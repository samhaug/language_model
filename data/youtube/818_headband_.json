finished three around it was done in eight weeks my part got taken in there over there too but it's just really nice really really nice and frosty as hell and it's really really cushy it's got that og smell and flavor it's really it's really heady and I understand why I got its name headband because it it does feel like you're like wearing like a headband they've got like a pressure around your head it's all in the face and had it's really heavy however they're like it's kind of creative so so I'll show you guys anyway see we got here this is my little phyno find our tongue and I kind of got the idea because I was sick of [ __ ] couldn't plants from seed into my flower or one of my flower to flower rooms and then having a perm me out or speak junk yeah I mean and then it was just like a waste of space and time when I could have something bomb in there so a little fee to find her blow it off small small I got four in here right now this is it a crazy train and this is the one I'm excited about the most because I had a train wreck I just one greenhouse that I grew", "skBiX-R0ZWs": "okay so doing another video right now and the string I got for today is eight one eight headband really wonderful string this is a 60/40 sativa dominant hybrid and if Sour Diesel cross with San Fernando Valley oh gee cush so two wonderful strains and that's where the eight one eight comes from is from the San Fernando Valley area code super chill strain it's got a really nice mellow body stone and it kind of creeps up you don't really feel it's after that first ball and the high the high is so wonderful some fifteen cerebral high kind of energetic it's very happy euphoric but not too much you know I mean you're happy and everything but if you've got something to do this what for me I found myself get really immersed in it like if you do some Photoshop being evil stuff on the computer whether you're crafting or like knitting or doing something you can playing video games this is really wonderful you kind of get in tune with it whatever it is whether you're gonna keep talking with somebody and you feel you've become talkative and kind of focused on that and that's what I really liked about it was a really wonderful way to bake get you started get you you know doing things and feeling really wonderful and just just creates a really great environment for wherever you are and it lasts pretty long too was about a big three and a half hours that before I felt like I need to medicate again also if you're kind of coming down in the afternoon like you said to get that far Jake won't take a nap this is good to kind of you that you know extra boost kick into gear get you going you know because it is energetic and it's great for anxiety and depression and headaches and stress just know really good everyday string that you can keep on hand almost like they're herbal aspirin you know it's it's great for those things so I would definitely get this again I enjoyed this is very enjoyable mmm you can taste that citrus that sour diesel that with them any fuel taste that's a wonderful smoke I picked this up from health for life mixer and they had one special was like nine bucks a gram so score anything else yeah we'll get this again eight one eight headband", "zEnOWYG-J7o": "[Music] hey everybody welcome to another episode of you dude my name is bud I am here today to show you a new cannabis strain sometimes I I do I like to do just regular reviews where I kind of talk about a strain a little bit sometimes it's fun to do growing projects or what's the best list and looks like that's that but you got to get down to the the roots here of just straight up reviews once in a while that's how this whole channel started so anyways today we have a headband that's the strain the THC is 19.3% and the CBD is 0.1 so very low in the CBD and quite high high ish in the THC but so high this is a indica it's kind of usually it has really big juicy nuggets it's not like good I know you would call that but good like bag appeal or something you know when you get a bag and it's got nice nuggets in it so this one I only saved a little little guy here and actually only a portion of it but you get the idea that this is just like a little chunker but oh the smell is just amazing really cheesy there's got a good cheese nose to it a little bit skunky slightly to almost salty like a salty salty cheese you know really really nice smell and then when we break this guy up that's gonna just bouquet as soon as you open the bag with some of something like this it's pretty skunky and cheesy it's really good so headband refers to it's not anything to do with like hippies or any of that crap it's more to do with the sensation that your head feels as soon as you smoke it it's like a press and you're on that in your temples it feels like you're wearing a tight headband sometimes so it's pretty it's pretty I'd say intense it's not for a very stop for a beginner because that could be something that turns people off of smoking pot in the beginning when they get a little bit too high or you feel like the sensation like that it's not always what people are looking for but for experienced pot smokers it's definitely something that makes you remember why spoke did in the first place it it you get used to this the feeling of being stoned so it's nice to once in a while have one that kind of like okay flicks on a light switch with you and that's this one for me headband okay I'm gonna grind some of this stuff up here yeah good stuff well one thing with this is it's like quite I'm gonna say quite sticky when you're put pressing it down into your grinder so it sometimes gets caught up in the grind and but it rolls usually really nicely because them get being quite sticky okay here we go oh I can smell it already it's just like it's that classic it's a classic smell this is like when I don't know I don't know what it is it's maybe a nostalgia thing or I've had this dream before in the past but there's something just it brings me back to the the old days when I first started smoking pot it's really really potent really skunky the kind of stuff that you you know I'd have to bring home and put in a ziploc bag and then like an airtight container and then inside of a jar just to contain the smell from my mom and dad smelling it but yeah it's it's really like the skunk the cheesiness turns into a full-out funk and it's nice so it's like I've said this before but it's kind of like incense you know I I personally love the smell it doesn't offend me whatsoever I think if anything when I smell you know people smoking pot in public it like it brightens me up a bit but some people are offended by it some people don't like the smell at all so hey it's kind of too bad I have a little plate here where I'm keeping all the like the spares so I can have like roll some splendid joint it's kind of thing it's like a Solera bat okay here we go got a decent sized joint here let's try it out mmm there's you know there's actually a little bit of it's a little bit spicy on the flavor I would even say there's not a lot of like fruits going on or anything like that a little bit mentally - mmm actually almost slightly chocolatey to taste delicious but again for people who are maybe buying this strain for the first time on the website the Canadian or the BC website whatever province you're in just beware that you're you're gonna buy these products and not know how they're gonna affect you especially if you're a new novice so is that what it's called there's novice like someone that's good okay a beginner I'll say anyway but 19.3% THC mmm mmm a couple of a couple of good puffs and you already like already I'm starting to feel that buzzy pressure in the head so it's it's interesting I personally like it not everybody does but it's also one of these ones that's really good for if you're nauseous it's a good one or if you're you're having problems eating it's a good to induce hunger one thing though it's very very cottonmouth your mouth gets really pasty and dry so that also I think is another nostalgia thing because when you're really stoned and in your own kind of head with it and then you got that pasty tongue kind of feel extra stoned so some people don't like that it's kind of a throwback for me and it reminds me of the good old days of the first couple times and listening to music especially it's just just amazing so anyway my name's bud click like subscribe if you have any comments or if you've tried this strain but I forgot to mention that this is by pure Sun farms so it's interesting some of these products being here during the kovat 19 and Emma can kind of stuck indoors most of the time I wonder how many of these companies are going to be around at the end of this who knows anyway thank God they've considered it a essential service here in Canada okay thanks for joining me talk to you soon all right [Music]", "1PwwKxUL0AA": "all right welcome back everybody purpose of this video is to try to teach people how to determine female seeds for male seeds okay if you have feminized seeds they're female don't even try this okay so this is this what I learned a long long time ago I wouldn't say it's exactly 100% because it's up to you know your own discretion so there's a lot of human interference in there but it's about 90 95 percent accurate if you actually are really like really a you know quality controlled about I was gonna say anal whatever but you know if you're really anal about it and you really really really only go for strict strict looks then you can pull it off 100% okay but this is what I come up with okay the female seeds look look a lot like this okay and if you see these seeds here see how they have like a little top to them okay now if you were look to look on this top you'll see a perfect circle where's my camera okay you'll see perfect circles it kind of looks like a little volcano maybe something like that oh look what I just found out guys so my cameras over here but when I put things over here it gets blurry when I put things over here they become clear oh you look nice I can work see how blurry though we did just remember that when you guys are trying to show stuff you put it right in front of you camera is blurry if you put it over there look how clear so so that's a perfect circle in there and it's like the volcano shape okay so you want to look for on the top of the seeds you want it to have like a little Ridge it doesn't have to be that defined these are pictures so you completely understand what I'm talking about okay they're a little over exaggerated so you're gonna see a little bit of a climb with in the middle will be a perfect circle okay and that's where actually the seed attaches to the actual button okay so you can see the top of the seeds it's the round piece and then you'll have you know the the sides of the little volcano that you'll be able to see from the top it'll look like you know you know it look like puckering up and then you have a complete perfect circle in the center and then from the side you see will look something like this okay the male seeds have a smaller Ridge or no Ridge at all okay do not confuse male seeds with immature seeds okay these are immature seeds they're super flat on the top but you can tell they have not grown yet okay those are immature seeds okay they have not completely formed do not confuse this with a male seed okay now mind you this probably would have formed into a male seed although it is not fully matured yet but this is how a male seed will look see how it has a kind of slight bump to it okay let's go to a male seed okay see how it's got slightly kind of inclined raised okay see it but it's flat it is flat it looks like a but okay and there is a circle in there but the circle will not be perfect it will not be centered perfectly normally and it will be flat looking and look kind of like you know it'll be like that you have a circle and there will be a weird thing around it and they look like little bloodshot lines spitting out of it and they'll look like these seats here these are 100% sure for sure mail seeds okay no doubt in my mind so this is just the easy way and I went through a whole bunch of different seeds to find males from females but um it's just an easy way if you're going through stuff like this and you want to find female and male seeds okay yeah yeah yeah that's a lot of seeds I got a couple of these okay I'm sure all you do to these right here people these are all skunk baby all skunk you see there's some immature ones in there blah blah blah whatever but yeah that's what these are so I hope this helps you guys you can determine your seeds a lot faster before you ever stick them in the dirt okay so try this technique out you know give me feedback see if it works for you works for me I know mother nature it also does this way works for her that's how we do it you know and like I said it's all up to human discretion you know you might look at you might look at a seed and say on all about by what he was saying that that might be a male but that's a female female seed perfectly round circle with the but you know the volcano look to it okay male seed are me female seed pardon me okay that's how we do it see that male seed see that you can see the volcano to it but look how flat it is okay male seed so I hope this guys this helps you guys I just thought I'd make this real quick while I was doing the harvest I forgot I had told somebody I was gonna make this for them so hopefully they watch this and you know pick up a future a few tricks are just bit my tongue so now I'm gonna get back to harvesting people so have a good evening", "zh-tEHz6Gq0": "[Music] hello today I created heaven so you can here's to know how to recreate it stay tuned for this DIY project we'll need some stretchy fabric but we will need three equal sections that are bigger and one smaller basically I have two already done for our brave but I left one to show you how I'm solving it I measure it so you can see the real but here you can make a braid Peter or smaller depending on your preference also you'll need some needle and a thread that matches the fabric color some super glue or a glue gun also I'm making the measurements so you can see that everything is true and wide so now we'll grab our smaller piece of fabric because our headband is not that big at the end I decided to cut a little bit the edges of our headband Fabri [Music] now we will sew the edges of our cupboard or our headband don't try to make a super fancy seam make a simplest seam that you ever seen because we'll cover everything let alone with our braid [Music] when our seam is ready we want to turn our cover inside out [Music] okay now we will dress up our headband by covering it with our velvet cover now make sure everything is nice and tight if your cover is longer make sure to cut it and saw the edges to make it tight and nice looking [Music] basically half of our work is done because our headband is ready now he'll grab our bigger fabric bringing me to to like that saw them together making a simple very very simple thing like I'm shown here and then turn it is set out [Music] now make sure the seam is backwards and then bring them three together like I'm showing and fix them in place with something this is my son thing you can find yourself on what you have and then make a simple three strand braid like braiding a braid with our hair make sure is nice and beautiful [Music] when you are finishing your bread make sure to fix it in place as well so basically this is the great for our headband we will measure it to see how it will look it's good I like it but you can hold it a little bit to make it beautiful looking then you want to grab your needle and thread and sew the edges of your braid if you are happy of course if not then redo it and then sew the edges on both sides of our braid [Music] [Music] okay now our parade is ready we are ready to do it all so bring it together and find the middle measure then you want to glue it onto our head first the center and then the ends then you want to sew the edges of your braid to your headband like I'm showing making sure there are no no fabric ticking oh like I'm showing basically is harder to explain them to look and repeat what I'm doing here guys I hope that you are inspired because of these virus and current team we can stay at home or we can do something useful for us so I decided why not to make a braided headband for us or maybe for somebody that we truly love [Music] if you like these kind of videos and these kind of tutorials please let me know in comments down below and also I don't know that you are watching till this minute this makes me so happy you cannot imagine will so what ends but if you have any thread sticking out you can also glue some fabric over but I'm happy with my results so I'll leave it as it is I hope that you enjoyed this idea and this DIY project if you do don't forget to comment down below give me a like also if you make sure to subscribe to be notified every time I post a new hair tutorial and guys if you want and you leave me more comments here down below then I promise you I'll have at least one week of everyday heroes so help me and I will thank you too of course but this is for today love you guys bye [Music]", "J_Q8mEB6cf4": "what's up - is the bud barber just doing

sometimes but as you can see they are doing very well they are starting to leave starting to purple out now the buds are not the biggest bud in the world but they are nice this time doesn't produce any huge huge huge but well not this one here anyway but produce a lot of butts there's buds everywhere they're pretty good size too so i've been giving them only water it's been two time i water them now with only water flushing them out they only have two weeks and a half three weeks of flushing by the time they are ready and as you can see they are very nice buds they are sticky really really sticky and smell very nice too i didn't have any issue with bugs at all since i traded them at the beginning so that's one good thing i didn't have no deficiency at all all the way through so i didn't have any problem and as you can see right now there's no no stakes or nets or anything holding those plants there's just a tomato cage on the bottom but the tomato cage is only about to two thirds of the plant and all the top the buds are not supported and they are very very strong the branch are really strong and that has to do with giving them silica silica that strain of the branch pretty good and they didn't need any support at all unless they flop in the last week but if they do they won't flood that far because they're all sitting one on the other there's only 16 plant in here under 4 000 watt hps and the room is full as you can see it fills the room and that's only 16 plants they're at five feet tall and they are very bushy there's a lot of branch a lot of buds nice buds a lot of errors on those buds a lot of crystal hard to see with this camera but i'll take some other uh macro picture later to show you the trichome and i really love it can't wait it's always fun and look at

"reading everybody can I medication here we're at the 74 and it's still not ready this crop takes a long time to finish the buds are nice they have filled up couple of them start to fall but it's not a major thing the thing I cannot handle but the buds that are filling up now just waiting for Dee I'm waiting for the trichome to start to turn amber somehow they'll start to turn milky now and when they are completely milky then they turn to Amber and when they start to turn to amber color that's when you want to harvest that means the THC is at his maximum and start to degrade when it turned amber color but yeah they are nice as you could see nice buds not the biggest butts in the world but a lot of boats see like this branch here falling very nice and they are sticky and smelly like crazy they turn purple leaves start to turn purple and yellow meaning they are flushed they are held of the any nutrients that's when they start to have sign of nutrient deficiency which is normal at the end see like this leave here probably can't see that on it but it's all purple now many of them so I'll give you a next update assumes I cut them off I just watered them tonight so it means I got a way to at least through the three days before I cut them but I'm gonna launch a trike home first hopefully it's the last watering at 74 days it's it's probably the max close to the max time here but yeah going well a lot of buds there are heavy thick dance they're very very dense but you can't squeeze them even if you the only thing you have it's your am full of try : that smells like beautiful color and in the next video when I cut at the end I'll put a video giving all my recipes for the whole crop what I did I'll make an update on that so you guys can't see there's a one that falls in the

here can of medication today we're going to show you the room that we are getting ready for the next crop and this is a licensed medical growing facility for health from Health Canada and we have a 4000 watt light in this room so what I want to do is this time it's actually make a little Theory here we're going to make a Serie of growing a complete crop here so I'm going to have video every week for the one that wants to follow and maybe even more but at least every week i will show you what's going on here in this room the crop that we're going to grow the strength that we want to go this time is going to be 8 18 headband OG which is a really good strand so let's make a tour of the room here to show you guys how to set up the room properly so you don't have any problem with fire hazard or mold or any issues like that has helped Canada is trying to take the license away from medical patient and they use the excuse that it's a fire hazard then it's a mold issue well it's been over here here here and there's no mold and there's no fire heater knock on wood it could happen like anything could happen to any house the fire could catch in the stove it could be anywhere in the house not more dangerous if you set it up properly now let's start with the electrical well first of all there's n an independent breaker for each light so each light thousand watt run on his own breaker 15 amp breaker for each light and the only thing else that is run on each light is a little fan which use about three points not even so it's very safe all the ballots are installed higher so the light reflection don't hit them too much to warm them more than what they need it could actually be set all outside but in this case here we put it inside because we are kind of limited in space and as you can see I'm using to kind of ballast in this room we get I power here which is a pretty good ballast for the price and we also have quantum series which is a really great ballast so tiny bit more expensive but not that much for the quality you going to get it's pretty good so each of them is hook on his own light as you can see there's two Bauer's to fixture and bandit they all run on a Brea timer all of them will run on a timer on the other side room we have same thing and again one breaker for each and that's very important like um I could find a sound annoying but it is important don't plug a thousand-watt and your regular Howlett in the wall because those outlet by code probably runs between 12 to 15 plug or light on each of them because that's normal light of a house and as the code you know but if you want to grow and use a thousand watt which use quite a bit of power you want to have your own 15 and braker a thousand what will draw around hate amp each of them will draw about 8 amps yes you still have place but you don't want to overload it there's no need to overload it so if you don't have the electrical proper lectric hold you could stop right there and don't grow any any any grass because any cannabis because you're going to cause another rule you may cause fire in your place so that's one thing the electrical is very very important now the ventilation as you can see here we have four fan that are mounted on the ceiling and the arm the stick is adjustable as you can see I could drop them lower or higher and that's perfect right there and they don't take any space at that height and you could angle them down so if you can't afford to buy those fan that goes on the wall that our wall mounted you could always buy those cheaper fanwood but they are about 25 bucks each at home depot and they do a really good job actually you could put more than four but I have four in here and four is plenty in this room plus I put another one on the on the ground on the bottom to draw the air under the plants as they grow so the air circulation is very very important you need to have those fan on all the time and you put them so they move and move the air all around the plants what it does first of all it does a lot of things it will actually activate your co2 it will also make your plant more strong stronger stronger stem so the bland that braided the the plant won't been as much will be stronger because she's usually forced to repair her wall man brain has they break as she been and she make it stronger so by having fan blowing all around it makes the plant stronger it also makes the plan it also eliminate the mildew because the air circulate freely in the room there is no mildew and you want to keep the humidity at a certain level like right now there is nothing in the inner rule and I just flossed with dr X so the unity is about 64 which is a bit high but I didn't put the exhaust fan on yet and there is no planet no nothing in the room and it's raining pouring rain outside so it's kind of humid so if I put the heater on here for about two minutes the humidity is going or a if I turn the light on you may be will be dropping about twenty percent so you want to keep your humidity around 45 45 found is perfect it doesn't grow any mildew and moles and any problem a lot of people have problem with powdery mildew powdery mildew is more than just having a problem with humidity in your room basically power leader mill do is transfer from the outside to inside and it could be carried through the exchange of hair or on your clothes or on your pet or whatever and soon as it gets to your plant it gets into the fiber who planned the tissue of the plants well you could control it to the end but you'll I doubt you'll never get rid of it you could use actually a cara baking soda in water you put about 2 tablespoon of baking soda and two liter water and you spray your plant heavily what it does it raise the humidity pH humanity sorry and use the pH it raise the pH or around hate and mildew cannot survive at that kind of pho they die but you have to repeat that process regularly make sure you don't have them but in this case here I'm lucky I don't have any problem with mildew I never had and I'm keeping an eye on it you better also put less length in your room then stocking all of them together and being too tight and at the end you have a problem with air circulation because they were planned are too tied together and also if you put too much clam they won't do as nice the but won't come as big because they are too tight the light don't penetrate so in this room here we put 16 plant and at 16 plant you'll see that what I'm done it covers the whole room because we make them grow quite nicely nice size so and also you want to take a look at the exhaust system okay well first of all you want to make sure you don't send any smell outside because if you send smell outside people are not dummy other people had grown weed before or had smell weed before and they know the smell so if they pass around your house or around your place or whatever you keep them and they smell it they know that you're growing weed there so the best thing to do is get one of those grubber filter charcoal filter you could find them actually on kennel medication website can amedication.com and you can find those filter this one is a hate inches for 80 inches fan 770 RP a-- CFM exhaust fan and as you can see everything is mounted suspended on rubber so you don't get any vibration going anywhere else you barely fee here at a fan basically because it's mounted with rubber very simple to do efficient no vibration you don't hear nothing outside just a smooth airflow coming out of the vent of course you're going to have the heat but the heat could also be recycle if you decide to eat your building with it he could all swit a duck back inside and give your hair inside because actually this this if you don't use any chemical or spray and things like that this charcoal filter will filter everything before it goes back in and there is a pre-filter on as you can see this is a pre-filter could be removed for cleaning and under you have the scrubbing one under and I regularly clean it you can see it's still dark I washed it with javax but it's still it's good for about a year there was a filter by the way and I believe you could buy the refill for them I think I'm going to look at it if I am I'm going to get it on the website on our store so if you need to but you only know and i will show you down the road how to refill basically it's to unmount the cap with those screws here and you just empty the char coat and put new charcoal in your filter is good to go that little trick to save money you know because patient don't have that much money and they they struggle to grow their own marijuana or cannabis for medical purpose that's one of the reason why we don't want to lose our garden because I don't think a lot of people could afford to buy their own medicine that a couple thousand dollars a month I am personally prescribes seven grams a day for glaucoma PT is the advanced art arises anythings and it does help a lot with this I'm able to function but anyway we'll make a video about that another day and also in this room you can see those reflector well at that time I didn't want to spend that much money on so I went local I didn't have any store back then when local hydroponic but regular reflector which is only up to here and i expanded them by buying second one and added a wing to it so I got really nice reflector now and they are adjustable with ratchet and they do the job they reflect pretty good and we get four of them another update i did this time it's putting the mylar reflective on the wall and i could tell you i turn on the light the other day and my god it is bright so if you have the money i spend a bit more money hundred bucks for 100 not even hundred bucks for 100 foot roll and you're going to see I think you're gonna see a difference in the arvest because when you turn that on is just like there's like everywhere in here before on the wall it was only white so the reflection of the light was hitting the wall and when you were putting your hand or the plants in behind my hand or in behind the plant there was no reflection because the light would bounce but as much on the white but with this there's no dark spot in behind my hand anymore so it grows everywhere the light bounce everywhere so it's going to help having better buds on the plants all around so that way you don't need to turn your plant all the time and move thing around and yes it light up like crazy you'll see when I put the metal highlights two for the veggie stage right now the clones are getting ready and we are about to transplant them probably today or tomorrow and we'll show you when we transplant how we do it will show you when they all transplant and all this so as you can see it's a really nice room oh I forgot the intake well actually you need him take care coming in so we have a hair exchanger here that works all the time on high six inches coming in i bought a flexible ducking put it on so it drops basically it drops the fresh air on the on the bottom you don't want the fresh air to come on top it's useless so you want the fresh air to come on the bottom hit the floor and it will spread I'll put also a fan around here with circulate that air all around the hot hair rise and it will go up to the filter over there and get eggs exit and at this hand here you got the intake and at the other hand you get the outtake so it's a normal flow of hair going through your room we also have a baseboard here in here just in case at nighttime if it comes to low that will kick in and keep the room from freezing I doubt it will happen but just in case we also have a portable this one is only a 7,000 BTU I actually going to change it for next summer but for the winter is going to be good if ever it comes to hot this will kick in and it's also a dehumidifier there is any need of the human the unifying now the the reflective film mylar that's a role that you could find on Canal medication website this one is a hundred foot roll there's other type it's a very sturdy one it's not the cheap tin pick that is easy to rip this one is very hard to rip well hard it depends what you do but it's harder than the cheap one and it's very easy to install the I use all the staples on the wall but you could use tape or glue and behind the pens on what you're trying to achieve here and as you can see we install also a surveillance camera so this is mount to the computer and the computer is recording not only on the computer but on a server so if somebody break in or something happen it's all recorded Plus also i'll be able to show you some live footage of the room as it grow we'll probably have it on very often won't put it on and have you guys take a look at the progress of growing here so we're going to do a Serie the series is going to be on my youtube channel you're going to be able to follow us to see how we grow the hate Haiti net ban we also have those tomato cage a big one the tree rings four foot and you're going to see that they are very useful depends what kind of plant you grow again if you grow a plant that is very very bushy clumsy that falls you're gonna put some netting which we might end up putting some netting on top of it depends to hold the buds but we'll see so if you have any comments or suggestion for the grow room let me know not perfect I'm not like you guys im a learning process we are always on the learning process and this is for medical cannabis in Canada and I'm a patient licensed patient and yeah it's pretty it's pretty exciting to start a new grow and to have the ability to show you guys what's going to happen here so we put a plastic also on the ground to make sure that we don't have any spill of water if ever the under pot goes over but we have some sauce or to put under the big you saw sir we're what we're going to do use to grow in this room we're going to use 10 gallon material pot with pure cocoa but then i'll show you when i do the transplant so this video will show you the room so you can see what's going to happen here and how you set up your room if you have any question don't hesitate it I'll answer your question the best as I can by the way I got a background in construction for 25 years so I had my own company for 14 years and construction so that's why I'm very particular with electrical and setup up the room because it's very important you don't want to put nobody at risk or your building at risk or and as you can see there is a fire detector a smoke detector here so something happened we also have a fire in stack washer on the other side here and we're going to get a bigger one also there's also someone that one the one that day install it's like a sprinkling system it's a big huge fire extinguisher that goes on top and if the fire catcher will trigger it out and then we'll start to stop the fire everywhere but no that's the way it's gonna be and here you can see this is the this is where we get everything done ready for it this is our sink where we do most of our work it's a mob with javax and water that we washed all the floor and everything with javax in this room here we got another tent which is the gruel tenth another grill attempt but the drying and I used to be one there but I don't use it anymore it's too small but for some people they like it and our pots are in there we also have to two of them two of those 50 gallon container which we wash regularly progenics leach them so you're sure you get a good water we also have a hair pump for out outlet hair pump two for each so it keeps oxygen in the water your water's on with oxygen and we've got some fertilizer here but the most of riser is on the other side also have a sharp back if you have a grow room you better get a shot bag because you're gonna need it there's multiple uses purpose use for that shot back here in the role now let me show you here the Strand that's gonna go in there in the other room you don't attend the veggie one well it's temporary but as you can see they are pretty big we waited a bit too long yeah bit quite a big but yeah we're going to transplant them and get them going so and this is a 400-watt here it's only a four hundred wet and look at this this is full so that's the 818 headband that's going to go in the other room and we got a new strand after that that we're going to grow want to try a different strengths but yeah and now let's take a look at the fertilizer we're going to use well we're going to use voodoo juice that's for sure voodoo juice is one of the best what i'll do i'll make a video on just when I fertilize before I water I'll make a video to show you guys about what i use and how i mix we also get a bunch of light bulbs their stuff cost quite a bit of money to get set up I mean you're looking like I'm over ten thousand dollars altogether since the start and but it's the price that you have to pay to get your medication it's actually with cheaper than buying it because ten thousand dollars if I had to order my my mare American medicine from a supplier would be around 30 to 35 thousand dollars a year here which I can't afford nobody can afford that salary of a person so by growing it it cost me every crop about and I do two to three crop a year don't do moon that I could do for but there is no rush here we take like one month two months in between we don't supply anybody's just for myself so I do one crop and cost me about 1500 to 2000 dollars each crop because you gotta pay for a fertilizer it's very expensive you got about a thousand dollars just and fertilizer if it's not more you got the cocoa which you could recycle but you have to buy it at the head start you got electrical only electrical we spend about two hundred dollars a month here extra so you have to account all of this together and it's around two thousand dollars a month so not a month sorry two thousand dollars each crop which is about two times a year so let's say four thousand dollars a year cause me about to supply myself so all right people thank you for watching subscribe to your via to our Channel take a look of our website kanno medication calm it's a community where we going to be able to exchange information and growers and also suppliers we have a store there where you could buy all the equipment that you're going to need we are still updating so be patient we are also selling vaporizer the sublimator it's a vaporizer it's unbelievable that thing that's my next purchase and i'm going to show you guys when I get it we got the apex pipe on vaporizing on the goal with hay pex pipe so it's kind of troll and in this winter i'm going to show you a lot of things to you guys the stuff that we have the stuff we use the stuff where you could get and also we got to have a lot of deals cheap good price for cannabis patient medical cannabis patient so if you're a medicinal medicine cannabis beta sorry I'm French so I'm trying the best I can but if your minutes minutes medicinal if you grow medicinal cannabis in your license we're going to have a system on our site where you're going to be able to save a lot of money on buying stuff years to grow vaporizer bong we're going to have all those things so keep in touch with me guys I'm here to help you I'd like to have your help also and we could make a a nice grow here and show to the people that it's not only Punk head that grow weeds were not just EP we are patient we are medicinal medical patient and I'm not a kid I'm almost 50 years old so yeah I don't sit in public and puff like crazy because I don't believe in that heater I do that privately so it doesn't bother or insult anybody you have to have respect for other people to some time I see some people and yeah it's nice to puff outside in the public but hey there's also respect for other people you know and it's also i don't know it look weird you know you're sitting outside with big bong and you're puffing on that try to find some nice nature place outside maybe where there's less people there's no need to expose yourself in the public key with this you know it don't mean maybe only make the Li everybody look bad you know like we're a bunch of druggie that try to get high all day long and it's not the point here the point is to use this as a medicine so and in this video i also asked everybody that is an activist to support the coalition the MMR Coalition in Canada for the repeal we are fighting a cause here Jason Wilcock Wilcox is taking care of this with Canela cannabis Canada and he's doing a really good job and yes i'll post a link down there where you could actually give money to the coalition was so far there they need to raise two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the battle it's only for the beginning of the battle we win an injunction so far but we are going back to court to keep our license for medicinal purpose because the government wants to remove our privilege of growing marijuana for medicine purpose it's not a privilege it's a right we acquired in court but the government has usual wants to give that to commercial so I call to you all activists out there instead of supporting the industry is right to trying to expand and I know everybody wants to make money but you should also think about all the patient out there they can't afford to buy their own medicine and have to pay for it we are the one and me and many other 35,000 actually in Canada that can't afford that and you know it would be nice if a little everybody could give a bit of money so far they erase over 180,000 I think so we're close to the goal for the first challenge and yeah so I encourage you people to give to the quality against the repeal and i'll put a link on the site where you could actually make your donation to directly to to mr. Wilcock or the lawyer on the case here John I think it's john i don't remember his name but anyway i put a link for you guys to give money so thanks again for watching keep on watching scribe get ready because we're gonna have a nice drawing siri coming for you and if you're a company out there you want to serve to sponsor us send me an email I'll be happy to have some sponsor where we could put your logos and stuff like that and also use your product if you want to send us your products because right now we got nobody supplying us it's on my own so I'm trying to do this to help everybody out there and it would be nice to have some help in return so anyway keep on watching guys subscribe have a good day take care of you guys and medicate yourself in in a good way so we'll we'll talk the next video have a great day bye you", "hzK6TQz9fo8": "reading everybody can of medication here a little video update we're at the 24 and flowering and as you can see they started the flower pretty good the buds are taking size in the last couple of days since I super crop them now as you can see this branch here was super crop you can see the damage and actually was crushing it horn needed but you could see the branches getting back up and it's producing massive Paula on it it will be big goes like that everywhere as a good to see they are very nice i watered them yesterday and yesterday I give them six hundred milliliter up three parts from advanced nutrients rule micro and moon in 200 litre of water I also give them four hundred milliliter of big buds I also give them but candy 200 milliliter I give them overdrive 200 milliliter I give them sensei's I'm 200 milliliter I give them beat 50 to 200 milliliter and I give them also silica silica 150 milliliter and that's all in 200 leader container I brought them up slowly to this point and as you can see there is no burn tips or burn leave for anything and I keep getting them only not more than 600 milliliter of the three parts I found the last time i went up to 800 milliliter as recommended 400 million per 100 liter they were burned and the Leafs were not as nice and it basically stress your plants also but now with giving them only exactly what they want I could read them better I could see what they like what they don't like and this special strength which is the 818 headband OG and as you can see they produce a lot a lot of white hair that strength but they are doing really good the buds are dance nice they're getting bigger and bigger every day we get 16 plant in here for plant each light we got 4,000 watt and I'm running sunmaster yellow for ball I got for fan that circulate the air all the time on the plants one on each corner and I got fan under that low hunter also i just installed another system here connected to the filter so you recuperate some heat and humidity out of here for the other room while the other room meaning is the other building the part of the other building which is not when it's running here it's the meat to you the love II to heat up with this system i just installed hate and just by going up to another fan over there we got two exhaust fan if we need to exhaust a lot this one running full time glowing hair in the building eight inches and it's connected to that line which connect to the filter and the other fan that get a hand that bring the air outside and that one only work on the timer when the lights are on so when the light shoves off that fan shut off and it keeps the air circulating inside instead of going outside so that way we don't need to eat the building as much and recuperate the heat circulate the air we got also an intake of six inches here that brings fresh air with a fan and we're going to fan blowing on the bottom that blows the air hunter to keep everything dry even if these 49 percent and it's normal right now because i watered them last night and the first day it's always around 50 and then the last day before watering it drops about 25 50 55 is a good humidity higher than that it start to be a bit high so if we have too much humidity would just start that fan which is on the dimmer right now and the fan is only working maybe a quarter of our capacity so if i push it up to the max we could exhaust a lot of hair out of here and get rid of that humidity if we have too many but right now the temperatures for pickets 24 and 49 as you could see they're everywhere two buds they're like yeah they are terribly wrong everywhere and as you can see that's another branch admin super crop and the stocks on those branch are big I mean little thunder it's pretty big stuff to the branch are really strong there is no support right now we're going to add probably and net in the next couple of days I always wait until at least three weeks in the flowering before put anything there's no need for it before silicas help your plant standing straight and not flopping everywhere there is also tomato cage on all of them but the plants is we pass the tomato cage right now the plants are almost five feet in the bucket so so I think it's going to be a nice crowd this growth for brand new ball so they love that but yeah it's going pretty good so if you like what you see people share subscribe follow us gives us the thumbs up we'll bring you more video will show you more stuff in the coming next weeks but for now we are like I said day 24 and everything is going very good no sign of fits pesticide at all no sign of pests I mean pesticide is to eliminate them no sign of deficiency either plants are doing pretty good I do feed them every time I water them and I water them right now every five days I give them about three gallon each so for 16 plant right now i'm using 200 litre of water each watering and soon they will go to four days which I would assume in the next week will be at four days watering as they go they need more water faster all right people if you like what you see please subscribe share with your friend give us a thumbs up we'll show you more video coming we'll show you more video of this nice little garden the 818 ad man all right take care keep on growing", "0vQ1zGecpWw": "Mossberg

lot I want to mess with the the pod make them sweet just for extra boost extra gooeyness add some of that in the last two weeks at that in the last three four weeks supplement this you know in the mid mid flowering and in the flowering and yeah that is the complete line I use a lot of Vance nutrient haters but I'm not one of them tried others that I tried this and I just like how they mix like the pH perfect running pretty good bloom boost gives that extra hardening extra boost the flowering and yeah this is it this is the ting the ting of things great things are go on with this flowering nutriment nutrition and my plants are just exploding right now this off the line so if you want a copy go right ahead you're gonna see great results man you don't need a whole lot you need to go out

line up to the next update peace y'all", "5lED3KmILQo": "reading everybody can I medication here just wanted to show you my garden licensed medical garden for patient and I just wanted to show you without the light on because with the HP high pressure sodium light kind of hard to see with the camera unless you have a filter which I don't have so just wanted to give you a little update on the how healthy they are now and how thing is are going and as you can see the climb back up quite good so we got 16 8 18 at van Oh Jake wish for Jake sorry logical and they are in 10 gallon material pod with pure cocoa recycled and if you want to know how to recycle your cocoa I had made a video to explain to you what to use to recycle your cocoa and how to recycle it now to do it that way you don't have to buy brand new ground every time you do a crop you know you could use your cocoa recycle it and it has you can see the plant love it the plants are very healthy I trimmed em hunter and I'm going to do it again about this round close to the second week of of the flowering I would be I will be trimming them back again removing some vegetation that is useless on the bottom so the light penetrate better we are also going to change those ball we got four brand new ball coming in while they already in but we got through a four brand new ball we're going to put here and I'll show you the bulb when I change them so right now right now the temperature is 25 as you can see temperature is 25 and 30 to 32 humidity yeah I like the humidity UNT is low and it's perfect there is no problem may be low in full no mold and no problem high humidity equal problem so anyway especially if you give some silicon so you plant silica you don't have to worry if it's not that human and if it's hard because the plant could take it as you can see the these this strength like to be fertilized very strongly it's the 818 @ ban and they do love friend leiser that is strong so which was just a little update to show you the plants in night time well my time it's half time I never close alike really that one stays on but the main light goes off for about four hours I rode them it's been the third week now third three week and a half although i'll do another update on friday on the sunday sorry sunday where is the going to be the fourth week and i think we want to switch them to flower and as you can see that trainwreck there is doing really well too and that train wreck is not going to be flowered right away it's the mother plant and i just put her here to boost her up a little bit because she was quite me and some fertilizer and she needed more like and I need to have her produce more branch record clone it for a next crop but the rest is looking very good we got rid of the threat trim strips I think anyway I don't see none anymore we have treat them for three weeks with azo max LEM oil and dish soap 2 tbsp of each in one gallon of water and you make sure you spray under the Leafs pretty good everywhere and it's biologic the fertilizer so enough fertilizer pesticides so it's not it won't harm your plant at all there's no chemical so you'll be you'll be fine with that now i'm looking at looking at a recipes that i found and i actually posted on the site can amedication.com if you take a look it's about oil orange juice oil base fertilizer which is made with orange now juice orange oil and garlic and you mix that together you spray your plants and the bugs don't like garlic and they don't like zest like an orange and very strong they don't like that it's a good way to control your bug but in this case here we had quite an infestation at one point so I had no choice to go strong and so I use very strong azo Max and Nev oil together so it was really strong plus I put dish soap in it because it helped still await the azo max and the net wild with the water I also put the water a little bit more so it mixed together properly because the oil and water don't go together and the quote a float on top so you got to make sure pretty good and in between the photo when you spray with your spray whatever container you want to use you've got to shake that to make sure that it's always makes properly and you spray them very heavy and you make sure the lights are off when you spray them and you leave the light off for at least two three hours and lease and fans on all the way so it dries out and you don't have any problem with mold or burning your leaves as you can see I didn't burn no leaves at all there's no leaf that are burned or suffered from piesa Max and Nev oil plus dish soul together so you're very LT nice color they take their fertilizer they are not deficient in any kind of way right now and they are growing like crazy and I have no choice to switch them because I don't have that much height here and those plant has tend to see up growing pretty high still after you switch them to flower you're going to grow at lease another foot foot and a half which at one point i'll have to super crop them i always super crop them because it makes bigger but stronger buds and traumatize the plan a bit but not that much i mean at one point you know it's not it's not going to change a lot of thing in the heel it's going to change a lot of thing in the heel if you don't super crop if you super crop you'll have more weight you'll have more bigger bugs and stronger branch at pulls the buzz also but when we use actually the solution that i use for fertilizer and the silica is helping you see the size of those stem on the height and there is no purple on it so it means it's very very healthy the only purple you see is on the main fan leaves which is normal but on the stem himself there is no purple so it's a good sign it means the plant is LT stem himself are getting bigger and bigger and it's going pretty good right now I'm watering every week on friday every friday and they are just perfect after one week did rain all their water i go away by the weight of the plant I get the pod and i listed a bit and when I see the pod is very light usually a weed in unit as they will grow as they will search for use flour they are going to go about four days and watering in between and that's what's going to be not more than that you can see the setup of the rule here at for 1000 watt electronic ballasts we have two quantum and two high power high power are impressing me because they are not that expensive and actually they do a good job it's been over here here i get them and no failure or nothing knock on wood but i got two of them spare anyway if something happened and yeah so it's going pretty good so alright guys if you like what you see subscribe share with your friends talk about it we're going to have a lot of

review I got a little nugge that I that I think this one's a headband the Thai bread it's by occulta clocks in about 20.1 percent THC so you know this is a bad bad this is bad girl right here got it got it rolled up and also I got those cartridges from the collaboration culture did with Japan Pro with the little slide cartridges pretty pretty low key that's an indica indica strain um yo I think is maggin I can't remember what this clocks in I think it clocks in at like 70% indica THC I think it was triangle OG and some other strain I'm not sure they did a like a combination and then here I got here I got that head being boy we tested this out thoroughly so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start taking I'll try to take three videos not not every strain is gonna get that thorough assessment but when I can I'm gonna take 3 video smoking in three different ways trying to really assess and review the strain you know I feel like you got a smoke at least an eight sometimes quarter before you can really understand really how sweet the leaf really is [Applause] got my smoking hat on bro this is a wake and bake by the way it's 7:30 2 a.m. in Baltimore it's a lovely day so the first things that I notice is like that citrusy taste that I was mentioned from the other strain that like it's like a pungent like citrus flavor profile that mmm we're just really good the headband of the Eastern Shore OG the deadhead they all share it's slightly different the other one was like more grape fruity flavor this one's more like you can tell like orange orange II like tangerine or something I don't know mmm [Applause] hey what's going on Tam I'm back I just wanted to finish that I'm finishing off that other J gonna spark up another one you know I'm saying I gotta gotta get bloke awakened Vig yeah yeah got a really stoke those buyers mmm it's a strong girl right there this is a great way to start the day excellent it's not it's a hybrid you know so it doesn't really it's not really locking me up but it's got to be really a really strong indica to do that or like some some heavy-duty edible which you know I like to make my own edible I just take take my medical and turn it into food because I can't always smoke you know and and I got my pens and stuff but like I like to eat it too it's all it's good for you too so this fatty of this fat is getting me going I had some diamonds I could have put that on the outside you know with some Keef and stuff but I forgot all about it you know it's the wake-and-bake man I'm just trying to get going got I got a chronic back pain and [ __ ] and I had hand surgery but my hands are always [ __ ] up and I went into rainy day like this or like the over cows casting shitty day you know I'll be aching I'll be a que yo yesterday I was smoking at Tahoe oh gee that man's got purple in it I'm frosting [Music] so good so good I'm gonna review that soon - I got a whole bunch of strains I got to do I'm about to put them all out there and let me know what y'all think I'm gonna try to get the ladies the greatest that Baltimore Maryland has to offer of course I'll be taking other videos I'll be doing videos of like going I'll be going in like DC I go to my favorite like tat shops and stuff and introduce you to introduce you to all the people that are [ __ ] with not all of my patients and stuff not all of them smoked you know I'm saying some of them like my boy he just does tats and stuff he's he likes he's waiting for it to get rekt and I just did so well what's so good this is a good a good role here got a little crunch in there you feeling Oh yum yum man [Applause] I think out of the ten the Eastern Shore gave like it 7.5 dead in for the head injury it's called eight one eight headbands are you it didn't have all that on the top cut up by Coulter [Applause] I think I got to give this on the 8th it got that extra point at 5 because it's got it's a little bit higher in THC couple percent but that the numbers matter

on it it's gonna be a yielded which it really is and this is definitely in yield or - I mean Scott Shoji these things are the reward one and I don't see if I get a good close-up back here yeah man my battery's low I feel well there you go to finish this up as you can see the top of the line is what it is I've been over stream view not the best cameraman that's why I do this [ __ ] look at that yes crawl down and as you can see this guy's too big he's standing there talking lights he's gonna grow if I groaning for another week and then it stopped we're all vertically so what's a super crop accident right now I'll show you guys how to supercro it once more look pinch bins don't don't crank it just bend it I'm gonna give these guys the other way just bend it first step get it down in there and now seek didn't harm it he's fine this guy I'm gonna do is snap him I know most people don't do this because they're scared really they don't know what the hell they're doing this will not harm the plant whatsoever it'll only improve it and only get more sunlight ain't no keep it under light as much I'm mainly doing it for as you can see it's gonna be punch you're gonna yield over a half pound but look how big they are I'm a ginger both of them we're damn near seven foot six and a half feet actually the lights about seven plus look at that lollipops about three about three foot 3 foot of Ollie pop so as you can see buds grow from up here up that which produces big buds and there's plenty of sites it's ridiculous to do that work the funny thing is I see everybody's girl on YouTube their shits all burnt so we do it way too much two times a week two times a week and I don't follow no PPM schedule we just we just pour it just pour it in don't even need to don't use anything no measurements I've been doing so long I just know it's the [ __ ] villain as you see they're only gonna get bigger man I'm gonna [ __ ] next week those boys start stop growing out with and

first of October and I'm thinking I'm gonna kick off October by chopping down this headband it could go another week or two but it does have Amber's on there maybe 10 to 15 percent so I think it's good enough there's also a few other reasons it's taken the mildew has gotten mildew harder than the other plant so I've D foliated it a lot and also this tree up here because of the rotation of the Sun this plant now gets less light than any any of the other 11 plants in the garden so I've also heard from kill a shark that headbands pretty susceptible to bud rot and I have seen a bit of that myself definitely but it's nice fat nugs all over the plant like this you can see they're very pineappley looking and developed like your cush plants tend to get and yeah so it seems like a obvious first pick tonight at midnight I'll probably chop into this and since I'm awake all night you know frickin watching 4 rippers anyways I have something to do I'm being able to just stay up and cut my weed but this is the headband eight one eight and based on the trichomes and the amount of light it gets I think she's just about ready how much I'll get exactly I don't know but if you look at it from the sides you can see all the arms are starting to pull themselves down with weight so hopefully a fair amount guys but that's the headband eight one eight and I'll show you guys what it looks like when it's all trimmed up and cut and hung and that is gonna be the first slice I get into tonight of the big dog garden alright everybody thanks for stopping in Tony - totes peace",

six best clones and run them in number two pots here bedroom for a couple weeks out all they get because she's a vertical grower try and get him as big as I possibly can and six of them should fill the tent nicely and see what I get see what happens so that's the plan I've had set up I'm gonna get a t5 or t12 for some kind of tube lighting and make a shelf here so the mothers will be down on the bottom and vegging clones up top here so hopefully you know try and get a little bit more organized here as we go along gonna be strapping up the carbon filter I'm hearing you guys I know just every

here we are transplanting today we're going to transplant our 818 headband to the bigger room actually this is just a veggie not even veggie this is supposed to be the cloning and for some reason we couldn't transplant until today so they obviously horror grow way too big and as you can see on the bottom not taking care of them properly because been busy doing other things so the over veg in here a little bit so what we're going to do we're going to trim them a lot and fix them they also i notice that they have some threats so we're going to have to take care of this also so it's going to be an exciting room now if we go on the other side where have the growing room this is going to be the growing room here I just trim those for as you can see quite a nice trimming and I'm going to transplant all of them and then water them with the mix I have prepared that you've seen in the other video in pure cocoa 10 gallon container I all using a four-foot tomato rack but I might also put a trellis that's going to depends how they're going to grow but I'm gonna veg them at least two weeks here maybe more I want to make them bushy not too high because this strain has tendency of growing hi a even when you switch when you switch them to actually to flower these threats quite a bit so I'm going to trim them quite a bit as they grow because i don't i don't want them to be too high because as you could see the height is limited so now we are about I would say four foot from the plants with the light maybe more and by the time they are ready to bud they will probably be a foot and a half at the mobile and the max I'll try to anyway but what's going to be exciting what this grow is the fact that first of all the over veg as a clone so by trimming them right now it's exciting to see what's going to happen so and also the fact that they have trips trips so I'm gonna show you guys and probably with your help now we're going to take care of those trips usually I treat them with has a max and nem oil I mix both of them as a max and neem oil and I spray my plant very heavy for about I give about three to three days in between the spring and I do this for about four to five time and I stopped before when they are ready to flower to start flowering we're going to stop that we're going to stop you you could still do it with as a max is pretty safe you could go up to would say the second week of flowering and then you stopped because you don't want to have anything and even though as a max is completely organic Fred liya not fertilizer and pesticide still it could affect the taste and stuff like that so that's what we're going to do here we're going to spray them take care of those little bugs and we'll be fine so I'll show you guys after when I transplant one after it's all done here I'll show you guys own and that's the way it's going to go so please subscribe keep on watching because we're going to come up with the full grow every week we're going to have an update here we're going to show how it's go every week we're going to have 16 plant in here so keep on watching subscribe thank you", "3qznHAVQvnE": "everybody welcome thank you for joining into my strain review I would like to start off and you know show you all the packaging today I'm going to be reviewing eight one eight headband diamonds like Ulta the first thing I noticed when I opened up this was that it smells wonderful very very fruity it's a very very citrusy as well I get like a fruity citrusy smell had been has been a longtime favorite strain of mine so that's why I wanted to give it a review it's why I wanted to you know I'm a big believer in watching how something affects somebody you know before ingesting it at least like at least I don't know at least if you're sensitive or if you're newer you know it always helps to get an idea of what you're about to do you know what you're about to ingest how you might feel but so I'm gonna start off I'm gonna take a dab of this I have the temperature I'm actually gonna turn the temperature down a little bit cuz my last day was a little hot I'm gonna turn it down the like I hated that 6:39 I'm gonna I'm gonna turn it down so we'll do 600 so as soon as I hit 600 I'm gonna go I would suggest you guys if you're a dabber if you're a happier diver if you're a heavier smoker and you don't have any now I'd highly advise you to get one it's expensive I probably put like I guess depending on who you are you know but it's it cost I probably spent about three a little bit over three hundred or mine but the amount of money that I've actually saved in dabs is probably way over that I mean I was taking roughly between 100 to 150 maybe 200 milligrams you know a point one point one two I'm sorry I point one point one five point two but with this I take maybe twenty five to ten percent of that you know I mean maybe like twenty milligrams instead of two hundred milligrams and because you know it's it's an electric nail it just stays the same temperature if your dad just like keeps going and it's just it really stretches out my dad's you know our grandma dad's really wouldn't last me a bit like a day or two before and now it last me a little bit around a week you know what I mean so if you're consuming anything wants a day and you can make that one time a week you know what I mean you're already spending a sixth of the money because if you're doing it once a day now you're doing it once every seven days you know it's instead of doing it 365 times a year you're doing it 52 times a year so I mean you can see where a grandma dabs let's say let's just say $40 let's say you're getting it for $40 for the ground you know thirty and sixty five times forty I just make myself a little easier I'm gonna do during in 50 times 40 and that comes out what 14,000 so if you bought a gramma dad's today they'll be $14,000 a year $40 a grand as opposed to a gram once a week that's about what 52 times 40 so 20 2080 I was gonna say 20 80 so 2080 you know so so literally spending at $300 on your email if you're grabbing day dad which I know is a serious serious tab well if your grandma day daddy now you go to a gram a week on your email you know that's that's literally saving you eleven twelve thousand dollars a year I mean that's so stage will not money okay well it's switch to rate times church so I'm gonna go ahead and do my dad now the first thing I noticed is how amazing this strain tastes as assets only it's been a personal favorite of mine but I love doing it first thing in the morning its morning time here it's about 9:00 a.m. so I because it's very cerebral for me I feel like I get those creative juices flowing I forget the energetic buzz I feel like I get that nice social anxiety relief but at the same time it's also I don't know it's relaxing I don't get that as if I don't get back sigh it's just a great string for the morning it's a great rating for me to start off the day because you know you don't want to start the day with anxiety at the same time you don't want to start the day with like a indica that's gonna just knock you out and make you exhausted at the same time so I don't know this is I would say that this is relatively one of my favorite strains had been I can't say that it's my favorite sharing but it's more with my top five I don't I haven't really got to get too much of it it's so it's really nice to see it with Cultus a little bit of a bittersweet because they were doing graybles of diamonds for $55 and then they would do following you and half off so you know it was 55 and then you get the weather one half off so it's 27 fifties so it's 82 54 2 grams of diamond so I was a wonderful deal but they now decided to do $50 for a half gram of diamonds and you know it was I don't know it was upsetting to me because I went there and I was like alright you know couple era dollars and you're like six grams of diamonds and and they're like not stupid dollars for half gram now even though I looked on in and said $50 for a gram but I wasn't gonna I've never tried to be a hard person to deal with so I wasn't gonna look at it and be like oh let's advertise for $50 heroes I just figured out what you know and be like ok but it's it's really the slap in the face to me personally when you're a patient and you're going to get your medicine you know it's not like this is recreational or it's just business you know what I mean like I can understand alcohol but when you're a patient you're coming to get the medicine what's prescribed to you what you need and all of a sudden it's over a hundred percent more expensive you know 8250 was giving me two grams of diamonds now now $100 gets me at Grandma diamonds like come on you guys grow it you process it and you sell it and now you know I mean you've shown us how well you've done I understand that you sellout and you can't keep the product for as long but you've shown us I mean you've shown us what you can profit rather be showing us that y'all are doing well off of it and now you just decided well you know I'm just gonna brace it 120 percent and you know it'll it'll make it last longer yeah I agree with that and I appreciate you know called us products I've always enjoyed them but it was it was really I don't know I mean I'm not I don't consider myself a cheap person you know I understand economics I understand business but it's like I don't know I don't feel like they understand that it's medicine you go there a lot of the times and they treat you calm funny it's like you go to the counter and you know they're like well what do you want I want something make me feel good I want something to make me feel better you don't I don't what I might just don't know I'm not just his shopping I'm not just here like trying to get my weed I'm here trying to get what I need you know I mean they're trying to to just and I don't know I don't I don't feel like they're understanding to that I feel like they're looking at it as a business and they're trying to be quick and they're trying to get people in and out and they're trying to sell to trying to upsell you know what I mean now their prices are going up and it's just like to me that's not I don't know it's not what this industry should be about I I really been trying to get involved in the CBD business it's a big passion project of mine you know that's not going to be a let's raise prices 100 percent on people it's gonna it's going to be something that's trying to help people is trying to help the community you know no I I just I personally see it as a little bit of a slap in the face I enjoy calls the they do have great products I'm not you know not trying to be a naysayer I'm just trying to be honest and trying to give you guys honest reviews because I don't feel like there's really much information out here I don't really feel like there's really anybody's talking for us I don't feel like there really is much going on but I don't know I mean I don't know if you guys you know are medical and you guys are in Maryland I don't want I'm wondering if you guys have the same experiences as I do because I really really never enjoy when I go into a place and I feel like I'm being rushed you know what I mean I want to I want to come in here and I want to look around I wanna I want to hear a little bit about what I'm getting you know I don't want to just what if I have extremely bad PTSD and sativa just makes my anxiety crazy you know what I mean it's just like I don't know it they don't look at you with open welcoming arms most of the time being personable you know it's more or less just like they want you to get in and get out and that's and that's a vibe that I really don't like um I know I know I've kind of went on that I know that this is supposed to be a stranger you at 8 1 8 headband let's get up you know I would give it a 8.5 out of 10 it's but I just wanted to get that off my chest I don't know how other people in this community feel about that but it really always upsets me when you know because it's I could understand recreational you know what I mean I don't walk into a liquor store and I'm like you know well tell me all about this bottle here I don't you know I mean that's that's not necessarily what I want to do but when I'm walking into a dispensary to get my medicine you know and I have a medical card I would like some time I don't want to be treated like a number I don't wanna be treated like a money sign I want to be treated like a patient you know maybe that's too much to ask I don't know maybe maybe I'm being unrealistic with how this world works around here how economics work you know I had AI have economic projects you know marijuana and marijuana related things is not economic to me it's healing it's it's helping it's being there for people that need it need this help and then I'm getting it you know and it's just really disheartening it's really just you know dis encouraging a little bit to welcome to a place with such enormous potential to help people and having them treat you like a number like you know I mean like you're just in a fast-food line you need to hurry the [ __ ] up I don't know as I said maybe I'm wrong I would love to hear what anybody else thinks about this topic if anybody else has similar

medication here just finish the super crop and as you can see it's quite a difference in height and yeah they look like [ __ ] they look like they all bend and madill be over in about a week they'll be back up even before that now it gives us a bit more space in between the light so they'll stop growing we were almost done growing so budding very good now with some pretty nice buzz in the back there so I assume within the week they should be back up and they won't go any more higher and those buds will become bigger and the one inside we'll have time to pop up a little bit also all right it was an update on super cropping if you have any question or comment drop me a line down if you like what you see please your thumbs up give me thumbs up share it with your friend and said please

stretch go kaneen up the leaves in a few days just did some below ground trimming got the Mar 16 one of the canopies looking real nice Scroggs pretty even really happy with how it's coming out this time around there's always ways to you know shove something under there loop-d-loop around them scrog for those of you that know I want to show you guys check this [ __ ] out is this is a custom feed system how it works is I have it hooked up to this timer and this timer goes off twice a day for 20 seconds and pumps into this item which is a drip ring which has holes in it it actually feeds it it's great I honestly think it's awesome I just put some nutrients in the seven gallon bucket here I you know keep it up for a day or two and check on it check the pH pH and if I need to and usually at the end of three days four days I just refill it with some new nutrients um as you can see you know we cleaned up down here a little bit really I'm not gonna lie guys I've had this mar 16 2014 10 afore mob everything I got a little bit going out too much over there but everything else is looking fantastic honestly I just took that under alright guys its gritty grower just giving you an update take care", "jZ6wFxYeR00": "reading everybody can a medication here just a little video to show you the garden we are on the second week of flowering starting the third week and as you could see they are huge so what are we gonna do we're gonna super prop them because they're getting too close to the light and you can see lights pretty close and there's not enough space on the ceiling heater to go any much higher I could do like maybe three or four inches higher on the ceiling but not much so what we're gonna do here we're gonna super crop those baby but before we're super crop just want to show you some little video starting to bud pretty good buds everywhere I mean they like it oh also just to show you an average of the heights deep line here in the bucket on the ground no the top of this one when we evolved 57 58 57 the six with the 7 inches from the ground and some of them are even higher like way in the back there is some higher even higher and we don't want them to be clue close to the light because while they bud they're gonna still grow another week usually it takes three weeks 24 out of 21 days before they stop growing completely and only producing the buds because it takes them three weeks we are in the second week we know that another week and they'll be done growing so to slow this down I am gonna super crop them tonight all of them and that way that way they'll stop growing in the height maybe the little branch in size will come up a little bit more maybe but they'll put their energy on strength getting back that branch up and straight and by the time they do this the week of growing will be over and they will be only producing some buds it's a little stress to the plant but not that much if you do it right you know it'll benefit a lot on the Arvest you have way bigger buds more bud sites for bud place on them on the plant and you know next day or so about three days they'll be stopping completely producing about a week they'll be stopping producing any vegetation stage so we'll trim the bottom at that time we move all the Leafs that we need to on the books as you can see the stem is for you baby quite healthy it's like that all and as you can see there's not much space left here in the little how to walk down and if you look at the plant actually touching a lot we may have vegetable for the room we have here but we'll see so anyway let me show you here how super crop so you have this branch here and you see that the branch is way too getting too long and you want to reduce this let's take this one here it's higher like this one here and I want to slow down the growth on this one so what I'll do I'll basically find the stem or reduce the height about closed-up foot so I'm gonna bend them about a foot from the top well you do you take the stem here in between your finger and you're gonna press on the stem to crush it flat like the size of the finger see what I mean it's getting flatter I like press on and as I press on to flat it up I just force the plant to come down slowly you don't want to break the branch you just want to bend them by producing a bend in the plant she'll get back up and she'll be sending more energy to fix those branch there I've been bended like this so as you can see this one is done and let me show you closer how it looks and you try to round them as much as you can so they don't bend the square you know to let the Bend slowly like this one I'll do another one here take this one here and we're gonna bend this boat here I squeezed a stem about an inch wide an inch high to me I squeeze it until it flattened up a bit and when it start to flatten up I just bend the branch slowly with that flat that I just made and here we go here we go that's what super cropping is about", "KIxmv1zNCQY": "let's go rowing out guys as you can see it's week two flowering for the8 180 headband using scrog under the Mars 1600 strain happens to stop stretching pretty quickly I don't think I got much more stretch so the canopies starting to look good everything's looking great if we look down here and don't mind the mess you can see I got the auto feeder still going got the branches look how thick this is look at that man that's [ __ ] thick like I'm a pretty big dude not overly large but but damn that's a thicker than my [ __ ] thumb you can see from underneath we've trimmed up the bottom canopy you could use a little bit more love but for the most part it's all squared away um yeah I'm definitely a fan you can see some of the buds are starting to grow here it's just trying to produce just using my regular nutrient regimen I got some updated nutrients I gotta make a video for that on you guys but yeah Mar 16 years to impress this is coming from a guy who used to have a thousand water in this same tent beautiful beautiful scrog always recommend a scrub they work great alright guys gritty grow or keep it growing", "Aj_49vfQl5Y": "reading everybody can a medication here the third week in the room after the transplant the veggie time and as you could see they are doing really really well they just love whatever I'm doing with them they love the environment and they love the Fred Liza and obviously we're growing them in cocoa pure cocoa 10-gallon bags well pouch or whatever you call it it reads through and the water the trim through and drain true and it's better oxygen for the routes using cocoa also give you a better drainage better aeration for oxygen for the roots and they love it and as you can see that's getting there I mean told you the last video that they would touch together pretty soon Andy does they do right now so I'm going to have to move them a little bit around but yeah they are doing really really good well as usual it's not the first time I grew that members they always come nice it's a beautiful plant it's the 818 @ bano J and it's a very nice structure it is a very bushy I top them a long time ago and you just love it and as you can see under I have cut all the branch from them under three weeks ago when I transferred them from the clone to here and soon i'm going to have to do it again in a day or so you want to take care of that trimming the under again removing some leaves and trimming that the branch the top the one that are climbing too far too fast we're going to trim them a bit make sure that you don't do it too high and more bushy and here you see the space in between that they keep myself to walking while soon I'll have hard time walking in here I'll have to crawl under to water them that's usually what I do after a while because they become too big and this is the one that going after and this one is pushy I didn't even trim it his bushy naturally and this one is the train wreck that's going to be the next drop I'm just keeping her here until i switched into flour and then i'll move our back to the to the phone room i just want it to pepper up a little bit so i could take some clone out of it but yeah as you can see they're really like it we had 4,000 watt in here and i use i pressure sodium balls for vegetation and the reason why it's because they climb lesson hide is stretch less and the produce more branch closer inter not as you can see so that's the reason why I'm using HPS for veggie if you use metal highlight for veg usually stretch way way more than that and more space in between the int or not actually if you use if you as I pressure sodium you'll have a more dance planet like that but also to use normal fluorescence fluorescence t5 or whatever will give you a bushy plant too so and as you can see there is no space in between minus buy they growing very very fast they don't take too much too long to grow I feed them very good right now I give them the tree part from advanced nutrients grow bloom and micro I give them four hundred million 500 milliliter the last time for 200 milliliter water and I give them some d 50 to 250 milliliter of b-52 I give them 250 milliliter of voodoo juice I give them 250 milliliter this time of sugar molasses can sugar and molasses I don't give them usually too much in the veggie stage only at the end of the flowering but usually giving them a shot on the second or third watering in the veggie do you like it can I also give them some some other stuff so yeah do you like it to be a really like it so probably in a week from now I'll be switching them to flower and the other stuff I'm giving its silica high on the black a blank of memory here silica give them 250 milliliter of silica also but this flower this watering coming I water them to the day ago so the next watering will be probably only the flowering stuff so i'll show you my recipes at that time and i also been treating them for fritz for the last three weeks I've been spraying them every three days with azo mags and them oil with dish soap so you mix 2 tbsp of hazel max 2 tbsp of Memorial and 2 tbsp of dish soap in one gallon of water and you put your water a little bit look Lucas or warm a bit lukewarm they call it the monitor and also when you water them I heat up my water so the water reach 60 in between 60 and 65 65 and 70 you got between 60 and 70 but I keep it around 65 and they really liked it the temperature in here is 25 the mid-eighties 30 energy is a bit low and I like it like that that's why I give them silica so it protect them from transpiring and into dry and the heat I have a team of the fire here and deprez you with Cole hair hair cooling so it keeps the room around 25 all the time with the exhaust fan going on all the time Fulton over there with the carbon filter on and this is actually running full time the exhaust the heat how the beer and whatever and I got an intake on this side which brings six inches of fresh air from the outside mount it on the air exchanger so it filters the air that comes in make sure we don't have any bugs or thing coming in so besides that they are doing good I will show you in a week again when i switch them to flower but for the veggie stage near looking pretty good so far and those tomato rack or foot for foot high from the ground because they are in the bucket so we got four foot height from the ground here i'd say the plant has about close to four foot high too because she's sticking out more than the the last ring so it's not really a matter of height it's a matter of structure and density how big bushy she is going to be I like to get them clean under so the air circulate properly they don't if it's better for bugs it's better for moisture and stuff like that so anyway people if you like what you see subscribe share with your friends talk about it i'll be showing you how to videos coming up and don't forget to subscribe down there give

of the eight one eight seven oh seven headband 9 and when I get into premium seeds versus cheaper seeds and why they're that they are premium seeds a lot of guys be like nah see to see the seeds and seeds money talks money talks this is the eight one eight so we got the eight one in the back one two three four five and the rest 707 now let me get into it straight I had six seeds of the eight one eight by Cali connection and fifteen seeds of the seven or seven hso same environment same soil same light if I was going to transplant these tomorrow and weed out the weaklings out of the six I could transplant comfortably into my system five eight one eight by Kali connection as you see in the back there very plump the very green very vigorous out of fifteen 707s by HS old and I love HS old I grew a lot but this is the problem out of fifteen of them I would comfortably transplant two maybe three out of fifteen eight years old compared to the six or the five out of the six cally connections that is a big ratio I'm pretty sure two or three HS O's you're gonna grow he's gonna be chronic it's gonna be chronic off the bat it's gonna be you know I mean but that's that's that's some ratios that's some ratios and I grew a lot of anxious old but that's the problem with them you have to pop you know it depends on your size you know of your grow but you're not the pot a lot to get keepers or some of the worth of to set the Grohl because you know people with small spaces don't have a lot of space to get a mother plant growing and growing or going on so people small spaces like me will pop and prevent so this is my pre big this is how I pre veg you know I mean and and and root out the week because I'm not gonna waste my time with weed plants so I'm gonna picked on the best of the best for myself and sell out whatever whatever told the people you know I mean so this is just one one of one set now price of the seeds Callie connection is maybe three quarters more seventy bucks more sixty bucks more than a pack of of hso but knowing that Cal connection premium see is going to give me premium plants and genetics I don't find a problem going with Callie connections knowing that in the space limited they're going to give me premium for my space where there's a lot of there's a lot of ifs and buts about the other cheaper seats that's all I'm getting at so this is the eighth one eight it's the headband and looking very healthy they're stinking dispense our ready Naomi I want a veggie mo for a week it's a Sunday so probably gonna transplant next Sunday so we can tweak more veg in get a little more stash to get ready so when I put you in the system the ready to take off strongly because I would be pushing these guys to the limit don't be pushing these guys to limit bending scrog pushing these guys to the limit of limit of the potential of yielding important but so I want them strong I want them and I don't want weak stirs not gonna I'm not gonna waste my time this is a good thing you started like I always started you veg them you pre vaginally got weed out to get something that you like and if you get if you time for ten and you only get seven strong ones always tire on the other ones let be let it be let it be you know me let it be let it be twenty coming at you one more time this hybrid looking they all look good man I'm pretty sure all of them perform what perform will perform but then again it's touching that snowing with some chronic man that's so chronic right there let's see I hope I'll have some a trousseau to put in with Cali you know I wanted one strain this is the thing again when you make mixing up breeders some are gonna outshine others you know and I was planning to have you know one one girl one strain but we're two different breeders two different same same strain into a headband you can see the difference in in in in it you just see the difference you just see the difference right we'll see it smells good though yeah it's just smells like the but everybody starts about how it is gonna be on the part night peppery citrusy lemony skunky pushy Beasley they're small and I can tell you that there's someone that I'm gonna put in hell yeah we're gonna perform others Mazz before 20 and a link back up for the transplant to the system one week away wish me luck hope everything goes as planned already everything looks healthy 99 percent healthy no deficiencies everything looks green and looks proper yeah wish me luck and check me out later boys laters Mossberg", "q34QG-l9iFs": "welcome back to Dutchman's medical

week six and we are under thousand watt double-ended bulbs with the king wing hoods and lr5 light rail system I have 6,000 watts here down from 10,000 so I took my ten thousand I'm out room put the lr5 light rail in and cut my legging back and I'm down to six thousand watts and I can put about 35 to 40 plants under this setup and that keeps me under my limit and everything staged beautifully about two to four weeks apart so they only got about three to six plants getting done every month and just keep spacing them out keep them going perpetual so that's about it I just want to kind of show you guys the blue dream haze how she's coming along looking absolutely phenomenal our next video will be on the tangerine Dream's which don't really know if I have any favourites on these ones yet I usually wait till about week six to start phenotyping for smell and stickiness and kind of get a better idea of which one I'm leaning towards so that's it that wraps up our video we are in week

treating them with as a max and them oil with dish soap three of them mixed together I use the 2 tbsp of as a max neem oil and dish wash soap in a one gallon of water and I've been treating them every third three days spraying them under the leaves on top of the leaves everywhere we also been feeding them with a lot of good stuff and I had shown you but i will show you when i do a watering the

going with seven leaps I don't know where I seen it but I've seen one before anyway which give me a sign that the plant is very healthy when you have seven leaves of stead of five so and as you can see they are very LT right now he went back some of them the stocks is very big getting bigger and bigger now I want to make sure they don't grow through high and I keep trimming them and I'm going to trim them back again because I want to make sure that they go pushy and not as high so that's an example here of a seven leaps starting three four five six seven so so but I see a leaves having seven things like that while duels planned anyway I know that the plant is very healthy I've been feeding them pretty good not too hard and I don't have any burn tip or I don't have any burn tip or anything like that so what it seems to like it now we have 4000 watt in this room one here one there one on that side and one here and we get aid plant on each side in cocoa ten-gallon material thought and yeah I really like it we had trouble but now they are coming back and the leaves are pretty shiny right now because of the use of Max and neem oil well as you can see we spray them every three days and there's no Burnley for nothing with as a max in them oil and this show basically what you have to do is shut the light and spray your plants have VAV everywhere under the leaves everywhere on the top on the ground around on the stem everywhere and after this leave the lights off for at least two or three hours I I say three hours me and make sure the fans are circulating so the live the fans are blowing on the plants so to make sure that like this fan of this color at this fan on this corner and another one on this side where the entrance and an exhaust fan exhaust coming in six inches for fresh air and I got another fan over there plus we have an air cooler here that's awful circulate the air plus we're going to put another fan on the bottom that's going to blow under but as you can see the air trim pretty high so I don't have any problem on the bottom there's no sense of keeping branch on the bottom the light don't penetrate that much in and it's an awesome cause a time and branch and so I rather keep them more bushy on top and as you can see I'm using tomato racks the forefoot one the four ring four foot this one is a tree ring galvanized but still four foot care both like five or six bucks each but you're worth it and it's going to do for a while and when you're going to see in the next video were they going to be like this here one that's going to grow there will be no space in between right now you see space in between but when they are at the second week of the flowering there will be no space in between and those this particular strand which is the 818 @ ban grow pretty tall when you switch it to flower and still going rule another foot and a half foot foot and a half of a hike so I got to make sure that see the height that we have here we're going to make sure that we don't want them to grow too high so what I'm going to do I'm going to clip the top of those in couple days make sure they don't grow through high and become more bushy around it and all the branch are coming out on the side so we're going to have a lot a lot of branch everywhere so it's going to come more bushy less height but they still going to grow up like I'd say from the planet right now when they are ready to will be about a foot and a half from the light sometime even less and what I do I just bend them to make sure they don't get burned but the air circulation is pretty good in here that's very important and I got this one here that I'm going to grow the next is going to be the next crop in here it's a train wreck and it seems very very very bushy it's a plan that seems to be going very bushy dance she had hard time to in the other room so now she's gonna pick up back here and I'm going to transplant her in the bigger pots old and she's going to be the mother plant she's the mother plant the train wreck a train wreck and it's supposed to be a good strength so I can't wait to try it so anyway i'll give you another update within a week about show you how they are doing and as far as I could see they are doing pretty good if coming back from their transplant and now they go to start to go wild and crazy and I like it because we got a lot a branch coming out very close that's why I use H vs high pressure sodium for vegetation also because I found what I pressure sodium of vegetation it's producing very close as you can see the branch are very very close together and I like that so it's going to make a big huge but you know instead of stretching for nothing so that's I think I did it with meadow I light before and they stretch it more in between and they were not as nice at this time they are very nice and healthy as you can tell so I'll keep you up to date with what's going on here if you like what you see subscribe I'm going to have more video coming in share it like it we're going to have a lot of the video coming in for you guys 16 of them here and wait where is this in two months so we get two months ahead of us and I'm going to show you how we grow those baby I will also give you all my recipes that I'm using and if you do the same thing as I do you'll get the same result hopefully the result will be nice so we're going to put four brand new bulb here when they start to flower so we won't switch them right away i'm going to wait another week at least before I switch them I'm going to clip the top of them so they Bush even more and I'm not going to switch them right away wait another week they're going to be huge make sure they don't have any more traits at all trips at all so within a week there should be all clean because it's been almost two weeks over two weeks now that I treat them every three days so they should be a really clean hopefully they won't get any more those little bugs so all right people

yep 26 about 27 27 point whatever percent thc all fire crystals this is headband not really any purple in this one but that's because that's how the strain is fire fire fire now what i wanted to show about this is i tried to look it up on google i i once had the information all about it but the delta nine thc d9 t8c what is that d9 thc is gonna be um delta 9 thc is going to be the the thc that gets you more um high it's i'm it's hard to explain but it's the more therapeutic thc it's the one that's going to get you more medicated and more and more of that uplifted feeling um i'm not exactly sure about it i i didn't know once like the main component of it like what it mainly does but mainly this is the better thc and this is one of the highest ones that i've seen which is surprising uh but this is the highest one that i've that i've seen so far out of all the strains i've gotten from them and this is perch harvest brand they only grow for a certain uh dispensary around here but this is perch harvest this is the hover and that's what it is the br the strain is headband now as you can see look at all that thc that's all delta nine that's going to get you very very very uplifted and what else i wanted to uh shout out to is thanks for the boveda bag they're always busting with the boveda bags you know a lot you don't really see the boveda bags with them but i do like that you get the boveda bags keep your product fresh but yeah that's pretty much the headband 27 percent closest to some of the highest stuff you're going to see and yeah check it out purge harvest massachusetts shit's really busting and as always if you're under 18 please do not watch these videos as i know some of you probably do but if you are under 18 please do not watch these videos if you're not 21 and

here we got the tropic thunder from shred and palmetto headband so um yeah let's uh see what it picks come on uh bengal give me some good shit it's gonna give me a headband it looks like that's all right i like headband my favorite so far has been the pure sun farms one plus i tried the what is it here high tide yes i tried the high tide one as well so this is my third headband let's try it this is the palmetto headband sativa hybrid that's uh got 19 or 190 milligrams thc and we got for a package date we've got june the 18th so today is halloween today is the 31st of october so there we go anyways um yeah this is a sundial brand i tried their other one last time uh palmetto chem dog and i liked it it was good so hopefully this is also good and like i said before this is the third headband i've tried before my favorite so far and my favorite of all of the pure sun farm strains is the headband because it's so awesome so i hope this will compare anyways just checking this 50.0 gram weight 50.00 gram weight on the scale make sure it's accurate here yep see we're all good so there we go with that all right there we go we got the little container here zero it out there we go it's time for this palmetto time for headband all right all right ah there we go hey it comes with a thing too i don't remember if the other one did it probably did actually hmm nice smell it's kind of got like a flowery grassy smell yeah anyways let's see what they gave me here oh oh come on keep coming keep it going what oh no there's another piece in there come on come on what for fuck's sakes this shit is underweight it's under my weight it's not under the legal limit of underweight but it's what i call underweight so here's the buds from the palmetto headband they're kind of a little bit of a fluffy well this one's actually a bit solid some of them look fluffy this one looks fluffy but they're like uh fairly dry it's got a nice dryness to it this um this stuff here on ocs goes for just under 32 bucks for a 3.5 so like i don't know how much that is that's like nine dollars in like 15 cents a gram or something maybe but anyways looks okay feels okay smells there's a bit of a smell nice smell so that's all right um let's check it out with a microscope next nice buds too these ones [Laughter] all right here's some of the outside of the palmetto headband it's got um like clear and cloudy trichomes there's some close-ups on the uh one of these buds that on the right there is just a little tear along a stem that's don't worry about that i know it looks kind of funny but that's okay right there um yeah see there's some there's a little bit of amber in there a little bit let's see see look on the left side you see a little spot of amber in those bicones there's a little tiny little bit here and there wow look at this section it looks freaking awesome look at that so cool looking this this section here is uh from one of the i think this section must have gotten ripped open and this must be the inside so that looks like the inside right there like a whole bunch of uh clear ones right and those little guys oh my god these little guys have little amber things in them little amber pupils looking at you there's some more awesome close-ups look at that so again from the outside of another of the buds looking good though looking real cool what's that little guy there i don't know what that is a little dark spot i think that trichome died it died anyways though this is looking decent maybe i'll break open a bud and check out the inside just to make sure and what it looks like right so let's let's open this one here this one right here here's a look inside oh my goodness look at those tricoms right over there can i get over there can i get over there please oh shit trying to get them in view here yeah that patch get up get in there get in there fuck that other button was really hard to look inside so i ripped open another one here's a different one and look inside this guy you can actually see a lot better inside this one um but yeah that's you know that's what the trichomes look like in this pretty cool anyways though this is headband and i'm gonna go and try it because i love headbands so i'll be back in like a second so i just got in from this headband at uh 19 from palmetto and uh this stuff here is decent once again another nice one from palmetto the flavor on here is kind of it's kind of like plants it's like it's a bit like geraniums but then also there's another there's like another plant or two in there that it tastes like so you know vegetarians would probably really like this one um there's also other stuff in there there's like a a hint of grape or lime or lime grape there's just like a hint of something else in there it makes it real interesting i like it as for like the headband effect there was a tiny bit but nothing compared to the pure sun farms headband which is unusual cause i think those are both sundial this is also sundial so i don't know how that works but anyways so i do still prefer the pure sun farms headband over this but this stuff here is also good and i like it it's a real nice head high it's a real kind of uh i don't know if i would say it's got energy but it's sort of like a focus one it's very sort of clear very nice it's very happy kind of buzz so i like that sativa hybrid yeah that's awesome i like it very cool um so what what was the price on this i forget it's like 32 bucks or something that's okay you know it'll be nice to get more of it for less like if they were to sell like a seven or or 15 bag or something for i'd give you a bit of a deal on that that would be nice but i would buy this again i would buy the pure sun farms headband before this but since it's always sold out probably would buy this instead right because you can't they never have the other one because it's so good so that's it for the uh for this then uh there's one thing left the tropic thunder on the uh the bangle of buds and we'll spin that up next time so um hit the subscribe button if you want and the uh the notification bell it'll send you a message when the next video is up and

grams and it has twenty three point eight percent thc and a point three percent cbd and then this was packaged may 21st 2020. so yeah three and a half grams this is my first time trying grail anything from them so i have no expectations that's looking in the container does look like pretty dark nugs fairly small in size and it smells fairly sweet but like skunky 3.56 nice so the bud is fairly spongy i'd say like really spongy definitely not dry weed so like i said before mostly smaller sized nugs and then i'd say leaf color is pretty dark i don't see a ton of hairs but there it does look like there's a fair amount to crystal and then a little bit of purple on the leaves it looks like it might be why they're so dark [Laughter] so yeah pretty fluffy kind of lightened up a bit being busted up and so headband from grill is more of a relaxing high i did find the hits were kind of like sweet tasting i also needed to leave the bud out of the container for a little bit just to help dry it up so it smoked a bit nicer and i did a little more experimenting with the microscope camera i did get some videos but again they didn't turn out too well so i didn't include them but here are some of the close-up shots that i got there is this one side right here where i'm not too sure what like why it's so white and why it looks like i don't know if it's moldy or if it's just like a spiderweb or like what's going on i'm not sure but if you have any input definitely let me know i did find that these pictures like the quality did turn out a little bit better than the last video so um like the trichomes like you can see like the bulbs on them and whatnot so that was kind of interesting i know they're not great but i'll keep working on it and see if i can get some better quality stuff for you guys but yeah definitely give this strain a try and let us know your experience in the comments below like and subscribe and we'll see you next time thanks for watching", "RkVVMXu0ZnA":

grow cannabis strains [Music] so the burning question is why would you want to grow a strain of cannabis that was notoriously difficult to cultivate is it that you like a challenge is your life that dull that there is no other challenges at hand maybe there is something special about the particular strain you want to grow after all we seldom try to grow a cannabis plant before we have tried the end result first that would be like buying a car without taking it for a test drive so for the five hardest to grow strains what is it about them that makes us want to persevere with them whilst you have a think about that here's our list of the top five most difficult strains to grow and achieve the desired results in fifth place we have jack here this is not actually that hard to grow but it takes a lot of care and attention to get really good results named in memory of one of the world's greatest hemp proponents it can be grown in an sog or screen of green setup but outdoors is where it comes into its own producing an amazing 600 grams per square meter at number four we have headband it makes the list because these small popcorn like buds means that training the plant will be necessary to maximize yield with the need for a screen of green essential sfv og comes in at number three also known as san fernando valley og once again the plant is not necessarily difficult to grow but it takes a lot to achieve its maximum yield of 350 grams per plant which performs best when grown outdoors that then creates an additional problem as more than most cannabis plants it requires an incredibly steady temperature or growth will fail completely dr grinspoon just fails to make it to the top spot but it was close one of the biggest problems is that the yield is incredibly low this is a plant for purists with such a low yield it is possible to have little to show for all your hard work needless to say this is not a commercial cropping plant colombian gold takes the crown for the hardest cannabis strain to grow this is partly due to its moderate resistance to pests and mold and the fact that the greater yield comes from growing it outdoors at almost double that of indoor grown

pierson farms this has eighteen point seven percent thc and zero percent cbd and then it was packaged uh september 21st 2020 and this is seven grams seven grams in a zippy bag [Applause] so first look here it's pretty skunky smelling a little bit of like a sour and a hint to it that's six points oh i think there's a little bit more in here some crumbly so 7.02 so the nugs i'd say are pretty floofy looking not super dense it's got a pretty good moisture to it though and then i'd say like a medium green for leaf color there's quite a few hairs in it as well and a decent coating of crystal and then for nug size i'd say medium on the bigger end of medium bust it up a little bit lighter than the nugs but more or less the same some of these nugs have some pretty dark patches on them so but pretty good moisture you don't see as much of the hairs being busted up so headband from pierson farms i found to be both uplifting and relaxing um overall a pretty productive high and the nugs had a pretty good coating of mostly white trichomes but there was a few clusters of darker spots throughout the nugs also there's a good amount of hairs but they were fairly clustered it seemed to be a bit more dense in trichomes around the clusters of hairs overall the nugs were pretty light in color but as you can see there are quite a few dark spots um just kind of throughout if you've tried the

the plants so I'm gonna transplant them see how it looks some crazy headband alright peeps chicky well leader", "W3X4oONm0nM": "[Music] hi everyone I hope you're well this is Selena so this week I'm bringing to you a new headband project it's really fun and really easy to make so to make this project I have used one skein well very a very small part of this skein of style craft cotton DK so it's a hundred percent cotton I'll be linking everything in the description box all the materials that I've used and you can download the free pattern at Selena Verona calm as always so this is the yarn that I used you will be needing a full millimeter crochet hook a pair of scissors and a tapestry needle and without further ado I'm just gonna jump right into the tutorial so for this video I'm just gonna make a small sample however you will be making a longer version so you will be chaining more than me so to begin just make a slipknot so I'm just gonna make my slip knot like so I'm just gonna pop my hook through and tighten and now you are going to be chaining 70 chains and I'll be chaining less so just go ahead and chain 70 so one two three so I've chained a much smaller sample but you should have chained 70 for my pattern just so you know and this pattern needs to be a multiple of two so if you want to make it smaller say for a child or if you want to make it larger just because you may have like a larger head just know that it's a multiple of Choo so now that I've chained my and you've changed 70 we are going to be doing a half double crochet in the third chain from the hook so just count 1 2 & 3 and go into that third chain wrap your yarn around your hook and pop your hook inside this chain take your yarn pull it through you've got three loops on your hook take your yarn and pull through three loops and this is how we make a half double crochet and you the first two chains right here counts as a half double crochet already so what we're going to do now is place another half double crochet into the next stitch so just do the same and pull through three loops and into the next chain and this is what you're going to do until the end of this row just pop your hook through and place a half double crochet until the end of the row and then I'll show you how to do row two okay so I've just finished row one so I've placed a half double crochet into every stitch and then into that last one right here so what we're going to do now for the second row star there's only three rows in this pattern and this is gonna be the filet crochet row the next row so basically what you are going to be doing is chaining 3 so 1 2 & 3 turn your work and this actually counts as a half double crochet and chain and what we going to do and it's it counts as this stitch so the first stitch so the second stitch right here is actually the second stitch and we're gonna skip that because we've got a chain space right here so we're just gonna skip this stitch and go into the third half double crochet from the previous row and place a half double crochet into that so just go ahead and place a half double crochet into that and basically this is what we have so this creates that space what we're going to do now is chain 1 and skip this stitch and go into the next stitch and place a half double crochet into that one and then what we're going to do is chain 1 skip that stitch and go into the next stitch there we go and chain 1 skip a stitch go into the next one and what we're going to do is chain 1 skip a stitch and now we're at the and what your your row will be a lot longer than mine obviously because you've chained more but this is just the principle I'm showing so we've chained 1 we're gonna skip one stitch and we're just gonna place our half double crochet into the chain 2 from the previous row right here so just go ahead and find that change you and pop your sing a stitch into that which is a half double crochet and this is how it should look for now and this is your second row and I'm just gonna show you how to do row 3 and then that will be the whole pattern so for Row 3 you are going to chain 2 1 and you turn your work and this counts as your first half double crochet with this first stitch and then the second stitch is the space that we created in the last row so we're just going to go directly into that with our half double crochet so just pop your half double crochet into space directly oops so just pop your half double crochet into that space directly and now we are going to go into the next stitch which is a half double crochet from the previous row and we're just gonna place our half double crochet into that so just go ahead and go into that and place a half double crochet and now we are going to be placing a half double crochet in this space like so and now this is the half double crochet from the previous row so just go ahead and place your half double crochet into that and then in the next space just go ahead and place a half double crochet into that and I'll just let you carry on until the end of the row so there we go so I've just placed a half double crochet into the half double crochet from the previous row right here and now I've got two stitches left indeed I've got a space left and a chain two left from the previous row so we are going to be placing a half double crochet into both so just go ahead and place a half double crochet into that space and then just go ahead and place a half double crochet into the change you from the previous row and there you go you have your um your pattern so you should have a much longer a much longer project so with my sample I showed you how to make Row 1 Row 2 Row 2 and Row 3 so to make this headband you just need to repeat Row 2 right here and then Row three once again and once you've done that just fasten off and now I'm just gonna show you how to make the hair ties so basically these are what we are going to be tying our headband with I thought it was more fun to have a couple of hair ties just because I think it's fun you can make them longer than the ones that I've made because these are just gonna tie a bit like a small knot if you wanted more like a more flamboyant look you could go for a longer version so I'm just gonna show you how to make these so basically you are gonna make a tie on each two on each side so on each corner so this is on the bottom corner and this is on the top corner and I'm just gonna show you this side so to make your hair tie you are simply just going to be taking your yarn and popping it through this corner so there we go we've popped our hook through this corner and we are simply gonna take our yarn and pull it through with our hook so just not this you cannot it twice there we go and now what we are going to be doing is going into this corner with our hook take your yarn pull through and what we are going to be doing now is chaining 40 so just go ahead and chain 40 so one two three so I've just chained 40 and this is what it looks like it's a simple chain and what we are going to be doing is slip stitching through this chain so you are gonna skip that first chain here and go into the second one with your hook so just go into the second chain pop your hook through very simply grab your yarn pull it through that loop and then pull it through the other loop and this creates your slip stitch and we are just gonna go into the next chain so these are quite tight and that's normal and take your yarn pull it through one loop and through the next loop and this is what it's going to look like so we are just going to slip stitch through each and every chain until the top of the chain and then I'll show you what you do then alright so I finished slip stitching as you can see until the top of the row and what I'm going to do now is secure this side into the top corner of this headband so just go through a stitch basically just go through any stitch at the top on that side and slip stitch again through just to secure it to that corner what you are going to be doing now is fastening off so just snip your yarn and to fasten off you just need to pull through this loop there we go so there we go this is one of our hair ties what we need to do now is so in these loose ends so I'll just let you sew in these loose ends we need another one at the top corner here and our headband will be absolutely perfect so I hope you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe for a new crochet video every week and don't forget to give me a thumbs up if you liked this

"what's up to it's the bud barber I just wanted to do a little video showing some of the dry flowers they just broke them down off the stem off the stocks they were dry and they were in the men in jars for a night or two so they're still curing but it's this is the crazy train and it came out really nice is so friggin stinky stinks so bad i think i like i said i think i have the kimchi fino that I've heard jinx proof talk about it's pretty friggin stanky nothing like I've ever smelled before but this is the crazy train she went nine weeks just like everything did in that room she's some dank [ __ ] really nice heady high dense dense bo-buds she yielded really well which I didn't think she will but she did and just some really nice slope did kind of a loose trim it's been really really dry in my area like twenty thirty percent humidity so I've been leave a little more leaf on in the dry and then kind of trimming it down after it dries that's the crazy train starting to get a nice little cure on it she's bouncing back going back to original shape when you squeeze her anyway so now this also i did a loose trim on this is the layout g now i don't think i've ever shown any finished bug shots of this layer but the [ __ ] is just chronic and it smells like great fuel and it's mad frosty i get a really loose trim on it though like i said but the thing heald's crazy it was a pound plant which is always nice because everyone likes Leia all the the patients like it for its sleeping qualities really helps you sleep it's real potent you know really really medicinal like if you smoke somethin ain't get much done it's good for pain relief and like relaxing and sleeping I like it a lot it helps me relax I wish you could smell this it's amazing smell this is just like I love it it's one of my favorite scents that great be you know by grapey diesel fuel ease kind of smell so I that was the stelae uh oh gee so you can tell she's secure up this damn right here still a little green so let her cure for a few weeks trim her up a little bit better I just want to show some Leia all right and the next we got some la cheese now these are nugs these are so like dense i love the smoke it's really good for sleep relaxing it's actually good for just chilling out doing stuff too early doesn't might give you that couch lock but it just really is nice nice don't not the hugest nugs but like I said they're they're like rocks and the smell this is just amazing it's got like this grey peachy's but with like you know like this cushy licorice to it's pretty cool see is it about here so this is the LA cheese even the little stuff is like rock hard it's amazing and then we got the 818 which I won't be keeping I'll um I just don't like the smell on her stone is really nice the high is really nice every time I've runner since I ran as a small plant in a three gallon pot I haven't come close to the quality of that first run and as a little plant so I don't know maybe it's just one of those strands it doesn't like to be growing out as a big monster plant it does well and you know really little small three gallon pots but if you got a real big monsters you're gonna not get top quality I don't know I just it's nice I mean really really dense I just the smells just not there for me just kind of like I don't know nothing special about it it's kind of like piney you know khushi I've had other oh geez and stuff that were way more cushier that had more of a punch and more Berthier flavor than us and it's just I mean it's nice but I'm just not going to run anymore it's not for me so is the 818 but this video is getting kind of long so we'll cut her off but uh just want to show you guys these these dried flowers they need to cure still but we're going to get the shots before I end up smoking at all so anyway to everyone's having a good day night morning whatever and I will catch you later", "BcVmKDqtT4A": "all right welcome to the SPC bro day 19 of flower and really good we've had a slight humidity problem again so we bought an extra dehumidifier so we have a total of three right now so we're going to see it tonight when the light shuts off our third one is going to kick on and we'll see at that point if it could drop it below the fifty percent it's having a spike when the lights are off about 57 to 60 percent and as we all know that that's not a good humidity range to be in so if this doesn't work tonight we're going to have to upgrade to a commercial tomorrow but as you can see these girls are just looking and we went through the bottom of the canopy and actually trimmed up a little bit yesterday just to kind of open it up a little bit try and get some air through there besides the humidity problem everything's looking really we'll get it under control it's kind of risky doing this is flour but we really didn't think we were going to have a problem because of how small the room was but when you think about it we have 30 to 10 gallon pots and we're giving them a gallon of water every watering and it at this point it takes about three days to drink that water so we'll see what happens tonight and then tomorrow I'll give you guys an update see how everything goes if anybody has any questions feel free to comment or send me a private message it's what some people have been doing sometimes a little late on getting back but I will

so as you can see a little bit of Newt burn but that was my two weeks ago tell me on a few leaves not all of them so we began flushing so you can see you know the flushing is starting to kick in as far as the but they've been slowing up pretty nicely oh yeah this smell is here you know the crystals are on point you know it's not it's not deep frosty is strain but it definitely puts off some nice some nice Christmas so it's getting to the point where a lot of the budget starting to fall over with stirs but feelings think those buds missing it's just cuz they've fallen over for this when I here for example it's a pretty decent size but just falling over you got another one back here that's completely just just laying on the straw but how much I can do at this point check you got the whole line of bugs on this side so this is how the point used to be the ice and perky up but ever since I had to pull it out of his craw gonna try to put it back on he just you know I got all flimsy so it is at week seven and I believe it you could do another about another I would say two weeks to finish up properly still has a lot of white pistols and a lot of swelling to do so this is not I don't flower with the CFL's a flower with the LED but I just turned them on because it looks a lot better to film that way um I have my oscillating fan there I have my exhaust fan in there and I have an intake fan in there this is all growing you know I believe that two three four gallon maybe five gallon pot single plant bro it's just really bummed me out that I had to pull that other scrub because it was growing so nicely this this [ __ ] right now by this time I would have looked amazing in here but I run into a mildew issue and I had to pull it out and fix it right up into her back in here try to put the scrub back on and it just didn't go back on like it was supposed to but if you've ever pulled the plant out of a scrog and attempted to put it back you know what I'm talking about [ __ ] ain't easy [Music] yeah it's tough yeah it's definitely time to do some maintenance dude because a lot of the a lot of the fans that have a bunch of a bunch of dust built up and yeah yeah and you shoot we should probably use the that mildew solution to wipe it all down do that stuff works really well", "vdZvaaz29-c": "hi I'm Jordan Sinclair with tweed we're here in Smiths Falls Ontario this is an old Hershey Chocolate Factory that we've retrofitted and turned into a medical marijuana growing facility we figured since it's such a beautiful spring day in Canada we would invite high times up [Music] so I mean all this empty space that's behind us here will be more grow rooms in the next few months right now in Canada there's probably 40 to 45,000 medical users of marijuana and we probably got you know 20% of that market so here we've got one of the streams that set aside twelve growing rooms that we have operational right now we'll be in there anywhere from 8 to 12 weeks what type of string there looks like we've got something that's pretty close to the end of its of its harvest life so what's six right now will probably be available for sale the next couple month DNA genetics these guys obviously have one I think every category of canvas couplet there is and they're just worn out you know for breeding and for their growing practices and what they're doing here this week is a phenotype of project with us we've got you know a bunch of their strains that we already sell and now they're just helping us whittle it down so which of the seeds that we already have that the customers like can we really refine down so that we're just working with literally the hand-picked best of the best for what this world of genetics has to offer so here at tweed we've got 125 employees right now we've been ramping up over the last couple of years we were at a spot where it still looked a lot more like a Chocolate Factory that it did like a marijuana production facility so the change is kind of coming incremental II let me speed it up along quite nicely at this point great so I mean that was the little peek at the tween facility that we've got here it's this Falls and I

today we're looking at headband by pure sun farms i've gone through most of pure sun farm strains now this one was packaged on july 7th so super fresh sitting at this batch is sitting at 18.7 thc headband is bred by crossing og kush and sour diesel headband is unique to ontario before making its way out to the west the buds are said to be dense and covered in a blanket of sticky trichomes headband is said to have flavors of nutmeg and coriander heres on farms is grown in the fraser valley with 175 years of combined cultivation experience previous to cannabis they had been growing produce in the greenhouses for 25 years mother plants are carefully selected and checked up on every morning at 4 00 am here sun farms uses an app-based monitoring system so they can indulge in their plants 24 7. and they also created a proprietary food blend to bring out the best in their plants if you're looking to invest into your sun farms they're under the parent company village farms international inc which we'll have on the screen all right so let's have a look at this guy here i think they changed the packaging for grams which is cool it's nice little bag [Music] hey everyone after testing out the um headband by pure sun farms uh i was really impressed with that actually um you guys are doing really well um when you're getting it fresh from these guys it's it's got a really good taste so it had a really good burn on it it was really smooth the ash was nice and white like i said i had a good taste and the effects were good so i'm going to bring this one in 8.7 out of 10. until next time guys", "lvKTEvdWClo": "greeting everybody can i medication here today we're gonna show you how to control trip rights fritz and it could also control other bugs like spider mite and many others so what we're gonna do we're going to spray the plants with a mix of neem oil which is actually no chemical its chemical free pesticides it's a natural pesticide coming from a plant and then three what a great thing to extract the oil out of it so it's natural product has a max which is really good also and has a max have some neem oil the base of it has a max is named oil plus other product but again it is biologically it's not actually chemical so it's natural from a plant so you could use this to control your infestation of mites or trips or whatever now what you have to do you have to use this more than once you have to use this for at least I recommend for time every three to four day not more than four days it could be on the third day about more than four days so every three or four days you're gonna spray your plant with this for about four to five times so two weeks two weeks and a half you could go up to the time where you slip your plants to flower and at that point you shouldn't have any bug left alive there unless you're having animal going in your room and stuff like that but as a preventive measure you could use this to prevent bugs infestation or to control existing bugs like in this in this garden here what we're gonna what we have its turrets so we have to get rid of them so what I'm mixing the way I'm mixing it I'm using nem Hoyle and I use two tablespoon of neem oil and 2 tablespoon of as a max so what I do I take a for a 2-liter bottle I quit warm warm water in it so make sure you put warm water the reason why neem oil is a home base and it's hard to mix with water so if you put warm water it will actually dissolve a bit better now don't put it too cold to hot to kill your plant but warm should be alright not too warm and on top of this I'm gonna had I usually had two tablespoon again of any detergent dishwasher detergent that you have dishwasher not dishwasher but just washing yeah to wash your dishes you're gonna take two tablespoon of this too you're gonna mix this with those all together so I had two liter first then I dropped my stuff that I used in the morale as a max and the dish wash into the spray bottle and then I had my second 2-liter and I only had my idea max dishwashing and you're gonna mix this in one gallon of water or four liter of water warm water after this you're gonna close this and shake it very very very very good because it's hard to mix again with the water and keep shaking in between when you spray the plant just keep shaking it to make sure that it doesn't stay on the bottom and spray your plant heavily everywhere everywhere under the leaves on the stem on the ground around the plant on the ground and make sure your lights are off put your light off and leave your right light have for at least two to three hours so the plant has time to dry put the fan on so the fans go around and circulate the air on top of the plants and make sure that your lights are off so as you can see here we already set the light off and I only have that little light that is on here we transplanted it about three four days ago they seem to like it actually they start to pick up back again but that treatment for bugs gonna help them because bugs could slow down your growth it could actually kill your plant so you want to make sure you take care of that and you're gonna spray everywhere on the plan under on the ground everywhere every three to four days so keep on watching people I'll have more video coming up of the full garden in full grow and I will show you the every week I'm gonna show you what's going on with this garden here it's the 818 ed man we've got 16 of them under 4000 watt garden so it's gonna be a real exciting Road and today we're gonna treat them for bugs in this case here trite threats but you probably have other time some time so it's good for all the bugs alright so keep on watching subscribe if you like what you see and share with your friends and don't

is that you can't really see every part of your point you can't really inspect it every time you look and you know I found a little bit of powdery mildew in some of the center leaves and when I pulled the whole plan out the whole back area back there you know it was [ __ ] everywhere and it was slowly creeping to the top so I I pulled it out the whole plant stripped it a bunch of leaves which is why it looks so naked now stripped out a bunch of leaves and I hit it with um it was a one part milk regular ordinary organic milk and nine parts water and just bombed the thing with it that's why you see it's white stuff it's you know just milk residue and so I did that and then I you know went over it with some regular water and just took off as many leaves that I saw that were infested and I ordered a fan and it looks like I took care of it because I don't see any more popping up anywhere no I still do my cleaning with the water to make sure I'm still trying to clean off some of this milk residue but um yes that's why it looks different cuz I want to put it back out of rotate it and then trying to put a scrub back on a plant it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] but you know the puesto is healthy and it's still producing at a good rate and I'm good just to hold still so I feel like I caught it right in time before it became a disaster so you know I was doing so good it was such a [ __ ] good perfect role you know my my setup my my canopy was nice and then all that [ __ ] had to happen so that's what I get for not having a you know circulating fan so lesson learned always have a fan guys or else your [ __ ] run into issues but now I feel like I've taken care of it like I said I'm I check on it every day but um it seems to be all taken care of and the bugs are producing [ __ ] nicely they finally you know starting to put on that frost so yeah these are at week five let me chop the fan fill over there all right so you can so all the colors that were on this side ended up on this side so that's custom what you see right here just all right there so we're all you know we're producing nicely yeah it was a [ __ ] taking off the scrog and then having to put it back on there you know it's just this [ __ ] was a nightmare but I'm glad I caught it when I caught it cuz see I guys it's all I got for you guys week five until next week peace", "1SLdPggT4Go": "Southwest grogger at

holistic health sabine holistic health is a non-profit that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs we believe that all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it medical cannabis is a safe effective medicine that patients struggle to afford today i'm discussing three medical marijuana strains in depth and indica sativa and hybrid agent orange g13 and headband these are all very well known strains that are high in thc but produce different effects for the user i'll talk about some common conditions that they can treat and the effects that they usually produce so let's look at these strains it is important to note that as i discussed these strains today that these are the effects and conditions that patients have felt and had success in treating the effects of any one strain could vary by the individual user the cannabinoids and terpenes in a strain can also treat a wide range of symptoms not only the ones i describe these are just symptoms and conditions that patients have reported effectiveness for with each strain as a medical marijuana patient it is important that to find your most effective medicine you are familiar with strain types thc and cbd ratios and the cannabinoids and terpenes in medical marijuana and their medical uses you can find a complete downloadable chart of the cannabinoids and terpenes and their medical uses using the link in the description you can also find more resources on thc and cbd ratios as well as strain types using the other links all of these factors are considerations when finding your most effective medical strain the strains i discussed today are all high in thc and would produce a high unlike strains with equal or higher percentages of cbd which are mostly non-intoxicating it should be noted that thc is not bad and the high is not dangerous thc is extremely medically active and needed to treat many conditions high cbd strains are also excellent for medical users as a non-intoxicating way to use cannabis while they are growing in variety there is a much larger variety of high thc strains the first strain headband is a sativa strain headband is related to two other very famous sativa strains og kush and sour diesel similar to other sativa strains it is known for energizing effects that promote focus and being social and best for daytime use headband has twenty percent thc and less than one percent cbd making this a twenty to one thc to cbd ratio that would produce euphoric effects in the form of a cerebral mind high associated with many sativa strains headband has a strong citrus taste and smell patients reported is effective in treating shingles pain depression stress attention deficit disorder anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder the cannabinoids and terpenes and headband could treat other conditions as well but these are reported as effective by patients cannabinoids and terpenes will treat the same symptoms in different strains either with increased energy in a sativa relaxation in an indica or more of a balance in hybrid strains being a pure sativa strain headband is uplifting and will best relieve symptoms during the day or when you need to be active the next strain is fairly opposite of headband g13 is an indica strain that is known to be extremely relaxing and sedative this strain has a mythical story or legend behind it if you will g13 stands for government indica number 13. the rumor or legend is that g13 was developed by the u.s government from the best strains in the world in the 1960s at a secret location in mississippi the government's marijuana farm is in mississippi but that doesn't necessarily mean there is any truth to this story however the genetic history of g13 is not known similar to other indiga strains it is known to be relaxing and sedative but g13 packs an extra sedative punch and produces deep body relaxation some say it induces sleep and others just say it is deeply relaxing g13 has a minty spicy and sweet taste and smell it contains twenty percent thc and less than one percent cbd which will definitely produce euphoric feelings g13 can treat many conditions especially those that need deep body relaxation but patients report it effective for insomnia post-traumatic stress disorder pain depression sleep disorders muscle spasms eating disorders nausea a lack of appetite arthritis stress and anxiety the last strain agent orange is a sativa dominant hybrid like many sativa dominant hybrids it is an energizing strain with calming tones agent orange supports a positive mood focus and creativity it tastes citrus and sweet like spicy oranges where it gets its name some say it is the best tasting strain agent orange has nineteen percent thc and less than one percent cbd it will produce euphoria or a high with this 19 to one thc to cbd ratio agent orange is associated with a cerebral high that is energizing and produces happy feelings with body relaxation if you find pure sativas too intense in terms of energy this sativa dominant hybrid combines the relaxed tones of an indica and would be a good choice patients report that agent orange is effective in treating fatigue depression headaches stress nausea and post-traumatic stress disorder again these are only those reported agent orange and its cannabinoids and terpenes could treat a much wider range of conditions effectively this can give you an idea of the effects strains of similar types and with similar thc and cbd ratios would produce always look at the individual cannabinoid and terpene profile of a strain medical marijuana patients should carefully consider the thc and cbd ratios strain types and other cannabinoids and terpenes needed to treat their conditions no matter what method you are using medical marijuana still medical marijuana treatment is patient directed due to restrictive marijuana laws and a lack of clinical trials it may take some trial and error to find your best medical strain medical marijuana patient logs can help you keep track of the strains that you've tried and how they affected your symptoms they provide a measurable way to show how medical marijuana

channel herbs hothouse where the only herbs you see are the ones in the pots today I have an excellent video plan for you all about the harvest results from the blueberry headband run but before we do don't forget to give this channel a like it lets me know that you like the content and if you want to help grow this community don't forget to subscribe to this channel Eliz take a look at those sugary buds [Music] these plans have been on a journey they were germinated freshly from seed they returned to mothers and then they were put over to the flower stage to give these amazing harvest results but if you want to get these plants for yourself they are courtesy of the humble seed organization what you can expect from the 70% etiqa and 30% Eva is a strong euphoric head high as a settle floral almost fruity smell to it is great for a day smoke turns a quantity each of these plans yielded 3 ounces each after being fully dried when it comes to growing these plants the Red Bull termini there were 10 weeks and in vegetative and 10 weeks in the flowering stage growing indoors they were under 3000 watt full-spectrum LED light and grew about 5 feet tall [Music] when it came time to cure these place we humph hold the whole entire branches with only cutting off the large fan leaves [Music] fully cure these plans we can expect is anywhere from ten to twelve days an additional drawing might be needed on a drying rack [Music] what was shocking with this train what's exactly how resonate was for that I would definitely recommend wear gloves when trimming these plans I highly recommend this train for those looking for a light end to go but without the heavy burnout at the end of the day this is also great for those who don't like a pungent taste but I'm gonna let you be the judge of that leave me a comment below what you think about my harvest results for the blueberry headband strain that's all for today's video I'll see you guys on the next one bye", "dfZv4yqfbzQ": "what's up YouTube Fatima tubes here been a while since I posted video one show everybody what's going on in the tent kind of crowded kind of crowded here's bag emic dukes general hydroponics eight one eight he's running the flora series per the lucas formula micro in the bloom as a base but he's also using floral Isha's plus rapid start and the liquid-cooled bloom and then when it comes time he'll be finishing her off in flower with the dry cool bloom might grab some other general hydroponics additives as well maybe the nectar but not a flavored one like the sugarcane or whatever he's also used some of the great white i use the great white i also use the roots accelerators so it's not really a ang eight showdown per se because you couldn't really say that because we're both using a couple different supplements but it'll still be an interesting will showdown to see what does what so here's the dutch blue auto number two dutch blue auto number one see the size that top over there to that one these are on like day fifty it's like an eighty five day auto flower so that one seems to be on track this one seemed i don't know unless it might go a little bit further we'll see we'll be checking try Chrome's and all that but both of those are going to go for hash anyways let's go ahead and move this one out of the way for a second it's when people out fatties purple rex hi I'm pretty shits Fino number one right here look how this lady's stacking up each of these little plants have been super crop once and top ones as you can see two shoots thrown out the top this is the number two a little bit more stretchy but not bad at all either one of these could end up being my purple skittle Espino or they couldn't who knows but they look pretty damn close to the structure and everything this is Fino number three which is way more trainwreck dominant in my my eyes you guys see how skinny that those get they're not recovering from the top and quite as fast as the other two but doing okay that's the strawberry diesel I fed them just straight P at all these these three four plants all pH water last night because I'd seen that and it went away and I come back today and it's back there again so I do new we shall see but look how much of a stretch of that one is dude like if I'm not you know I'm have to flower that soon I got a feeling that's going to put the stretch on quite a bit and then here's manatees eight one eight four the grow off I'm using bruise accelerator and great white one other and a couple hundred humble counties own additives like the purple max

tapping into a strain that is very well known for the type of high that it delivers just based off of its name we've got grails 3.5 gram of headband i'm really curious to see how the strain and version of the strain hells holds up not hails up holds up in comparison to the last time i tried it from a different lp so let's hope grail does a good job you guys let's get into this and i'll see on the other side of the intro when we're actually getting this review on its way cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into grails version of the headband strain i'm really excited to try this out i have tried the strain once before from the legal market i really enjoyed it the high was quite unique and i wasn't something that i was expecting to begin with but the way we experienced it as we smoked our way through i found it quite enjoyable come the end so i'm thinking uh this one's hopefully gonna be sending us the same way you guys so i've got the lift and co website pulled up we're gonna rattle off a little bit of information off of the container before we go on into the full review you guys so this uh 3.5 came in right around that 45 to 50 dollar mark at the shop that i picked it up in so it's on around the average side of the higher grades of cannabis because at ten dollars a gram is right around where you get the mids and anything upper echelon or higher is where you start looking at that roughly 15 a gram range which is when you're looking at about that 50 per container so grail put out a really good looking container i'm really excited to see how it does you guys let's get the information off here before we use the lift and go website and then we'll get to smoking it so this sativa came in with a thc total of 23.2 percent and a cbd total of 0.0 actually not 0.03 just 0.3 it was packaged on may 21st 2020. so it is a little bit older with the package date but i think there's a humidity pack in here from what i can hear i'm not 100 sure so we may end up having some some dryer bud from uh grail so on the lift and co website there isn't any written information for this strain so we're just going to go into the effects felt and the activities that it is used for before we go on into the full urban scale side of the review you guys so top four effects that are felt when smoking headband are going to be happy calming energetic and creative the top four activities that is typically used for are going to be socializing watching tv playing video games and listening to music top method consumption is via the joint and it's got a piney earthy and citrus experience you guys so we've got everything ready and uh rattled off let's get into the full review i'll see on the other side when uh we get the urban scale intro through y'all let's get into looking aroma when we're done that intro cheers welcome back guys let's crack into this container and see how grail did with this headband string so there is a humidity pack in here tossed oh while i did that it is on the drier side but the buds themselves aren't we're gonna actually move this integra boost pack that i had in uh another container into this one okay so ooh that is not something i was expecting i'm not getting any citrus tone to begin with i'm just gonna tell you that right off the bat no citrus whatsoever i do get hints of a pine in there and a really kind of spice rocks spice rack blend it's a really hearty hearty smell to this button i'm i'm quite impressed with how well the uh the smell actually carried through but it's not the strongest smelling butt i've ever come across so now when we're looking at the actual nugs themselves they are really dark colors decent density good crystal coating all the way through it's actually overall a really nice looking bud when you stick it up close you get a little bit more of that pine experience but nothing nothing really overwhelming i'm going to give this an 8 out of a 10 for the look and aroma because i am interested in seeing how this bud is going to do for the flavor if it's going to push more of that piney or more of that kind of musky muggy smell that i'm getting hints of that tend to complement that kind of piney flavor for me at least quite well so now we're gonna bust some of this up we're gonna get packed up in our three rigs we've got a vaporizer to pack up a joint we got uh quite a bit of smoking to do for the rest of this review you guys so uh i'm gonna bust these nugs up and get that ready and i'll see you guys on the other side when we are actually ready to go cheers y'all and uh let's hope this bud tastes as good as it looks see on the other side cheers hell so we've got the boundless vaporizer here packed up and ready to go we're going to start out at 175 degrees celsius we're going to start out at that range because that's going to give us a first little taster of the lemonade and marisoline ter after that we bump it up to 205. that's going to give us the majority of the rest of the terpenes that this butt has to offer it's going to get more into that muggy earthy chocolaty cheesy that very rich toned and flavored based um experience then we bump it up to 220. 220 is going to give us the beta-carothylene and thc highest level of dump so we're gonna get a very peppery very woody kind of experience and we're gonna feel the most of the high that there is to offer at that 220. this one's ready at the 175. let's rattle this off and uh see how this bud does through the vaporizer guys cheers and i'll see on the other side when uh well i don't even know what i say i'll see you on the other side because we're gonna be talking our way through it so that's going to give us a really lemon and mango taste really fruity sweet taste with that citric citric kind of dump and i'm getting that i'm getting a really nice light kind of citronella experience to this we bump up to the 205 range now because that's going to give us the biggest dump of terpenes available for their boiling point so this is going to give us a lot more of that muggy earthy kind of foresty forested experience those cushy tones a lot of the other terpenes start to come into play at the 205 range so this ends up getting like a vegetable soup kind of mix with a woody undertone kind of that sweet tomato into that wow wasn't expecting that after 205 you guys we bump up to the 220 because that's going to give us that very peppery based off of the betas carefully and the heaviest thc dump as well let's do that right now let's see what happens we bump up to 220. really woody really almost kind of cushy tones i was founding finding at that 205 really kind of that dense wooded moist flavor with that hint of pine and really light citrus kind of touch we're at that 220 let's try it out and see how it does guys so it goes with more of that woody light pepper undertone but still well balanced it's not overpowering and overall it was kind of a nice light experience all the way through i think i'll only give it an 8 out of 10 just because it had some points in there that were really nice like that mid-range was probably my most enjoyable part of it and it was primarily because it had that cushy kind of push and lately i've been loving that that cushy that really heavy dense cushy kind of flavor you guys so i'm quite curious to see how that flavors are gonna be represented in the bongs and through the pipe and the joint as well but the only way we're gonna find out about that you guys is by actually tapping in and finding out we've got three bongs packed up and ready to go we're gonna move on into that side of the review now the way we light our bongs is the first one gets lit with some straight hemp wick the second one we go with a clipper lighter and the third one we've got this bundle of jet lighters but we go with a jet liner this allows us to really taste all of the different flavors and presentations that this bud has so i'm really curious to see how it does i'm hoping for more of that citrus almost wooded kind of flavor because it's definitely what i found the most enjoyable through there because it had the most kind of cushy push the only way we are going to really find out how it tastes you guys is by sparking these bowls up smoking them and finding out so let's get to that get into it and uh cheers let's get smoking this headband by grill y'all i'll see you on the other side of these three bowls when we're back with the skull i'll shoot y'all cheers hey y'all so i'm going to taste from a bong an 8 out of a 10. it really wasn't overwhelming with the flavor but it was a relatively smooth smoke for how old the buds are and i think the terps might have just started to degrade a little bit not really give us the full possibility of the flavor what i was able to pull through that kind of piney a little bit of a sweet um cushy tone in there as well really really well balanced tasting bud um it just it i think it'd be better fresh honestly i really do and i'm really intrigued to try the bigger nugs out of that container to see if they hold any more flavor but still it's not a bad tasting bud i just wish there was more and that's really where i why i'm knocking those points off is i wish there was just a little bit richer of a flavor more intense of each of the individual flavors but other than that a good smooth smoke definitely something i would recommend for somebody who likes that kind of woody cushy tone but looking for more of a sativa base so we're gonna move on into the pipe we've got a beautifully fresh clean crave straight pipe here look at the glisten on here even underneath his clean so we're going to light this up we're going to see how it tastes through here before we move on into the joint you guys what can i say i am already feeling the high from this at the 23 this bud is doing great but you got a little while to wait before we uh start talking about that so uh let's get to the pipe y'all hope you guys are enjoying the review so far i know i definitely am cheers and i'll see you guys on the other side hey guys so i'm gonna give the taste from a pipe a seven out of a ten it has a decent flavor to it it just isn't something that strong and that's really why it's meh right it has kind of that cushy tone that i was finding in the bong but just really really subtle it didn't have and i i honestly think it's the intensity and the amount of smoke is going to affect the flavor for this strain more than anything and that is mainly because of how dry the buds are and how old the dry buds are that's what i'm thinking at least um but still it had that kind of hint at that cushy tone but it wouldn't stay any longer than it's sitting on your tongue which is a huge disappointment for me um i definitely wish it would sit and stay quite a bit longer but just didn't didn't do that for me so that's why it's only getting the 7 out of 10. it's enjoyable but me right now we've got the elements paper rolled joint right here of uh this headband from graham we are almost all the way through this i don't know why i'm gonna light the paper first let's take the dry hauls we're almost done this review so uh we're gonna be smoking the uh soul joint on it let's try it out you guys cheers wow i don't know why but lately i've been getting really strong kind of spiced licorice licorice-y kind of tones through the joints more when i'm doing these dry halls it's got a sweetness to it too but it's still that really rich kind of licorice base that i'm getting that i don't know i've been enjoying lately so uh let's spark this up i'll see you guys when we're about halfway through cheers hey guys so nine out of 10 is what i'm gonna give the joint it's subtle like the pipe is but in a different way you get a really nice even distribution of the flavors but they're really light but they balance off one another really well so you get that kind of sweet piney like really light like almost minty kind of pine um flavor and then it shifts over into kind of a dominant woody like burning woody almost campfire like really hardy um smoke flavor oh push that too far between my fingers couldn't get it with my lips it's a nice shift between the two and it really develops quite well you guys so 9 out of 10 for this because it's it the all of the flavors are quite subtle to like if you look at them individually but when they work together and they kind of shift like that it's a very nice cohesive unit at a taste really really enjoyable but i'm not a huge flavor change person so nines are usually the best it's gonna get and it did really really well now going into the high holy [ __ ] 10 out of 10 without thinking about it i i have to give it a 10 out of 10 you guys for me um this is almost a pure head high for me i'm getting very light um uplift in my body but i'm i don't know if it's a body high or a just a really dominant head high it's true to its name where the headband wrap is the dominant place like def where my tooth is from boat let's make it a little fatter about there all the way around my head all the way down to the base up above my eyes it doesn't sit at my eyes or behind them it sits up here very frontal lobe and then down along my ears down into the base like crazy how it wraps around there and then the ski that kind of the skull cap there's not much there but i don't typically get very strong highs there unless it's like a base kind of a higher and anybody who smokes a lot of head-based sativas or even just head-based um strains you know what i'm talking about if not take it lightly this would be a really good strain to introduce you because it's a whole head wrap versus like a frontal back i find these ones are less likely to give me headaches because it's an entire brain um but like my entire head is involved where instead of just right here then that kind of transitions into a headache for my i find for myself but very very energetic very encouraging but major mental drift if you are not careful with it especially at this 23 if anybody is new and trying this out take it lightly take it very lightly it is a torquey strain it hits me hard it's been a while since i've had a sativa that's just rocked and be a very clear-headed high but if you want to drift off and go to uh go to neverland it's it's not impossible with this strain so 10 out of 10 is absolutely easily the score for the taste from or not taste from joy but the high you guys so i'll be right back when i finish this joint and have the overall scored up cheers okay guys 50 out of 60 is how this butt is gonna end up doing and that is incredible i am so surprised at how well this butt ended up doing in the end um it was a little bit dry in the beginning with being a may package date which is a little bit disappointing i'd be interested in trying this bud fresh because i could only imagine the type of flavors and honestly the stickiness that come out of there they seem like dense little nugs so i could probably press some decent rosin out of that um and any of my larger quantities flower i'm getting a little bit more into uh starting to press some rods and once the home grow gets going full set you guys will start pressing some rosin too and doing a lot more videos like that because i love doing the rosin videos but for the time being we're gonna wrap this sucker up 50 out of 60 that's this bud did really really well um case from a vape did 8 out of 10 just subtle but enjoyable um taste from bong did really well it was edging a nine but i wish it had more flavor i really do and if it did then um like more intensity more it like a more intimate flavor i definitely think it would have done quite a bit better the pipe it was just the same thing from the bottom but a little bit less um and the joint it did incredibly well through the joint and then into the high and i am feeling the end side of that joint kick in you guys so uh let's wrap this sucker up i hope you guys enjoyed if you guys are checking this out on youtube and cart is going to slide in up in the corner is going to be my logo hover over that and click that bell notifications until anytime one of my videos go live down in the corners those will be two videos for you to go check out one will be the most recently uploaded and the other

stay tuned because we got some brotherly podcasts coming to you this weekend cheers [Music] bye you", "UGN3LRxkxPM": "so this is the second day got these plants game a little bit of water yesterday as soon as I got them back they're all true be still this one's doing alright it's alright it stopped looks all right then listen looks like it's beat to hell so it's all this one now when are they tell us that what's the shortest but starting over again we got 2707 headbands 38 18 advanced and when Martin's made great it is October 21st 2016", "Dngw9enklmk": "oh gee deliveries presents the unpackaging of 707 it is a hybrid on our top shelf the strain emerge from the bay area of California and that areas telephone area code is the source of this in America moniker it's a cross between Sour Diesel and OG Kush and Master Kush 7:07 headband plants flower 9 to 11 weeks and usually have large yields in the codominant hybrid this strain is known for in high THC levels and can be strong but it's balanced enough to leave most users feeling heady and creative rather than sleepy because of this it's often used to treat tension and anxiety hope you enjoyed our overview of 707 headband please visit us at poaching delivery story", "iR8lfqrHuN0": "[Music] hey what's going on guys got some purple headband for you today another solid indica from Doc and Yeti and like I stated in my previous video this is probably the most purp I've ever seen in rep I have had some bud in the past that was didn't have quite as many orange hairs on it but this is definitely the frosty is purplish cannabis I've seen and it's just absolutely amazing when I cracked it open it was honestly like pure sugar I didn't really get like an earthy kick to it maybe a tiny but if you search for it but honestly it was like sugar like a sugar cookie or something not not really quite like a bakery but like sugar it was very sweet um I was excited to pick this up to just because like I had stated before docking Eddie I think is the best farm in Washington State when it comes to quality cannabis everything that they grow and produce is on point I've never had a problem with any of it they don't list any pesticides and I'm not sure if they do I think by the look of it taking a best judgment I think they use a few of them but it's not listed so don't quote me on it no it's here just crack it open here then you can see - from the inside purple is not just on the outside it goes deep it's all throughout all purple and it's all orange to them crazy orange hairs just all over is what I'm gonna excuse me but it's very frosty this goes for 12 bucks a gram 40 for an eighth or seventy-five for a quarter and I will pay that all day long for this cannabis this is just amazing like I stated in my other video they just won excuse me dope cup for best indica best ateva the Brandywine my video I had earlier was the indica and the redheaded stranger which I haven't done yet is the sativa and that was all Willie Nelson's old cannabis that was his genetics before he auctioned it off to do the willies wonder era excuse me to do the willies reserved sorry I'm like our he's awesome just really excited and getting like in a trance here looking at this stuff but he had the willies wonder genetics and the oxygen did often it stuck with this and this is the only actual solid purple headband that I could find that I've ever had honestly excuse me but um yeah this is honestly like Barney purple this is straight purple purp I'm gonna grind it up here see what zoom in on here or yeah you guys didn't get a close-up let me see what it smells like honestly after its thank you guys for bearing with me but yeah you can definitely see the green mixed in there too when you get the purple but it's beautiful very nice very light light green if that but very very dark purple super dark you can tell it's gonna be a good indica now the web says that this is more of a 50/50 but I don't think it is I think it's more of a 70/30 indica I it says that it's cross with Master Kush but I believe this one's brand daddy purple and headband so you got the granddaddy and then the Sour Diesel no G Kush which would should be a Prettyish nice cerebral up staying with a body relaxation the purple headband that I have right here is nineteen point two seven total cannabinoids and the THC is only eighteen point eight six but that don't mean anything I know it's gonna get me just as stoned as some of the other cannabis let's go ahead and do some bong rip you guys yeah super excited to grab this just because there's only been in a certain amount of times that I've actually come across strains that are actually this solid purple and it's nice because you know it's just confident when it you get a really nice purp string instead of just something that's called purple kush or purple or Cola that it doesn't have any purple in it whatsoever so when you get the name and the color it's pretty awesome but you know it was just um it was just sugar for me on this smell honestly like a sugar cookie without that not so much bakery it did have a long earthy kick to it as far as the soil but nothing too overpowering I'll go ahead and try not to taste let's see what we got as far as taste let's do some ribs here thank you guys so much for watching my videos it is very sweet it's like candy like sugar candy it does kind of have that a chem dog sour nice aroma to it you can definitely tell there's headband in there but I am getting more of like a sugar earthy kick to it honestly which is nice it's not super super potent but it's definitely there I like it it's very nice very nice sweet indica hmm oh yeah the flavor adjustment definitely stays there too one thing I noticed about this iPod the purple headband one other time a couple months ago when docking it he had a brought in their flower this was one of their brand new ones when y'all got a sample it and it was super super harsh they had a blueberry cush to that I hope to get back but one thing that I noticed with a lot of their strains just a couple months ago is harshness and flavor it's not nearly as harsh whatsoever you take greens purples whatever it is from the balm first pay and it's gif throat's on fire it's not smooth whatsoever but so what I've seen honestly from come from them just in the last couple months is honestly whatever they're doing is working as far as the harshness and I'm getting a lot more flavor out of this so I'm wondering if maybe they're using just a different soil or if there's just something small that their their fixed-up it definitely is really good good I've had a lot of talking Yeti and this is honestly one of the best factions of balcony that I've had I can tell just from like the Brandywine that I had on the Buffalo Bill this straining that I'm going to be doing some redheaded stranger for you guys as well not really not feeling really feeling it all too much yet um the third hit there definitely has like a sweet berry flavor to it it's honestly there it just as much as the first hit was but it's just kind of a different flavors that are just like a earthy sugar it's more of a sweet berry so I'm probably getting honestly more that soil yeah that's nice I definitely am starting to feel more of like a lifting relaxation I feel I feel pressure got foamy behind my eyes and in my temples I can feel the cerebral buzz which the thought of me being able to line up my words and speak more fluid and fluently it's definitely the headband feeling but I am feeling more uplifted and relaxed too so I can definitely feel the indica side to it I can feel it like in my shoulders and honestly started as like a wave is going over my body and I'm just feeling really really relaxed now I feel really nice honestly a bowl of this will honestly go pretty far I filled up just a couple mugs and I still got some here in the grinder and I got some pretty decent rips off of that so that's what's nice dude you know like just burn through it super quick it's definitely got the density to it Ron it's crazy to just looking on it if you guys ever get a chance to check it out I'll try and get the close-up as much as I could I'm just on the beginning but man this is definitely just the Magus definition of magazine height I'm bud right here if you could look at this under a magnifying glass to scream at you everything that you want and I look at a bud and I think of a bud and this is honestly what I think this is magnificent I give it a 10 out of 10 as far as looks I wants to give it a pretty nice rating - I like a 9 out of 10 and that's honestly only because what gets a 10 out of 10 I don't really have anything against this it had a really nice up come I can feel it I know it's still probably just beginning but man it's just got a really really nice II fork uplift to it and you can already tell it's gonna help me just relax and chill and get much out - especially if you have any problems eating already probably sleeping this would be a very nice strain for you especially if you like that mental had changed to go along with it if you if you like prefer stick with more like the 9 pound hammer type or the Deathstar if you want us to complete knockout but if you need help that body relaxation and you still lack the mental change purple headbands you guys need to check this out the [ __ ] is bomb but uh yeah I just want to thank you guys again I thank you every time for just liking my videos I'm gonna be continuing to pump it out and I'll be pumping out as more strains as I possibly can I know I've said it a million times and I thank you for bearing with me I'm just trying to set up and get a nice oil rig so I can be with oil reviews but I just hope you guys all have a blessed day if you like this please give it a thumbs up I want to thank you for watching subscribe to my channel if you like purple headband is killer it's got me feeling really good you guys need to check it out it is clonic thank you guys you guys have a blessed day", "D2O1vqjfiO0": "hey this bill for Sparky Channel and this is a Klein cooling towel and it's made so that it stays about thirty degrees cooler than your body temperature and Klein must think that this is going to be a hot summer because they just came out with five of these different kind of products what you do you just don't come in water and bring them out a little bit for them around your neck and you can you know reuse them and you can wash them and it comes in a nice container with a carabiner so that's one of the five products the second of the five products you know just dunk it okay this is a smaller towel it's a mesh towel you put it around your neck and it's

really does cool you down okay and the last one is a do-rag so you get it wet and you take it and it's a lot like the the helmet liner but it's a do-rag it it ties in the back so those are your five cooling products from client I think my favorite one is actually that helmet liner it's really nice it's really where you want to be cool right on your head like that and a hot summer day that's a nice product I'll put links for all five of these product in my video description and I'll put links for the client hard hats to which are really good hard hats they have they're really comfortable

YouTube Matthew coming at you again with another video today and today we're gonna be doing a strain review I just got this strain we're gonna smoke a little bit of it and I'll tell you guys what I think the straining question is headband it is a nice indica dominant hybrid see 60% indica 40% sativa so it's that nice kind of body high but it also gets you that good it's a tea of effect as well we're going to take a rip out of it out of this bong here and get cut it right into the facts and stuff about the strengths the cheers guys all right hmm it's a good taste to it we'll get into that later though cuz I got a little spoon pipe as well I have don't think of you so is channel yet but I got my little spoon play-doh like I said I don't think I've used it in a video so I'm gonna bring them to a video so like you said it head bed is an indica dominant hybrid which mean it is sixty percent while in this case it is sixty percent indicated 40 percent sativa the parents of this plant are OG Kush if I can remember that oh gee cush and Sour Diesel and army I've never had OG Kush but I'm a huge fan of Sour Diesel I really love it it's one of my favorite strengths and right away I can tell you I taste a little bit of that which is awesome now it's got its name with I have a bit of note so don't forget to do stuff because I will totally forget we're gonna take another hit of this and get into a little bit more so Cheers oh and a little bit today back up my little cooler so I don't have that squeaky chair which it was a problem for me cool alright so headband gets its name it's kind of a weird name for a strain but does give its name from that sensation it gives you like a little bit of pressure around here and now I could say I'm already starting to feel that took two big hits there pop the bowl in two hits this is a decent sized bowl and I can say like it definitely has an effect right around here you feel a little bit of pressure it could be just as I'm wearing the Hat where I take this off and look at my messy-ass hair yeah I still feel that little pressure there so that's a cool effect above this and then it's got its name now as far as the THC levels of this coat um it has high THC levels so between 17 and 24 percent this is numbers have pulled off line I don't know this stuff so I'm looking at my notes here but yeah 17 to 24 percent THC and it's in some cases has exceeded that however was CBD it's really low it's zero point zero point five percent so it won't have this strain is better for ailments that or injuries or whatever that sativa or an indica will help or THC will help sorry not an indica as far as CBD goes marketing huge effects it does help a lot with pain anxiety which is something I live I live from this kind of of the high THC strain the anxiety thing health love for me it helps with migraines which I don't really get in winter become like spring when we get tux here thank you to leave now to DiCaprio for freaking out global warming because of the look that was a I was it really funny for someone whose native to Alberta so all I'm not native but who's lived here for most of his life I was getting back to the point it does help with pain anxiety migraines which did you get in the fall or the spring sorry with the schnooks nausea and as well as like I said anything that THC will help so it's like I had there's a huge list of stuff like that but it was all just generic stuff that THC pretty much helped and as well as sweet in general I keep it all for this bond but it so we're gonna take a I can already tell that it does kind of have like a spacey effect so this would be a perfect strain for like a rainy day kind of thing or you know you wake up you see it's [ __ ] snowed and you go for it like you just enjoy the day so we're going to take a little hit out of this pipe here it's a little glass pipe I will show it off it's a little dirty right now but this is actually the first pipe I ever bought these first smoking thing ever but I went I never started on joints like I said when I started on this little pipe and like I have a thumbnail for that video with the og smoke rook whatever that's I used to do wait till night it was dark no one could see me in the cold and had like two jackets on I'd go out there and smoke and this that little pipe I thought I was doing it with and that's what I mean there's only a year ago but like it seems like a while so we're gonna take you heard of this pipe here get they taste and get it to cheers guys got some stink Scooby Snacks no no no fun taste but aside from that I could taste the weed and it does have a really its sweet taste to it it's it smells really sweet as well but we're gonna get the smell but it does have a really sweet taste to it but it's also tangy so I don't know how to describe this like cuz it's sweet and tangy that's how you describe it but I don't know what it would be closed I know there's something it's close to know and I'll say lemon lemon it has a taste of lemon you can taste lemon with it as with any kind of cush hybrid I believe or cush pairing well you said the parents of this the parents of this are okay oh gee cushions Howie diesel so it's gonna have that sour taste anyways well that diesel II taste anyways but it will have it also has like a lemony kind of taste as well from the kosher side so it is kind of a really cool taste as far as smell goes it kind of smells awesome like it takes it smells sweet and it smells like that diesel you smell Thea Sour Diesel lemon and it like you again you smell the lemon and it's like really earthy we just got I think all we kind of smells earthy to me but it does have a really good smell so I really love that but it is very strong smell I keep in mind it is a very strong like you better have that [ __ ] in an airtight container wrapped in a bunch of [ __ ] and cut away if you're not if you're hiding it but like it's some good [ __ ] so we're going to get into this hit this finish this bowl off and we'll another video cheers guys alright guys so I as you saw I finished off that pipe there hopefully I'll kind of spend them put some music through that but overall I do give this string a 4 out of 5 percent it has a really good taste a really good it's really strong smell which to me I love I think a good good weed will have a like a great smell not the best for hiding but I mean that's what it is and late I'm really high from it and I'm enjoying this I love this so we're gonna end this video on again no 4.5 out of 5 like I said the taste it wasn't at the taste wasn't as strong as everything else but they're all super strong it was just like I really get straighten so I do recommend this to you guys hope you guys smoked along and got those effects nice and your were in there it's pleasure doing this this is my hot box graph piece don't forget to like it's good", "UVi_tBYizN0": "good morning everybody this is kena medication the morning medication so this is my homemade jar pipe vaporizer kind of thing usually i hook my q vaporizer on it when i use grass green buds but if i use concentrate like that i usually use the other one and as you can see that thing is i'm sure you can't see properly with this but this is a really good stuff this one here is 818 headband 73 my cog skywalker OG Skywalker this one is 73 micron also and we get some 18 headband again and this one is 45 micron and the this stuff is like almost like sugar it's so nice it's shiny clear honey looking pure trichome so yeah so anyway what are we going to do here we want to do a little dab on this which is my favorite little diverting oh yeah I could short by another one but hey i like my homemade thing and work very good for me so usually what I do here I put a couple daddle this each container I like to mix them together actually it gives a really really good effect you get exactly what you're looking for medicating with this thing it's kind of the body and mind together remove the pain make your stomach stop aching feeling lonely inside of you that goes away so anyway I put a couple spool of each here and I just move it around a little bit so let's write this they're my little doggy me every time she see a dog outside she goes there we go sorry that's what it is that's medicating in the morning and this stuff is very good nice taste to it very good for you guys actually concentrate is only basically shaking your leaves off of the plant and connecting the trichome off of it get them a different way of doing this you could only use dry sift which is screen to get them off you drive your plants and then you bounce them and shake them a bit on screen and while the trichome gets release and go through the screens different micron swing or you could do bubble hash basically taking your grass it could be fresh frozen or dried and you mix it with hi-c hi-c icy water and it separate the glands off the leaves and they go through different bags of screen micron and that's what you get at the end but i'll show you later how to do that so anyway folks have a great day keep medicating keep on watching we're going to have a lot of video coming up for you guys we're going to show the grow room we're going to show you a full growing from the beginning to the arvest it's going to be the 818 @ ban og cush and I can't wait to show

take the privilege we're not a privilege our right to grow medical marijuana as usual the government the most control everything and give that to their friends companies so they could have a little bit of return to going back to them and beyond in any way in Canada so far there's only like 20 licensed medical commercial drawer and it's been a year they are basically most of them are out of medication so you can't even order so yeah that's the mess we are in and Health Canada is taking forever to approve companies they even make it harder most of the company are approved now a lot of them are from united state taking over Canada again there's nothing wrong with the economy but the money's gotta stay in Canada and we have to try to get more company from Canada growing men medical marijuana proof and we've got to have more of them if they really want to use that Avenue to supply medical patient they gonna need quite a bit more than 20 so far over thousand application but only 20 that's a big Burke reci of the government you know what I mean and of course the security because you have to have a security check which is done by the RCMP so hey they don't like you or you're not on the list of or your suspect that has the suspect everybody well you won't get any license because you won't get your security clearance which is supposed to be a level 7 it was a level 5 in there raise that up to 7 don't know why but anyway it's pretty pretty crazy like the building could be secure in all of this but hey again in Canada it's the way they do business but anyway and then we coming we're going to show you how medical garden patient is growing his own medicine and why it is important to keep our license because not a lot of people can afford to spend thirty thousand

levels of this can get the twenty four percent so she gets a pretty high and she said average is like 17 so she's not she's a strong strain and from what I found out the genetics on this this is max the curse crossed with OG Kush cross with sour diesel and that is very similar to the platinum OG with platinum OG is master crisscross og cush cross with an unknown strain and this one same thing except on Australia's Sour Diesel and this is varied easily you can taste the diesel in restraint it's it has that gassiness in there it's earthy its pungent a little bit of citrus as well as tasting as well you know the XL is going to windows after they say man it takes a little bit of some kind of a citrus it's nice very pleasant Thank kind of a strength of puff on and I thought I'd met a good social smokers it is talkative you know you're it's upbeat it's uplifting you know it's not energetic but you are kind of like you know it's good you know it and if you don't have anything to do if you just sitting down the couch Gabi this stuff and you got some music playing you might find yourself couch locking you might find yourself in a spaced out and just kind of story an hour because it does have that potential but from what I found is if you've got stuff to do if there's things happening moving you know your lesser style likely to do to catch that crash what he's not that my experience but i I've meta came to this to us the data said yeah I thought that crash come in around the afternoon I came in I took it took a break I said a couch a sardine tiles real comfortable you know and I was like man I can just go to sleep right now as I I had too much stuff to do so I just got up came back together dab and I was like back in action man so yeah it's uh that crash might come but it's not nothing that's going to stick around and hound you down until you take a nap you can push right through it you know so if you ever get you sucking the couch lock with this you got stuff to do just get a ticket download acid you know put some music on because that kind of helps as well says the moon anyhow anyways there is a person is so hits run deep with this one hand I feel like this still smoking my lungs even have to excel in everything here we go headband 707 man defects can come pretty quick I'm ready for that blasted right now bad but feeling really really wonderful yeah but those hits man you can really feel up but still this is a nice train I love the taste I love the high pain relief is good you know I was just saying compared to the platinum OG because these two strains are very very similar I just feel like the euphoric high on this was slightly stronger and the pain relief just wasn't as much as the platinum OG anyways but still really really wonderful straight man and I would medicate with this thing to out the whole entire day except I don't know probably would be better in the afternoon but you could it's great for the morning man I'm sheesh man sorry about that i still like little ticklish defeat in my lungs anyhow um she's it's a link strain and um I would totally get this again and Ben said all I had been hey I forgave him talk straight man I should just end this video before I just keeps sitting here like damn this guy's been coughing for like two minutes long I kind of feel like they're still smoking my lungs right now I'm we were starting to sweat from these dabs but yeah she's anyways see if I might like two minutes of coughing I know wonderful story we're totally good it again head bad sale instead", "O7kqkrIENZg": "it's

pulled serious numbers from this phenome himself I'm using a much smaller light in a much smaller area he pulled big numbers like I got some I got some numbers to run here but yeah guys this is how it's going again we're doing it in the Coco we're gonna make sure everything's nice and flush and topped out we're gonna fix all these little burnt leave edges and that's it just want to let you guys

video this is a the next future grow comin soon I germinated these you saw that in that video where I explain how to take care of germination and seedlings and now as you can see they're they're beefing up so I'll give you a little overview this is a super sour OG I think this is from Emerald triangle it's cross of a Lost Coast og crossed with super cross with them talking it's Sour Diesel crossed with blueberry crossed with OG Kush crossed with Lost Coast OG which is lost oh gee Kush crossed with chem for this is a Cali connection chem 4 OG which is San Fernando Valley OG Kush crossed with Kem for this is a pretty solid one this is going to be a good one from what I understand and this one is uh one that I've never seen before actually seen the other two grown before I've seen reviews this is a new one this is something from DNA genetics called double-stuffed sherbert it's dosey doe cross with sorbet in dosey doe as you know or not is uh Carl Scout cookies crossed with face-off oh gee Kush as you can see my cubes are a little green but it doesn't matter there's nothing wrong with that if you really don't like it you just pick it off and I look at that it's clean under there but I never had an issue with it these all go in cocoa and I also want to show you guys real quick my cloning setup these are eight one eight clones from what I have downstairs I have this set as a bucket right here if you want to see pop it open maybe don't take me too long right you see the struggle is real all right well I guess we're not getting in there oh wait no we are you look in there you can see I am a homemade cloner setup that's the water right there with some roots accelerator in it pH to about five six have the 900 gallon per hour pump I built off this off eBay it's really simple I'll try to make a video about how to do it remember when closing it narrow cloner make sure you close it all the way otherwise when it turns on it sprays it's no good but these clones I just took the day they look pretty solid and I just want to give you guys a glimpse of what's in to come so sour super sour OG camphor OG and two double stuff sure birds and a bunch of eight one eight

at our stores in California and all over the world these are bangs on a headband they come in 10 different colors and Danielle my amazing daughter is going to show you how easy they are to put on they're flexible and they're very very comfortable so whether you have hair and you use them for travel or for a little extra bang remember they won't frizz so you can take them to the beach or anything just stretch the headband and put it on just like you're putting a headband on letting the hair graze and touch your eyebrows from there you have the choice of covering bangs on a headband with any turban as Danielle's going to show you or hat or scarf so all Danielle's doing is touching the top of her head and then grazing your hands around the back of the turban and just tucking your hair in but look how natural those bangs are and the biggest benefit for cancer patients is instead of standing out in a crowd with no hair wearing a turban just let these bangs on a headband add the illusion that you have a tickle of hair great Danielle will you run through the colors that we carry these and course so we call it we have these in ten great colors the lightest color is called creamy toffee it's a blend of a lighter blonde and a little darker gold blonde next we have chai cream which is just a little darker blonde a little deeper red and still the lighter blondes the third one we have is called Mochaccino it's a little more ash she has a little bit of a brown but still with the blonde our fourth color that we have is marble brown it's a light caramel brown with a little bit of a medium brown in it our next color we have is called ginger Brown it's a blended reddish-brown very very natural the next color that we have is called chestnut it's a great red color it works with all different if you're red this color will work for you it's a lighter red mixed with a little darker red the next color we have is a deep Brown called cappuccino it's great brown with like almost a little reddish hue to it our darkest Brown we have is called expresso it's almost like a soft black great if your hair is black or dark brown and then for our gray clients we have to Gray's the first one is called sandy silver this is a brownish grey great for if your hair is just a little bit grey or you just want to have a little grey for fun our last color is Silverstone it's a really light gray mixed with the white and it's beautiful beautiful brent blends and how can clients purchase bangs on a headband and young clients can purchase bangs on a headband by just calling us at

of that shiny [ __ ] that I have put these three big CFLs up here for now until I get that 250 put up I just needed to hurry up and get it done and I'm [ __ ] done for the night um forget what day it's on but it was just fed only five milliliters in the base and then I went full strength on all the additives except for Rhino skin Nirvana and ancient earth they got five milliliters of that everything else was eight milliliters the big bud the [ __ ] sentences I'm bud candy [ __ ] b-52 yeah and then there's some other things you know my other products are so sore Moltres what else I put in there i think that's it actually but yeah so that's that there needed to make room in the other box changing the style of growing I'm going to be I took 12 818 clones and gonna be flowering out in like one gallon containers let them veg for a little while and then you know maybe Topham once let them you know if I can recoup a little bit and then throw them in the flowering the one gallon containers and then have like 12 of them in flour and see what the yields like on that and that there that one that doesn't have a clone in it and that one there spitfire genetics it's the hooch which is plush berry crossed with Hera wanna so pop two of those just to see if I can find a female a decent female out of them um you know and then i'll probably i'm probably going to pop two more soon I just need to get more rockwool cubes so that's the 818 all heck the [ __ ] up no I mean really no heads on it left but I mean we got we got new stuff coming and I try it you know so should uh should be okay Chernobyl mother those are uh 2818 clones that we're already rooted they got transplanted a little late obviously you see that um use Chernobyl clones are doing really nice and I waited longer to do them they were sitting in there until today I just transplanted these today and they're doing a lot better than the other ones are so that's it for now guys [ __ ] my knees ah peace love unity respect spread it around no what the [ __ ] time it is TV soup", "SpCpMNLiBlE": "hello hello YouTube here we have see a headband from purple star collective purple star MD and as I always do I pick

and thoroughly medicated so let that being said let's examine this but um zooming in right now um we're gonna say looks very frosty I love to see the shimmers of the trichomes beautiful crystals I love to see all of that I like the dark like brown hairs a headband I believe is a sativa though so I would like it to see it looks very Foresti but I think since he was usually a little bit more brighter but it looks really good looks really good actually so let's uh this snug looks fantastic let's let's put on macro and see how it looks okay so here's our macro of it looks phenomenal oh yeah I love that oh yeah look at all that shimmer that right there is beautiful that how come I can zoom in oops excuse my oh yeah this looks really good super beautiful guys I love looking at macro tree

this should like what I mean they do they could be pigs being tracked by the pigs feet", "9X2feV0_ek0": "greeting everybody can of Education here just a little video to show you the I'm watering them right now every five days so that's what I use for water I give them exactly 40 seconds of water each represent about three gallon of water each plant i'm using a 200 litre barrel and it's taking the whole barrel exactly I got a little bit left at the end but and as you can see they are growing very very fast and what I like to do when I water them like to make sure that thing is high I'm just emptying the rest right now but I water high like this so it produce also oxygen at the same time I'm just finishing emptying the bucket right now it should be almost empty by now there we go the last couple drops and the watering is complete there you go we retain just floor to show you here shut off the pump put this here there you go give me a second unplug be there I'll show you a little bit the setup here in the second but let's unplug the home before now turn that light back on there you go okay so as you can see those are my containers water containers 200 litre each and they sit there for at least a week it's not over full of water I've got a heater that heat them to 65 degrees so it keeps I heat one as I get ready for the watering like a couple days before I get ready for the watering I heat up the water like this one I'm going to shut it down right now need that barrel for a long for another five days but my hose is connected to my pump which goes inside my bucket and so that's what I'm using as a pump simmer quarter quarter horse power and it produces enough water to fill that holes and you see the spray terror is pretty good too so that's what I use for watering so now let's get back here inside the room since the last video it's been a week as you can see Dad grown a lot they've been in flower for a week now they only ask actually starting to pop up flowers that strength take a bit longer to start but as you can see they're at their maximum height I didn't want them that high but that's what i get for now and you as you could see they're going to be even more bushy tomorrow because i just watered them they're gonna fill up with water overnight and tomorrow they'll be even bigger but right now as you can see they're all nice and the stem on there is pretty good size and those 10 gallon material bucket with hundred percent cocoa pure cocoa as you can see 16 of them in here and I'm going to put a phantom are well under also that gonna circulate more hair hunter and you could see that and started producing some hair hard to tell on that camp I've started to produce some hair here so they are starting to budding now as you can see the height is the max I could bring them I actually going to have to super prop them in the next couple days next days or so two days I'm going to super crop them because usually when you switch your plant to flower they still grow for about 21 days from the time you switch you'll be about almost three weeks in the flowering by the time they stop growing and this strand in particular stretch a lot in the last two weeks so the they are huge I'm going to have to move them closer in the middle here just a tiny bit and as you can see there is no other space in here and there's only 16 plan that's a 4000 watt room and the room is about 14 by 11 and it is like there's no space to play around here and like I say because they're just in the water they are going to be going to boost up a lot tomorrow now the trick with cocoa you can't let your plan dry out because if you let your plan dry out you'll have some issues with cocoa you have to keep your plant wet or not wet but not dry like you would do with her sometime up to the point where debris the Leafs are dropping and all the plants look like almost dead I did that before and hurt but in cocoa it doesn't give you that much of a play with it so I make sure that every 45 days in the flowering like right now I'm at five days in between watering and they like it I got no burn leaves yet from light but they are really close I could hold my hand here but yeah it's not there's a lot of fan circulating the air on top too to prevent this burning but I have two super crop them because they'll still grown for another week week and a half at least so I'm going to super crop them it's going to slow the growing a bit the Big Branch at least and the other smaller will do a bit more what it does also it it makes the plant stem that you've been stronger and it bypasses the metal channel to bring the water to the outside membrane and it makes the the buds way bigger because it sends a lot of energy to that branch to fix it and make it better so those buds are usually bigger when you super crop them it slows down a bit of the flowering cycle but not that much at the annual gain weight with the weight you're going to get and bigger bud more THC basically so if you extract it won't bigger plans you could get them bigger but you're going to get more th e going to extract if you do extracting water bubble lash or any kind of extraction you going to have more th of course it has to do also with the Strand that you're growing because some plant produce more THC sometimes produce less alright people was just an update to show you the watering session and that was the third watering into the flour time and we are at a week and two days after the flower session as began and they are doing very nice the leaves are perfect no burn tip it's just beautiful but I don't hit them like advanced Centurions recommande hate 400 milliliters per liter but 400 whatever they recommend i gue only tweak order of that like this time I give them six hundred milliliter of all the tree parts in 200 milliliter in 200 litre of water so 600 milliliter of each the three parts in 200 litre of water and I usually don't go more than 600 I don't go to hate hundred like if I follow their chart on the advanced nutrients you would have to hit them with 800 for the quantity that I water that I use what 600 is perfect if you hit them at hate and review it burns the tips planned that yet the tip burn means that she's getting too much nutrients and it is armful to the plant you don't want to traumatize the plant whatsoever less traumatize you give to your plant better it is so try not to traumatize your plant and leave it alone leave it to grow and over over Fred Lyta fertilizing is waste of money and your garden don't look that good here as you can see the garden look good it's not over water it's not over for life it's just perfect and they are not small so I must be doing something good all right people keep on

so the sights techs have been remounted into top lighting I have to mount the fan ship as you see in the back corner there's a fans in there that I've been too lazy to mount need to measure the pedo couple of new LEDs dominator 1800 watt selectable once which lights up this the middle and the second switch flights up the two outside columns so you have a high medium and large all right I got a couple of fans on the ground that I need to mount up there gotta cut that hole yet and put them in then I got some flex ducting that hopefully will help keep on my co2 in got a fan in the back there that is just a vertical fan it's where the side stack was just going to take out air from the top or possibly co2 and make sure that the room is the same temperature at the top that's the bottom I'm starting to get the wiring fixed in place where it's going to be going to hang it up a little bit so it's not touching anything on this side of the room adjacent to the cloner clone army on the left and on the right hand side this would be like the intermediate area I'm going to do the same thing put up a little framing and I'm going to put the other fluorescent light in there for now I'd like to have great debt to some LEDs in a later time it's a much better spectrum but we'll talk about that later my fish tank of course is right under it and underneath the cloner on the other side is my nutrient tank so all my chemical is going to lift on my fish and buffered water who went to the right and I'll take my clones out of here put them above the fish and I'll have an intermediate area so I got a little work to do on Mike Lohner yet as you see I'm a [ __ ] slob but I got all my tools and stuff over there still a mess high-velocity eight inch fan that I'm going to mount up in the top gear to cool off these lights I've got fresh brand new bulbs awesome name brand I won't say a brand to let dry mouth but I'm gonna have two thousand a lots of fresh bulbs here and then each one of these is 1800 watts there and then we're going to have another 2,000 watts with fresh bulbs over there I got a little bit of cleaning to do on my filters and my dehumidifiers you can see they're all nasty I got to clean my conditioning face to just sucks it all the dust but we're almost there this is going to be awesome and I'll tell you how fantastic this is my watering bucket back in 20 kids

tight in the compact nuggets various trichome development on the haul plant material surfaces smells like headband dominate at first but I saw lemon the OG smell it can be detected the og smell could

smell to it check this out here this is a gram you guys can see how well these nugs are check that out here very frosty if you can see the froth right there that's not Dwight pretty frosty I would say overall probably I mean this stuff is frosty kind of like Dom your fish snoops master i would say stuff is um on the field on the same level frostiness is that stuff easily and this stuff's only 45 a gram and stuff sticky look so hopefully the hike wiggle is managed to do it again we'll see here check this stuff out on this looks right at about I really do need to get a scale but uh yeah I would say our look I would say definitely a little above a gram I would say definitely not definitely a bug point definitely Bubba a gram I don't know how much I would say that is probably I'm this stuff pretty dense too i would say maybe 1.2 1.2 maybe definitely hooked up definitely hooked up you have to show you guys the bang so all right let's give this up a whirl here bud tender Tommy this stuff's pretty heavy one of the heavier 45 and because if they have so see if he's uh soubise right or not definitely you got your your OG Kush pull on no doubt about it clean Bowl here let's hope we don't

wrecker and they had some dream queen in there which is blue dream and space clean crossed i was between that one and the headband OG so maybe next time I when i'm going to try that I'm dream queen that's him that once seemed to stick out to me and as far as the 15 45s go yeah I definitely feel this stuff now I'm definitely behind I it's definitely a definitely a winner man love this stuff the beautiful looking bud I mean normally places sell this stuff for 55 I would say you know this stuff is a right on point man priced to move this stuff will not I guarantee guarantee I know I didn't you know I have no idea how much they have got into this stuff you know no clue but i would say i wouldn't i wouldn't it's not going to last more than a week so today is Saturday if it's there next Saturday and you're still being able to get some consider yourself very lucky because normally stuff like this at 45 doesn't last I'm completely baked right now off that nice hit was it too i would say like a medium expansion to really no expansion just it wasn't too bad finish this off here my bag we'll ask it um looking at the after looking at the ashes in the bowl it looks like it was fairly

dedicating this review to someone who's very special to me our family dog passed away unfortunately this morning his name was major and he was the best dog ever I know every dog owner says that but seriously loved him very much and who's a big part of my life so yeah I'm dedicating this review to him rest in peace major all right 18th cannabis review today bringing jet fuel back so excited for that this is jet fuel 707 headband hybrid flower and there it is so I got this at kind people's in Santa Cruz it's $50 before tax and then I got the bull we're gonna be using today from kind people's as well this is $25 before tax or $19.99 on their website not sure if you can make that out they spell it really weird but the company is ice ey c e and i'll put the link to their website in the description for this video so you can check out more of their silicone products that's what they specialize in but this is called the Ice Bowl so we'll get a little more into that as we start using it so this jet fuel 707 headband it's coming in at 26.2 percent THC so definitely pretty high testing it gives you the terpenes on here mere seen Kerry Ophelia and Hume you lean and then it tells you package 625 20 so pretty standard packaging but cool I've already been using this for a day like with all my reviews just so I can really give you a good idea of the flavors and aromas and effects this one was kind of tough to nail down but I think I got it and can definitely give a good description of all the different kind of stuff about this 707 strain so 707 headband it's hybrid it's a cross between three strains Sour Diesel OG Kush and Master Kush Oh Sour Diesel was the very first tree and I started using when I was started using cannabis and I really liked it and you definitely noticed those notes of sour in this 707 headband so this is 8th which is 3.5 grams let's go ahead and open it up so normally when it's not been opened yet there's a little thing on there you take off that really just helps with the punch the impact of the aroma is from the flower but it's definitely really strong it smells really really nice it's like piney and earthy and then there's some definitely some sweetness and a little bit of sour as well really a dense powerful mix of a room is there but super nice so I already packed a bowl and we have some pre ground here but let's go ahead and throw the flour into this mason jar courtesy of kind people's [Music] there we go already yes super nice so before I talk about the effects of this strain let's talk a little bit about this ice spoon Bowl it's silicone pipe so silicone rubber it's bendable it won't break if you drop it and it comes with a poker that just pops right in and out of the back of it like that so it's super combat compact super convenient you have this little part on the back here you can store a key for wax in there if you want so that's pretty cool but yeah this is a great product because it's just really easy to bring around with you and it has everything you need right there so you just need your product on a lighter and you know you're good to go no more no more tools and actually this bowl piece pops out as well you can stick this whole thing in the freezer and it won't break because it's not glass and you can just chip away at the residue so yeah really easy again this is ice or ice spoon sorry so like I mentioned with the terpenes on this one there's three chart beans your mere scene which is the most common Turkey and found in cannabis that's your clove and herbal and earthy flavors and then it's known for your couch loft effect and also known to promote feelings of calmness and relaxation then you have your karaoke lean which is your pepper and spice and now it's known to have anti-inflammatory benefits and your human which is your herbal earthy and kind of bark flavor and that has anti-inflammatory benefits like the carrier feeling so yeah pretty decent terpenes I think it's actually the same as the pure Kush by jet fuel but no complaints I mean it makes for a really great flavor profile and terrific aromas as well so like the aroma is the flavors that I'm getting from this are most prominently that pine and sweet a little bit of like sappy kind of syrup texture and flavor on some jelly as well I'm not sure if you're going to find the same thing if you try out this strain but this is just what I'm noticing and then a little bit of that sour taste as well that I think is kind of from that Sour Diesel mix in there overall great flavors great great aromas though go ahead and use the the poker here on this ice spoon Bowl show you how that works pack another one as we talk about the effects yeah boom super easy just like that you know you have your poker I check out of the back there and they use pop it in it's super super easy you got a flower right there so this is definitely known as a strain to have a pretty powerful euphoric effect and it definitely does as as a hybrid it's kind of known for that 50/50 between your head high creative energetic and your kind of relaxed and sleepy so personally with this strain I would say that I'm getting a immediate uplifting sensation and like I mentioned quite a strong before effect as well also increased creativity and heightened alertness and awareness as well really good amount of stress relief just overall sense of calmness and relaxation definitely noticed that right away and it really improves with with each head and there's just kind of calm energy that you get to I think it's because of that mix between sativa and indica where you feel like you want to do stuff but you're also like happy and calm and just overall feeling good it's just a really good kind of happy uplifting strain good for just you know maybe you're down having a having a tough day like you know my family dog passes away this morning so for me this is a nice pick-me-up strain definitely but yeah overall very good I'm giving it at 8.5 out of 10 excuse me some strong laughs hits there once again 7f 7 headband by jet fuel you pick one up $50 kind people's in santa cruz 2 locations and this ice bowl as well check out the description to this video for a link to the ice website we could check out more of these products jet fuels website kind people's website thank you everyone for watching following

the day help you feel good I think it's also good for creativity and kind of increasing energy well keeping you feeling relaxed and calm as well and the flavors and and the aromas are really great

organ medical cannabis garden this is blue dream here in front of me okay quite a bit of wind the last few days and these buds are getting so big i noticed this one this morning it's got so much weight he's just going right up against the fence fence is basically supporting it so yeah you can see that wind just a little bit and these coals are so heavy they're having a hard time keeping up with stinks right now but they're getting close got them going across twice but it's really a helped a lot it's just giving a little bit support look at this magnificent shot here it's just me get to what the sun's not write me write it out of how glorious comes to mind so there we go takes a little while for the focus to come in but it's pretty good so I've kind of basically what I've been doing is adding a lot of support to some branches that are I've marked all my bamboo and all my steaks the feeling was as we get to harvest and I want somebody leaning in and getting an icon on something like that so all my little steaks that could you know you could fewer guide you ran into that that would be bad so everything's got little orange tags or just little hunting targets i found a hardware store just kind of if it's dark you know desk and somebody forgets there's a ladder there just safety precautions I think it's really important so I've got kind of a method of how I get through the garden here kind of like go this way and then because i had this branch break on the headband and see right down here I had this branch break and it was coming all the way over here and so I can actually get through now but that's been the only real casualty and I've got a little footage of that the headband is close to being done it's y'all it up a lot green crack certainly not close to done there isn't really any hairs turned I think it's going to take quite a while longer we've got a couple weeks left on some maybe as much as a week on a couple this blue dream has been seriously hard to manage the whole plant is almost completely falling over sour d's coming really really nicely been this gorgeous looking really good this blue dream has been difficult to manage its almost falling over the ladder is the only thing keeping it from totally falling over so just a little shot great gapes doing great but we're going to give it some time and certainly not going to rush this all right all peace and cannabis a couple weeks left thanks for viewing be safe branch yesterday I tied the top Koloff to the tree next to it and I think what I ended up happening is it just wouldn't allow it to sway in the wind just got rigid and just broke the whole branch off so it was just too much of a hassle to try to fix it so I'm going to trim this up get a big leafed which which I'm doing right now and then we'll let her drive for a few days and go from there so I'm just going to strip all the big leaves off I don't get shot that one all right mr. branch start okay so September 24 this has been about three days the night of a 20 f I guess and it's dried up okay it's definitely needs one or two days left before i'm gonna mess with it but i'll just get in and clean queens yup these won't be perfect then won't be completely mature but they're pretty close it's just one small little branch but it gives you something fresh to get going", "x__7A0cd-L4": "hey what's up wooded this your boy

didn't like the other strain list he had so i just didn't want anything this was the only one that i was a little bit interested in besides the blue city diesel and the blue dreams but they were just cuttings and it looks like they're actually doing good with Richards advice to begi the top of them so I'm pleased with that because their roof perkin up with a little bit heat from the heat mat and

Day Parade yeah so this is the master cuz I got these cones from a chrome ball in dispensary I'm not gonna mention a name you dig what I'm saying am I giving no credit but what a waste of time these are two of my biggest plans outdoors and it's like me fans beautifully grown nice now it's like flowering time and they don't have no trichomes about what six feet the excuse me anyway this is the cross that I did of my headband diesel with the tangi just doing some funky stuff smells awesome no no like a pineapple liquorice do phenotypes and so on that stack the closest there's a second mine and it's a dirty no this one just smelled like a skunk no fruitiness this one smells the best actually but they don't look the best this one looks the best so I was alright see how it turns out got three girls in a fog and a pot my own soil that I made this is the BlackBerry og focus focus focus damn man she never disappoints believe it or not I found this from a back seat I figured I'd keep a some bird crap nice piece of wood just be some wood yeah so I got my hmm he smells awesome I love this blackberry fee no man never been not doing that lately raising my daughter tending to the bills tending to my ladies I remember this little fruit I mean veggie plot right so I got my corns coming up tomatoes ripening sweet peppers going right mostly peppers over there I got these heroin Tomatoes looking crazy big girl before I let go check out my ladies man so the reason why they look all awkward I guess is because I did the lateral growth thing you know I didn't pinch the top initially like this is the original first stem right here and what I did I basically laid her laid it down this way and then the side shoots grew on all of them same way so maybe next season I'll chop them off and get a more bushier no which will equate some more buds let's have a little closer look oh yeah again I see baby I want to give a shout out to myself I'm loving Emma Girls is turning out this season you know I've been watching a lot of you guys I'm out of it yeah she's looking dope you know I just had to ran with the strange that I was definite about except what I mask the cush in the green house I've some BS right there what I plan to do is take the sample to the place where I bought it from and have their quality control judge the genetics of why they should sell this to the people you know some garbage genetics just for the bread oh my little friend it's a neighbor's cat he coming and checking up on me what's up cutie hanging out you just made some up video 15 minutes of fame about 15 seconds I guess yeah so they are he's stacking up my head panties oh these plans are about five seven five eight I'm five two and he reached me right above my chin oh let me show you ding with the lateral growth yes my uh it's my cover crop yeah well no tilt method you dig so like I was saying the lateral growth you know you see the main chute and everything these were the size shoots that grow out so that's why so that's the main chute I didn't top it until they got up to here is when I topped it the main top and she did that so she was Majan if I woulda topped her growing vertically she would have been much more bushy little remedy Mendel D from my soul I can't wait so my hope is so what good hole alright man singing one love shoutout to everybody on tubas thanks for checking in your broke vid yeah oh let me show you guys this blackberry back here mister you know the BlackBerry then I have the pheno it's finished like in six and a half seven weeks so he's got like three more weeks

blunt rolled up 707 headband yeah we got it from my tumbleweed organics it's a nice delivery service definitely cool people over there definitely hook it up and blah Tamara came over and definitely hook it up nicely we got some 707 headband was indeed any words out of the widow it definitely got hooked up with the nice one point three fat fat pre-roll some dutch passion and if gia dutch passion

shorts blue would all got from there it's one of my favorites so far also like the 707 half-man yeah basically any headband you go with you're going to be okay should be yeah the 707 is a lot more i want to say sweeter but not in a like a super candy since trying to distinguish the word I want to use I'm talking about it's like it's you know we we've had headband from like do s and it's you know it's more sour you know and it's like this to me I'd like I like to say it's more like earthy like natural to me oh no it's like that just it looks chugging like some like manly going to me I don't know it's like funny like I think about the outdoors I God that it was like brown outdoors but like just the way it looks to me it's like it looks like like a wild animal plant you know I'm saying like so it's great this to me this really has like some like floor like undertone so our core just way different tastes in like with normal headband Easley's real distinguishable if you're hitting it like you had to rolled up and like you know there's going on and like rotation you get oh it definitely taste the difference on either of them I believe they have a the caps like 60 it's not 50 like some places but you know still quality medications so nothing to complain about and I think like we mentioned in some of the other tumbleweed videos that said by 45 minutes it would take to be over there and it took like 20 25 something like bad they were over here yeah quick like easy verified over the phone and they got here you know these have they're like little scanner and copyright therefore unit to copy of your recommendation and your ID and whatnot nothing that's a hassle just real quick they do think or you will fill your couple like two papers and you're good to go flying there was definitely cool the driver hopefully you looking see him once and future episodes definitely a possibility dude needs to come over and chill yeah the 707 to really nice note for sure I could say that this is like an even medicator not just a full-on head or a phone body or anything like that it's just really even like pain relief but then still able to do things that you want to do text alert anxiety you definitely get you thinking to can't stop thinking about which I enjoy that taste yeah you guys have to at least try just for the taste even if you don't prefer the the height gives you I know some people are just straight sativa fans take indica fans and then like like what do you do what hybrids what welcome you know we burn different kinds of weed altered like different times

such as nice and style some people have like the Cameron or some people have a deadly style some people just just different atmospheres yeah it's nice that when you have a decent sized menu to choose from some places are kind of lacking on that yeah but then sometimes as the if it has a smaller menu it's easy for you to choose not to use even sometimes when they got like you got like 15 just fired strains in front of your face you're like what am I going to do hard so it's nice to ask the recommendations to my just specify like what your real needs are what you want we definitely help out on

you for joining and as always it's nice to see you just kill that so we're not having a head in there today today I'm testing the blood from the folks at AGL the AGL hybrid all has flour animal cookies crossed with Loompas headband this particular one they say has a THC rating of 20 8.75% now if you don't know those particular strains you're not heard of that and not a problem I've got you covered animal cookies child of the legendary hybrid marijuana string Girl Scout cookies and fire Oh Jade this clone all the strands flowers and nine to ten weeks they play and grows too dense frosty green buds tipped with purple true to its name animal cookies has a sweet sour aroma with heavy full body effects that will impress any veteran consumer this potent medicine might be overkill for mild symptoms but its ability to obliterate severe pain and insomnia is unprecedented so keep those in mind now lupus headband otherwise known as underdog Oh Jade underdog og is a slightly indica dominant hybrid at 60% indica 40% sativa these strains created through a cross of the classic properties across with og cush strains assistance of the classic and dog family this bud brings a mellow Tommy hi and incoming effects that last for hours on end the underdog og hi starts with a slightly de Fora cleft that's pretty mellow and it won't cause you any sort of anxiety the effect is long lasting and becomes a debt if excuse me at times tripping over my own tongue well it went to a sleepy state that often ends and a nice long nap not bad for some people huh because of these effects and it's high 25% average so this one being in the twenty eight range is normal the THC level underdog is said to be the perfect thing for treating conditions such as chronic pain insomnia chronic stress anxiety muscle spasms this one has super dense light minty green grape shaped nuts with sparse bright orange hairs and a coating of thick frosty bright white crystal trichomes say that five times fast underdog og has sweet herbal tea flavor with a head to push the aroma is of herbal sweet earth with a super dank pungency that can fill a room with its potent snatch I agree with the herbal tea flavoring kind of sense aroma but it's nothing that fills the room maybe once we smoke it that's that's quite possible now before I get into that though let me give you the breakdown in this particular one THC a 28-point 18 percent THC of 0.57 put them together will you get your number twenty eight point seven five percent THC excuse me CBD a at 0.1 percent CBD 0.1% CBG a zero point nine six percent CBG 0.14 percent CBN zero point one percent and then finally wrapping it up with the CBC at 0.1 percent so give you guys a little view of what this doesn't look like remember they say great sheets so this is absolutely normal sorry guys for some reason not my legs not gonna work and it's not that my battery's low mmm there we go got it roll with the punches nice little look at noblets i mean if i move the paper even slightly or move the light even slightly you can see some nice little glistening so again that part seems to definitely fit I'm hoping that the other room filling aroma comes with the smoke each of it speaking of it's nice to hear that little sound not saying that the buds done wrong again they describe it beating this way so just be on the safe side to get a Bovie to keep that freshness speaking of the freshness when you break it up with your fingers it breaks up nicely it's one of the reasons why I kind of figured I didn't need a grinder because you could see it through the bottle it wasn't anything bigger hard and one nice little nub that seems to break up through good both sides so for people who were standard Bowl users you're covered this will last nice flavor it does it has that it does have that horrible to your over to it nothing harsh nothing heavy it's not expanding or breaking ring it's nice actually you feel it in the chest but it's it's more I don't know it's that that nice air coming through you're not you're not dying from it I mean it doesn't hit your heart even though they say it's 60% indicate it doesn't come across to me as bowel right between the eyes but it's not completely here I mean it's a it's a blend hmm check it out for yourselves guys see what you think go on in and ask for a hybrid all s animal cookies look across the Lupus head bag aka underdog og see what you think", "yKYJYXXyy8g": "all righty one of the guys I'm walking my first calls TV this 2100 channel design people have marijuana music the sports and today's episode we're gonna be doing a quick little strand review on some headbands so real quick [ __ ] won't let you guys know today that uh today I'm gonna be doing three friend reviews this can be spending view number one next one after this can be Lambo and then after that we should be doing wrong queen or actually no after this one I'm gonna do royal Queen and they don't get into the Lambo or vice versa but like I said we got other ashamed of you is gonna be doing three today so be on the lookout for that in your description notification box but before we get into this hopefully you has a home at your smoking device a little hopefully you guys be joining us later product so at the end is always a heparin challenger time you see me tickets marijuana I want you guys at home to do the same and smoke along with me so went out to the world are no hot shop the other day picked up a couple things stuff already showed you guys got the you know some stuff over there stuff over here got this stuff over here this stuff here was only six bucks a gram which is a great [ __ ] deal but that's what you want today is some headband here I'll show you guys the stats grow my naked in Perth I says here rolled cannabis is were sold by had been potency analysts say that this here has 1% THC CBD czar 0.2 percent THC a czar fourteen point six percent and total THC is thirteen point eight percent harvest it was ten seven of 2015 and that's about it got the barcode nothing else on there so let's go ahead and open this sucker up and see what it smells like and get into the smell test so we're gonna see if it's very strong very loud package we as wasn't if it's very great among you know is it very great or is it kind of shitty smelling weed does it smell like some home stone leafy yeah no grass cut stuff so let's open up and see what it smells like here guys oh also real quickly head bin is a not only an old-school strain it's actually the very first strain of wheat I've ever heard about when I started smoking the very first name for some wheat I ever heard was had been you know which is kind of funny because [ __ ] a headband just let you guys know as a hybrid that is cross between OG Kush and Sour Diesel so basically you [ __ ] power double and you got OG Kush the holes badass train and then Sour Diesel another old-school badass train put them together and you got a badass or even more badass really old-school [ __ ] train that ban here but myself going into the smoke test here just want to let you guys know or you can get a little couple tidbits or some infos about that it's a hybrid OD cars are diesel which is pretty cool Scarah kind of funky and musky so you do get a little bit in the earth tones it has a sweet funky lemons pine smell like that Sour Diesel that that's really funky and monkey like some real true Sour Diesel like some funky [ __ ] some Funkadelics type [ __ ] but yeah some really strong musky funky uh earthy tones with the with that little kind of hint of a sweet lemon but it's more like a bitter lemon and a bitter price but there's a little hint of sweetness in there too so the small test uh it's not very strong smelling wheat it's not very loud package but it is better than average so we'll give that a four to five and it does smell pretty damn good it doesn't smell great but it does smell good so smells better than average so we'll give the small test a four out of five it smells good you can smell those flavors and there's a musky funky Sour Diesel with that sweet little lemon and pine tree kind of mist up in there oh but it's not very lot of package but it is pretty strong you know you just a long hint go ahead dude can I kick you back there so it's more test four out of five now next up what's going into the but it's off here so okay it's a manicure job on Scotty fresh G dry as well as the density of it and when I'm looking at this [ __ ] the manicure job is gonna be a 4.5 out of 5 as you can see they're just a little couple hints of the light leaf right there but besides that only great manicured job so 4.5 out of 5 for the manicure I sell to you fresh and dry it is perfect it's not too fresh it's not too dry it's right in the middle where you want your weed and then the density I can see as you can see they're a tiny tiny bit of flex but for [ __ ] rock-hard solid so we'll give that a 4.5 out of 5 for the density so definitely some good salt but all the way around now we're gonna break off some of this stuff here I just want to see what it smells like cuz I notice that when you break it up it also smells a little different oh okay now when you break the stuff up the smell test goes to the 5 out of 5 now I can really smell that sweet lemon and boy is it [ __ ] strong so you just have to break it up and it becomes a lot sweeter so it's really funky musky on the Sour Diesel on the outside but then when you crack that sucker open that's when you start to smell the hints of the og cush in there mmm goddamn alright so breaking it up 5 out of 5 keeping it together a 4 out of 4 or 4 out of 5 [ __ ] yeah throw this up here I'm gonna take a couple hits we're under the green stage has to after beans haystacks get into the high and then of course give you my official review of dish headband here so gonna get smoked long guys and toast I also apologize I'm trying to hear the music gets way way over there I just got a little music for the background just so you know for my sake I have a hard time talking when it's dead [ __ ] silent like if I know other people can possibly hear what the [ __ ] I'm saying right now and they're not in my general [ __ ] little zone right here we don't like that kind I can't speak whenever I other people I think you might be you'll be hear what I'm saying I'm not talking let's get smoking guys here in toast we got a little too Park in the background get down baby do grubs greens taste I'm gonna have to give that a 4 out of 5 don't be very strong in the palate does last pretty long you do get that sweet you get a little hint of sweet pine and then that very strong hint of sweet are just a strong taste of sweet skunk so yeah sweet skunk with a little hint of sweet pie but it's very strong on the palate and inducting lasts long and it tastes great so straight up I'm about to get the Greenes taste test a 5 out of 5 that's some great [ __ ] I was thing about giving it a 4 out of 5 as it as I sit here that the flavors start to kick in and really go at my palate so very strong skunky taste with that hint of sweet lemon when I say skunky tastes like that old-school [ __ ] you know super skunk is badass weed that type of taste so if I were to fall for the green taste that no one keep on taking a couple more hits here will tell you what it tastes like when after greens taste I said bits so folks those flavors or if we start to get more flavor of the combusted side then the flavors of the actual sweet pine in the skunk in there and then of course get into the high as well then right the sucker does not talking pick up more hits or guys and toast all right so dr. Rehn stage this will give it a four out of five even in the third and fourth it I do taste you know start to taste that come already combusted wheat flavor or that already burnt weed but it's still really whole so strong flavors of that Super Skunk and that little hint of sweet la ours sweet lemon in there it almost tastes like I'm sprinkling a little bit of green on top each hit you know even though I got a little bit of combust taste to it so tastes like I still got some green up in there even though how'd you guys do tell that ball is completely burnt and just about gone so don't be a four out of five for the greens taste test now we're gonna take two more hits here hold them in see what kind of highway get and then let you guys know about the I read it I think give you my review of the [ __ ] here so I'll keep on with smoking on guys in toast that role quickly just a little info tip a reason why this straight is called Tet bad because most people would they smoked it they felt a lot of pressure released around their head here like almost a headband light just like they felt like oh like you know release some pressure and a high right around their head here but people smoke that ban so that's why they actually call headband because they said to relieve pressure and stuff on their head [ __ ] and it felt like there's like a little like you know miracle headband or something around them that you know those making them feel better oh yeah that's why essentially is called headband just because it's supposed to like release like pressure for like you know in the head and stuff for like migraines and [ __ ] like that be I guess really great for [ __ ] ocular pressure for migraines like I'll know if you guys can tell like you're off in the light my [ __ ] eyes all [ __ ] up a couple days now yeah as you guys see there I don't know what the [ __ ] happens with my eyes Minh [ __ ] up for like two three days now it's been causing real [ __ ] bad migraines like holy [ __ ] man then the rough [ __ ] week but that's that's what had been supposed to do is just kind of help that ocular pressure and [ __ ] like that hope you know ease the pain in your eyes and [ __ ] but don't think one more hit here guys and then I will just go get into the high because like I said I just want to give you a little info about that why it's called had been because like I said when people smoking almost they said I did almost felt like there was a headband around I'm like they just had some release and pressure and like you know the high around their head there all right so the hi I definitely have a very good [ __ ] head II have I know a little heavy it's almost like a strong indica head high like just at the very top like they said to my headband so to be honest with you this [ __ ] does help out my eye a lot especially with what just recently happened there like as I cuz for no [ __ ] before I smoke this [ __ ] when I was moving my eye and [ __ ] because it's all like [ __ ] up right there I was moving it it hurt every time just to [ __ ] look up down left right anything but when I smoked this [ __ ] here this headband it actually numbs that painter I don't feel the pain in my eye when I move it or anything like it I can't feel like that all you in before he was [ __ ] hurt like a son of a [ __ ] if I just look to the left or something it was like my neck to my next don't [ __ ] up like when I turn my neck it [ __ ] hurts and [ __ ] I smoked that [ __ ] during him like I can move my right now and [ __ ] it doesn't hurt at all so I'm definitely going to give the high a 5 out of 5 it does say what it does which is did ya good nice head high good for ocular pressure glaucoma migraine [ __ ] like that I do feel like an active indica though you know I can talk perfect I can you know I I feel like I could go out and do [ __ ] I don't feel like to go hiking or something but you know like just normal regular day stuff easy you know just [ __ ] you can smoke this go about your day and have no problem talking walking moving doing anything like that I think like it like extreme exercise you probably want to want to do this but this is a great morning bowl for [ __ ] this you know if you have pain or something like that like migraines and [ __ ] like that this is definitely gonna help because it is more of a head highlight from here to here this is where I feel the most stoned right now it's just up in my upper torso so like my neck and stuff is actually starting to feel better too and then of course my head it feels a lot better so the high I let me give it a 5 out of 5 if I could a 6 out of 5 I think this is actually a really great strain for medical for people who suffer from some medical symptoms like glaucoma and [ __ ] like that [ __ ] so my official review though of this headband how do you in a five out of five it's a great [ __ ] strain not only recreationally but also medically it's also very helpful especially in my case because I'm so I'm someone who suffers from glaucoma they have [ __ ] this ruling puffs out and with not only trying to help prevent migraines but if I do get a migraine or if I do get some kind of like you know what happened to my eye here where it's all [ __ ] up and I don't know what the hell happened but it was hurting like a son of a [ __ ] but you know it [ __ ] helped out the pain

is my strain here this is the one that helps me out and keeps me functional through the day but I'm surprised how [ __ ] good this [ __ ] is like just the strain in particular cuz I smoked a lot of strains I smoked a lot of weed and in my ears and I've only smoked I think I demand maybe once in my life in it I don't remember it doing this here but I'm really amazed by this but please see guys

about about an hour hour buzz trailing off into the second hours kind of postponing in a bed yeah it seems to be the trend the harder it hits the faster that [ __ ] wears off so it's always something to keep in mind but [ __ ] coffee's done bubbles packed here Keith or Austin all that [ __ ] see if I can't taste this something a little bit of blueberry about where it's gonna smell like a bomb mild mild blueberry flavor earthy notes for sure very earthy also not a not a piney flavor at all no pining as to this whatsoever earthy more earthy very mild mild citrus notes very mild mild blueberry notes and I think this particular strain is the more direct salivate a lot my smoke I think this strain is the more direct blending of blueberry and headband instead of the original strain which is like a blend of four different types like [ __ ] old 76 blueberry and [ __ ] a bunch of [ __ ] so this is like cheater blueberry headband and not the full-on like original [ __ ] but that's to be expected when you have licensing issues and blah blah blah for production personal and the [ __ ] you know just distribution level production and plant limits all that [ __ ] [ __ ] kind of hard to produce anything when you got to have four plans to make one plant to get one string and still I don't know run a business on top of that so I mean you can have the for parents trains and then work up to the strain you're trying to have it's like you know what happens when you're trying to have other strains for other people because you are a medicinal dispensary and then you know you got patients who need certain things for certain ailments and you don't have what they want anymore because you're trying to do something because it's costing for plans to have one one thing you know it's a [ __ ] when you work out the logistics of running a dispensary dude that's a [ __ ] too much [ __ ] too much mess it's a lot of mess what it is red tape and water you know just keep your [ __ ] governmental big brother [ __ ] mitts out of my goddamn grinder and leave me the [ __ ] alone okay weed is meant to be a social [ __ ] thing don't sit there and restricted you feel like that's medicinal don't share it you wouldn't share like it in with you you [ __ ] filth eat my dick [ __ ] bastards this has got a nice slow burn to it I mean not like slow slow but it's not like he doesn't burn up despite the buds being on like the dryer end it's still retains a fluffiness and you know they they fluff out decently in the grinder I mean I'm seeing more fluff about it's decent it's pretty decent strain overall you see if this one will last the day or perhaps my my smoking has just [ __ ] gone up I don't know it tends to happen when I have a lot of weed you know I'm sitting on a lot of weed I haven't weighed the sale strain in a minute but uh you know when I got back from Albuquerque I had leg and eight to that plus I have an 8 in clementines there's like quarters sitting on top of life board one more strains one more drams you know hey pretty spiffy it's like two quarters a weed I had when I liked the half ounce a week I had when I came back from Albuquerque man I just had to weigh it all up to know that Pennsylvania so much time getting free grams and I only got a backup doobie keep trying to forget about it but it's like you know like my little holdout weapon it's like when I run out of [ __ ] I'm having a [ __ ] piss-poor day it's like hey look we cores at the same time I don't want to save that the last minute because if I do then I won't smoke it as a doobie I'll roll it out and like get two bowls out of it instead I'd really like to [ __ ] smoke a joint for once because it's been a minute so I just said smoke a joint by my damn self but [ __ ] man I like this weed a lot was it about two hits or am i in the first one I don't know you're the one that can scroll back and look at that [ __ ] you'd know better than me I'm high the [ __ ] you trusted my word for it I'm just like god damn drunk out a deal fire in your room Raleigh back out back out well then wow wow wow so this is one of those throat hit master aims right here man that should get you right enough throat you look I can like that people are watching my [ __ ] that's nippy holy [ __ ] I don't even know what some of these buttons do I'd really like to test them but I'm afraid it'll mess the video rawr oh man this is good [ __ ] I like it although it's not energetic at all that's another thing worth mentioning it's not energetic there's a straight-up spacey you'd go sit down kinda [ __ ] which isn't good because I got a I got to be a my own roto tiller finish finish up this garden space here I've been been digging out a new garden space because I need to grow things pretty high be [ __ ] stoned I mean it's a good place to be in for sure it's not forgetting things so pretty much blueberry headband [ __ ] pretty happy relaxed rain kind of it's kind of a heavy ish buzz you know it comes on kind of strong and it creeps up a little bit more definitely not an energetic strain I'm gonna have you glued to the floor pretty much pretty good flavor though man definitely definitely buried notes I mean you get it more on the aftertaste for sure it's definitely blueberry distant citrusy hint and in an earthy now very pleasant hey I picked such a great time spotting garbage drug and realized he did that today what is today stay Tuesday Mia well it's Tuesday so the average high this is stoned off your ass [ __ ] right here holy [ __ ] I want to get out of it with three dudes all right now

and you spend more time changing amount than anything oh man headband let me tell you leaves as big as my hands full of it Liberty Hayes same thing larger than my hands thank you very much attitude seeds they look beautiful they look exactly like they're supposed to look the only thing I did not like is the headband seeds being put into the silica pack that was a very abrasive for them I think I wasted three seats just trying to get it to germinate good thing i ordered a six pack there's the line that goes up to my five gallon bucket hello grommet there and it keeps the water from the month spurting all over the place this is a free draining floor by the way one inch neoprene rubber if that book it was to spill it would drain right off into the corner wouldn't be a problem and this is

update so yeah everything is moving looking good as i can see the new headliner the head bad mom is in full effect on also got some cuts got two cuts over there got some cuts of the cheese over there i'm going to take two more cuts of each and maybe about another week my pump failed in the cloner that's why i'm using my whole method just one inch rifle blocks everything is in rockwool no i'm going to top this off a rock wool this is my little triage for the red beard that i transplanted if y'all go back to the last banjo date you've seen i had the taproot was out the bottom of the cup that he was in so in a transplant I wanted to give it a nice tree are highly oxygenated area to that and get activated this waters just ph said about 5.5 to six with uh some voodoo juice and I think that's it just to keep everything highly oxygenated and get those roots down there in the bottom of the spot to start pushing out and spray it now so this red beard as you can see she's doing fine I'm calling to see because although I don't see any hair is it a funny story about the way i acquired this sea from one seed and sprouted female cloned it for almost a year and the last female that i cloned self their self and gave me a couple b's this is one of I've had it have a head of being yet out of self female come out any of them but straight female no Hermes this is my Larry over here finally starting to look a little normal after transplant and of course I got the two autos over here you got the diesel on the left and the ultraviolet on the right day na finding final home of the 66 inch Big Mama blocks and that's what it do for them both of them are already so female and then doing so for about going on the week now so I'm gonna rock out of here for maybe another week on there's newts and start putting some roots down in those blocks before hitting with any other blow notes or anything stronger I want to see a little sad Branson before I hit them so that's what it doing here of course in this purple sowwie only down mama all right so that's what's up one time y'all see y'all on my return and of course you know the growth is gonna be explosive and next level so keep its tanking all right and min wha hi John", "RwKy9t-dng4": "alright man here we are at three weeks exactly 21 days and they look a little droopy this is their nighttime actually just woke them up then we

transplanted the 818 headband into a solo cup I wanted to get that on video and end the whole process and everything but it's kind of hard to do it with a smartphone and one-handed and everything so I'll just explain what I did it's a small hempy cup basically the solo cup with pear light at the bottom and then one hundred percent cocoa and I you know saturate the cocoa before I go into the medium and I use 0.25 milliliters roots accelerator and one and a half milliliters of the Orca for micro rise up and I ph what was it just 5.6 just now so and that's how we're looking um the Chernobyl did get burns a little bit and I was expecting that I mean you know as big as a jump I as I made you know I doubled the newts on her you know so just gonna give her fresh water tomorrow because it's a you know I go feed feed flush or well feed feed fresh water tomorrow's freshwater day and then two days after well you know I day in between I give you know if I water today they won't get nothing tomorrow and then the day after that don't get it so the Chernobyl is just gonna keep getting what she was getting I know it doesn't look like it's too wet on camera here but believe you me I've ran like almost a half a gallon through just this one cup so and half a gallon before I even put anything in there for the bottom half of the cocoa still nothing from the auto I planted I was expecting it I don't know I I thought it would be out today I have to go check my journal and see where we're at but if expecting it to pop any time now so the clones have all been topped you know and then these two here I got two of them that are like this that we're at topped branches that I took off and I made clones so those will be four top soon that one back there I mean they're looking a little poopy but they're coming back they're bouncing back the new growth looks good and everything so that's the 420 update just wanted to tell everybody to you know if you want to get in get in the end date end date is December 15 for the race 2 420 you know get your clones your beans popped you know try and be as educational about it as you possibly can be you know just don't be like here's my entry and we'll watch it grow I mean if it at the very least you don't explain you know what you're doing and now all that good stuff you know try and give us some info you know because that that's what this is more about is uh everybody seeing how everybody else grows and and obviously to make sure you know we have something to smoke on on 420 but uh yeah peace love unity respect spread it around makhdoom showing you that you can pop your beans with nutrients just gotta not [ __ ] you know roots accelerator dude I swear to god she popped in one day or not in one day took her like less than 72 hours but then after she popped she had a [ __ ] inched root sticking out the bottom in like six seven hours so i'll definitely be using the 0.25 roots accelerator in the one and a half of Orca to pop my beans from now on in my rockwool cubes until i see any adverse effect do looks like a happy little seedling to me but uh yeah that's it guys we'll end it here almost at the 420 well after the four tony mark yeah get your beans popped or clones taken and join in the fun", "yb9SYSvO-2I": "all right what's going on youtube we got major burns here showing you a new strain he's working on um this is a uh i

remember guys keep smiling and stay medicated alright peace out", "-SixuOWiFi0": "was kickin guys smoothed over 420 coming at you with another exciting episode of some new product that I haven't tried that I'm picked up today 1 / 2 got a dreams out in poulsbo and never been at to that shop before wanted to see you know what was going on out there don't let the cat in knows what time it is hey my buddy good way yeah good friend am i all right persistence always has to be here for these come on buddy come on bud wait a minute am I can you get up here what come here oh he inched Auburn today because what have had a little adventure this morning so today's Monday I basically was supposed to go get my permit here in Washington and the permit place is closed on Mondays so I got another appointment tomorrow my homie Corey that I just met you know like a week ago we started talking like a couple days ago so yeah he's going to bring me out there and I'm going to go get my permit test and probably go hit the casino again because we hit the casino today when he discovered it was closed and we were already all the way out there we figured [ __ ] it was just gonna hit the casino i won like 30 bucks went in with like what was it sixty bucks and I ended up coming out and we spent 40 so I made 60 so yeah I actually made like 20 bucks or something like that anyway so picked up that stuff from the Gotti dreams so let's get right to it on I'm going to make this video and I'm going to do this once trained then i'm going to upload it and then while I'm doing that I'm going to make another video of the other string so we'll do it like that way I can break it up have more videos and cover more strands individually so let's get to it Seattle's Private Reserve pick this stuff up from we got a 707 headband so yeah now i have only ever smoked a headband strain once before in my life that was with my homie Jules what up Jules her brother ended up getting some or whatever so I had vaporized it was the first time I think I'd ever vaporized to this was like God years ago like 2000 and I want to say it was like seven but I could be wrong anyway Seattle's Private Reserve 707 headband let's check out okay right off the bat this isn't glass this is just plastic they want to make it look fancy that's fine whatever we're happy to judge about their packaging today because at least it's coming in okay so initially when I'm smelling this stuff it smells turn it smells kind of spicy like it's got some spice to it if that makes any sense like like a flowery spicy kind of smell i know that when i smoke the headband from before that [ __ ] got me so lifted like what ridiculously lifted let's check out some of the stuff i know it's kind of hard to see with my shitty camera my phone camera but yeah this is the this is the headband really loose but not really dense you know it's definitely crystally it's really crystally my toes crystal yours dusted as some other stuff that I've smoked or seen but let's see how tastes break up some of this right here and she's really sticky that's one thing this is really sticky stuff yeah not really sticky but it's got some stick to it that's for sure Scooby Snack Oh persistence is where's my lighter ya gotta go grab my lighter you right alright I'm back whoo so 707 headband channels private reserve cheers guys Oh so this was harvested on 59 2016 a couple months ago THC is 20-point 92% CBD is 0.4 percent at one eighth of this stuff the headband let's take another route see where she does Oh so it's not really flavoring it's not really tasty tasty yeah quit smoking cigarettes so I'm still trying to get my palate back but yeah the step is really it's really as far as the profile the smell profile and a little spicy not much of a skunky or you know I kind of smell like that no like berry or anything but um it's got a decent smell it's spicy i would say that so yeah let's finish this up oh yeah picked up a fat hoodie from these guys to check this out alright so when I when I went to the shop I saw the things I'm t-shirts and some other swag and I was like man I really like to get another hoodie i only own like the one good hoodie now might rationally so picked up this day oh goody from a got a dreams yeah it's perfect yeah it's a deal for you but the huge extended hood on that it's really awesome massive hood look at this thing feel like the Grim Reaper roll anyway yeah so 707 headband so let's get rid back into this not really feeling anything yet took a good dab of some grilled loup number four wafer is what I call it this morning so it pretty lifted went to the casino went to the DMV all that [ __ ] and they don't even call it the DMV here it's like the licensing station or whatever it's [ __ ] crazy but yeah my eyes been gone since then so see if it if I can pick it back up with some of this headband see if i can get my headband on what I'd like to do is I'd love to just find that headband strain you know just the straight headband not the super Silver Haze headband or the 707 headband or the 502 headband or the 802 headband or the [ __ ] your mom in the mouth headband [ __ ] I want just the regular headband but I don't even know if that exists anymore i don't know everybody's like what we're breathing and how you know breeding out and mixing like nothing's everything's a hybrid down essentially they say it's indica but is it truly indica no not fully but I could tell this is definitely not fully a sativa but it does have that sativa you know like how a lot of sativas have like they're not really super smelly almost chemically sometimes but like spicy too like that's what I'm getting from this well guys first impression of headband 707 you know I guess I really haven't smoked enough I only smoke those couple ribs so maybe we should just pack up on the live alone I think that's a good idea I'm pretty sure all my viewers at home my homies insane a ver mom wherever you're at all around the world because what I was watching this whoever's subscribed to me whoever likes my videos and [ __ ] your own my homies every single one of you you are my homies all right and then mariah is back home her boyfriend's back home they're probably watching some of these videos hopefully you gone damn i wish i could be smoking on their bunker the shirt get your [ __ ] asses out here smoke on this [ __ ] ain't nobody stopping you cheers guys really chemical taste initially like almost tape reminds me of that old school hydro taste from Canada back in the day the dense nugget that's what this tastes like I know it tastes like that old school hydro for sure I mean hands down that's what it is chemically hydro kind of days I don't know how they grow it I mean every farm out here is different they all have different techniques they all use different lighting they all use different soil compositions they all use different chemicals some of them do some adult pesticides some are pesticide-free I don't know about this stuff I don't think I just saw the warning label but it doesn't talk about pesticides or any of that [ __ ] which kind of has me concerned because guys when I'm smoking my flowers or I'm doubted off my oil I don't want to be smoking up bucking pesticides I'd only be so having a neem oil or nothing I don't want any of that [ __ ] I just want it to be the dirt and the flower and that you know the dirt the flower was grown in and water you know I mean you've got your nutrients you at your nutrients obviously but you know with no-till soil you know that's that's the way my homie likes to go that's the way I prefer to go you know do a nice note to the soil you know we're getting all the way but uh no morning labels don't really you know really seen anything on this [ __ ] so yeah we'll see what's up but anyway this stuff the next stuff that i'm going to show you guys in my next video it tests a little bit higher on the THC a little bit higher meaning like point 21 so we'll see we'll see how it tastes the diesel too so and you know I love me some diesel sour kush our anything cushioning diesel anything Barry tasting very market oh my gosh we'll do a review of the mango kush with you guys wow I tried some mega push before for my dispensary in Vermont and the mango kush from my dispensary in Vermont really good stuff you know they've got they've got a sour kush which is my favorite by far my favorite strain of all time I cannot find it out here I have not found any sour kush [ __ ] Sour Diesel sour widows that were [ __ ] your mom summer everything else but no sour kush you can find Jedi cush Skywalker kush OG Kush [ __ ] purple kailash every other [ __ ] cush but no sour kush like the menus that call some places they just don't have it [ __ ] sucks that's what i crave that's with my mouth craves the taste of that sour kush is so salary and so skunky and so tasty blows your [ __ ] mind not only that it rose it's terrific and if you buy the hash it presses really nice and some shatter it's really good stuff guys so anyway let's finish this bowl up eventually here pretty soon t were going to be doing some product reviews i'm in the process i'm going to be buying a car here probably tomorrow after I getting a permit that way and I can drive my own car when I'm driving around and my buddy is going to be riding with me so that's cool he's going to give me driving lessons he actually gives driving license that's one of the things he does so he's going to give me a really cheap driving lesson which is awesome and they can i d-do friend out here which is cool see he's a real dude so ex-military probably right around my age too he might be a little bit younger I'm not sure he might be right around my age but pretty chill dude definitely and you know I don't know how many other uber drivers and I'd man besides of one Michael woulda and you know like the two of the coolest member drivers I've ever met hands down right there Michael and according so this one's for you guys actually Corey doesn't smoke it was his first time going into a marijuana shop today so I popped his cherry there that was awesome and that's the first time I've ever been to a casino that big in my life this place was [ __ ] huge hotel casino parking garage right in the place this thing was massive that picture on facebook does not do it justice I'll take a video one of these days we're going to be going to another casino tomorrow and don't worry guys I'm not a huge gambler i only spent like maybe 40 bucks that's my limit I spent 40 bucks today walked out with 60 [ __ ] right can't beat that cheers a little hot here all right guy so my first impression of the headband 707 taste not all there I mean what do you expect when you're getting us a tube unless you're getting like some cynics or something that shit's delicious but I mean it's all about the grower it's all about how they grow it and it's all about the strain to some strains people can grow and give it good flavor good good taste it smell same strain somebody else grows doesn't come out as good you know that's just the learning process with those guys I guess but anyway so my review of the 707 headband yeah it's uplifting I give it a thumbs up as far as flavor me but the high that I'm getting right now I definitely feel uplifted I feel like I feel good my pain levels are excruciating right now guys like my back hurts so bad that's [ __ ] terrible so this isn't really doing too much for my pain you know that being said it just barely starting to kick in a little bit now so give it a few more seconds once again a got a dreams check these guys out and Twitter Facebook whatever the [ __ ] else you can do I don't know if [ __ ] thief they're on leaf Lee insta slam Instagram what up Julia will be man and you're one of my biggest inspirations for moving out here tell me we're not friends I don't even think

look at that [ __ ] can't really see through them it's not really airy and i'm touching they kind of dance this our diesel is just chunking up i'm flushing right now i'm gonna flush for two weeks i've been flushing the fast past few days i'm in five gallons so i'll do it twice as much so from the five gallons i'll do a ten gallon flush but the solar headband turned out to be cool i got a clone of it everything looking right put y'all up in there everything is [ __ ] frosty and dense you know you can see it's fading already because i've been flushing i gave it the clear x then i'm gonna start doing straight water yeah man i'm just doing a quick update for y'all though ain't nothing too much look at some dirty ass nutrients i've been flushing [ __ ] looks nasty man i've been flushing all that nasty [ __ ] out but i'll be flushing for the next week and a half too trying to get all that [ __ ] out you know look at the stem on that [ __ ] yeah man just a quick update sardisa and the hairband you know i'll be doing breeding on my next run making me some femme seeds i'm gonna try that tyrese i missed again a piece man just a quick update it was [ __ ] hot today too man in my tent hope this [ __ ] cool down dude peace", "UvKQ_X9H-1M": "what's up YouTube we got spiritual girl coming at you with our weekly update all right let's get right into it so right off the bat you can see there's a little bit of nutrient burn I want a little bit too strong on the on the ginormous and the bud candy on this last feeding and everything but you know it's fine it's I wanted to get one last saw solid feeding before we went into you know flushing because today is week six we are at day 42 so we are beginning to flush I'm planning on flushing firm between two and three weeks so we could finish this at around eight to nine weeks more likely nine weeks just cuz I've noticed that it takes a little bit longer to finish up but blood protection it's it's I would say it's in the first round of swelling you can see the calyx is are starting off imma secondly focus there it is the calyx is are starting to swallow up finally and that white stuff it's just residue from the solution that I used to clean off the powdery mildew which I was able to get rid of finally so yeah I mean as you could he could so they're the ones that put on a lot of weight since the last since the last video some of this stuff is already falling over like back here we got this boat over here just I can't manage to hold up a coach to get some yo-yos for it yeah it's looking nice and frosty we got my favorite line of butter back here we got one two three four five just stacking back here just one in particular this pack you really nicely so so yeah guys I mean if it wasn't if it wouldn't have been for the powdery mildew issue this would have been like by far my best bro but you live and you learn you grow and you learn so yeah that's to avoid powdery mildew to make sure you always have and also any family and just you know you'll run into so much issues but yeah so we've started flushing the frost is there it's gonna get better though so my next my next grow after this it's not gonna be I'm going to switch up on the headband I got a pink sunset in the veg tent that so this is gonna be done in about two to three weeks plus another week of drying in here for the tent so you're looking at about a month above a month more before this gets chopped down I don't before this tent is free so the other plant has a month to veg and I think in a month I can get it to a pretty decent size but yeah you could sell the bus here are nice and swollen ready to put on some more weight lollipop the whole bottom nothing but buds up top yeah so that's about it guys any questions comments whatever get at me the comments section keep subscribing and then yeah stay posted for the harvest of this and the new pink sunset grow along that pink sunset man it's I've heard and I've seen that it grows pretty [ __ ] pretty amazing so I'm really looking forward to that strain and I hope to get my hands on some some Girl Scout cookies hopefully some animal cookies maybe some gorilla glue just introduce some new strains to the to the cycle here but on that's a guy for you guys peace", "ugqu2_fk1gM": "hey guys welcome to Ruth basement I'm room this is my basement today we got some spark joints we were up in wenatchee we're up at the joint and we picked up some joints alright so this is a little 4-pack ok it comes I've already been into these but it comes with a sticker over the top sealing this Park shut and then this sides is perforated right this front little kind of like the cigarette pack would open right so if you punch her with your thumb I didn't even notice this until after the fact I was just getting ready to shoot this video and then I noticed this I was going to compare these out to the drift box that we picked up earlier how I like how that that box kind of opened up real easily um and this box had this little flap that I had to open up after i got this sticker peeled off but that wasn't the case actually i didn't even need to peel that sticker off I just needed to perforate this with my thumbs but I didn't even notice that so we automatically just pull off the sticker open it up like this boom we smoked one of these a little while ago but so yeah I didn't even notice this perforation edge which is kind of nice I mean I do like that little BAM looks like you know it's like cigarettes end in there you remember a few years ago we all thought Polish name you know was going to get legalized of course it did get legalized but we all figured ho yeah we'll be just a while before we see you know certain name brand cigarettes with you know embellish green across them you know Bo marijuana cigarettes you know they're here guys um this is the fact right now I've got a four pack you know I don't know when we'll see 20 pack or if there are 20 packs out there right now but right now we got a four pack so we're going to go ahead and spark one of these up and sheriff's here boom it's a cone is a little one of the guess it'd be point 75 is a for gram joint or not for gram joint there's four joints and there's three grams split among those four joints so if you do the math five point three quarters of garam joint okay everywhere that's all right though all right so fans of the show will know that I'm not a huge fan of the cone okay this one's just kind of folded over they don't often come very well stuffed okay they they run a lot they go out I'm just not a big fan of combs pre-rolled phones I've never tried to stuff a call to myself maybe I'll do that on the show get a cone on the show see if I can do a better job than some of these manufacturers then been able to do of course there you know trying to mass produce them I could love and care of the mom or whatever I roll he hadn't seen me roll check out that how to roll of blog video it's on this channel I teach Ricky a troll blonde he tricky Anna step become good day did I even mention that we're smoking on a headband today this is this is one of our favorite strains on the show he really likes it it's sativa okay I've done a done another headband review we smoke some two joints by my noble farmers there were half grams each okay there were a little little smaller than these ones i really i really enjoyed those the best size of those okay I have a little run going on here so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to wet my finger and I'm just going to run it across the entire circumference of the joint in a nice circle even circle I just kind of get it to catch up and could almost draw fire line just moisten your voice in the paper around it keep it kind of it if it's going too far stop it from you slow it down a little bit it's not going to stop it but and you can you can always I usually take it i would like to roll these and make them all nice and all that but i didn't do that today we're just going to go off of you know default what they you know will help game how do they roll up but hope you can see that run knock something over but let's go ahead and moisten it okay see how it's it's down here right here but it's not burning right here so I'm going to do is I'm going to hold this up that side that I want burn and I'm going to take a hit from it and then going up is going to burn it a little bit faster because heat rises again you can already see is starting to catch up burn a little bit more evenly deal too much with the little pre-rolled joints on discuss so many people don't do it right ah so really it really depends on whether or not I feel like working with the joint today I didn't feel like working with one so just going to go ahead and and rana des is is you know kind of wet it a little bit I didn't I didn't twist it you may have seen another video or I I Twista I told that on a joint where I make it kind of wiggle down I get the get the weed down there are a lot of the times some of these some of these guys only you shake in their in their joints you know this if a lot of times you can pretty much guarantee that it's shake unless it says somewhere on there that it's an all bug joint you know well this was a fairly good deal I was 18 bucks for three grams you know this that's right on cooking that's a very good deal it lasted pretty well it didn't it didn't run that bad actually um I worked with a little bit I mean I've had I've had ones that completely fell apart they they were just unsalvageable even after you know working with them for a minute you know this one I didn't need to put too much working you know I didn't put any work into it before I did it and then I just I just moistened it a little bit more more like in there too much air flow on that one felt like it was just going to burn into cardboard if I stuck to our no astronaut good burnt ash that's not even to me no weed was was left on burnt in the entire joint a lot of times you know you go to ask the joint it falls apart you've still got the top of it on Burt let's not get guys so yeah these are pretty good

in the flower huh yep so like I said I don't [ __ ] with soil these are in soil and it's or they go through some [ __ ] man you don't say lack of water not enough root space they grew too fast and [ __ ] but they all right man this [ __ ] over here frosty as hell look at that [ __ ] yeah and that [ __ ] frosty its paw yeah this what it is man well give him straightened out them put a couple old lights up in this [ __ ] man and some amber yeah keep going through the thing this one [ __ ] up in going through its thing since its birth even in there so we go get up right sit here smoking on little stump so mild even though it was smoking on this time [ __ ] I'm smoking on some type of cheese yeah one of these cheese's where that's these [ __ ] look like you got a little Nome city - but that's what we do right he max them out and today tips start Burning Man if then you cut back a little bit you want to see that burn man you want to know how much you can get him you want to push them today limit to get the best out of them but that's what it looked like this will need some more light we're gonna get it all straightened out though they turn this stuff and [ __ ] just case they start falling the [ __ ] over yeah some others just look kind of right though they still id' you still I we're going something a little bit go get him straight though he just got getting a feeding [

give you the end oh I'm gonna move more light to it man like couple more lights man just to help these girls out if you don't want to [ __ ] off and not get your year of good decent yield because growing plants man you've been here counting your [ __ ] chickens before they hatch like yeah I'm I hope I'm gonna get this much I'm gonna get this much no you never get what you think you're gonna get unless you got your [ __ ] down pack you know your plant you know your regimen you know what you think got befoe and you know how you did it that's the only way you're gonna get a steady amount that's the only way is if you know what's up already but if you're just trying to plan out you're just trying to grow it doing different techniques and all that [ __ ] just to try some [ __ ] out while you growing which is part which is that's to supposed to do you supposed to experiment when you grow that's why when I first started growing I did it with like two plants you don't sayin just so I can start figuring some [ __ ] out but I doesn't have crops with 40 [ __ ] plans look at the videos [ __ ] outdoor plant coupled with indoor plants I didn't did some fucked-up [ __ ] they got wasn't supposed to do it but [ __ ] it [ __ ] that's how you do it Winnie when you happy you can grow a weed and [ __ ] you do [ __ ] overboard and [ __ ] in you learn can't be doing that alright I'm gonna do it like that you know I'm saying so you know I got my little six plants enough in the work though [ __ ] out those mother cuz I ain't even trippin my little six plants will probably use me as much as this project into you or close to it we're not getting done with these [ __ ] yeah but that's what it is man liking this [ __ ] back there man I'm liking this [ __ ] this blueberry air bear you gotta close to this [ __ ] yeah you gotta let me get some of them that get straight up see how this [ __ ] do on the water yeah alright [ __ ] you boy bdub power", "4pY6gwwlvp8": "you know what it to you coming after the update day late or better late than never alright so we're going to vent it right now you may be wondering with a big baby set and I'll get to that in a second so you guys could tell I ran into a little powdery mildew the problem bud so it's looking a lot better than it was before I you know I went in there and I cleaned some of the leaves off and it's better I just figured um since the big bug was in here which is really moist in here and you know it just wasn't helping but now that I've removed at home and she would take care of [ __ ] but he was home the headband ordinates clones are looking good nice and healthy stilted sherbert looking fabulous taking off now that has more room and more direct Sun sometimes you more direct CFL right you know it's gonna hopefully take off we got the Wi-Fi back there looking good in the girl fine at least we know it's routed nicely same with the pink sunset you got a GDP and I believe in Northern Lights in there darling so yeah guys this is the veg time let's go ahead and take take a look at the big boy so the headband the big boy that I had a when is it and transferred into flyer switched it over yesterday so this is day zero flowering the Durban widow's did get cut down to kill me trying this is the Northern Lights falling over which is basically woods last week just blushing really [ __ ] swelled up check that out new trauma like oh yes this might help get you guys some some close up so he's frosty Northern Lights so this stuff is pretty [ __ ] covered in trikes I mean look at that and they nice nice and chunky lugs they're not not flimsy or anything yeah Oh until you see also delicioso no goes more Rico that you see how good I could give up take a screenshot of that and put it as your wallpaper though so yeah anyways so the big boy is finally in here and has a little bit of room right here a little bit of room here but we all know that when you flower the first two weeks they stretch like [ __ ] crazy so when that happens I'm gonna get in that which I'm kind of going to buy pretty soon and I'm gonna try to keep this [ __ ] at this level cuz mice and my LEDs only about a foot and a half away so ideally I want to keep everything at this level fill out all the way from corner to corner and that way we have a 2 by 2 just completely full with the even canopy extremely stoked on so far happy with what I've what I produce here now if you could if you guys want to go ahead and count the heads with me we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 and then whatever creeps up with the stretch I'm looking at like between 15 and 20 [ __ ] decent heads on here I'm telling you guys I'm gonna get QP off this [ __ ] baby plan I said I probably get like her this was just like a little I was actually taking clothes off their supply and you know when I'm under plan we just tell me too much it just gets to that point where it's just like oh I can kill me so I decided to flower rate and get some bugs off of it and I'm glad I did cause look at this [ __ ] whoo all right guys unfortunately the other ten already turned off the bigger tent so I'll have a up day for you guys on that home to the following week but yeah guys I'll keep talking the comments keep subscribing I appreciate all that [ __ ] and yeah till then peace", "hWxhD09vvww": "what up boy Angelo so say back again I'm actually late I haven't been up here for over a year but I'm only doing this to show you all a quick update on this plant that I got it's or both of these plants buff off of my headband this one is definitely more healthy and way more vibrant it has better weight on it if I can get a close-up it actually got some purple in it so it looks really really good stuff we got some purple in the top in the Crown's of it yeah so you seola got a purple right up in there definitely looks good this one right here her family's has been falling off she's been stressing out she never quite got quite as big as this one she's always been a little runt but they both came from the same seed pot which is official headband both official headband seeds and plants so I'm gonna harvest her tonight she also she's has a little bit of purple as well but again she didn't come out as good and I'm gonna harvest her as a test plant for right now attentionally grew these small and kept them in smaller buckets intentionally because I just haven't been having time because I've been running it with this radio program and that eats up a lot of my time and a lot of the things that I do with that so yeah this issue is low so say checking in to headband plants also have another baby plant in there but she couldn't be no older than what a week oh and I've recently just topped a matter of fact I'll show you her real quick just to get it out the way yeah little baby one she's doing good but I definitely need to get my life set up switch stuff I got lights all around the plant and keeping it all around and stuff so it is especially on this particular headband plant you can see where that kind of it made a big difference especially in the undergrowth and the size of the buzz underneath last time when I was going I had so many plants and a lot of a buzz only the buzz at top where big ones and ones underneath were really not even worth harvesting this time a lot of the buzz structure is underneath because I have more light penetrating underneath the canopy and it made a big difference this go-around so again this is just a quick update new harvest where actually is not even new anymore I've been harvesting these things it is now what February 13 2007 seen my last harvest was February in 2016 so that'll tell you something right there so it's been over a year almost and yeah we're back so this is a headband and say good night because we're out of here peace [Music]", "1f2lvA2NgFU": "welcome to black cannabis culture this is 10 with another episode of black cannabis culture um today we

of just putting in a camp because to me just like the humidity x is what's making the can you know I'm saying do his job you know I mean so we could just [ __ ] and save ourselves some money instead of spending twenty dollars on a mother [ __ ] can and we can keep our same jars and just put those packs in there and get the same results or even close to the same results I'm saying I'm about to do that document documentary or documentation for you and my joints is coming in like this week and I go ahead and do the test for y'all but I'll get over to you too", "ewxShHt4Y2g": "alright guys so what I wanted to do um is do a small little video on germinating seeds and planning them a lot of people use the little jiffy you know peopie things that look about the size but the way I germinate my seeds by the time i get them into the peat pot the bottom stem is you know it's longer than the peat pot so you can see all those nice roots there mmm that's going to be nice strong one I'll have to star that one if you can see it anyways these are all headband seeds and what we got here is I use a smaller cup I think this is a 10 ounce cup believe it or not and they were all pre-soaked with a routing solution so that they can really well in a very mild nutrient a grove nutrients so what we're going to do is we're going to take an instrument here already padded this town like I said it was already wet wedded puta thoroughly soaked and we'll take this I'm just going to poke a hole down and lift it up so we already have a nice hole there for the seedling and a lot of people wait until you know only they have a tiny little piece sticking out I don't do that I wait until the see things about that size and it's kicking off this it's kicking off the seed boom I can just pull that off and what I'll do is to plant that I'll take a little piece of this paper towel that this is kind of silly I developed this over time and I was like how can i do that i put this piece of paper towel right over the hole okay we're going to take this little headband seedling will put the tail right on top of that paper towel now what we'll do is lightly just I push that down and it's just gonna go mmm see I want that tail to go all the way down into it to the bottom kind of I don't want to be sitting up there all just like coiled up I want to go all the way down on the bottom that's going to speed everything up a lot um I'll take this little seedling here and put it down in my grow room which is the bedroom which is a 250 watt 6,500 k CFL and I just have one in my whole bedroom and it by tomorrow we will have nice seedlings um there will be it'll be this tall and they'll be going because they're already this far along instead of having a tiny little bud you know of a seed I'm trying to look and find the smallest one I have here like the smallest this one know if you can see that that's small so uneasy and kick the seed off yet I probably won't even plan that one just because it's not a not going to be genetically superior than the rest that of like I have ones that are you know like this one was just furry Rudy and good you know you don't want to plant all those other ones and then just end up taking them out anyways so I just want to do a little you know thing here on how I plant my seeds and how I get a higher germination and see you know survival rate the all these seeds were in 24 hours distilled water and then I take them out and I put them in a well ring do you want to get the paper towel wet this paper towel right here okay you want to get it wet but then take it and putting in the sink and bring it all out not till all the waters gone but as as much as you know that it's gonna still be damned then you put it inside the ziplock bag put it on top of I put it on top of my fish tank no listen but um so yeah you know that's how it goes and then we'll take these put these downstairs and let them just you know get the thing on and a foliar feeding with a little bit of um bio marine from general organics and there we go these things will take off like you know a flying start but everybody have a good day and take it easy peace", "KqJzZqlTbfM": "thanks rolling

taste that comes along with it I was said that in Humboldt County known strong was getting popular in that leg and DNA genetics tried to recreate it so essentially there are two strains with the same name going around and that 707 had been the original parents of the strain are said to be og cush master Christian Sarah diesel but no one really knows but that's what the guest says and trying to recreate that DNA genetics that came up with their strength medical jane dot-com gives it a great review the medical benefits are said it's good for pain depression stress nausea and insomnia baby

done for you if you've had the original string let me know what it's done for you researching this I came I can only conclude that there are two strains of the 707 headband walking around and I would

with a lemon cake with one knit one of them is a lemon cake feminize oh and in the back of the cup is this 7:07 headband clone next to it it's the big button of the light CBD eCall big big but another life CBD clone and critical kush clone which started rooting right now and spent five days awesome I got to get more buckets another thirty right now to clean them and so I could put those things I could see more clones to this critical cut so pretty ever since I've been trying to advance nutrients grow the two part which is like the grow bloom kind of sore they need branch out a lot I mean a lot and I and and the only difference is that I've been using that for grow for the seedlings I used to use the three part eventually the street part the grow bloom micro with some b-52 sensi sign and some rule enhancers that I use that are not advance nutrients which I used to clone with that rule dead lands and it's [ __ ] awesome a super Lemon Haze already taking off full of rules so it's that one this one is slowing that I don't know I'm gonna do I got hit with some rust fungus in here and it was a pain to get rid of it I had to wipe down the whole [ __ ] tent sorry foreign language with neem oil and some of those fluoride wax white bees let it dry out then I put them back in I turn off the fan he's getting cold and it seems to work everything kicked back into our growing one of the tell-tale signs of the rust fungus is everything slows down and you start seeing the spots but everything's just growing there will be no new growth very very skinny sickly looking growth so yes she got hit pretty hard but I got rid of it as you can see now she's I know that one part I burn I got caught in the thing so he killed it but other than that everything is coming along hopefully I have it'll be a green Christmas for me sorry the video cut off yeah hopefully you'll be a green Christmas for me so everything is growing I got I haven't been this Tupperware this is a eight ball high output so it gives out a lot lumens and I like to keep them a little close because that he helps with the growth in here in this tent which tends get cold so you do have to cry some he although I'm inside inside of a building still my voice so whiny sorry it's my sinuses I'm using an advanced mutagens through all of them except for the root enhance I have it somewhere upstairs I'll show you yeah this is my setup this is my update thanks for watching", "sREI8SuWRms": "this thing's huge head round it's only getting thicker 20 hours I guess let's go really far for you to see the whole plant yeah you can see other videos of when this was originally clone but and then it's finished maybe two years old", "YdYDJ4nS3iQ": "hey guys so today's video is going to be my video and this it's going to be how I kind of do my big wavy curls and then my little pullback twisty pieces and kind of how I personally do it um does a couple things I want to say before I get started and number one is I'm terrible at hair I am NOT creative when it comes to hair or doing hair things like I'm sure you guys have realized the only hairstyles you've seen ian is straight curly or ponytail like I don't do anything fun I can't I can barely even do a button like whenever I tried to abundant still doesn't look good so I never do buns I never do anything this is like the first thing I've ever been able to do where it was kind of cute so I was like all excited about this um but seriously your own that probably never see you here to show off for me again because I'm terrible at hair second um if you notice Olli probably won't notice my hair looks like it always does you know it's the same like this it always has been I do have really long hair but one thing I have done recently which all I did yesterday was on my hair felt very damaged and it's been feeling very damaged lately so what I did yesterday was I went to the hair salon and I got my hair cut they cut off about 2 inches from the length and then probably three to four inches from the top layers so really my hair is not that much shorter than it was before but then I got clip-in hair extensions that are the exact same length as my hair was so if you see towards the bottom here my natural hair stops here and then the extension stops here so you see like I got the extensions thinking I was going to be getting a lot more length taken off but I didn't so now it's just like I put the extensions in in my hair's just the exact same length that was before you know so it's not I didn't get these for like a lot of length I got them to bring my hair back to the exact length it was before I got my hair cut does that make sense I hope it does but it also adds some thickness which is nice obviously if your hair shorter than mine it'll not a lot of more like a dramatic length but like I said for me it kind of just makes my hair look exactly as it did before I got it cut anyways huh um so that's that the brands this is the brand of hair extensions i buy i would not recommend this to really anybody and I don't do it myself and that is I would never buy extensions online like I don't care how high quality pictures you have you do not know exactly what color your hair is in hair extensions unless you see them in person I get mine at Sally's Beauty Supply that's why I've always got in mind these were a hundred and thirty nine ninety nine and then they had like you get fifteen dollars off if you join the Sally Beauty club which is for you which is awesome and then when i bought these i got a free argan oil spray and i got a free bag so that was pretty cool so that's where i get mine you know whatever and that way i can always make sure i'm getting the right colors so those the ones i bought that's what i'm doing i touch my hairline this video because it's a hair video so don't be mad at me and that's pretty much it so i hope you guys enjoy the video and if you want to see how i get this hairstyle and please keep on watching the first thing i'm going to be doing is spraying in like a treatment kind of thing now you can use like a hair he protected I just heat protectant whatever in the world you want i'm using this stuff it's um let's see one and only argan oil spray treatment blah blah blah it's basically argan oil in a spray form I got this um for free when I bought my extensions from sally beauty supply it's one of the Sally Beauty Supply brands so you can only buy it there because you know they do their whole thing so I'm just going to spray a light amount of this and I'm going to focus it in the back here because my hair is more damage back here at the top and then at the ends and I'm only doing like a couple sprays of this I kind of fluff my hair in the mist you know I mean do what it was like okay that's good right and then I'm just going to brush my hair out and i'm using this goody thing I don't want to show you too close because there's hair net and I'm embarrassed but it's just like one of those I've heard I'm sure you've heard of the tangle tamer this is like that but it's from goodie and it's only like a couple dollars at target so that's what I use in and it just makes it really easy to detangle your hair like my hair gets sub tangley and this thing is just like amazing already so now my hair is sort of he protected it is now fully brushed out and everything so there's not any tangles but there will be in about two seconds because that's where my hair is so anyways I am going to now section my hair so I start out with bottom simple stuff go straight back and then I'll just pull this top stuff up and it's already and then I'll split that in half and then just go through and Carl now the curling iron team using today is my new me styling wand and I've kept ugg boots down below for two hundred dollars off and then um I have a giveaway and you're going to have to like my twitter like my facebook follow me on instagram follow them on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and put in your email address and then you take this quiz and then after you take the quiz then you put your social security number and your other email address and then um we'll let you know now I'm kidding this is um the brand is Jose EE bear I got it in the middle of the mall you know there's annoying people that come up to you in the mail the mall be like oh let me do your hair yeah that's where I got this and um I got up four years ago and it still works really well and I love it so basically it's just like one of the wand thingies and I'll just start out with a section and I've wrapped like this there's two different ways you can wrap your hair I guess I'll just show you really quick so you could wrap it by holding it and then just continuing to hold in the same spot and as you see that hair kind of twists around on itself and that will give you more of like a wavy kind of look but if you want like traditional ring light kind of curls you um go like this and then just keep kind of fixing the hair to make sure it lays flat the entire way around if that makes sense as opposed to like twisting up on itself all the way around do you get it out so yeah I'm going to just do that all the way around the bottom and then I'll move on to the other sections you alright and I want to get up here basically I just kind of you know you have your part whatever just go back from my part and split this in half and then put this up now um some people don't have to section their hair this much I just have a lot of hair so I have to do a lot of sections to make sure that all the hair gets curled you know to me so I'll take the side and I'll split this one in half as well and I just push my fingers straight back and then I will clip this up and then basically i'll just do the same thing for the rest of my head so i'll do the same kind of curling technique here take this down to this one and then the same over here I'll split it in half and then do that section in them that section and that's it and then I'll come back after I'm finished all that already so all the hair is curled now I'm just going to spray in some hairspray really quick i use the awesome mega hairspray because it's really an expensive it's only a couple dollars like three dollars as huge and it just smells nice works really well and I just sprayed very lightly my hair holds a curl fritti well and this hair specific curling iron works really well for curling hair like I could curl my hair and if I didn't wash my hair for like five days my hair would be curly all five dates like that's it lasts really belong these girls do so here's curly and everything so now I'm going to add my extensions and you don't have to do this this is totally optional so next time you're just a little bit of teasing I'm really not good at this guy's so it's not like I'm doing this I'm have a beautiful like bump back here that does not happen I'm terrible at teasing my hair ask chris he always wants me to tease my hair because he likes the way it looks but I'm just like well I'm worried I'll try it never works anyway so I'll take this little piece like this at the crown spray a little bit of hairspray this is the comb I use its conair teasing comb its got like a comb within a comb so it's good for teasing and then I get kind of just go like that a couple times give me a lift and then I'll go just a little more up here little spray and then do the same thing just a little bit because like my part here tends to want to part all the way back so I do that so that my part isn't so crazy and then I'll just kind of take these little pieces here I won't do a spray too much or do too much I'm just doing this so that it kind of there's not just bump here you know what I mean it'll kind of go all the way around that area you know what I mean guys I hope so I'm terrible at hair so um really not explaining this very well that's right okay so there's that done and I mean that's pretty easy as you can see like I said just don't really do anything to me it'll just make it so you can't really see anything not that you can really see anything anyway um but whatever anyways so next comes the twisty part so I'm going to take part of my bangs and I just going to go straight down the front here until I get to my eyebrow area you know that's my bruh and make sure I get some kind of longer piece and this is a little tricky now that I've got my hair cut because of the way it was cut like I don't really have too much thickness or length right here but anyway so I'll take some of this and then make sure it's smooth and then basically just twist it like this really easy now this will kind of loosen up a little bit after i put it up so not to worry if it looks really like smooth down and stuff so I'll hold down my mouth and I do this on the other side you get that quick look so good push push push oh okay okay and then and then I'll just pull them back and that little volume kind of helps this part look a little poofy and pretty so I'll go back and what could have helped me with this because I've wanted been trying to do this kind of hair cell for so long and it could never never looked right something was always wrong and I finally realized what it was was that I was taking it too far down this way so try to bring it up higher than you would think it would look right like you might think this is too high like it's not going to look whit but I promise so just taking it over here up here and i'll turn around in a second okay so as you can see hopefully terrible at this case i'm trying so then I'm going to take bobby pins and I'm going to make it x so there's this strength here i'm going to put it underneath on underneath that strand and up sort of kind of like diagonal and then take my other one and go underneath this strand over here and on top of the other bobby pin and cross them and then push them together really hard and that will really make sure these are tight tight tight together because sometimes they fall through that wider part at the end of the bobby pin does this make sense I'm talking too much anyways I personally don't care that you can kind of see these bobby pins I mean if you could like pull some hair over them if you really want to i think only one of them showing I don't know but you could cover those if you want to buy sticking them like underneath the hair I personally don't really care so if you care then you know fix that the way you want to and then sometimes my bangs fell out of this so I'll usually just pull those out and then pull them down easy so they're not falling let me just check this is okay that's yours yeah yeah that's pretty much the gist of it I can't like I'm so confused right now wait it's a little poofy for me today but whatever it works I can just kind of press it down I'm like so weird about certain things I don't like too poufy to blow 10 so that's what it looks like from the back and I'm just gonna um brush through the hair nail she's a big round brush for this and this kind of helps to mesh the hair together like the real with the fake so you brush it through together with all your real hair and that'll kind of break up the curls and everything will kind of just blend together you know what I mean I hope you know what I mean yeah see how it's all blends now very nice so here's what it looks like from the back I hope you can see it you probably can't you can sit up for a second that's a little ticked on the back super pretty and fluffy and here's what it looks like from the front again nice and fluffy and pretty and you happy little things now um I obviously know that not everyone's hair can look like this you would really need long hair already um I really don't recommend people with like hair anywhere shorter than here to use long extensions I hate when people do that because you know it just looks really a Nashville because you have like hair to here and then all of a sudden long hair and it's like no one cuts layers like that like it's so obvious so um if you have shorter hair it obviously won't look like this but this technique you mean you can still do that and that still looks you know really pretty no matter what length your hair is having these little kind of pullback little pieces are super cute on everybody um and yeah that's pretty much it I'm really hot right now guys like four seriously but um yeah so that is it I hope you guys enjoyed it I hope you could see everything I have no idea i'm about to watch this and see how bad it looks haha but um yeah that's pretty much it so hope you enjoy fixing things okay see you guys later bye", "NOZPuWel_ZQ": "good morning YouTube yes yes yes here we go

got my hands on some headband always heard about this [ __ ] no I'm sad and now I could report back to my stone the community fan of that I have indeed partook oh my bad partaking now first of all you know this [ __ ] is a [ __ ] banger first off I'm the taste it's like a first when I opened their smelter bag it's like a [ __ ] a floral a floral kind of taste it's a different different smell it's a floral kind of snow Sutton knows that I'm trying to figure out what it is it's like a it's like some type of zesty like zesty kind of zing to it if that makes any sense it's like a zany kind of it tastes like a like a very sharp Genki like I said it's like a Zee zesty kind of it says knock off that door fleek as you can see but yeah definitely floral let's take a look at the butt work dark green leaves and it's lime green leaves as well which a classic armchair sprouting over here and there because definitely a headbanger they called a headband from what I hear cuz it feel like I should just hide just wrap around your head like you got a [ __ ] pair headphones on or something let's check out the stats it says it's the love child of cannabis power couple oh gee cushion Sour Diesel Oh signal wonder yo yo that headband is OG Kush no one the matter of fact that says I was snickered of that might be that sour got a little taste I was trying to put my finger on that I was like oh it's a zesty kind of sang econ except there might be got a little sour a little sour taste this [ __ ] yeah very dank but ok so it's a it's a cross between oh gee push which by the way I love you I adore but last time I checked oh gee cush has a high CHC weight of pretty much any weed so yeah so let's see it says smooth creamy smoke is accents about flavors of lemons and diesel while the long-lasting effects are great for pain relief helping you to relax and to combat elevated stress levels many report that effects create a slight pressure around the crown of their head part feels as though they have been wearing a headband but I've had citrusy weeds I'm saying I had lemon flavor lemon scones Lemon Haze and [ __ ] like that everybody's different you know the palate is different what tastes like one thing to somebody else when I taste like somebody else so you describe it different but I don't definitely a winner tastes marvelous and I'm saying and you heard the stats from the pros I'm your boy flow tonight this has been another string review brought to you by the hood ministers show States own people", "i-zk-Rxays4": "what's going on everybody check it out the headbands you know they are coming down their last final stages here they're getting their last feeding today in regards of a bug harder that i've been using check it out mendo avalanche flower hardener also has a seek help in there that I pacifically like anyway it's a derived from a seek help Esther has just phosphoric acid in it and for those of you have ever used phosphor low or gravity pretty much does the same thing but a little more organic but anyway let's take a little stickler peak everything's dancing out still a lot of white hairs so some time to finish but this is their last feeding I'll be going in there and the bottoms and taking out all the mulch that I have in there all the loose stuff and try to get as much as the heavy harvest I can out you know this way i can start flushing it out with think right now i have in tag number three over there the last one I have a flushing agent some reasons not coming to mind it's not final phase it's whatever it's a flushing aging botanic hair some some I've been using that to flush you had some other things that I've harvested already I also I want to get some final phase for these in particularly so the heavy harvest will stop working it's one of those products were a little Pacific with it all they will tell you that yes it's there you have to use it because that's what that's what they make you do anyway let's not go there all chunking out I'll look a nice thick [ __ ] hard you can see they're flopping everywhere I can't stand on their own anymore dunk you know I'm saying they're getting their I've already harvested some GDPs that's what I pulled out for shits and giggles I mean it took me like it took me forever it's like pulling out the sword from the stone like Excalibur effingham it was how rootbound you know thick white roots was nice all the GDPs are kind of getting you know that in that purple tint I don't if you can see it on camera they're getting they're being flushed they're getting ready to be pulled in a couple days silver haze still has a long time ago not a long time but it's all ittle bit to go you know all the hairs are white still so I said thinking that a little bit but I knew that would be a little bit another silver maui's they're cool with a little too too little bushy Maui's something different to smoke on I have a couple of those around here that is put in late silver cush this one's coming down to this one's being flushed super hard dense nugs the smell is just it's complex match has that cush smell but then it hits you with that like I like to say the snowcaps no booms there's a cushy snow cap and its really smells awesome wait widow I had some [ __ ] caterpillars in here they've been turned tearing [ __ ] up so I've been going here every day looking for damage town I'm out spending it with with a caterpillar control or bacillus detritus a specific name of it's like a bacteria that spreads pours out and kills the caterpillars on contact basically but anyway let's keep talking another GDP that's being flushed doing a thing I did have a couple bud rot spot so I did a couple ones but I just cut that out you know it's which all you have to do is cut it out and keep your eye on it this bulb is being flushed kind of funny to it's getting real cool because if bob was actually turned little has some purple hues to it so be purple bubba you know it's all because of the cold though yeah and all the Armageddon's have been harvest I ready so they're gone and thus our super sour skunks gone and the midnight is gone and I was pretty impressed with those plants out of the midnight the little plant it was only the size of this plan right here and I got a half pound off of it easily so uh yeah yeah I want to Ranbir on too long I guess is the last month to show you uh crazy train she's nice she's frosty as [ __ ] she smells nice but that's it base", "cwuQK1iu86Q": "hey everybody love you Jen coming to you again with a another test I guess we're taking a look at two types of cannabis here what we have here is some good old-fashioned LA confidential indoor organic hydroponically grown looking at about nine percent you can see that this grower didn't take too much time on the trimming leaving a lot of the sugar leaf on now some people like this some people don't I don't really mind too much everything kind of goes into a grinder for me um so I mean aside from that it looks beautiful crystal formation under the microscope is fantastic the trichome heads or perfectly formed they got a nice haze goodhue to them the only thing I can see about this is it's it's a tad bit green I think a little more time hanging in the dark to allow the chlorophyll to go away would give you something a little bit better a good example of that is right here now this is what they call a blue headband it comes from a blue dot hybrid back strain from what I'm told anyways this is it's quite beautiful it's definitely hybrid leaning more towards the sativa side you can tell by how sparse it is here in the center sativas tend to be a little bit you know fluffier but it's still dense nonetheless and I know for a fact that this was indoor on these both come from the same patient this one here from my understanding is closer to nineteen twenty percent on your alkaloid contents the Delta tetrahydrocannabinol and the cbc easy ends so forth and so on um Buckner and I are going to take a little time and do a little testing on these things and see what we got and then we're going to go ahead and do a little testing out of the medication by actually using it and and seeing the effects so what we like to do is we like to try one one day and then start fresh with a new day and go with the other one and we'll give you the results on the flavor and taste but as for now we are looking at the alley confidential and the blue headband blue had been so le confidential really good maybe could have used a couple more days curing in the dark and the blue headband which has a nice grayish hue to it definitely was probably stuffed in the back and was hanging a little bit longer I'm really excited about this one in particular it's hard to find a good sativa that you know that gives you what you need medically as far as well muscle relaxant and nausea control and stuff like that this one here um you know the LA confidential is a hybrid this one to me it looks like possibly this one had a little little too much of the nitrogen because as you can see it's it is dense but it is it is kind of stretchy i would say stretchy definitely between the internodes there and the nodes are the parts where the the flower or the bud itself actually attaches branches off as you can see there's one here at the end and then one up here they're both kind of doing that the girl might possibly just have is light a little too high it could be a nutrient thing I'm not exactly sure I'd have to ask them but if you guys have any ideas and you know let let me know definitely leave a comment if you like what we're doing here and you have some suggestions or you want us to go ahead and test your strain and tell the people where they can you know meet up with you and see if you guys can work together you know patients legal patients here in the state of California I know there's other states out there that also have medical laws keep fighting guys keep fighting because it's definitely for a good cause and I and we're starting to see more reasonable people in this area people who actually you know care about what's going on this isn't just the pot game to them this is about care health care and the you know the practical applications as well you know commercial and industrial so enough of that stuff I'll get off my soapbox and we'll get to testing Buckner and I tend to frequent places like can of cat and we also often use google hangout google+ hangout so um you know let us know if there's a night you want to hang out and show us what you got you know definitely we'd love to hear it we'd love to hear everything because everyone's got their own techniques so again coming from casa del low-key this is low key gen and we're trying out the LA confidential and the blue headband", "Y3bVp0ZExlM": "all right guys what's up still vibes here coming at you with another strain review what you're looking at right now is this beautiful headband from

really good herb really nice frosty and then you can see the difference between the nugs the headband you can see the difference between between indoor and outdoor the indoor is definitely more caked with trichomes uh towards the stem you can just see down there it's just covered this [ __ ] it's more you know it's they're both beautiful weed guys they're both a great smoke but um yeah this [ __ ] is just wonderful right here i mean this is some quality herb guys but yeah guys if you like this strain review um subscribe like for more um yeah guys that's about it [ __ ] peace", "XUU8m1a_rNo": "good morning YouTube we're in the small flower room headband it's almost harvest time there's a lot of hairs on here unfortunately see it's little focus here I've kind of hard to see this stuff is really really frosty of the best lighting a lot of yellowing going on none of this back here has been plucked whatsoever other stuff has been cleaned up quite a bit Bud's aren't going purple but the leaves are couple nugs have already broken off and have been tested and apparently this [ __ ] is just psycho Wow psycho that's a quite a funky description I know how yellow the leaves look they look Neon Neon then the hairs on here that are white neon products cool yeah once this garden is done the patient is you're going to want to want to do less plants instead of doing all their plants at one time so they are they going to do a perpetual harvest from now on which is pretty cool beds suck get the new pots finally for this guy [ __ ] is just roasted to the tents god I love it gotta love it Oh a little soil on the leaf there a good example here some leaves are going to want to pull off gotta love the nugs I'm trying to hold this still the buds actually got they're not big at all they're really not really small but they're not very big this room had a lot of problems this time I think the major factor was there was no co2 in this room Oh actually that's not even the major factor I think the heat was a major factor if they got up to 95 in here for like three weeks at night with each other wasn't working at night so I couldn't bring the temperature down once the lights went off and also there was no co co ji for almost two weeks weak forward five i believe so that's like prime time for bud development so these things have had many many issues but it's still going to be some quality medicine and there should still be enough to at least get the patient by bottom branches here really hairy smells amazing thanks for watching YouTube have a great day", "06lLNTz-938": "what's a few to mr. Greene my back against my strain review of headband I've heard some positive things about this through some friends of mine and also through the YouTube community so when I thought I just had to pick a little bit up just to try it out for myself my last blog of it here well actually I'd you have a little bit put aside but it's my emergency fund got everything in front of me just to indicate they're saying it's the mainly indica bun but I find most strains to their hybrid it's pretty hard to find a in straight in the codominance train but that's what they're claiming it is its origins are a sour diesel crossed with OG kush and the guy at the dispensary originally recommended it for me for also my sleep just because i tend to have bad thoughts before sleeping he says the strain is very euphoric and also causes a kind of a couch lock effect so it might be good for me to get sleep so and try a little bit of the suit unfortunately I have the grinder propping up my camera so i can't really grind it up with that some finger bust out a quick sesh here sure it got my bowl and harder just so not a second you [ __ ] up some Bulls not going to work but it's pink but I left to do so it's for my strain review so far I'm definitely getting a strong a diesel smile coming up from its kind of overpowering actually which I never really noticed a true full on diesel smelling weed before this is very strong a diesel spelling now loaded up a fat ass bowl just so I can get a real um true perception of this weed and by the way this is also my first wheat of the day this is my wake and bake so I don't have any tht my system currently so this is going to be a non bias or a non tainted review rep in case you guys are wondering now this light area which is I'm keeping around just because my favorite lighter it does work I'm in the sun's that is that a fine by down a little sparking it doesn't seem to ignite it anymore so I have to use another lighter to ignite it but i like using and so who very strong definitely filling that down the fact that couch lock effect but also very euphoric at the same time hmm actually giving me really nice for you when we go on for a little second bow on that just so I get more of a directed I'm going to go in on my other bone which I don't like these as much just because I'm used to the taller bongs but I to find the smaller ones give me more direct it so to speak what as you guys can see my camera propping skills aren't the greatest but i'm trying to illinois the light so you guys get a better angle try to get the fusion soft shot going in this bomb just because it's a really cool diffusion on it but are they like it personally whoo well after just two bowls i have to say that put me on my ass so it's definitely going to be one of me to buy again that actually i would does the master ish i just add recently so yeah for an overall strain review headband if you see in your dispensary yeah definitely go forward that's a kickass string anyways guys a piece out if you like anything you see on my channel please check out some of my other videos and I could like anything you see please like and subscribe a great date is",

Maggie's crochet need a work in crafts and in this video I'm gonna show you pattern number PA eight one eight that's available at Maggie's crochet calm this is floral bouquet of dishcloth set one in another video I show you set two so there's seven in each set so if you had both sets you could make 14 gorgeous floral dish cloths so all of these were made out of worsted weight yarn and I used cotton of course that's the best yarn to use for dishcloths and this skill is easy and each one is about nine and a half to ten inches across and I think that's about it I will show you each one this one is started from the center it's a rosebud dishcloth and with double crochet stitches and then you go to change to green for the leaf V stitches and then you do a cluster stitch for the rosebuds here and then you go back to white that's so adorable and here's a beautiful rose dishcloth and there's a video on YouTube where I show you how to do a rose and work behind the petals so if you've never done that before that's a good way don't learn by watching the videos and my youtube channel is Maggie Weldon and here is a beautiful pansy so you work the pansy and then you do chains behind the petals so that you have something to build the next round onto and then these leaves are worked separately and sewn on here is a daisy and these this has long cluster stitches to create those petals and I'm going to do a YouTube video on that one too on that flower or something similar to that so you see how it's made here's a carnation carnation is a lot easier than it looks you work in a circle of single crochet you work in the back loop and then you come back and work in those unused loops and you do these chains to make a creative flower and then you work in the unused loops on the final round and you create the rest of the dishcloth working off those loops so here you start with a double crochet circle this is for the forget-me-nots and then you work the green off the white here for the leaf round and then you make these little flowers separately and you sell them on and this is the little sunflower and this is a little single crochet chain one circle and then you work the petals and then behind the petals you work a little chain lubes you can see the chains back there and then on those chains you work double crochets and then a little single crochet chain around there and it comes out really pretty and I love this color combination another combination might be to use blue behind here like maybe a royal blue and be really pretty with white would be nice so all seven of those patterns come in the one pattern which is pattern number PA eight one eight and that's available at Maggie's crochet comm thank you very much for watching", "kEX-MjfBOpU": "sorry have a little problem with the video previous video so this is part two of the recycling of the cocoa and as you can see those are roots fiber if you could see them you remove them that's for sure I mean that's work for whatever you want to put in to remove it but now the cocoa is all loose and ready to go back again and before I had walked my plant for a month yes some people will say that washing your plans for a month is a lot it is not some case they retain a lot of especially if you use some kind of other potting material it may retain already have in it fertilizer and those that after you fill them with fertilizer to retain a lot but I do wash for the last month four weeks I don't give any fertilizer only water so when I'm done my t my my pH is good in the ground is neural because of the Google and my part per million is a little very low too because the rally's already washed but if you don't do that whether you could do it's just before you empty all of them you wash them properly with clear water in the San the tub or something that you have that you could drain it or outside or whatever flog them really good long wall blend the water to it make sure this parts are a million come down you could test your ppm after make sure your ppm is low so you know that you washed every fertilizer out so after this after you record them I'm gonna show you the stuff that we're using here and this is the all the fertilizer I'm using advanced nutrients so they've been using for a long and it's really good so you're gonna use this to put in your first watering for to help the roots being combust and used by the plant so this is gonna turn your roots into food for the plants himself and it's gonna help your you're using your recycling your you could find this on advanced Aryans pretty much anywhere I don't have it on the website already but it's gonna come here you have overdrive that I use in the flowering period but candy voodoo juice the three parts here I use floral nectar which is sugar cane and molasses and the pro silicates for silica especially if you grew in cocoa if you grow in cocoa you need this because in natural ground it's there naturally so the plant use it but in cocoa cocoa don't have it and the plan become deficient and your stem become very weak and brand your branch flop and with this it's gonna be sturdy and this I use it more a little bit during the the veggie cycle but not much it's more at the end of the flowering cycle to give retain the taste and if I wash for a month if everything is going anyway but it's just healthy the plants this this is our sample I don't use that voodoo juice is really really good voodoo juice will do his job as a voodoo but candy makes you a bud swell like crazy but anyway go back to the well I could show you a little bit here what's going in there next that's what's gonna happen next that was here there's hate there and there are 16 there 16 going in a room and on the hate I keep seven one

now I want to show you a whole different look for Yvette this week is called Christy I love this on YouTube it's chic do you very much Vegas one of your friends has anyone said anything well they like it very much I like my hair you know and a couple of them I've admitted it's a wig but then others that don't know they they just know it's a style change mm-hmm for me and they basically like it but I like the wig too because it it makes a statement and it's trim it's pretty and I feel good when I wear it and that's most important you know and we talked about when women are going through chemotherapy having choices when you wake up in the morning that's really what empowers you so did you get any bangs the banks on a headband no so I'm going to show you and you the other item alright and actually it's a surprise and I'm gonna give it to you as a gift because I love it it's gift day for me oh my god so watch this because even the most amazing wig you don't want to have to wear every day so Godiva's secret offers bangs on a headband you think that's just a headband and then you would wear a hat over or a hat a scarf a turban unbelievable unbelievable it's amazing all the things you kept with the ladies thank you know so this is just a simple urban bill I'll be darned Lily hearing isn't that great anything I love yeah it's great it's just that a little illusion of here that because most ladies I find you know they're wearing the whole hat right or some of them are going without anything right you know I don't have that courage not yet and you don't need to know you know they they have my point it's beautiful and they're going through chemo you don't necessarily want to stand out there's enough different things going on you just want to blend into society so the bangs and great wigs are things that just help you during that's okay help you to look great when you look in the mirror and give you the confidence but you going out your day so look I'm going to show you what this is just I hate you I'm grating and I'm gonna put your Christi back on oh thank you I I'm so Christy and I have bonded your best your BFFs but I like Carly too well I should ask you which we do you want to wear outfit no because I want to keep this until next week for this special but I may when I make my entrance oh so amazing this is about empowering women that are going through medical challenges and saying you know what it's only hair and in the meantime our wigs are amazing and we'll get them through anything just so wonderful thank you for sharing with all of our

in here this is the batch obviously our next two to go in is going to be these two is the or Boris number two is the fee no D I really liked a lot and then TJ's Jack the Ripper today is also a transplant day so I'm going to transplant here real quick i'll show you guys what that is this is our this are going to go into 10 gallon pots is the oral Boris number two fino seat another one I like a lot and then plus Barry times sweet and sour diesel we've got any plants of them yet 23 or we got four plants of them there's one these two are going into 10 gallon pots and then now this is a fee no number three the plush Barry time is a sweet and sour diesel from red line and then that's the number two and then in the one gallon pot right there that's going to the number one that's number four and then this is Jilly bean from TGA we've got a foot and a half tall right now it's a feed day I'm giving them a tea so it's going to be good to transplant an obvious I'm gonna clean up them leaves that's like a daily daily thing clean up leaves once I transplant I'll get them off these milk crates as well but it'll be a little squished this is what we got to do here we are with the cheesecake the strawberry cheesecake from Revlon genetics today is day 61 we're go ahead and chop or down not as frosty as I'd like but very very very dense nice-sized nugs has a very great fruity smell reminds me it still reminds me a lot of the cheese berry just dry it out no chopper down against the strawberry cheesecake from redline genetics we're back we did our transplanting we got this or Boris number two in front of us definitely needs some sort of caging just wasn't doing it with just that one steak or trellis nothing I mean it's you could see it minutes stacked nice but I mean it's kind of flimsy so I need some sort of caging but I put my cages on now just so I don't disturb any roots should we got this all set nice transplanted I've got to do my preventative maintenance sprayed today as well but I've got a family function to go to real quick so I'm going to do that later hopefully we'll get that in video bye so it's the following day now it's actually sunday i got back kind of late last night and just didn't didn't get a chance to get into here so today we're going to do we're going to do a preventative spray real quick and then going to bloom what's perfect because I just got to I do I got a water in bloom today so I got to move all the plants around but as for the spray goes I've turned off all the lights the fans for a couple hours probably don't have to just because i'm not using high intensity lighting only t5's but it's just what I do I like to it's not going to hurt the plants any because they're normally on the 20-hour light cycle as it is I've run my my veg tent here 20 hours on four hours off so here's what we'll be spraying today I switched it up every other week as of those every week but I'll spray the spinal sad whatever however you pronounce it this week and the next week is Organa side then that's some 90s some awesome stuff right there I had to do some moving around fit a lot of these in there and we're real close to the lights now but these are them head bands that we're back over there on that side again today is sunday june twenty ninth and I guess to start off with like I said I've got to move a lot of these around so i guess to start off with you want to do with these this is Jack the Ripper number two right in front of us then I believe that's number three right behind it they're both TGA is day five and then right here to the left or my head bands good night day 19 is a 818 head bands from cali connect within their day 19 stretching should be done I started lollipop in actually yesterday a little bit on this planet just to test it to see if it would no force it to stretch up more and it didn't so I'm pretty confident I will come in here probably not today just because I got so much to do but tomorrow and lollipop these up some more they're easily six foot tall right now in fact this one I here is a little bit taller than me that one is sorry I don't look down that was the number one right here it's really tall one I got a clone of it actually of all these headbands and the number one is by far the most vigorous grower and then over here this right here is the headband number two this one's a little bit older and you see it really need some water which is great because it says a water day this one is on day 34 but then we also have the girl scout cookies under the last video I said the wrong company this is from BC bud depot there's a freebie from attitude and is also on day 34 I said I got to move these around anyway to water so look up this off here move them around and we're right back go ahead and spray them up okay so now we got everything moved around in here there's a close-up of the girl scout cookies right here is tj's corkill yes and uh day 44 right here and then we have red line genetics King Arkell oh gee also day 44 there's that Jack the Ripper with day five do something with her forget these move back around with that headband number two day 34 it's the back side of it my feet like today I gave them a water just water and some kale meg but when I feed I turn a quarter turn on these square cages it's really easy to tell no obviously a quarter turn but usually I'll take note of where the tags are at and so every time I feed which is every four days I give them a quarter turn so get these moved around again and uh we're gonna be right back where we adjusted these headbands just because of the fact that these corals are coming out next as a matter of fact I think I'm going to pull this one tomorrow so I will not be feeding it they only been getting two straight water no cal mag or anything for the past couple weeks anyway same with this one at least a week same with that one but I'm going to pull this one definitely tomorrow look if I ever get a better look at this is tj's corkle this is day 56 today as always I want to thank everybody for all the wonderful comments last vid I always say I would never be here without anybody without you guys is helping this the truth everything I've learned I've learned here on YouTube and I thank you so with that I'll see you guys next week later and the lights were on ah", "O3xabf_c3ew": "she's a model an author a fierce force to be reckoned with and she makes us laugh is there anything she can't do welcome to Ms mojo and today we're counting down our picks for the top 10 funniest Chrissy Teigen moments can we burn this before we begin we publish new content every day so be sure to subscribe to our Channel and ring the bell to get notified about our latest videos for this list we're taking a look at the Chrissy Teigan moments both on social media and TV that made us laugh the most number 10 opening Rihanna's mail during an interview with Ellen Chrissy unwittingly confessed to opening Rihanna's mail after moving into her old house Teigen is unaware that she has essentially just confessed to committing a felony so luckily Ellen is there to set the record straight okay yeah cuz if that isn't funny enough Chrissy tells Ellen that she planned on returning the mail to the singer during the Grammys until her husband told her that wasn't cool bring it to the Grammys and John said no that doesn't look cool please we're not sure if Rihanna saw this interview but if she did we're sure she regularly sends someone to collect her mail now number nine the many faces of Chrissy Teigen Chrissy Teigen has a wealth of talents under her belt but when going undercover there are still a couple of things she needs to master thank you very much she donned some truly terrible disguises and highly questionable accents while visiting John on the set of his music video to grill him about their relationship everybody wants to know if I have a girlfriend today man it's like isn't really nobody's business honestly I'm just trying to shoot a video well technically now he's clearly in on the joke but it's funny to watch him push her buttons until calling her out all together as they kiss and make up it's hard not to laugh when Chrissy's Tom Selleck style mustache becomes part of the romance we're getting married if we don't trust each other what do we have that's what this relationship was built on you know what their mustache giving keys to trust to trust number eight her failed magic tricks a lesser-known fact about Chrissy Teigen is that she's quite into magic and even joined an exclusive social club for magicians I just became a member after two years of applying you have to really love magic and you have to have disposable income as she says you need quite a bit of expendable income to join which is lucky for her because she certainly didn't get in on her magical prowess oh my god where did that come from her two magic tricks fall hilariously flat and it's only made funnier when Jimmy Kimmel reacts with feigned surprise she is a woman of many talents but at least for now magic is not one of them Wow number seven Krissy doesn't know jack about John how much does chrissy teigen know about John Legend not much according to this game all right so here's here's the first question what's the name of the band John was a part of in the movie lala land oh no choices oh gosh it wasn't a great start when Chrissie asked for multiple choice but her blank expression for most of the questions is priceless what album did John win his first Grammy for and what year was it it's really no choices it's clear that she doesn't always closely follow John's career but in her defense at least she wasn't a creepy stalker before they dated and it is amusing to watch her learn more about him through the game people it was after that really mm-hmm I'll give you the first word get Oh get lifted yes yeah 2006 this is yeah I wasn't like yeah creepy stalker all right despite failing to answer most of the questions she still manages to show that she pays attention where it counts you're on a roll what does John's middle name Roger that's right number six hot wings challenge [Music] in this unconventional interview for every subject covered Chrissy has to try a different hot sauce and it just gets spicier and spicier as the episode progresses they cover a lot of ground such as the way the media reacts to your comments what title they should give this video what nugs really means and of course bug gate is he a nice bug or do you don't give him a kiss as they hit the harder stuff Chrissy struggles to keep her cool and eventually bypasses her glass to drink straight out of the jug it's great fun to watch although we would not want to trade places that'd be so cool if you got if the last one ended up like everyone's eye and then you end it's sick just sick it's like ice cream yeah like maple brown sugar right it's not number five charades skills Chrissy and John are the ideal couple that have around for a game night as we learned when they joined Jimmy Fallon for a game of charades what does that mean song okay boogie whether she's describing or guessing she never fails to crack the audience up and he's special dynamic between the couple makes them all the more entertaining to watch she gets super into the game and forgets the no-talking rule while prancing around mimicking a train not only do John and Chrissy make a sudden comeback and win the game they win all of us over to number four online clap backs be warned those who come for Chrissy Teigan because the queen of clap backs is always on hand with a quick-witted reply fed up with people trying to tell her how to live her life she has an answer for everything and you could spend hours scrolling through her social media and laughing your way through all her brilliant shutdowns some of her best clap backs are for comments that the internet trolls haven't even come up with yet in a nutshell if you come for Chrissy Teigen you will not leave unscathed number three haunted house one of the highlights of Halloween TV is watching Ellen's producer Andy face yet another haunted house and in 2018 Chrissy Teigen had the honor of joining him I'm here with my fellow model chrissy teigen we've done work together there we actions get more hysterical the deeper they get into the maze with a particular highlight being Chrissy screaming at the brush of a curtain [Applause] they were so hilarious that Ellen sent them for round two with Chrissy's mom whom they essentially used as a human shield they makes such an adorable team that we could just watch them on repeat until next Halloween number two her Mima bull face when you're always in the public eye it seems almost inevitable that eventually he'll become a meme at the 2016 Oscars Chrissy's cringe face was caught on camera and lo a meme was born this isn't the first time she's become a meme as her crying face at the Golden Globes became an instant mean - and even she was surprised at how fast it all happened she then hilariously tweeted an apology for not having practiced her crying face showing she can take it as well as she dishes before we unveil our number one pick here are some honorable mentions [Applause] hard to pose with them yeah you know what to do well look if I get too mean face and then John's just happy to be alive sorry to bother you my queen like who's bad what it was like m'lady [Laughter] number one any time she posts on social media she's regarded as one of the most influential celebrities on social media but if you're just looking for pure entertainment she's your gal whether she's providing political commentary or roasting her husband at every opportunity there's a tweet or Instagram post that's bound to crack you up her food posts are highly relatable and on some level aren't we all Chrissy Teigen crying over a pie whatever the topic she calls it as she sees it and her brutal honesty makes her social media presence the gift that keeps on giving do you agree with our picks check out these other great clips from

Okay, lets reload first. How to kill this thing? Oh just so you know... You SUCK! Hey what's up, everybody. It's your Boi Hugh here from CreatorUp. You just saw my horrible VR gameplay of the\nHalf-Life Alyx on SteamVR. I am bad at VR game but good at figuring it\nout VR tech. And today, we are going to learn how to play\nany SteamVR games wirelessly, in 4K high resolution without any delay, using the brand new Pico\nNeo 2. But, this is not a consumer VR gaming headset. Neo 2 is built for business. You actually can not buy it unless you are\na business or developer. Okay well, not exactly. Pico Neo 2 is actually the most popular 6DoF\ngaming headset right now in China. It is like the Chinese Oculus Quest. So you can get it on Taobao, Alibaba, or any\neCommerce site in China. It is not hard at all. CreatorUp, as a VR training, VR education,\nand content production company, we do have lots of experience in making VR training videos\nfor big companies. So I know what business needs exactly. I can tell you right now, businesses don't\nwant to be associated with Facebook and don't want their customer data owned by this guy. I don't want to give out too much for my next\nin-depth review on the Pico Neo 2 Eye for business. We will cover Eye-tracking, immersive theater,\nbest rendering setting for 360VR or VR180 videos on the Neo 2, and 8K 360 Livestream. Lots of great tutorials are coming on the\nPico Neo 2 Eye. But some viewers don't believe I can play\nHalf-Life with Neo 2, during my unboxing Livestream. So this is the video to prove you guys are\nwrong. In fact, if you know how to set up correctly,\nPico Neo 2 will give you one of the best VR playing experience, wirelessly, in 4K compared\nto an unreliable solution like Oculus Link, Oculus Quest with Virtual Desktop or Vive\nFocus, like what I have right here. If you are a VR gamer looking for the best\nVR gaming experience without cable, boundary, and light, and you have some extra cash stash\nsomewhere. This just might be your best summer gift during\nCOVID lockdown. Let's dive right in. Quick Review of Neo 2 for VR Gamers\nThere are lots of great reviews for VR gamers already. So I am going to keep it short and only mentioned\nthings that other reviewers did not cover. If you are a VR filmmaker, developer, and\nbusiness decision-maker, please let me know what you want to find out in the next official\nreview. To me, the biggest annoying thing about VR\ngaming is the cable. Pico Neo 2 uses the new Qualcomm 845 Snapdragon\nprocessor with Boundless XR - a new technology hopefully will be in every single XR headset\nfrom now on. This allows stable and high-quality wireless\nstreaming PCVR games using your 5G network. Well, not without some careful setup - but\nthis is what this tutorial for. So don't worry, REDDIT users - we will get\nto that. The second thing is the controllers. It uses electromagnetic tracking that is different\nfrom everything else in the market. As you see right here, I put my hand behind\nmy back, and the tracking still good. Doing this kind of gun holding action usually\nlost track in other VR headset - but not on Neo 2. Some reviewers complain about the tracking\naccuracy. But Pico just had an update like 2 days ago\nthat fix lots of the bugs. I don't feel any latency after 2 hours of\ngameplay at night without light. And yes, this comes to the third point - tracking\nwithout light. There are some gamers just love to play games\nin the dark - it is more immersive when there is no outside light sneak into your VR headset. Well, Neo 2 still rely on in-side out tracking,\nso it will be really interesting to find out for real if playing in the dark work. So let's test it out! As you see right here lets go ahead and start\nstreaming. Okay. So as you see I am in complete low light hopefully\nyou see my hand tracking perfectly see so now I am going to turn off the TV to see complete\ndarkness and still able to track. Okay\nTurn off the TV completely. Okay now should be completely darkness. So put the headset back on lock it go ahead\nand grab my hands see still tracking perfectly ammo great look at that. So turn around. Still tracking great I gonna go ahead and\ndo this part real quick ohhh what is going on ... So as you see, you can absolutely play in\ndarkness. Hand tracking does not change a bit. The only thing that is kinda strange is the\nsafety boundary. When you are out of steamVR in the normal\nPico menu, sometimes the lost boundary notification will show up, even you did not move at all. But it will not affect your gameplay when\nyou are in SteamVR. For those of you audio nerds, Pico Neo 2 supports\nblue tooth headphones. So you can use your AirPods or your fancy\nbeats by Dre headphones. Oculus Quest now has Bluetooth headphone features\nas well, but it is hit or miss. And you know that already. The last thing is that beautiful 4K screen\nwith a 101\u00b0 Fresnel lens, basically no screen-door effect. But you know that already. So is this headset all good with no bad? Well, not exactly. If you are long time followers, you know I\ndo unbiased reviews. One feature that everyone is talking about\nis how light and comfortable this headset is when you are wearing it. Look at the weight distribution of this headset\n- the battery is at the back. Okay, let me cut tho the marketing hype. After 2 hours of continuous gameplay, from\na fully charged battery to completely kill the headset, I can tell you this headset is\nnot as comfortable as Oculus Quest. First, it is not lighter than Oculus Quest,\nlike some reviewers mentioned. 360g is only the front part of the headset\n- but you can't use it without the battery - so the total weight is 690g - a lot heavier\nthan Oculus Quest. For long hours of gaming, I will personally\npick the lighter version. Another big thing no one mentions is this\nPlastic face pad right here. Yes it is soft and very comfortable for people\nlike me with glasses. But it does not circulate heat as well as\nOculus Quest. So here is what I look like after half an\nhour of intensive gameplay. As you see, my glasses are all blurry and\nsteamy. The Fresnel lenses are also blurry cover by\nmy sweat, and also the surrounding Plastic face pad as you see right here. The electromagnetic controller also gets warm\nat the base. My suggestion is to turn your AC on - as this\nis an exercise. It is not your normal sitting on a gaming\nchair - use your joint stick for turning - Valve Index VR experience. This can be a fully immersive, full-body immersion\nif you are playing it like me. So you will get sweat - like any full-body\nexercise. To have the same immersive experience without\nany lagging - there are necessary gears you need. You will need a minimum one long CAT 6 ethernet\ncable, a standard MIMO 5G router, and of course, a VR-ready gaming PC, but you probably have\nthat already if you are watching this video. Most of the glitching problems during gameplay\nare caused by using the wrong ethernet cable. It is actually really hard to tell which is\nCAT 6 cable and which is a CAT 5 cable. For those of you who are not network engineer,\nyou probably have only CAT 5 cable at home. Look at the side of your cable, it will say\nsomething like C5E - that is a CAT 5. If your cable too beat up and you can not\nread the side - look at the pins compared to CAT 6. CAT 5, all pins are at the same height and\nCAT 6 they are up and down, up and down. So, just go on Amazon and order a long CAT\n6 cable. It is good for your Twitch streaming and router\nanyway. Talking about router, here is what I use. This is a Linksys MU-MIMO GIGABIT WI-FI ROUTER. Don't worry, you don't need the exact same\nrouter as I do. But I will suggest going to pick up a new\nmodern router with big antennas from Best Buy. You want a dedicated 5G Router only for steaming\nVR gameplay. Put your Spotify steaming, your girlfriend,\nor boyfriend Instagram starking on your other router. Having a dedicated router also allow you to\nbe anywhere around your house and stay close to the signal - which is the most important\nthing for seamless gameplay. Okay, let me walk you tho my setup right now. So as you see my router actually in my garage\nhere. That is a CAT 6 cable but you don't need that. That is a Verizon router. The cable is go into my living room area right\nhere look at that we are going into an other router right there it is the Linksys right\nhere so the CAT 6 go in and the different this provide internet and again you don't\nneed a CAT 6 cable for that. CAT 5 is fine the but this one has to be CAT\n6 so right here this blue cable is CAT 6 cable let me show you see right here C6A CAT 6 go\ninto my PC right here into my ethernet port and then this is the 5G connect to my Neo\n2 right here and that is how I created like no latency 4K real time game play for half\nlife so to see it this is my play area right here this is my play area you see big TV right\nhere I am playing half life just now as you see that is the half life screen right here\nand that is router that is how I make sure I have a reliable wifi without blocking so\nI have the best playing and streaming experience so if you want to have the same experience\nI have that is the setup I will suggest you to do. Now go online to download the Pico Streaming\nAssistant software for your PC. Please note this minimum spec. Right now, AMD graphic card is not supported. Also, Intel Xeon series CPU and Titan series\nGPU are not going to work for now. But Pico is working on supporting those spec\nvery soon as I am using a Titan series GPU. Now install and open the streaming assistant. When you connect your Pico Neo 2 to the 5G\nnetwork - everything will turn green as you see right here. Very straight forward. Go to the gear icon, you can set your streaming\nquality to High - which is what I use. Okay, if you own the Pico Neo 2, hopefully\nby now, you can have a smooth playing experience as I do right here. When you follow my steps exactly and get it\nto work, it is incredible. The 4K looks so sharp compared to Valve Index,\nOculus Quest, and my Vive Focus here. And the control \nis smooth.

right message I actually she first primary ye please say hello to sky thank you thank you what's your picture here so nice yeah like so nice like I'm so excited always guests up you know right thank you for that what I'm she was gonna weird cuz I'm like this my camera okay okay alright we're now the 30 minute mark questions questions a little chat bar to but we ask questions on our community tab on YouTube about relaxed here at gamble giving a lot of subscribers and I people don't know that we're relaxed so yeah actually saw my picture somebody who's my picture and put it on their Instagram it was like a hair is the grand page it knows for natural hair I don't like wait a minute do not really watch our videos or know much about us because our hair definitely is not natural I mean it's it's ours but it's definitely been relaxed and it still is relaxed I just got relaxed very relaxed the whole video is coming up on next Sunday so young look up a bit alright so let's go do a spill where it's like cool no I'm trying to just fall but it is burning up in here this is hot out there and things like eighty something okay all right so I'm this one I'm gonna go away from the bottom sorry I'm scratching my head its flakes don't scratch before relaxer I might get my relaxer but you're not getting it next month like next week Oh why are you getting it okay all right so first question is from Serena Oh somebody say they're watching from France oh ok so the first question is from Serena Adrienne does it damage your hair afterwards just don't Robin relaxing this to relax and damage our hair afterwards I know it doesn't no no it doesn't damage our hair no it does have potential damage your hair I'll put it in right if you aren't researching a relaxer you don't know your hair you're putting it in for too long you don't know how to put it in a relaxed there's so many factors that could damage the after product with your relaxing yeah the key is when you put the relaxer in your hair do not I guess yeah don't put it on your hands always put it on the new growth never put it on your ends a lot of people do relax their in soon as they go all the way down but keep the ends free of like relaxer and what I did before my relaxed which was seeing video but give you guys a sneak little peek of what I did but I did use and oil I'm not gonna tell you which I use because you gotta watch the video it's not olive oil but it's another oil I use but just use an oil on the ends of your hair or the hair that's already been relaxed and when you do the relaxer or somebody puts the relaxer in if you do have a bit of runoff it's not gonna you know damage your hair so the key is to keep the relaxer away from here that's already been relaxed just know where the new growth stops and where the already relaxed hair is yeah damage it but just answer your question no it doesn't damage our hair mm-hmm all right the next one is between a movie okay what's the best way to keep you here healthy and easy to manage while having a lot of new growth is it straightening it once a month or not straightening it at all but doing different protective styles thanks love you guys we love you too so we love to straighten it because our hair is easy to manage when it's string we also get it keratin treatments that has been our saving grace when we were stretching our new growth for so long did an 1890s stretch and we got a keratin treatment cuz when you do stretch all right you all know break is breakage because of those two textures are just kind of conflicting with each other so we got Karason treatment to strengthen the bonds of the hair like both textures to kind of keep them strong so they looked to the I can't talk so that it won't break off so that's a does deep conditioning saved us as well and like we go to the salon once a month which is wash our hair so those deep conditioners and then when she straightens it we're able to keep our hair straight forward hold my full month and it's just easy to take care of when it's straight I feel like if I had it curly it I would be breaking my hair off so yeah when you were starting your hair this is from w Barnes when you were starting your hair journey how long did you notice volume more thicker strands um honestly what Warren I would say recently I'm good as more volume in my hair we started doing collagen and the animals they have more protein protein helps with the with our hair being a lot thicker so your collagen the the keratin I do have a video because like I said I just noticed that my hair is a little bit more thicker even Lisa did my hair last time and she did a bone straight look it still looked more a lot more fuller with the bone straight look so um yeah I think I'm doing a video though a comprehensive plan about how our hair got thicker and stuff so yeah definitely college and carrots and what else we do we actually put a lot of like during the summer we don't put a lot of heat to it yes those are all factors and stuff but yeah but let be on the lookout for that videos I think have a video for that next question should probably have my note somebody's asking questions I'm sorry oh cool Midtown Miami voila Deena oh we've never been to Miami wanna go how do you keep your Flatiron it hair moisturize with without causing it to be stiff from the product go out a lot of product there's a lot of product yeah your wash stage we go get our hair done by Lisa Lisa doesn't use she's the shampoo the conditioner and conditioner and then after that is she's like an all-in-one type of product that that's like the heat protectant these handler and like I don't know everything all-in-one Oh she'll combine like a moisturizer and oil that's like before the blow I yeah but leave the key is to the key for not stiffness is to not use a lot of products in your washer stage so and with us after we get our hair then we put no product minute at all so like first two weeks we're just you know living off the product the Shula in our hair and when she did it and then around the third week is when it starts to get a little ratty so we'll put a little bit of moisturizer in it and stuff and that's when we started using more products and well Scott massages and stuff but the keys just don't use a lot a lot of people use moisturizer every day and that's just that make sure your it's good so let's let your hair breathe let it be free after you get it still gets to throw my yeah it's not gonna get it why free following yeah and first two weeks we just leave it alone just don't put any product in it and then your hair can just do its name how often do you prep keep your hair straight before a relaxer touch it oh how I'm sorry how can you keep your hair straight before Alexa touch-up I just did a video I just planned it but you did yeah yeah he says we're done we're gonna link it down below but I talk about what I do a month before my relaxer routine do's and don'ts yeah just pretty much it's called a relaxer prep video so go check that out but yeah I really don't I just leave base of the videos is I just leave my hair alone but you gotta go see it but yeah it goes into detail about what we do and how to keep it so that when you go get your relaxer it won't damage your hair so yeah have some good points in there I love my stream high everything Erik have you ever tried the split end or Pro thanks for answering my questions oh no we never tried it thinking about trying it were you for a video I think maybe at one point I was but I know those a tingling yeah you asked them to comment one time before ever gonna try that or maybe it wasn't you I'm sorry but yeah something like that I guess the Splinter to xsplit InterPro kinda helps explode ends then there's a split into pro 2 apparently yeah if I'm wrong correct me but I think somebody asked our we're gonna try the two and we haven't even tried the first one yet would you ever get highlights or change your hair color obviously not new tone getting a relaxer right I've always yeah and you guys followed us for a while I've always talked about going darker I went to go jet black because part of looking like here as many black it is not like true black I went to the black black like black is black so um I've heard of henna I know you guys have heard of in a couple of you guys oh yeah because I got it from you guys but some of y'all had commented in the comment section about henna and I did look into it and it is a safe way to color your hair I mean obviously you got to be careful with some henna brands but it's not no chemicals or anything so a lot of people use too and it coats your hair it makes it it's kind of like it's not a protein but it just coats you here it makes it stronger and it gives you here like a nice dark rich look and so I really want to go with that I'm gonna ask Lisa about I should ask you that yesterday Recker got but um yeah if I do color I might explore the option of henna let us not have y'all try him now or you know anything about it because I think it is kind of baked in the black hair community yeah I want to kind of look into that I'm going to try a hair paint wax and then you all tripe a hair people acts the colored ones another consecrate so that's why I kinda want to try it Belinda hi did you ever try the coffee caffeine method or hair growth as a me as your solution Oh copy it caffeine does grow your hair I've heard of that I don't know if I would actually try this or yeah I'm about try that like as far as like like making it to a mask like it yeah I'll be caffeine a coffee mask or something I see it yeah yeah look like a mess for anything face hair or anything so I don't know maybe look at that see how you can do that same ever I know it's actually good idea cuz caught me is pretty good hurt for your hair mmm how much how much breakage should I be worried about right British phrase from a relaxer no is it from relaxing or from because I didn't get any breakage after my relaxer yeah she showed me the brush there was no hair in the brush after she was done detangling and all that stuff so yeah if you see something that's like off more than normal like we're shaving the normal or more breakage but if you are experiencing lot of breakage I will definitely try vitamin E to help with that breakage show you where to go yeah I'm not sure where the breakage is coming from if you can expand on that oh so you tried henna but it made your hair soft softly my hair too much hmm yeah I heard you do have these a protein treatment with henna it does not replace a protein treatment a lot of people think it does cuz it's like meet your hair strong but Oh interesting so you know did you hear looking lighter from the relaxer I can see this one's very clearly between my new growth and straight hair oh no yeah this has been the same I've noticed a difference in color with like the new growth of the arterial x here I wonder why it's interesting observation alright often do y'all hot oil treatment yeah we're like really really here it's really dry and we'll use that hot head cap that we have yeah just put it in the microwave but he's much baby black castor oil my go to town we don't serve it a lot fit a lot yeah not as often as some people thank you okay here's really great thank you I mean I'm gonna get my relax in like the next two after Thanksgiving days after Thanksgiving she's I can't remember the ingredient Alexa that lightens our here video how old are y'all guess yeah we Erica you spoil your name I just want able to see like the CK CK we'll just build my name was the K like I'll start looks like just your eyes er ika her breath smells my name with a why is this belong okay somebody has where's Mizani I'm due for a relaxer where's mazzani sold I want to let my stylist know so they do have store brands in Ulta and they have like the professional salon great one where your if you're a stylist hair stylist you can buy it but you can go on the website too and they sell a lot of their products they got a lot of styling products not just relaxers so you can buy off their site I believe as well but look at Ulta who's also starting to carry their brand as well I mean Amazon has an Amazon yes it was on yeah 25 oh thank you do you own any pets if not why you do here we have two Labradors we have a chocolate lab who's a year old and a black man who's 80 months yeah and they're big I might bring them you know it is so hyper instructive right now so it's all gonna turn upside down right [Music] especially this age of the eye right ma'am did you scum they have a lot of energy so yeah really they're really lovable it's the next what do you guys used to protect your previously relaxed here from over processing that's in the video coming up it's an oil that I use and watch the video but yeah it isn't oil some people use other stuff but definitely don't use Vaseline things were like that like his again took from burning but yeah some people use olive oil - olive oils also Goods this light and everything so olive oil is a good one I like how both you'd like to stretch out the times between relaxers is for three months since my last relaxer and I'm going this do you ever get tempted to relax sooner yes sometimes I do wonder lasts twice a year instead of once and there's nothing wrong with that a six-month stretch so I mean we talked about it before because I'm one time will rely - I don't like to do this year but here we are stuff but yeah I'm not gonna count up 1 to 18 months again no I'm definitely not probably cut it off at 9 or 2 months so I'm definitely gonna try my best to stick to it yeah cuz I didn't think about getting my relaxers twice twice so I see you I see you are you still only getting relaxer once a year yes we are currently 10 weeks post getting breakage but not much show you worry about that I don't think that's the relaxer though I mean how often do you usually relax cuz I would say your hair might be used to you getting that relaxer and also what is your routine are using a lot of heat on your hair mm-hmm cuz that could be it too what are you sleeping on yeah Tim wicks post I don't think you should be due for another relaxer but it depends on how often you do relax so your hair might be used to it so you might have trained your hair this girl we had a trained artist too because we used to get ours every three months we skip relaxes four times a year four times our mom that's crazy the key problem is it's so beautiful no optimum optimum the outer most optimum was our go-to little box relaxation by Martin with them for years well no she did that for just for me does the kitty turn cheddar by two of them cuz beauty's awesome um she didn't use two of them have y'all got to try out the vatika kept this oil even if you didn't try it and if you did try it with jumping I didn't try it I think okay oh I thought we did yeah I've never tried it um I should look it up and see what it what is it does it how was it good for your hair like cactus oil affection everything Wow long hair I love you like actually yes yeah but it wasn't like this long I think you had right after our gross articles for I thought relaxer I had a bit of growth spurt but we've always had like I would say thicker hair we were younger but it was it was like a nice length but then afterwards we got the relaxer like it got longer and well you can see you the keratin treatments yes a little bit after my relaxer probably three months after my relaxing because I'm not gonna last time we got my carries actually we were like already at almost a year post so yeah we're not doing that so I think we're definitely gonna do it sooner that's gonna help our carats and last longer is gonna help it look uniform so yeah it just helps with your stretch and you kind of stretch your relaxer keratin just helps it anyway without worrying by any breakage or anything so gonna be super Hannah foreseer know your shade so you just wash your hair whenever is not breaking even if it's pink girl so yes we walked here once a month and so she's asking what do we do when our hair gets dry does speed naughty and not behaving right well our hair doesn't get naughty because Leslie not like knots or whatever but we do wrap our hair so it keeps any tangles and also wrapping your hair cut your hair straight longer to when you go to come in yeah so it keeps your hair manageable without having to use a lot of heat to keep it straight so that might be why our hair has been you know okay throughout the month but when he gets too dry I do put a moisturizer and an oil with me like argan oil I put on I put a butter it's the Jane Carter butter on my ends to help with split ends but I guess with our routine the way we wrap it and everything it doesn't get that bad it like we said it starts getting stuff and it does get a little pass out here it's hot yeah we do um it does get like really kind of gross around probably about the fourth week so yeah that's when we start putting product in it and just making it look nice throw on some headbands we're a hair in a bun do edge controls anything to kind of make it look nice and appearance because yeah it does get to a point where it's just kind of like ill and stuff but that's wrong the time when we're about to get a wash anyway so I think we do a pretty good job with keeping it together for a full month and everything I can't do it video I just need to do a video showing you guys what I do in the full month of wash getting my hair washed once and then that whole entire month what I do so I get my hair wash the next month I think that's a good idea for a video I guess how's my tooth before those of youtubers have reacted to her oh oh that's why you got us mixed up oh I'm happy he said my hair's got my binky I gotta trim too so I haven't trim in a while so it's just like it's just what it looks like but yeah thank you so ends look great I'm excited oh yeah maybe she does a lot summer here oh wow look her up look her I'm not sure I've never heard of her before but interesting your hair turn brown when using oh my relaxes I've never heard of that never heard of that either interests me thank you looks way yeah I think I might do that video that sounds like a good idea I have to have y'all ever nice now so yes yes girl we do get dry scalp it's it used to it's really bad yeah it's really really bad but get some peppermint oil it's called Eaton's body works I think that's the brand like using suture or lavender your scalp and hair grew at the same time but yeah t-shirt yeah I'm hoping that all takes the itch way like that but yeah and any shampoo will teach you all in it do the trick I think Paul Mitchell has one that Lisa used on our hairs another one I think is cocoon that all does yeah and we also might start greasing her scalp as well because we do that all the time I think I might go back to it I kept saying that any comments I think I'm gonna keep my word on it and grease of my hair and document it for y'all all right I like these line now no lightning mm-hmm interesting using the like you're looking for that more how long should I wait to put another relaxer Anna put one in last one okay don't do it this mom yeah I will say wait what happened to usually put blacks in but I will say wait three more months yeah see if you can stretch that long and then just keep building your stretch let's see yeah how you hear response to it and then Trey Turner says my hair tends to  when I need a wash a relaxer does your hair show signs from these attention yes yes why here's been shedding - because I'm construction this relaxer definitely before this relaxer I was getting some shedding so even when I need to wash my hair sheds so that's why I'm not gonna try to stretch as long because my hair was just unnecessarily shedding but it wasn't a lot that I was concerned about but I knew that shedding was coming from me stretching it just being lazy so yeah our hair definitely shows signs see you don't go the other way to use rice water actually using after you put some treatment you like or just love you I'll thank you yes please wait after using the FG protein treatment don't use rice water after that assists that puts an overload yeah my father is a very strong protein treatment fj stand strong too but not as strong as rice water but yeah they're both pretty i wouldn't use them right after each other company honestly I want to get like routine treatments we still get a mic twice a year I do my times a year maybe yeah I do mind you know as often as deviations are definitely amazing I usually do a lot of protein treatments before I get my relaxers do y'all ever get relaxer burns we have before when we use the phyto or feed opener relaxer we're in New York the guy that does our hair we get relaxer not burns not like like like our scalp I get what burn on here but we didn't get like burns on her scalp no but like it did burn our hair convert some Sonics we don't get any burnt tsunami but we never had anything we're like aren't the skin yeah we just got a lot of itches yeah but you never actually burned burned her scalp so who did your hair when you were really young and natural my mom was my dad or sister got hurt dad never touched my hair still relaxing with you she like when I relax it in well actually she actually kept doing her hair yeah make sure you put our relaxers in it so we were like we moved out which was like tween one yeah 22 so she's been doing our mom's been doing my relaxers since Ward's for me too and she did our hair we were natural then we moved to New York we found a guy that does our hair really well his name is Alan if y'all want to go look him up what happens link below but he did he's amazing he's like our Lisa in new yeah so yeah but our mom took care of our hair our mom and grandma my grandma who were natural definitely our grandma and I can't put it relaxing our here a couple times - I'm sorry mr. Ballentine relax once a year and what are your final thoughts on the carrots the tree that we love it and we're getting another one it was a video I'll pull dots on it carrots an update is cowashing better nation of cooling I think said I like it and I did a lot in the summer I did not really shampoo my hair that much I couldn't wash it because I was a swimming a lot and stuff so conditioner really helps you hear after swimming shampoo and just kind of kind of think about trying a my advisor here we're using a good carrots and treated shampoo or a shampoo for keratin treatment hair so but yeah I really didn't use the shampoo that much so the answer question yes I like co-washing better yeah I'm here I'm listen it is not a question about love your journey in tips the fine picture it load the city hair woman your tips really hope I to notice shedding variety of washer relaxer oh thank you lady eloquent are you you guys have any kids no our kids are our puppies yeah we love babies though but we don't have these puppies aren't really our cell roommates but yeah we're there since day one so they kind of like well the second one is on a sort of are there are there are other wigs are cool is know how to render off yeah so they want me playing at your hair like I don't know too much about wigs but I think the issue a lot of people have is when they use wigs they think they don't have to take care of the hair underneath it yeah and so when they take the wig off when the hair it's just like all messed up they blooming on the wigs or stuff another wig on yeah but you really have to let your hair breathe you have to wear it all the time so I think it's just a thing where you just have to remember that you do have your real hair I'm gonna meet there they need to take care of but did we finish the wait let's finish the other questions see temerity to the weirdest mazzani soul okay okay okay so here's another question sorry which relaxer brand do you recommend

of your concoction I still get my scalp still it just - especially as I'm talking to get a relaxer but it's not it doesn't itch as much anymore because I put in it okay so we already answered trays so here's another one what is the best way to treat the relaxer burn on the scout all right so we asked Lisa this yesterday and she said alum it's good aloe aloe vera helps with burns in general so yeah if you don't relax it burn and albear is good for your hair anyway I have aloe vera I have a leaf in my refrigerator now but yeah just yeah it's very healing soothing healing and it just helps little

Mahalia Jackson do you pronounce it mahalia and mahalia or mahalia number one mahalia or number two maja yeah I love that me and maybe we're pronouncing it wrong both ways Oh litter let Angela has used a low C yeah yeah what do you think about so many youtubers return to relaxes I told you I know you're all day yeah watching Meg's video she was good too right I would read in the comments and everybody was talking about I might go back to relaxing and then they were listing the reasons why I mean I feel like the natural hair is a lot gonna take care of your hair and I think actual hair movement the actual movement kind of got people jumping on what I think created a bandwagon and so they didn't know they were just joining a fad and then didn't realize how much work you have to put into doing or keeping up with natural hair which I mean if you're able to do that look good for you like I'm I'm jealous cuz I know I can't do it a lot of the issues a lot they were saying that yeah and actually I really think that because is passive recently it was like you know the thing to do you know the natural hair instantly obviously you know if you want to have nationair that's fine and stuff but it has become sort of a trend and past you years to have natural hair because because a little media social media thing yeah though I do kind of think it was kinda do you think it was good was that everybody kind of just hopped on but without really knowing yeah you know they're getting themselves into like there's nothing wrong natural hair without seeing that but you do have to take care of your hair in the natural hair stage there's a lot more maintenance required than would be a relaxer so which is why we haven't really don't burn this guy doesn't that's not us saying my oh is a lot of work knowing but these are the comments we've read where people are pretty near confessing what's going on with like good natural hair my hair is breaking off like that I returned to natural herbs inside big chop and whatever and like a lot of people are just I don't know it's kind of ruining their hair because they know they really know what they were getting themselves into or maybe they did and they just like yeah yeah but oh no that's a lot a lot of respect somebody said they also returned to Greece degrees is back it is days in the 90s sitting in between your mom's legs why should we stay here then force right I agree cool we're taking on a bandwagon yeah I agree I mean unnatural people will say it's not a bandwagon it's not not because here that you were born here so there's no way about the movement that was created by I guess society at a certain point you know I said you know social media and everything everything a can wagon so yeah that's what that's one of the issues to have social media because it can really it does create little sub communities I'm bandwagon to Stephanie jump on people need to know what they're getting into so yeah natural hair is definitely not a trend or fad this hair that you were born with so that's that's not what we're talking about actual there was there was a movement yeah I mean this still is but but I think it's moving on now alright yeah cuz oh yeah why did we retain that what was her relaxed here I chose too much word you know like worsening that yeah my dad used blue magic in my hair like some years earlier to be clear that was causing my hair to break oh really oh wow I mean some people can't take Greece because it's lightning bolts your floors and stuff that's why I like them good oil but no no depends on which one personally I'm Rachel because I like afros be care for every West doing special to him thank you see you took as you like yeah your hair is so I don't think you're doing because everyone else is doing it I like that comment long shall we to get a corrective relaxer relaxers I know I'm just gonna if he about corrective little way to kind of correct your relaxer is a good condition yeah I'm gonna go back to it and then try to correct it with more chemicals I'm not really well-versed on corrective relaxers but I don't know I I I personally would stay away from them they'd find other ways like sit deep conditions and everything that's always like that's like our answer for everything but it's been working for us but yeah I fee like it would do more harm than good stretch my relaxer three to four most I keep my scalp oil with hair grease and vitamin E but and to make a black castor oil and olive oil stir it together at Christmas oh wow that's a lot we do use vitamin E oil vitamin E is like the hair growth oil you put on here and it's great with hair damage jamaican black castor oil we've got Muscat massage with that grease it's the best way to go be

things have changed fair amount let's go over what I've done here in the GRU and first off this is the light that actually lowered the light by about 15 inches actually so I've lowered the light bulb 15 inches I'm also lowered this fan a little bit and also the fan is one of the brackets that are holding up this pipe that goes from the very top all the way down to the bottom where there is a fan of drawing the warm air in and point up to the bottom where it gets cool okay so that's what I've done I lowered this fan as well so it's hitting the mark more so I ran about my light and apparently the best area is around 18 inches to 24 inches 24 for no what is it now now 24 for vegging so I've pretty much gone to 24 inches now and 18 for flowering which I will lower it but of course there'll be higher plants then anyway so I've done a heavy cropping I think you guys saw that in the update before so now I have stopped topping and now everything is growing tops the fair number of them there's like 30 on this plant orange juice from Dyna femme the cheese is really coming along I've done this thing called ponytail which I will show you in a later video that's a pretty radical low stress training thing but anyway the bottom branches are coming out a lot and it has certainly gotten much bigger the last week and here's another one that has about Oh 25 30 tops as well so they're all tied down and they're low stress trained and just gonna grow up as soon as they grow up will be spreading them out to make a big canopy here's the last blueberry headband okay same thing this one has a little more training to do but it's not far behind the we've managed to keep the temperature within like seven degrees of and that's Fahrenheit so actually it's not just like five degrees variance and I'm really happy with that so there's not a lot of variation of temperature it's very good climate control so we're rocking in the next week or two the chain should be considerable from what you see in here now so anyway I hope you guys have a wonderful Sunday and take care", "AcWFppuTcbc": "it makes all the sense in the world steve you just don't understand well yeah you're

that's one of the first key one of the first pillars that needed to die was limbaugh you're right his non like but he's inspired so many stupid people but they don't i don't think they're at the same poll as he did well yeah he inspired a lot of them a lot of them were [ __ ] up to begin with well i know they just used him as an excuse as a vessel of ignorance and racism [Music] he's just an opportunist after [ __ ] he said he can bleed remember when they hire you for about 10 minutes for sports remember that no when did they do that oh this was about about five years ago where who hired me what are you supposed to do and he he was there for about three weeks and he said something about black running backs and they can't just ask she he says something negative they can't this isn't she a lighter like i never talk about the guy because like he's my [Music] my dad's been listening to that guy as long as i've been alive i'm almost gonna put money on it when did he get a national radio show i don't know early 80s late 70s like the only time i ever saw him was on the daily show when they were talking about that stupid he said it didn't and then the other [ __ ] gave him an award last year oh yeah [Music] [ __ ] to [ __ ] he's the next piece in the pie yeah he needs to go next yep doo doo doo he defies something wrong with his ass i'm sure it's something wrong with him syndicate since 88 his earlier radio career he was a sports announcer [Music] he got success in sacramento he announced his first he started being controversial with that then he spun off until his day after he saw the audience he had in 2003 he did a brief stint as a professional football commentator with espn yeah yes he resigned a few weeks in 2003 after making comments about the press coverage for quarterback mcnabb that caused controversy i don't think this is what he said i don't think he's been that good from the get-go i think we've had here is a social cons a little social concern in the nfl i think the media has been very darious that a black quarterback do well dear this year this i don't know what that word is i've never seen it before really the serious yeah i can't see it from here [Music] right here this word [Music] this that's a typo that's got to be it's a typo okay there's no word unless that's what he said he's just an idiot because oh yeah listen you're right unless he made up a word but i've never heard that word before or seen that word before actually i'm going to search google for it i mean it's probably no it's a word it probably is desire having a characteristic of desire the pope was this serious d serious peace in europe he was hoping hopeful of okay so okay the nfl he thinks the media has been very serious that a black quarterback do well they're interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well i think there's little hope invested in mcnabb and he i think there's little hope vested in mcnabb and he's got he got a little a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really did the defense carried his team and the next week he was gone yeah well you should have had gasoline you shouldn't have no they shouldn't have they if they didn't want him to talk about the fact the what the conservatives think because that's what they think what was it about that [ __ ] he said i thought that a black my dad told me in the 90s that a black man couldn't be quarterbacked because they were smart enough no no no the whites in their eyes i'm not [ __ ] [ __ ] you the whites in their eyes because then they'll know where they're throwing it's like hold on a second hold on hold on hold on let me get this straight you think because they're black you can see the whites better and a person can read someone's eyes better and something that literally takes i didn't understand that at all it's just some [ __ ] somebody made up because it's like it's like if you're looking at a white man it's the same thing you can tell where their eyes are going but see it was such a black people were held in such a low esteem it's just like my best friend but that's his dad his dad that was a tuskegee airman really yes and his dad told us one time he said um he said that uh the white officers would come in and a couple of them wanted the black guys to be aviators but most of them didn't right and they would say you guys know you're not smart enough to fly an airplane or even understand the technology they thought black people were so stupid they were you know it said jim crusher and what happened the tuskegee airmen were the greatest pilots of all time you know why they never lost that one bomber that they protected during the war they were the only squadron that never lost a bomber they protect their bombers better than anybody else could [Music] you're the most highly decorated era core when it was all said done yeah they made a movie about them yeah i get it i mean just like my dad my dad was in the red pull express in world war ii he was in the what it's called the red ball express they supply behind the enemy lines or anywhere our soldiers with ammunition oil gas new tanks new trucks yeah [ __ ] they need at 24 hours 24 hours 24 hours i kind of wish i could have talked to my grandfather about that [ __ ] that's the one thing i did miss out from talking to because i think i think grandpa krieger was like here national guard i think he was in the national guard and i don't know which one was older so he might not have been old enough but i know you can fly a plane i [ __ ] had like i didn't know my grandparents owned a plane until i was in oh they owned a plane yeah oh [ __ ] back then yeah they had money they had money i know they said though that's what i'm saying i didn't know that because i only knew i knew my my mom's family you know they're from the u.p and then my grandfather had a house in white lake that was really nice on a lake you know and he bought me in it but i'm 10 when they disappear yeah yeah they go to florida when i'm like 10. yeah and my grandparents are in the u.p i don't ever see them because there's no reason to ever come around now my mom's gone yeah you know that's the only reason they actually cared it well that's what you would assume yeah but grandparents care about the kids as a rule they do my grandparents didn't i had nuggets were selfish i never saw my grandparents i saw my grandmother on my father's side i spent the summer in washington with her but other than that i hardly ever saw her until she died and then my grandfather on my mother's side her mother died when she was young so i had no grandmother on that side and i saw him maybe 10 or 12 times i had some crazy grandparent i had because i had my mom's mom parents split so they both were married by the time i was born yeah yeah so i had two grandparents on both sides you know i had the full thing and they weren't like there wasn't no step grant it was just grandma um and then my dad they stayed together until they died like she died not long after he killed himself um but they were together the whole time like it was from yeah they got a picture of my grandfather who has this amazing like 19 because he's young he has to be in his 20s so he was born in the 20s so it had to be in the 40s at some point and he's got this [ __ ] stupid peacock thing it's all trimmed up nice and this stupid peacock thing that comes down no it didn't come down it was just came out just a little bit yeah it didn't come all the way out like yeah it's kind of curled up right right right and then grandma look you know [Music] i don't know i guess i don't old people old pictures of women aren't there's not many old pictures of women when you're like wow that's a walker because they didn't present themselves in the same way back then oh yeah some women did yeah no oh i can show you pictures going back to the 30s and some women you'd be like whoa she's gorgeous no i get that but most women didn't most women were very very homebound yeah i get you didn't have sexy clothes no that's my point she's wearing something that didn't wear makeup every day she was sh at that point they just got out of the depression and my grandmother was especially she did like lived that lifted she tells the only story i remember about it is that she lost her brother could you imagine living through something like that to diarrhea her younger brother who was a baby died of diarrhea during the depression yeah and then she met my grandpa and i guess you know because her her because again my grandma's family i think it was i don't even think my grandpa was poor either that's the thing i don't think i think my grandpa was just a simple dude who didn't need much because what do you mean didn't need i remember a dude a lot hold on my grandma on my dad's side her brother so my uncle great uncle owned the house that was a normal house you see in troy in the 70s it was a 2 000 square foot ranch he had a satellite like in the [ __ ] 80s [ __ ] had a satellite yeah yeah like he owned a business that him and his sons ran in the 70s and 80s and they would make [ __ ] kit cars on as a side thing oh with their business where they would take a fiero or some other car that was on make it look like a vet or a strawberry ferrari always ferrari yeah and they were [ __ ] close to the point where i saw those cars my i saw uncle had got cease and assist because it was they was too close they were too close yeah but they'd make them convertibles but i saw i saw those cars i remember i believe that yeah i remember seeing them yeah it was in troy and that so he i know they had money because their families have all they all went to school everything my grandpa so somehow he got out of the depression uncle did my grandfather was a carpenter and pretty democratic in that sense of we're doing this all for us everyone's together type thing so it's like the house was a thousand square feet at the most with an addition when he first built it it was probably only 800 yeah square feet well those are probably homes built right after world war ii no no it was his home that's my point oh my he built my i'm almost positive he built my uncle's house and then he built his home so he was a builder yeah that's what well he he built he may have built this house for all i know my grandfather's from what i understand built a lot of houses on the east side and was one of those dudes that built it from the ground up yeah a builder yeah so um but then he retired on social security so obviously he didn't make much money or he drank it away well i mean you see he retired on social security social security goes by how much money you made in your life he might have been getting three or four thousand dollars a month in social security i don't think it was that much because grandma i i was around when they were on social security and it wasn't wouldn't have no no dude he had his coffee and they had a [ __ ] fridge that was not even half full like there was no eggs in the fridge it was bread like if i went to grandma's red milk there's no cereal [Music] it's [ __ ] toast yeah and then whatever we eat i don't even remember what we eat but it wouldn't be much it'd be whatever she felt like making because grandma would make real food i think but it would like there was no the difference in my dad's grandparents house or my dad's parents house compared to my mom's parents house is astronomical like my grandfather on my mom's side the one that's her father had guns they had to hit a cadillac and grandpa fox had a [ __ ] a new ford yeah you know an f-150 yeah yeah and it wasn't even new until he got one in nine i think his first like i remember in the 90s he got one in 96 i think it was that was his first new truck red beautiful trial was fun to drive we got it after grandma died my brother got to drive it for a while [Music] but i didn't but i think my but my point is is my grandma's side had money but again woman in that time doesn't make nearly you know coming out of it as a woman you're even less chances women were treated just like black people back there they were second-class citizens right so uncle's wealthy so i feel like something happened changed in that family and then um because he owned a business to me if you own something you're you're wealthy if you own a legit business you're wealthy i don't i mean you could be living on debt and that's your fault but obviously you're not wealthy then but enough money is passing through yeah yeah if it's an actual business you can pass on to your kids then it's [ __ ] wealth yep so uh but mike i remember my grandpa's fox's mom living in royal oak [Music] so i don't know and it was a decent like it was a nice royal oak house you know i'm saying nothing spectacular a thousand square feet maybe 1200 square feet and i just i don't know because i look at the area now and i know what the land value is worth i know what you have to make if you want to live in this area yeah you gotta make some money you got to be making at least seventy thousand eighty thousand a year by two people you can sit there on the floor if you want to [Music] uh what's up mr parent how are things over in the i think he's in you're in wisconsin i'm pretty sure um wisconsin he says how's it going gentlemen just listening in while i'm painting today hope you are both having a great day well here we are hope you're having a great day too what do you think of that i like it i give it a five and a half six all right well i let it go like i've got some it like that's the [ __ ] you cut down on monday so this is just like a little early like cut it right right right i just because i tested it just to check out it yeah 21 so i'll test it again when it comes down the next time and see if it's any higher see if it needs that extra two days yeah because i don't think it does to be honest with you it is orange is [ __ ] right now and that might be one of the reasons that happened oh you see how much orange hair oh i can see it from here and it's also stressed you can see yeah the butt itself is not there's no there's too much air in there right right so i'm hoping the next one it'll be a little more compressed well the top buds are way more compressed yeah but i just gotta not [ __ ] know it's got a good buzz uh it's got a good taste yeah that's good yeah but yeah i smoke it again my dad gave us the impression we did not come from anything like there's no there's no inheritance yeah i don't have any expectation that when my father dies yeah then i'm gonna get a phone call and be like well there's money in this whale just waiting for you come and get it no if anything he's already changed me out of the way he changed me out of the will when i was 20 and i don't think i ever got put back in type thing but they don't have anything but you know what what does he do [ __ ] and i don't even know if they own they might still be paying making payments on this corvette my parents died all together it was about sixty thousand dollars and a house yeah the house matters because that's valuable it does matter uh but it's still gonna be split three ways it doesn't matter it's still something you're giving to your kids my dad lost the home that he had bought for 60 grand yeah that was worth 250 back when the market was hot yeah and i'm sure was is around that much now no actually it was 170. this is like 170 is what it's worth i know like so if he had actually finished paying it off and then dies when he's 70. he can actually pass it on to his [ __ ] character he has something to pass on yeah but there ain't nothing there's a corvette that i don't even know if they own horses that no one really wants you're expensive to maintain [ __ ] i do believe me oh i know they only people with money [ __ ] with horses that's where it's like i lived this life of like how the [ __ ] did we own why did we own horses because somebody liked them i understand that but there's four [ __ ] kids five kids dude and it's like you gotta feed the horses they require like a dog okay a dog makes sense you add that little extra income it becomes part of your family it's there you own horses that aren't even at your house because you live in a [ __ ] village where you so they're gonna be rooted somewhere yeah so you have to have some property somewhere or you've got to rent boarding and then the horses have to be groomed and exercised and veterinarian fees horseshoes well he does all the exercise in the grooming they do all that now because i i think they still own the horses and i feel i think they don't live in the sink because they live in mount morris now just the stuff that you need as far as tools uh and they call of uh harnesses it's a bunch of stuff involved with a horse i know i know because i one of the worst christmases i remember is getting like my dad had got a bonus and he spent over half of it on his wife he bought like a [ __ ] brand new horse saddle and it was like i know it was expensive i know it had to be like 800 [ __ ] horse saddle yeah all day yeah well you better can't buy a horse saddle for no less than probably four or five hundred bucks oh and this is a piece of [ __ ] it was nice custom and this piece of [ __ ] for that yeah a really good horse saddle back when i don't know about now i'm probably back in the day they were i supposedly had a horse uh the girl was telling me that one saddle that she had cost like three grand yeah but it was all innate it was all yeah it was dumb nice oh yeah yeah it's a piece of art if we lived in a world where i had to go like to get to work i needed a horse i would have a horse yeah i would probably have one and it would have a nice saddle because i understand the value in having a good saddle on a horse i understand that without a job you've got a rock about a hobby now it's a hobby yeah an expensive hobby a hobby where you're taking an animal out of its natural circumstances you're brying it you're forcing it to your will your your your enjoyment you're keeping it locked up you know i was when you're not there or whatever yeah i don't think they're like dogs in the sense that they're not in that they're not once you if they are in the sense that you can have a relationship with a horse yes they come up to you they recognize you and all you know i get that but no not like a dog because what do they say you got the two horse to ride it you got to break it you have to break it and i'll tell you what a lot of these horses you see the police riding around now if they could get away they would get away they would be out of there well they're in the city dude that's got mind [ __ ] that's what i'm saying that's the point i mean well did you see the horses that escaped the other day in new york was running down the street do up try to get away they caught them of course but they would they would get it they had to do it [Music] we're gonna get the [ __ ] out of this [ __ ] weirdo place yeah cause that it's it's got somebody on your back all day but again i'm i mean i don't know like i said the horses have been like you can build a real relationship with a horse and have a real friendship sure you sure can you know it sure can there's no doubt about it they they recognize you they they they'll have affection for you a horse can lick you or bite you you know what none of that because out the way because a lot of horses are angry a lot of horses are especially males and i'll tell you back when i was in high school all the kids who let's go horseback i never wanted to go i went one time i i didn't ride the horse i just went along yeah it was definitely not something that i was before my stepmom became my stepmom horses were not in our life like my dad rode motorcycles he played sports and he hunted you know when he was younger yeah yeah but you know that's yeah like there was no horses anywhere in either family that i had known of everybody that i've ever known that had horses were millionaires i'm serious i haven't known anybody yeah i'm not a millionaire the head stable that stable toy negative 20 sucks balls for sure what he says wisconsin been cold as [ __ ] i knew it was wisconsin oh yeah luckily not much snow but negative 20 sucks balls i feel for you well we're not too much better no but we still better than that yeah i ain't dying i've been to it i've been to wisconsin right outside of milwaukee milwaukee's in wisconsin right yeah right outside of milwaukee a guy owned a fight he was an architect real rich he owned the farm right outside of milwaukee and i remember it was 40 degrees below zero they said one of the coldest days they never had when i was there 40 below in wisconsin good lord i went there for worlds disc golf uh amateur world championships got to play in wisconsin it was over by the school uh whatever that is you know because what you said milwaukee's over here and then it was in the middle of the state yeah yeah i don't remember what the [ __ ] it was called it's wherever [ __ ] wisconsin university is but we're there's like five courses over there it was a good time we stayed at a farmhouse stayed in old ass farmhouse and airbnb yeah and it was an old-ass farmhouse on farmland like it's a lot of farmland around there dude it was cool but yet so we snuck and went into milwaukee right so we snuck it went into milwaukee this was a long time this was in the early 80s so this is that 70s showtime yeah yeah so we uh these don't go to milwaukee but we snuck and went to milwaukee anyway so i saw a black dude right and down telling me to walk yeah we walked in says huh yeah man uh where's the black neighborhood he started laughing so what are you laughing at literally on the other side of the tracks jesus it's a different world back then it's probably it probably hasn't changed a lot well no probably not no no wisconsin is pretty white yeah demographically yeah all that whole area in there you know yeah because cold yeah black people i mean it makes sense if you look at how the world's set up the only reason why black people would live in a cold environment it was good jobs here yeah that's exactly that's why they go to detroit yeah it was a great job good jobs but like if you look how the the planet itself is spread out with how humans naturally are where the colder you are the brighter you get right it makes sense how the us is kind of set up on that sense of there's more diversity south than there is north let me see if you're right but dad more self diversity complete diversity not just black people but all minorities you see there's more that itself than yeah texas definitely has more texas and why would you say that because there's a lot of hispanics there yep and what else i mean houston and dallas have big we got indonesia you got indians too yeah have big black populations too you got atlanta has georgia or georgia has atlanta that's the point of naked though black people thrive more in the bigger cities because there's more income to be had yes you know they left the farms back in the black people left the farms right after the war like in the 50s no [ __ ] money in the farm in the 50s and stuff no what are you doing nuts that's why the philippines is so poor you know because it's all farm stuff oh we don't put value in things we should for value you're right you are absolutely or we give actually we just give too much value to the [ __ ] that don't matter oh check this out it changes the subject a little bit the term my aunt says there's not many blacks up there that's not surprising yeah it's not surprising we don't really cotton cotton you understand there's not many whites in the u.p either not many people [Music] whatever anyway um so yeah i mean that's not bad i got a little bit of blood i'm buzzing i haven't lit it back up so i see it's pass it'll build it's pad it doesn't have much flavor to me it doesn't taste like deadhead no not at all which sucks because i need to find one that tastes more like deadhead less lemon they're all too lemony which people like don't get me wrong i just don't like it it's a nice looking nice color i like the color yeah the bigger buds are it kind of reminds me this is a small this is a low branch the color reminds me of my red well that's the thing it's got that tie look everything zane has has this a lot of hairs but it's still got enough density that it's not hairy hairy so yeah okay but it's it's definitely got more of a tie look than well no it's it looks like dead edge is big you'll see you'll see it you'll be like holy [ __ ] you weren't kidding it looks like that head just big huge that sounds good though it could be good", "dWp6bbcu73U": "what's up this your boy Tony T you are now tuned into Tony T reports I got my man G in the house today say

grinding it up getting ready to smoke it however you notice in your buds it's seed after seed after seed after seed and you're wondering well damn i spent hella [ __ ] money on this why am i seeing hella seeds i am here to tell you the reason my friend okay when you're growing cannabis you have your female plants and you have your male plants you also have your hermit plants and hermit plants they have both genders male and female sex organs okay female cannabis plants they produce buds with the thc in them that we all love male cannabis plants they produce seeds when you combine your male plants and your female plants and you grow them together and you can't properly identify the male plants what the male plants is going to do is it's going to pollute your female plants and cause your female plants to have seeds in them and it's so sad because most people don't know how to properly identify the difference between a male plant and a female plant well here is the proper identifications hopefully this helps you in the long run and the fun fact is males create seeds females create buds don't mix them together because when you mix them together it is going to cause your females to grow buds with seeds in them and then when you sell that to your customers we're gonna be oh so mad if you did not know that go ahead and click that subscribe button give this video a thumbs up and welcome back to my youtube channel cali valentine's day to all of my lovers all over the world and if you're single like me happy stoner sunday on today's menu we are going to be serving up some blue dream which is one of my favorite strains to smoke also we're going to be doing a tutorial on how to make a at home gravity bong so go ahead get you a j rolled up and let's go ahead and get lit so i have everything i need to make my at home gravity bong first thing i want to do is go ahead and take my 12 ounce bottle and cut a hole at the bottom of the bottle and once you're finished cutting the hole it should look something like this i mean i'm not bob the builder but hey i can build something next thing you want to do is go ahead you want to take your two liter bottle and then you want to cut a hole at the top of the container and it's going to look something like this and that is going to be your chamber piece these are what your two pieces should look like or this is an example now it's time to make our bowl we're gonna place aluminum foil on top of our 12 ounce bottle and place holes on the top of it once you place holes on top of it you want to go ahead fill the two liter container up with water pack your bowl up with the bud go ahead and light it up and as you light it up you should slowly rise the bottle out of the water and once you rise the bottle out of the water you should start to see smoke filling the bottle up when you see the smoke filling the bottle up you want to go ahead take that mouth piece off and give a big inhale a stoner versus challenge and let's just say challenge definitely kicked my ass today like it's not hard making a gravity bong it's just the part like that when you light it and you have to lift up and the smoke comes out like that's the trickiest part but i hope that my little fake tutorial was able to help you and you guys kind of get the concept now let's go ahead and rate this blue dream let's just say i was highly disappointed because when you spend like 50 plus on some cannabis and you have nothing but seeds in it like it's pretty disappointing especially if it's one of your favorite strains blue dream is one of my favorite strains and yeah it was nothing but seeds it threw the quality off and it threw the taste off like it had this real like musty cannabis taste to it is it my favorite batch of the blue dream um what i would rate it would be a six because yeah all the seeds threw it off the taste threw it off like it wasn't [Music] what i was expecting but hey you live and you learn if you have not already subscribed click that little subscribe button and pretty please with some people on top be a part of my cannabis community my marijuana community cali connections again my name is

connection this was a feminized seed that I got from an attitude promotion so I got it for free this but it's nice and sticky super smelly just like any Sour Diesel would be the one thing that kind of threw me off is I was expecting a sativa but I got a straight indica plant and usually want to think of the original Sour Diesel I think of a fluffier sativa type bud but this is really dense indica tight bud so um yeah I mean no complaints so gives you the munchies like hell I probably gained weight this week from smoking this bud just eating popcorn and chips and just all that good stuff it's got the nice nice lemon kind of lemon pledge diesel taste rather than the fuel I don't get much fuel from this I just get a lot of lemon pledge and a lot of sour a little bit of earthy dirt type smell with it to grow it in soil the Fox Farms ocean forest soil can't go wrong with that it's really proved to be a good soil for for a beginner like me yeah some nice buds Kelly connection original Sour Diesel no problems not even a single banana popped on this - just thought I should throw that out there because I've seen a lot of problems with Cali connections gear sometimes people have gotten Hermes but alright peace out guys keep growing stay high see you", "k3-F78oBNf0": "well good morning YouTube the update of eastside OG outdoor stinky funky girl she's definitely filled out the cage I kind of stopped weaving it I'm just let it go now there's already just an insane amount of crowding going on but she's thick she's real thick I'm probably going to wait a while to do any sort of lolli popping or anything like that wow man I might as well grab a bunch of clones off of it but you know you see I pick off some leaves and I'll throw them down there and I really don't understand how I'm getting this weird brown haze on here there's no nutrients being put into you so I don't know what that's about and I run a GX 1000 scrubber on my hose so it's all super clean water coming out but no no she's beautiful super insanely healthy not a single issue anywhere on the plant no way deep in there stem starting to get fat but she's loving life I haven't done anything I just give it fresh water and tribus grow which is microbe if you guys use mammoth pee I highly suggest you try a run with tribus instead and I can guarantee you'll see a difference I've tried mammoth pee I gave it a really big chance never really saw any difference from it but ever since I've been using tribus massive difference the plant does not get heat stressed she's insanely healthy she eats I give it about 10 gallons every other day if it doesn't rain if it's rained recently I'll I'll wait a little bit but she's incredibly healthy happy the soils doing insanely well again if this is the first video you've seen there's three cubic feet of Michigan mediums bloom and then three cubic feet of Michigan mediums bej on top and with the plant and then I put a two inch layer of organics a live premium soil amendment on top of it which at first you started seeing a little bit of burnt leaf tips I made the soil kind of hot by doing that there's a squirrels fighting in that tree but now you know obviously she's getting huge love in it probably getting close to flower time because she's really starting to stretch now you know a few branches I'll still here and there will bend over but I think I'm just gonna leave her alone right now yes she's really big really healthy and the cool thing about having this cage is you can turn it so every week I'll I'll turn it so it's been getting even light it's worked out pretty well Suns missmiss up but yeah we'll have a ton of clones off this just good she stinks if Annie wants any cuz I really don't need them right now I've already got everything I need for my reset they got some white runts regular runts when is there a Mac one in Gorilla Glue so that's cool alright be easy out the fun stuffs up coming soon", "Rkh2vNgRA9E": "good morning youtube we got the 3x3 autoflower tent going on here this one here is the care bears f3 we only have one of them left we did end up with one male with them and then the five in the back are the auto bmg and we did end up with one male from those already so yeah we gutted those guys got them outside i'm thinking these four are gonna be females hoping uh no idea on the two little runts i don't really care about what those are doing they'll probably produce a bud like this big if they're female but yeah we got these girls well regulars under the optic four gen four we're pumping out 150 watts at about just under four feet from the light so these lights are awesome they definitely pump out the uh good amount of light you can see the tight nodes on them and they're looking good too they're holding their color really nice uh no issues just water and stuff well super soil um yeah so that's what we got going on here over here we have the three o g k z look at that monster that thing's a beast um so yeah it seems like we have about three different kind of phenos here this one here at the end started yellowing on me uh early in flower so i had to double up the nutrients the top dressing on it and she seems to uh have brought some color back into her and she's praying looking good this one here you can see she's got a little bit of nutrient burn so we skipped a nutrient feeding a top dressing for her um yeah she did not appreciate uh the amount of nutrients we were giving her and then this one here is just doing great and has some of the most crazy trichrome production um you know like let's look at this leaf here i don't have a very good camera for getting close-up shots but there you go you can see the crystal building up on there look at the leaf on there so this one here is frosting up a lot quicker a lot more aggressively it's holding its color nicely um should have done a little better of a defoliating job i should have probably come up another six inches on the bottom but we're into week three or four flour now so i won't be doing anything too dramatic to them and we did sprinkle a little bit of the blueberry uh pollen onto a few branches on this side right here just a couple right in this area so we should get our blueberry cross og kz um you know might get 50 seeds out of it or something but that's all we need and yeah you can see they're starting to droop now it's only about half an hour before bedtime so they're starting to put themselves to sleep the lights are dimming down we got the master controller hooked up oh i've got it set into manual mode while i'm in here but yeah we got the master controller hooked up you can see boom boom automated sunrise sunset super simple to use plants appreciate it so yeah that thing is going to be a monster when she uh when she finishes that's you know she's pretty well filling that hole minus this little corner here she's filling that four by four pretty good so yeah guys and then these are of course you know under the optic 4xl next gens 500 watts 4xl from optic led uh girls are grown in step well soil we are using just this bloom top dressing step well soil in step well soil the ss soil there so yeah really happy love the smell of the terpene profile on these look at the frost on the fan leaves smells good all right guys that's where we'll leave you um hope you guys are doing well i hope everyone uh down across the border had a good thanksgiving long weekend and yeah stay safe guys stay elevated we'll talk to you soon cheers", "eD3L_eroFZU": "what's up

connection tell me a little about your boot today where you know we got the typical setup as usual we got our seed company going on but we introduced our new clothing line which is what i'm actually wearing and we have our new clothing booth behind us but that's beside the point but that's like the new fresh stuff that we're yeah we got going are you use advanced nutrients you love it you support it your friends a big mike what is your what is your favorite product of advanced nutrients Oh connoisseur I'm a very big fan of the connoisseur when it comes to a lot of my breeding engaging in particular we get a lot of robust growth and a lot of darker green foliage so we're very happy with it that's why we support advanced is that they're the best of the [ __ ] what can you say what makes your product different everybody else's well i mean first off we use advanced second off we have put time into putting a lot of the genetics that everybody loves into seed for the masses so when they can't get it we provided them a way that they can actually access it doing that we allow the general populace to actually achieve and grow stuff that they would normally not be able to do so that's definitely I think what kind of sets us apart from the rest what would you give advice to psych say someone is a freshman grower easy the one thing I'm not good at patience nice tattoos the spacious

so pretty much sixty-two sixty-three bout nine weeks kept throwing light pistols but uh supposed to be like a eight to nine week so it was wrapping up nine weeks so I finished figured I'm going to be pulling her pretty kind of funky no real sweetness or anything to least as of right now it was definitely probably needed to be watered yesterday there was a figure that I was pulling it soon so yes why see everything drooping it was uh pretty much starting to fade more or less pretty decent on the feet pretty frosty a little bit of a purple tint so I really think that was from it was cold in there a couple of nights decent-sized plant not a few tops on to see what we're gonna do I guess what it is so what else can we chop up a small pot actually like like three gallon and it's a number

I'm gonna be my channel name is my update so we're in week seven right now heading into week seven considering I guess I'm gonna just stop counting from the time that I flipped it would be week seven the time that it grew buds would be week six I'm gonna looking online to see what most people say and what not and everyone's saying from the time that you clip it so I guess I'll just go with the time that I flipper never know like when you go online and you see like multiple people saying different things and well in this aspect it's only you know two things these are the same from the time you flip or from the time that the buds form I'm getting you know I'm getting a good amount of information for both both sides but most mostly all of the people who grow the strands and all that [ __ ] like whatever you want to call them dispensary isn't sure they're the ones who are me say to do it from the time that you flip it so I guess that's what I'm gonna do so his is my new kids and they're doing pretty good they're pretty pretty thick maybe maybe two and a half three fingers thick very happy with it definitely more happy with the new kid that I am with like you know this is Liberty Hayes Liberty Hayes it's pretty thin but skinny I should say but these new kids are just beasts I mean they're like you know like they like baseball bats and they're nice and hard to like I want to squeeze them too much I hate touching the bus too much but they're definitely nice and hard place and dense most of them anyways some of them are as dense as the other ones so I'm pretty happy with it I'm gonna stop flushing them tomorrow I just again I gave these these girls some nutrients here that they haven't see if I can get rid of the yellow and but it's probably because they're just ready to start getting harvested they were going on week seven now and this week this week coming up will be week eight because on 25th is when I flipped them self so they're pretty much almost done I got my new tenant tomorrow's hydro tent my Ma's hydro tenant service you know they were saying this the 16 16 D whatever the hell that is I don't know if that's the thickness or that's just like the if it's like a the red count type of thing but I don't notice this to be any thicker than than this this is an Apollo tent I definitely would recommend that Apollo 10 to you guys this is a great tent I've had this tent for a year I don't have any tears or rips in it and I mean it's used pretty well and you can can't really see in the camera but it's different fraying over there from using it and zippering it up and whatnot you know I love it it's a great tent this one seems thirty truth the samaras hydro seems to be cheaper built than the Apollo but that's just my opinion me as my pitch very good they're uh they're pretty much all green I pretty much got all the funky color leaves out of there one side once I fed them the new Kats flower power package they just you know they're obviously obviously going to improve as time goes on you know I mean it's not like you're gonna give them the nutrients wake up the next day and boom they're like you know the way they're supposed to be that's obviously takes a little while but I'm very happy with them you know considering it they're in they own they're not even in a one gallon pot in there they're a foot tall guys I mean they're like a foot two feet tall you know and in theory they're actually just as tall as these plants look you know I mean this is right up up there with them look at some of these stems show you these guys these some stocks stems off [ __ ] you want to call them look at that look at these suckers look how nice those are [Music] everybody like a half an inch thick this one's pretty nice as Durbin poison looks like a freaking tree to me loving it but you know that that yellow and down there and stuff is because it's because of the light doesn't you know like look at this right here I noticed somebody on here I was talking about it but I don't think he understands what I'm talking about I just have my veg lights on because I need to keep it around 400 par you don't want too much power because you know and I also want to slow the growth down because I didn't want these to blow up because I don't have enough I didn't have enough room for them and I don't have the Landon get the pots in time to transplant them I should have just waited like pretty much a whole month before I even did anything with these seeds and the some of them are seized in some of the Morton seeds but if you look right here look how like that leave just looks like it's not doing good because when this plant gets moved over here it's not getting any light its getting nothing it's not getting an ounce of light over there and it's not gonna grow if it's not getting going but on the other hand it's not a big deal because that is the halfway point of the plant and that is where I'm going to strip the whole plant anyways it just you know I mean that's what I was trying to tell that guy I don't know who he is I'm gonna begin the study I saw I made a video about saying that give me he dedicated a video to me for I think was for me anyways it was kind of funny I'm not being mean or anything said that he's got no green no yellow leaves you know I don't give a [ __ ] I'm not here to try to outgrow anyone I'm not here to try to say I'm the best grower cuz I definitely know I'm not the best grower I'm just here just to grow weed get high and be happy that's it that's it's all about and it to learn I mean this is really only my this is my fourth this right he is my that's my fourth 4th grow this one's my fifth grow ever so I can't you know I'm learning every single time next time I'm not using these plots I got his plots on a dollar soil I love them because they hold the water the water don't leak out everywhere cuz if I get those if I get those trees and put them in this tent this is a 27 by 27 it's gonna it's gonna take away some of my room I might not be able to fit 8 plants in here if I do it that way because of the trays because of the where the two trees but up in meat you don't mean I'm losing about that much space and then that much space is also where I could put a plant in between there and you're it's not a complete flat surface like what this is so that's my own that's my thought on it I'm gonna go and you just use the cloth pots next time I got one gallon cloth cloth pots before I move these into that flower tent I'm going to put these in I'm going to sorry when I move these and put them in the flour time I'm going to cut the bottoms off and make clones out of them I've been also cutting the top so that my plants are all kind of similar in size which you can tell I've been doing a pretty good job at that that's my that's a new thing I've been trying trying to just you know like snip like right here cutting this off I just throw it away because I really don't need a hundred clones and it makes two new grill tips like right there and they're gonna shoot up and it's gonna be like two little branches it's gonna be even more I want to show you guys I've been just look at this I think this one is Jack Herer belt granddaddy purple all right suck don't look at this one this is such a pretty plan this is definitely very weird how this is granddaddy purple right this is a clone from a single seed I have the mother plant is in my head never smoked that mother plant up already I don't have them on the plane anymore you see if I can find another granddaddy purple in here I only have one oh I only got one granddaddy purple yeah I thought I had two but look at it look at these leaves I this didn't do this last grow I didn't get nice leaves like this look how nice those are those a nice uh sativa leaves right there like photo-quality sativa leaves look how beautiful that is nice and green yeah buddy you know my buddy over there with the green leaves look how nice and green my leave is there buddy this is get a Nuke a flower power package I love it it's getting all these little shoots over here see all those branches they're just gonna come up and keep coming up this is this is gonna go in the veg tent underneath that scrog net I have a funny feeling that these [ __ ] plants are just gonna be too big and I'm gonna be screwed but live and learn this one's nicest d'oeuvre employees and this is kind of kinda reminds me of a new cat it's nice and bushy I got a new kid over here somewhere this Sour Diesel but I got Sour Diesel for my cousin I suppose it's a clone I don't even know if it's real I'm not growing that anymore I'm not gonna clone that Sour Diesel most likely this is New Kent this one's nice and bushy look at that nice and bushy I do have a sprog net in here but I don't um I don't know if I want to use it ya know I might we'll see I'll probably smoke later and end up doing it I just put it in the other day I just got this tent I wanted to give these girls a little time to spread out who also like I said last bro I I had an issue with my my plants were meeting on me these did not hurt me on me I mean I'm like I said I'm at like week seven six to seven and they haven't heard me Tommy no seeds didn't see any bananas on them saw nothing so they're definitely definitely definitely definitely last grow I think what happened was I can tell like you know the the light the light ended up [ __ ] up on me the timer on the light I mean and the timer never had never turned back on I came home and the light was still was still off now what I probably should have done but I probably should have left the light off and fix the timer or whatever whatever figured out what was wrong with it and then just shut the light off and left it off to turn on the following day but I didn't do that so I would advise that if you guys ever [ __ ] up your timer with the light being off I'd keep it off just for an extra day and then let it go you know resume naturally the next I wouldn't interrupt its darkness I feel like maybe that stresses it out if you're in trouble is darkness period because something must have happened I don't know what happened but all I know is something happened with those plants because they freaking all have [ __ ] seeds so many [ __ ] seeds were in that we're in those that nuke head plant my last my first nuclear plant the one that hurt me it had so many season of guys like I put just a nug in a grinder and I probably pulled all eight seeds and just a little nug you know like what you would sell like a dime bag with it sucked but took the seeds out three more and I said you know I'm gonna see I'm gonna give him one more shot and we give all my plants one more shot and see if I can not stress them out I didn't really do many much topping these but but topping or whatever you want to call it I didn't do much of that I kind of just kind of just left the bee I did a little bit I only did it once last time I did it like two or three times so that could have stressed them out a little bit but I also noticed they'll to by not doing it these are really thin I didn't have these didn't last grow I mean it's not much there this one right here is Liberty Hayes maybe Liberty Hayes is a really thick butter clammy also I noticed that the the stems on Liberty Hayes wasn't as big as this is a dinky plant I mean look how thin that is look how thin that is that's like not even a finger thick this one is a little bit thicker so these buds are a little bit thicker these buds are a little bit better the buds back there that plant back there is a dinky little point really dinky little plant so put it in the scrog technically it could have been my um my thumb cutting I'm thinking that when you have a really good a really good branch like a thick branch that's the one that you would FEM cooked you know if you come over here and tell nice and thicknesses that's what you would top it when it's a thin branch like down here like something like this you don't top it because it's just it's just I feel like that's what happens that's probably what happened that's what I'm thinking that's why I only have three different plants in here the other have three different nutrients and in the different sections like these right here fertile oom those are the organic nutrients and those organic nutrients to those primordial solutions is right here and Agra power is over there but these are right here the Fertile oom and the Fertile oon one back there is definitely thinner than this and you can see the difference we've a controller about two inches right there and this one was just not as thick as you I don't know if it's it's hot I don't know if you can really see it that great I think you guys can't you guys get the point so that's what I'm thinking I'm thinking I just FEM cut a branch that was too tiny and it's probably just not supplying too much nutrients to the buds to get them fat so next time as you know as in this next grow that I'm doing I'm only [ __ ] with the thick branches if I do FEM cut but I'm not doing that in the wall no more topping on these I'm Doug actually just gonna probably put them in a scrub net and in here or in here since I got another two weeks for these before they go in there I'm probably gonna do a scrog netting here just to maybe open up in here and maybe get some colas though some yeah some colas and branches to come up I call them colas I know they're not colas yet technically but you know what I'm talking about the branches turn it to coals yeah I don't know what else to talk about let's see I can show you my other tenant and do anything with it this is the Kasauli tent this is a really nice tent too right if I would recommend this one if you guys see it on Amazon it's not it's not expensive it's tiny it's a 24 by 24 and it's only you know I don't know four feet high I think it's about four feet high I don't know what I'm to do with it yet I am gonna grow Otto flower plants that's going I'm gonna be ordering some seeds in the near future because I want to what I'm going to do is normal normally a lot of flower plants from seed to harvest take sixty days or two months so what I'm going to do is I'm going - as we know these take two months to flower and then you flush them and stuff so it could take two and a half months or depending on the strain you have could take even longer but let's say it takes two to two-and-a-half months for from the time you split that switch to the time that you stop flushing and ant harvesting and in between that once these vets go into my flower tent about the one one month to one week mark I'm going to probably the one month mark because I got to plant the seeds and they take about a week to pop up and stuff but the one month mark I'm going to throw some seeds in here and they're going to be my auto flower seeds so that when these start to grow buds and they take two months in between that two month period I'll be harvesting my auto flowers so I can kind of go maybe like every month getting weed because me and my boyfriend smoke a lot of weed I just harvested that with that plant from the closet over there what three weeks ago - three weeks ago I think I may be gone and I outside actually didn't even measure how much I got out of it could have been more than an ounce I don't know I filled up a mason jar using a mason jars an ounce ounce and a half somewhere on there it wasn't a big plant and only had to cool off three colas on it so and it was underneath the mars hydro and looked [ __ ] it totally totally totally Fox tailed because I didn't have much room for it I couldn't move the light up and that's why hence why I got another tent and I'm not growing in the closet room but um we already pretty much went through that weed so go through about an ounce a week probably maybe ounce every two weeks that we'd obviously we're trying to back off of because we don't want to have to buy weed Clem when I get a whole tent right here I have we personally hidden for me but because I grow it and I'm not gonna have someone smoked all my weed he'll kill don't know I don't care if I'm dating my mom I will be a greedy [ __ ] when it comes to my week so this is the Mars hydro scent it's got that diamond with a diamond texture the Kasauli has a diamond texture to it just a tiny diamond touch - it's got a nice window it's got the nice it's a nice bag with it you know it's kind of cheap actually it's like a cheap piece of it the best but it's alright this bag actually feels really thin so I feel like I don't I feel like maybe this is a little thicker than this bag I don't know I'd have to get a meteor and put it on here and test the thickness of it to really safely the back feels cheap I just think the tent is kind of cheap too to be all honest but it's a pretty nice it's a pretty decent tent I only paid 60 bucks for I can't expect it to be that great I wish guerilla tent didn't make tents so expensive I mean I love guerrilla tents my cousins got a gorilla tent I wish that um I I wish I'd get one but I'm not spending $300 for my [ __ ] tiny tent it's just it's so stupid to me I mean it ain't gonna grow weed any better you don't I mean who's just stuck oh right [Music] so in a few three weeks these will be going in here and I'll be drying these up and I'll be doing a video probably when I harvest them and not weighing them up maybe maybe you guys can tell me what you think I have in here for weight since it's at the end of the video we'll see if you guys watch the whole video and comment how much think of ways I was wonder if people watch them all my videos because I tell you the truth I don't when y'all videos at 20 minutes along I don't always watch them I skim through my fast forward and I just got a TD I can't watch a whole entire video but I try to watch you guys I try to share the love and give it a love back did you guys are it's great to have people talk to me and it's cool to have people come back when I upload a video certain people are always commenting on it and I think that's really cool it makes me feel good that people actually associate on YouTube and [ __ ] and imma getting viewers like up the ass I begin like 3/4 of you is every single week subscribers every week I know I know that's not a lot to someone who's probably has a busy YouTube channel but for me you know I mean I'm just trying to do this with fun and I go and I and I did go on YouTube and I looked up East Coast cannabis did not see anyone with a name that said East Coast cannabis so I'm stealing it it's my name I'm not you know I'm not gonna go put it on like I'm not patent it or anything like that I'm not gonna sue someone if they take it but I am on the East Coast I'm in Massachusetts so these plants look these buds look big as [ __ ] is [ __ ] on these on this thing I'm gonna get your I don't like optical illusions I don't like tough these buds look bigger than what they probably really happen I'll get a tape measure for you guys so it's about six inches six inches wide hey that's pretty big can't say that that's not big not bad maybe five and a half of this one I'm gonna have six inches this one right here this is the Liberty Hayes this one is about four four and a half I'm not tidying it up not putting it really tight against the bud so that's pretty good I'm gonna say I'm gonna say 12 ounces I'm gonna say I got 12 ounces here I don't I don't know we'll see I looked at the trick Holmes earlier in my microscope I'm actually gonna be ordering a microscope from Amazon in a few weeks probably for my next Kroger I can't see through that microscope I got really good eyesight but not only glasses or anything I just can't see squinting through that little tiny [ __ ] hole it's just I don't get it it's too tiny so I'm gonna get a microscope for my laptop plug it in there's a really good one on there for like 30 bucks it's good good review so I'm gonna use that one there you go my laptop take a picture of the trick Holmes real quick cuz when you looking under a microscope and you're looking at you know that magnet that type of magnification a single movement moves what you would think would be like a whole inch on out microscope but it's only a tiny bit but it totally just throws everything out of your view so if I can just get that little than one on on Amazon and you just tap it and it takes a picture once like once I get a good view of it I can tap it take a picture and then go on my laptop and look at it and look at the trick Holmes that way so right now as we stand right now the trick Holmes up up in the top there's a few amber ones but they're mostly cloudy though in the middle they're a little bit more clear there's really not much amber in it so that's usually what I like to stop flushing when they're about you know cloudy to aunt clear to cloudy to Amber once that Amber starts popping up you know the amber even baby up up top and when the middle is pretty it's time to get cloudy and milky within a two week mark you can bet that the amber that the amber will will definitely go down to the you know to the lower but Stu so I usually I'm gonna stop flushing but the way I flush is I don't necessarily drain five gallons of water through each of these pots every single time what I mainly do is I just give them water I might give them an extra you know gallon of water well I usually I do about a half gallon each pot so I probably would do two gallons for two pots so they'll be getting about a gallon each and I'll do that I wanted them every other day like that for about two two weeks two and half weeks maybe once or twice I probably would do a really big flush and in between there but I don't flush them every single time with five gallons of water I just do a longer water period with straight water nothing I don't give a molasses anymore I give them nothing I'm pretty much done feeding them I'm not gonna feed a minimum they're gonna stop just getting flushed there's still fatten up in the next two weeks I'm sure my Liberty Hayes will be a little bit fatter that one down that one right there just really bothers me I don't like that one okay don't like it at all these are pretty good it also sucks when he got them they're these new kids these new cabinet man Cody really did a good job with this strand I mean Liberty Hays is a strain that one a cannabis cup and it's you know it's a seed that I got to legit seed and it's just not even as nice as these new kids and I don't even know what I'm doing so I can imagine what this is like when you grow it under a controlled environment that was really great because you can tell my temperature fluctuates a lot I guess about sixty degrees in the daytime with the lights off and it goes up to about 82 degrees with the with the lights on I open the window here and there let it cool off in here but I don't I don't have like you know it's kind of hard when you have a house to to manage it it's also on the second floor of my house and the freakin heat doesn't escape that all no secondly in its winter so it's tough to control eat in the winter be easier in the summer because I can throw an air-conditioner in this room in the window and I can set the AC to probably 68 or 70 and it would probably keep this tent out of a more easier temperature but when the windows open at night and temperature drops really low because it gets cold and then I close the window and the temperature goes up you know and I mean it's a little bit hotter the controller when you're just opening and closing on what though versus just having an air-conditioner no window but like I said I don't grow medical weeds so I'm not worried about it when I buy another house I'll have them in a basement so that the temperature is more regular in the basement I think that's about it okay another thing I'm doing a Rambo so I move this I got my I got my event right here it's going up goes right in there it goes in the top I've noticed it gives you a little bit more room versus having on the sides over here because I don't have a lot of room in this bedroom bed you can tell that's how my tents is stacked right up against each other I have only about a couple inches of wiggle room in here if that an inch maybe into two let's try to allow some air in there but good it's turtle tank over yes and my Turtles just things really good you guys haven't wanted to get one of these these are really nice I like them I'm putting my clones in here and my seedlings in the air grow everything I stopped everything off and it's Nadel dome I did it last grow had a hundred percent success rate so for me it works perfect I can't wait to stop my autos I don't know what the strands I'm gonna get because I don't know anything about autos I'll be my first Auto girl and the lights that I'm gonna put in that one will probably be there won't be this one this is a really good veg light it's strong it's doing I like what it's doing right now - this plants so most likely it's gonna be this one because this one's dimmable and that 10 is tinier I just don't I just don't know if I'm gonna put the autos in this tent which is a 27 inch tent or if I'm gonna put the autos in my 24 inch 10 not sure I'm probably only gonna grow up like maybe three or four autos who knows don't be surprised if I have eight of them in here cuz I I say one thing and do the total opposite but probably like three or four but the only problem is you're supposed to have 300 Watts for every one plant so I would really need like a 1200 watt light in that 24 by 24 tent to probably grow four plants comfortably to the map today like really maximum potential assault we'll see maybe I'll just do two or three I'll probably start off with like two or three and then we'll see how it goes I guess because as you can tell here I definitely think I maxed out this tent wood plants I think the next girl Minute Rice not that one but the next the next the next set that I start with my veg plants I'm probably gonna just do six and see how that goes because I know I can I can fill that 10 up with 6 plants but I just feel like maybe maybe 6 maybe 6 plants will give me a little bit more room and I won't be as take as much juice from the lights maybe the buds will get bigger you always want to get bigger buds these buds are definitely the biggest that I've ever grown I'm very happy with these buds but um that's that's what I'm gonna try alright this video is 30 minutes long I doubt you guys are even gonna listen to the whole thing soon peace and yeah have fun enjoy growing keep commenting subscribe give me ideas to talk about so I'm not on here with Friday mumbling about nonsense but I don't know what I'm talking about and yeah give me ideas and do not go on my channel acting like a [ __ ] know-it-all I don't like that just go on my channel and be like hey man I got an idea blah blah blah blah don't come no one's aspect to know it all at all I ain't saying anyone has but keep the love coming and hopefully no newbies come on here and act like a know-it-all I'll try to [ __ ] [ __ ] on stuff i watch videos all the time and i see just some rude comments people are just like just so rude on youtube it's like there's you know sometimes keep your mouth shut good you guys are great so far the subscribers that I have but I just got like three or four of them this week so we'll see how they are if they comment alright see you later", "CwKdQgzBy78": "[Music] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel if you are new here my name is dima dims today's video is going to be an updated house store so i always get this like feeling like this itch i don't know how to explain it at the end of every year to change things up in my house to start a new year before i start a new year i had this feeling like late 2019 the same year that i moved here the same year that i did the original house store so i changed things up early last year did an updated house store showed you guys but last year it was just a couple of minor minor changes and minor updates that i had done this time around i have like a very big update in one of the rooms so yeah i always get this feeling at the end of every year and i think that last year it was a lot more intense because december last year i was isolating inside this house i could not leave this house for three weeks straight and it kind of dawned on me that i actually had to make some changes because normally there are certain things just because of the way i've structured my life i tend to not give that much attention but when i was forced to stay indoors last year like it just dawned on me that yeah like where i am at right now i did not think about it i did not plan for it i did not prepare for it and i struggled while isolating inside this bedroom it dawned on me that i did not have a tv in this room i didn't want to have to go all the way to the living room and i did not have blinds in the living room there was too much light coming in with kobe my eyes were hurting like it was just that whole situation that just led to a lot of decisions that i made so i'm really excited to show you guys what i have done i kind of changed things up in all the rooms the office space i just got one new thing that i want to show you guys nothing major honestly i did not do much in the office what i'm about to show you guys you guys might even consider a big change but yeah i got one thing there that i want to show you guys and then i made some changes in the living room and then this room that i'm talking in right now like the most exciting change the biggest update it's in this room so i'm going to start with the office to show you guys what i have there i know that you guys can't see my face at the moment but this area looks very different um i've been putting flowers here since last year i have this new arrangement that you know i showed you guys in the previous vlog that someone sent me this is the only new thing that i have in this room and it's from a brand called hvs home it's an acrylic tic-tac-toe set and it's very very beautiful besides the fact that this is a game that you can play i just love the fact that the base is transparent i love the fact that the pieces are gold this particular shade of gold and it's the same thing you know on the two sides for all the pieces the minute i saw this i was like yeah i have to have this i just thought immediately that it would look so good so good in this particular space you can buy this from the hvs home website i'm going to have the details that you need in the description box they also have an instagram account i'm going to have that linked and if you want to buy this they gave me a coupon code so if you want to buy this use the code the mac 20 as it appears on the screen and you're going to get 20 off the entire website okay this is so good this particular set is available in gold rose gold and silver depending on what you want but me it was just gold that i wanted so if you want a rose gold you can get to if you want it in silver you can get it if you decide to buy this or shop the hbs website just know that a portion of the proceeds from each purchase helps empower women and children in communities across west africa through hps cares it's an act of kindness initiative so that is it so tell me do you guys like details for this will be in the description box okay okay okay so i'm in the living room now okay so i got a new plant for this place this is not the plant that i had here in the original house store and even in the updated household this is not the same plant okay this plant is very tall if you're not sure how tall it is i am 510 almost six feet this plant is taller than me okay so let me explain what happened so guys i told you guys in my video that i went back home this year to spend time with my family all the plants that i have in my living room they died they did not survive me going for that trip okay all the plants in the living room died the only plants that survived in this house is the one that i have in my office and that one looks sick i know that some of you have noticed it looks really sick guys there was no one to water the plants when i left and i don't even think that taking leaving them outside would have helped because they're indoor plants and they don't need a lot of sunlight so yeah my plans died so i had to buy new ones but i really really really like this one i love the way it kind of fans out like i really like it this basket that it's sitting in okay so first of all it is sitting in a pot and the pot is sitting in the basket for those of you who are wondering this basket i really really like this basket i bought it for 8 000 now from a vendor in lucky phase one on admiralty way his name is sadiq and i buy most of my plants from him he's also like i don't know like sometimes some of these vendors they don't take their time out to explain things to you but sadiq is always very calm and he takes his time to explain things to me when i come to buy plants so i got the basket from him he had quite a few um when i got this one so hopefully he still has more so i'm going to leave his phone number in the description box so i have a new snake plant here this one is so different completely different from the one that um i had here before the one that i used to have here it fans out this one does not it just grows like you know tall and slim i like that i got this one from sadiq as well all my plants i got them from sadiq okay but then i did not get this basket from sadiq the small baskets i got them from lucky arts and crafts market um i'm not going to leave the number of a particular person when it comes to this because there are so many people selling identical things in that market so many people selling identical things so the guy that i got this from like i ended up having issues with him towards the end and i don't like recommending anyone who i have problems with because i don't want you guys to go patronize them because it has happened before a lot in the past but people start dming me saying oh demand this person you share their number like guys i don't know these people outside of buying things from them some of them don't even remember me i just shared their details because i know that it's going to be helpful if i have issues that i know that some of you might end up having i just don't recommend or mention them so go to lucky arts and craft there's so many people selling this basket there so this is the second plant that i got a snake plant just realized that i forgot to tell you guys what this plant is called it is called the madagascar dragon tree according to my app here called picture this i know that the sellers would not recognize like they know that this is not the name of this plan to them but you can just take a screenshot of this video and show it to your plant vendor and they will give you something that looks like this okay so next thing that i got is this mustache for this section i just thought it looked good just hanging on the arm of this particular chair i have some mustache yellow situation going on with this chair and some of the throw pillows or cushion covers that i have here so this i think that it looks really good and i also realized that i had the problem of like whenever i'm sitting down here to watch tv i get a bit cold so i have to go into the room to get a blanket or wrapper to cover my body i did not have a throw for this section so i got one i got this from amazon it's going to be linked in the description box so this is the room that i'm the most excited about i'm just so excited to show you guys all the changes that i made in here the last time you guys saw this room i did not have a tv on the wall it took me having covered isolating on this bed being bored out of my mind to realize that yeah i cannot do this i actually need a tv in this room so i had to go get a tv at the beginning of my isolation i was watching movies on my computer like on my laptop not good for my eyes 0 by 10 i will not recommend but that's what i was doing instead of getting headaches from that and i was like yeah i need to get a tv so i got a tv on this wall i am not sure how many inches it is but it's actually one of the smaller ones that they had in the store i'm going to leave the details in the description box so when i got the tv i had it on there and i realized yeah that little oven basket thing that i have there it's not going to cut it i need a proper console there okay just realize that i forgot to show you guys one plant in the living room i'll show you guys but mr kazim came and took measurements for this and i told him to leave this space here completely like just open so we kind of measured that out and all of that at first i wanted to put three baskets in here so the guy that i got those baskets from the one that i showed you guys and the small baskets for the snake plant i kind of paid him to weave three baskets for me but he did such a poor job that like that's where our problem started so that's the reason why i said i'm not going to recommend you so for this table on its own i think i paid mr casine 45 000 for the wooden table like the frame itself and then for this for this basket i paid about 30k 30 35k i think this kind of moves out some of you are probably wondering because i already put a picture of this on instagram what are the cables like the extension or what this is plugged into those things go into the basket just on one side and i use the other half of it for storing things that i don't really want to i don't know hang out in the open okay okay next thing that i have here is this bowl i got this from becky at a craft market there's an entire section where they sell marble items and i've gotten things from that area before like for my very first house store the very first one that i did in 2017 i got some marble items from there and i remember sharing in that particular video they sell bowls like very small ones very big ones if you want so this i really love the color and i love the fact that it just goes so well with the finish that this wood has it looks so good here i'll just use this to throw in keys and just throw in things that i don't want to forget sometimes so this particular base you guys have seen it before i had it in my very first house store in 2017 so i just went and i brought it up from where i kept it in a wardrobe and then i put this pampers grass that i've got from a vendor on instagram very professional guys is vendor i'm going to have her details in the description box i placed an order she delivered to me next day she has a wide variety of pampers grants depending on the size you want whatever size big small she has it so i got this from her and i think that it looks really nice in this corner here okay so last thing that i have here is this jewelry case so one time i decided to make changes around the time i got my tv before i even had this made i went on aliexpress to try to see if i can see jewelry okay so i wanted to order so that it will be in lagos before or around the time i came back to lagos and this got to the post office close to my house about two weeks after i came back from my trip this was everything that i wanted it to be and more i love the fact that it has this gold finish here just goes really well with this base here i love the fact that it kind of opens up and all my bottom jewelry i have it here and i also love the fact that the finish is very similar to the finish like the finish of the wood is very similar to the finish that i have on the wood and you know the rest of the room so this i was just so happy with it and it came in very good condition i got it from aliexpress it came to me in about a month so i am going to have it linked in the description box okay this area looks very similar to how it did in the original house store i just made a few changes so i kind of changed up the frames these frames that i have here i actually had them in my very first house store if you guys go back and watch like my videos 2017 2018 these two frames were literally behind me when i would record videos in my filming room at the time i just pulled them out and put it here so i just wanted to change things up and i swapped them for the ones that had plans this is a new cushion cover that i got i love the whole bohemian vibe that it is giving me i got this from amazon uk and all the things i got from amazon recently even my kindle oasis i got from amazon uk so i just ordered and i sent it to a personal shopper but the shopper can also shop for you if you're having issues with your card at that cheap pse she was very professional and i got all the things that i wanted by her so her details would be in the description box so lastly i have this through here i got this store from h m home and i sent it to my personal shopper and she sent it down to me with this cushion cover as well my bedding is already very light i told you guys i don't use thick duvets or duvet covers or anything thick this one is always light but then the weather has been so hot here in lagos that sometimes i just want something lighter than this so that's when i use this but i just have it folded up in this section here so last thing for this room is this throw pillow this cushion and cushion cover that i have here i got this from the same vendor that i got the pampas grass from wicker baskets ng very very professional guys this and the pampas grass they got to me the next day after i placed my order i also love the whole bohemian vibe that i'm getting from this as well i sit on this chair a lot i sit here to pray i sit here to meditate i sit here to read just books sometimes so i just really wanted to do something special for it and i think that this works this is the last plan that i got for the living room this is one i forgot to show you guys and according to my plant app this is called a corn plant or you can take a screenshot and just show this to your plant seller because i don't know what they call it here in nigeria but it's an indoor plant doesn't need a lot of water all the plants that i have in my living room are indoor plants they don't need a lot of water or sunlight just water them like twice a week and you're fine so guys that is it's got the weather is so hot just a small tour see how i'm sweating but i hope you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up if you liked it and all the details that you need you will find them in the description box so please check there i love you guys i'll see you in my next one bye", "1_3PRWeSLH4": "[Music] [Music] so Paul means mando seedlings are doing good those uh those are 10 watt LEDs I like a man you got the plastic part off that was doing good [Music] a little mirror behind it reflects light back on the branches you know anyhow man these are really [ __ ] look at this [Music] look at that oh yeah this frosty and huge look at that that's one plant at that man that plant has not been topped trained nothing but now I didn't know this till a couple days ago but the technique I used is called monster cropping I didn't know that see but this was a clone that was a bud and I revenged it right I took it off of a budding plant and revenged it and then branches just shoot out everywhere so that's why it's like this ok [ __ ] awesome man it's gonna be a huge yield on this one and this one too this was the one in the fabric and this is the one in the plastic five gallon container but this one's gonna have about as much I think it'll just take a little bit longer maybe to get there but now that one over there I like this Fino baby this is my favorite it's not a stick it's good buds a lot of bud but it's like so it's just got more of the lemony flavor you don't attend like it's real citrusy lemon flavor and none of these have any pollen at all on them it's only that one plant from about three days of darkness or three-and-a-half days of darkness I gave them it made that one plant I had two little bugs that popped out the female flowers and I mean female pollen and see this is the main difference right here if they pop out a ball that opens up you know how males they have little balls like Hank and then it opens up and there's like four or five little banana-shaped acts inside right well that means it's a hermie if it does that if you have that on a female but if your female plant has just the little banana to pop out from the bud and that's all it is then that's just normal female poem but none of the rest of them are making any it'd be nice just to have a little bit more sake it uh makes them see just to put up because I'm not going to grow this any more right now I'm switching to some new ones look this is back here these are really thick and sticky I mean coated totally with traps even the ones down here on the bottom man look [Music] and they just nothing but big dick playing ounces and ounces and ounces on each one of them in this one out here I'll probably get at least I don't know I'll get 600 grams easy I will get 600 grams from this one crop I'm guessing these plants are gonna have at least well I know the last one of these are grew and I grew it in this same bucket actually same container and everything same strain and I got a picture of it on Instagram and I got 220 grams from it so I'm guessing this would be about the same somewhere from 200 to 220 something like that and these yeah these will hit the 200 mark no doubt about it now the other crop I'm not gonna hit 600 so I'm not going to make the 1200 mark no way because uh two of them are in small containers the one and a half or two gun containers whatever I think it's like six liters or something and that was just because I wanted to grow a couple smaller ones to smoke you know while the other ones are ripening but the other crop I got that one big one in the cooler and it had 200 grams the other ones are gonna have like you know 90 maybe a piece maybe so I'm guessing I'm gonna hit about 400 on the other one see yeah that's probably about eight about thousand grams I was hoping for twelve man so that would be a true gram to walk for over 30 days of flowering but oh well that's good I'm getting some new varieties I got a white russian popping sweet - those are both pretty even well no the sweet the sweet tooth is 80% indica 20% sativa but it's a it's a real good cross and you know it's got a good cerebral high but it's still heavy in the curve body stone but the White Russian is across from ak-47 and my Widow so you know and it's one of the highest THC plants ever tested and you know when they say a plant's got 28 that's a total cannabinoids that's like they had the CBD to I believe because of the method high times uses for testing none of them has ever got just the THC that high but it's just a different way different method against no big deal but anyhow and I got the you know it needs a jack whatever okay and I'll be probably starting at least one of the auto soon I never done it before just to say you know check it out and yeah I got probably tomorrow the green for 20 minutes out out him awesome dude send me some Girl Scout cookies okay so I'll have that and then man [ __ ] penalties got two more seats for me man say tricks and these I'm gonna do right okay I got the little of route plugs now you know the little starter plugs that comes perfectly ph-balanced and everything so I'll be good there and I'm gonna order some soil or not soil that soilless potting soil mix from Amazon I seen some that was a peat and cocoa combined and that looks pretty good or I might try the the cocoa bushmaster whatever from Fox warms I might try that I haven't made my mind up but uh yeah I'll definitely take care of those two men and hopefully want to be a male wanna be a female and then I could breed them and you know anybody that wanted seeds like I have them you know I better cut this short I don't even know if I'll be able to up like this man my phone is uh yeah really good really good all right guys I'm gonna get off here so we do a quick update enter I think this is day 37 I've started flowering September the 9th so whatever clicked I think it's like 37 and I'd add it up but anyhow it's September the 9th I don't even know what today is I don't think so yeah all right guys I'm gonna get out there and burn some more this way man I got some outdoor lemonade's I'm smoking it's alright I catch y'all later boots [Music]", "6ZryFv3hM3A": "Donna marijuana

see the light stripes and third blueberry and let me back up you can see those three are the blueberry here is a Mendocino I can't find any data on this one never tried it I imagine it'll be decent medicine I've never been too disappointed there is the bud for that this is plush Barry and the buds are just tiny I got this plant from DJ CC boom back in June and I managed to make it smaller than it was when she gave it to me it's pretty good medicine it's eighty percent indica smells a bit like coffee has a smooth taste it's not a fantastic high but it's plenty good enough though it takes quite a lot med to get me high it still works I'm sure anyone would enjoy nice plush Barry buzz this is black Afghani I also can't find anything I can find Afghani they don't find any information on

working with making extractions pop tough [Applause]", "WfhPgyskbs4": "[Music] hi guys welcome and welcome back to my channel in today's video i'm going to be showing you how to make another type of headband so i already have a first video out on a headband and it's the scrunchy headband so if you haven't seen that please go ahead and watch it it promises to be another fun and detailed tutorial so in this one i'm going to be showing you a different style of headband and it's the turban or twisted front or not headband so that's something that you would like to see definitely keep watching um if you haven't subscribed please don't forget to hit the subscribe button as well as the like button so that the youtube algorithm knows that you enjoyed this video so guys we're going to dive right into the video for today to make your twisted or turban style headband you'll need the following items you'll need some elastic band and i've got my elastic band here this one is a one inch band so i've got this right here you'd also need your measuring tape so i've got my measuring tape right here you need a safety pin so i've got a safety pin here you'd also need some pins and of course your taylor struck to make markings you'll need a loop turner because i don't have a toner i've got a screwdriver right here you'd also need your normal scissors to cut off all loose thread and your fabric scissors but i have already gone ahead to cut out my own fabric pieces so i really don't need my fabric scissors but in case you haven't gone ahead to cut out your fabric pieces you will need your fabric scissors you would also need your pieces that you're going to be using so you're going to be needing three different pieces for this project the first piece is the elastic casing which is what i have here and the elastic casing measures a height i don't know if that's appropriate or width of three inches so this is three inches that i have here actually three and a half inches so you want three and a half inches by 15 inches in length so the length is 15 inches and then this is three and a half inches so you want it that's where the elastic goes in so that's the first piece you also have two pieces these two pieces are the same measurements and these two pieces the measurement that you want for them should be eight inches in height by 18 inches in length so you want eight inches in height by 18 inches in length so you want 18 inches by eight for that and that's two of that then you want one elastic casing that measures three and a half inches by 15 inches so that's what you want so the next thing to do is to go ahead and fold each piece over so you have this one just like that fold it over like that you sew it on half an inch so in allowance you want to repeat the same thing for this one you want to have this one on half an inch so in allowance and then you want to go ahead and repeat the same thing for your elastic casing and have it sewn over by half an inch sewing allowance after doing all of that i'm going to come back to you guys all right guys after sewing all the pieces this is what they look like and like you said oh like i rightly said you'll be needing your fabric scissors so i'm just going to go ahead and separate all the three pieces and this is what they look like after sewing and a half inch sewing allowance i'm going to have to sew all three of them i'm going to go ahead and turn them to the right side out so if you have a loop turner go ahead and do that if you don't look for something long and sharp and then proceed to turn them to the right side out all right guys after turning all my pieces this is what they look like i'm going to go ahead and give all of them a nice iron and then i'll come back to you guys guys after ironing my piece i made a conscious effort for all my seams to land in the middle so that's what it looks like and as you can see these two are the same size this is the elastic casing so the next thing to do is to cut out the elastic we'll be needing and putting it in the elastic casing so you need your elastic to be about six inches to seven inches i'm going to go ahead and cut out seven inches of my elastic so i have about i'm going to cut out seven and a half inches of elastic so i have that seven and a half cut that out just like that i'm gonna put that aside and then i'm gonna fit this into the elastic casing by attaching this to a safety pin so now that this has been attached to a safety pin i'm going to go ahead and feed it into the elastic casing while you are filling this into the elastic case you want to make sure that it doesn't like disappear on one end so if you want you can go ahead and just hold this you see how this end is here this is where your pins come in handy so you want to go ahead and hold this in place so it doesn't disappear you can i advise that you pin this securely in place like that and then just keep feeding the rest into the elastic casing when it comes out on this end you can go ahead and remove your safety pin so i've removed my safety pin pull this out of the way and then i'm just going to go ahead and pin this in place as well so it doesn't disappear now that i've pinned this in place you're going to go ahead and stitch here on half an inch and also stitch here on half an inch and then i'll come back to you guys guys after sewing the elastic casing closed this is what i have like this is what it looks like so as you can see i shot it closed on both ends and this is what it looks like so at this point guys this is what we have so the next thing to do is to sort out our headband so the first thing you want to do is you want to go ahead and turn this into two fold this into two just like that okay if you want you can hold the ends in place with pins just so that you you're not confused like that okay and then you want to put this loop so you folded this into half you want to insert this loop into the second one so just like that and fold that in half as well okay so insert that and fold it in half hold the bottom of this or open all the hands of this in place with some pins as well so now that you have held this implant this is what it looks like and we're literally almost done with our headband i'm going to go ahead and place this here [Music] you want to place the wrong side and then you want to go ahead and just stitch this in place while it's like this okay so you want to place i'm going to go right again you want to get one end you want to place this so that the line which is the wrong side is facing you so you're going to put this in place like that okay you can take out one of the pins or take a separate pin and just hold that in place just like that in the middle then you want to flip this over like that that side over and then you want to flip this other side over as well after flipping that side over you want to go ahead and sew all of this in place by half an inch so i'm just going to go ahead and do that and then i'll come back to you guys guys so i don't know if you notice but when you're sewing you will notice that it is kind of difficult to sew because it's thick but it's okay it's not impossible go ahead and remove your pin and this is what it should look like okay so we're just going to go ahead and finish it up by doing the other side i'm going to push it back to the wrong side and we're going to go ahead and finish up by placing on the other side so again you want to place the wrong side like that so that the wrong side is facing you you want to go ahead and hold it in place with a pin just like that you want to wrap this over one time you want to wrap this over the second time and you want to sew this in place by half an inch sewing allowance so i'm going to go ahead and do the second part again and come back to you guys all right guys i've just finished sewing it and i went ahead to sew it twice that's what i did for the other side as well i sewed it oh i stitched it together twice so that you know we don't have it loosening so i'm going to remove this pin i'm going to trim off all the fraying edges so that's the thing about this fabric is the tin and it does fray quite a lot so i'm just going to put you know trim off all the fraying edges on both sides and then i'm going to flip this to the right side so the time you do this what happens is it looks knit right and then there's minimal frame so that's how it looks like it looks really neat you can trim off all the fraying edges i didn't do that properly there's minimal frame and voila guys you have yourself a headband this is the wrong side of the headband and this side where you don't have any seam is the right side of the headband and as you can see you have the not end or the turban font like that that's what it looks like it's really nice if you ask me all right guys so we've come to the very end of this tutorial and this is what the headband looks like as you can see we have the turban front just like that and this is what the back looks like it looks very neat and it's quite simple to make so thank you so much for watching this video guys we come to the very

gonna make your headband in a straight long piece of crochet work in the stitches that you want when you're done you're gonna bring up the ends and you would typically sew the ends together to create your either your headband or your ear warmer or whatever you're making to make that pinch to pleat when I when I finished my work I left a long piece of yarn but I now have threaded with the needle that we're going to sew this together with you're going to take this this edge and you're going to fold it into a V or fold it in half then you're going to take this end and fold it in half as well and then you're going to interlock these just like that hey we're gonna be in our woven in here now you're gonna take your yarn needle and you are simply going to sew this together I'm just gonna go through that first stitch you're gonna grab all the pieces that first one is gonna be the most tricky make sure you get that the one that's inside there grab that and through there so my needle is going through this piece of work this one this and that so the end the last and the first of this piece and then the center of the one that's folded in here and you're just going to pull that yarn through and then we're going to go through the next side grabbing each one of the tops of those stitches in there they're gonna as you can see this one's kind of trying to fall down in here just make sure you pull that up because you want to make sure you grab every one of those stitches as we sew this together so you can take any stitch pattern or any headband pattern and make it into a twisted headband super easy and very popular right now it seems like everywhere I look people are making these or people are requesting them this is a great item for craft fairs this fall or in the spring or Christmas or anything like that alright we're about halfway done that is okay we're just gonna go ahead and keep working through those there we go when you're done sewing all those together just like any time you saw a piece together make sure there's some flexibility in there you don't want it super tight but at the same time you don't want it super loose then you're going to go ahead and weave it or tie it to secure it my weave in my ends I typically go through the bottoms of the stitches go through about three and then I turn and go right back through those same three alright then we're going to trim and that is the inside of your head man so when you turn it out you have that popular pinch to look but everybody is seeing nowadays I'll see how easy that was [Music] you [Music]", "Zn_qddC0PLA": "hey everybody my name is Stephanie and I'm back again with another sewing tutorial I had a nurse to message me yesterday to ask if I would make a fabric headband with these buttons because when they were a long shift and they have to wear the n95 mask it causes a pressure point behind their ears so she sent me the pattern and I made a couple of these yesterday and since then I've probably had a hundred people to message me wanting to know if I would make something I just can't keep up with the demand so I'm hoping that some of you sewing ladies out there will make some of these because apparently they are in very high demand I even had a nurse from California to message me and asked would I please make some and shipped them to California because they're in dire need of these out there these are super easy to make to me they're easier to make than the masks and they're faster so I'm going to give you all a quick tutorial of how to make these fabric headbands with the button that goes behind the ear and they loop their mask on to the back of the button instead of the back of their ear so again you start with the art fat quarter which is my go to you sewing with your you go for almost everything that I did because they're very easy but this is a fat quarter if you didn't see my first video about cutting in about fat quarters go back to my youtube channel or fall back on Facebook and you can see the the fat quarter tutorial and how to cut on the rotary cutter out of a fat quarter you're going to be able to make two fabric headbands okay so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your fabric you're your fat quarter and you're gonna fold it in half like this not counting this factory edge right here okay so you're gonna fold it in half and then you're gonna line it up on your rotary cutter and right with your mat and your acrylic ruler and your rotary color cutter and you're gonna get some straight lines so if you didn't see that before I'm gonna demonstrate that you want to make sure that this edge is lined up on your black line and then to get a straight cut on this side you're gonna line everything up with your acrylic and you're gonna make a cut so that everything is straight so I've got my first cut the next cut that you're gonna make and this is the pattern I can attach it below but your next cut is the headband is four inches wide so you're gonna need to cut four of these to get your two headbands again so I'm going to take my acrylic ruler again and my next cut is going to be at four inches tighten with cutter so now I've got a four inch strip and I'm gonna do that for the length of the fat quarter which is going to give me four pieces so there's two three and four so if you've never used a mat and a rotary cutter it's a lifesaver you don't have to use it you can use scissors but it's much easier and it's much more exact when you use a rotary cutter okay so after you have made your four inch strips the next step is you're going to take the two four inch strips and you're gonna place them right sides together line everything up then you're going to fold it over in half again like this so my fat quarter folded in half making the four inch strips then I take two of the pieces and I'll put on the right sides together and then I put them back on my cutting mat and then the next cut is this piece of fabric has to be nine and a half inches long so I take my ruler and I count nine inches one two three four five six seven eight and a half I'm gonna line that up I'm gonna make my second cut so now I've got a four inch wide strip that's nine and a half inches long so then I'm gonna take put it back on the cutting mat line up all of my edges and if you'll notice on this pattern it tapers at the edge to two inches wide so you may be wondering how do I do that how do I make the taper it's really easy if you have a rubber and cut rotary cutting mat so what I'm gonna do is take my fabric marker come around here so you can see this so it's four inches wide and I want it to taper down to two inches wide at the base and then if you look here at the pattern from here to here is five inches so what's really easy is you take the ruler and I'm gonna put the ruler on my two inch mark here and I'm gonna move the ruler in like this till it hits the fabric at five inches and it's gonna cut off this little triangle right here cut okay that's gone then I'm gonna do the same thing on this side I'm gonna find my two inch mark put my ruler on it and then I'm gonna angle the ruler in till it hits five inches like that and then I'm gonna hold it I'm gonna cut so now I've got everything I need right here to make the fabric headband so since I've already put my right sides together all I do is open it up like this I'm gonna take it to the sewing machine and I'm gonna sew a quarter inch seam all the way around but I'm gonna leave the two ends open so that's very important leave the two ends open so let's take it to the sewing machine and I'll show you how to do that okay so I'm ready on my sewing machine I've got everything lined up and then I'm gonna come in and start sewing with a quarter inch seam on the end so remember I like the function to push that so that when I stop sewing my needle stays engaged so I'm gonna start setting backstitch I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna lift up my foot and I'm gonna pivot so now we're ready for the next step so I've sewn all the way around a quarter inch seam and then I back stitch at the beginning just like we always do and your right sides are together so the next step and this is a little bit tight but you're gonna turn the headband inside out so you just kind of have to once you get it started it's easy but it's a little tight there at the beginning so this is the way I do it there's there could be a better way I'm sure but this is just the way that that I started doing and it worked for me so you're gonna turn it inside out you're gonna get it going you're gonna pull it all the way through and then you're gonna take it to the iron and you're gonna iron it down flat so once you get that turned inside out and then you iron it you end up with one that'll look like this so this is another one that's been song turned inside out and then iron down flat and if you'll look the ends are open both ends are open so what you do when you get to this step is it's really easy you're gonna fold that end down about a quarter of an inch like so and then you're gonna take a piece of one inch elastic that's been cut four inches in length and then you're gonna stick that little piece of elastic about a quarter of an inch into your little pocket right there then you're gonna put it back on the sewing machine and you're gonna sew your elastic in place so I'm gonna go ahead and do that real quick that's a piece that's gonna be tugged on a lot so you want to make sure that you sew over that a couple times to make sure it's very reinforced make sure it's straight back stitch over it so I did that three times and you're gonna cut that normally I wouldn't use white thread on this but it was just what I had on machine so then you're gonna wrap this around and you're gonna do the same thing on the other end you're gonna tuck this in on the ends about a quarter of an inch you're going to roll it down and the reason you do that is so that raw edge is not exposed and won't fray when you wash it I'm gonna turn that down and I'm gonna take the other end of the elastic and stick it down in there about a quarter of an inch and then put it back on the machine make sure everything's straight put it back on the machine and I'm gonna sew this end up okay see my fabric bunch right there so I'm gonna lift my foot I'm gonna make that correction if you see an error don't just keep going you want to stop right then and and fix your mistake because if you just keep going in an or ignore it it's gonna make an ugly place in your fabric so I'm gonna keep stitching all the way in then I'm gonna back stitch back over the whole thing and I'm going to come back over it one more time so now we've got this much of the fabric headband so now what you'll do is you're gonna put it back on the machine and you're gonna make a 1/8 it stitch all the way around and that reinforces everything see that little white stitch go in all the way around that reinforces it from the outlast thing that you do is you're going to put a button and you're gonna measure one and a half inches up from where the fabric starts that's just an estimation it's gonna end up when you wear it it's gonna end up being kind of right back here behind where that your would be but if I measured that was about one and a half inches up where I sewed it on the buttons that eyeball came from Walmart and I just bought a jar of buttons this jar buttons was ten dollars and eighty-eight cents and it's got so many buttons for a ton of projects they recommended the one-inch buttons which is about this size but I did another one with the button that was a little bit smaller and it worked just as well now a tiny button is gonna be too small and I think this one would be really big and heavy so this button is the ideal size and like I said just go make a ton of projects and this is about the one it resize button so that's how you make the fabric headband and I hope a lot of you will watch this tutorial and start making something because making some because this is a really really big need all across the United States", "9BByXIwOkkg": "hi everyone i hope you're doing well today today's video is about this headband that i have on here and i'm gonna do kind of an unboxing i've actually already unboxed it but i haven't looked at all of them i think i have three and this is called the square band square s-q-h-a-i-r band and i don't know where i heard about this somewhere online when i was looking at wig videos or on a facebook group or something and i thought i'm going to check that out because supposedly they fit like sunglasses well i'll tell you what i always have my sunglasses on my head if i'm outside or if i'm inside and i've come from outside i will always just stick my sunglasses on top of my head because i always have my sunglasses so when i heard that they fit these bands fit like sunglasses i'm like sign me up i was really impressed with the customer service so let me take them out first i'm just going to show you what the packaging looks like so it's minimal packaging so that's good so this is a little bit about um this is just a little um little baggies that they give you for them which is nice and then the bands are in there i have one on my head i got the leopard so this is what it looks like here it might be cheetah i'm not sure let me open it up and see if it says on here okay yeah so this is the leopard so let me pull that off this is what it looks like so you'll see that the ends there it looks like sunglasses and for me sunglasses are really comfortable on top of my head but headbands are usually not they just dig into that area right there by your the little bone behind your ear and so i like headbands but they always hurt me so i couldn't i could never wear them for any you know long amount of time so this is the leopard square they call it square because it kind of squares off there so you can fold it and it folds just like sunglasses basically it has the little teeth there on the inside but i haven't had any issues with that as far as them hurting me or scratching me or anything like that so i've been wearing this one that i have on this is i believe this is the tortoise and then i just got a plain black but it's actually not so plain because there are little rhinestones on either side there and it looks like that folds up like that this is called black and um has the rhinestone so all of these range and price from basically like about 1250 i think to maybe like 20 a piece it's a small company they are based out of dothan alabama and can i just say that i so appreciated her customer service because i really wanted to order a couple and they have different sizes okay so i believe there's a one two and a three i think okay i think i know there's a one and a two well i found one that i wanted but they didn't have the size of one and i was thinking just by reading um what you're supposed to do that the size one would be the one that would fit me the best but they didn't have that one in stock so i was like well i'll just get the size two you know it's probably not a big deal it's just a headband so i'll just go ahead and get that one so i made the order and julie who i didn't know was the owner but she emailed me not very long after that and said you know we got your order i see that you ordered a size two but probably you want a size one because a size one fits most heads most heads uh unless i think she said something like unless you have like a lot of hair i can't remember what she said which i do not but i have started wearing wigs and but you see that i have a size one here and she was able to switch it out for me basically so i got all size ones and so i do have on a wig and it fits perfectly it is not tight on me at all so that's a good thing but i really really appreciated that she reached out to me and instead of just sending it uh she didn't have to do that things like that do mean a lot as far as customer service to me you know when i'm purchasing something online so let me put so this is the tortoise one in that pretty i love tortoise i mean you see my sunglasses are tortoise i love tortoise i think that's really pretty so let's put the leopard one on i mean you gotta love leopard right how cute is this headband it's comfortable because you know your sunglasses when you have your sunglasses on on your head they're not usually uncomfortable and same thing goes for this it's not uncomfortable so i really do like these headbands okay let me try on the black one so you know if you don't know what to get just get black because that will pretty much go with everything you can't go wrong with black and then with the little rhinestones i mean so cute all right as far as what they have available they have tortoise animal prints houndstooth unique prints let me see what unique prints is okay interesting their unique prints is kind of like cracked um cracked paint and there's also a polka dot one and there's a paisley one but it's sold out i bet that one's cute too yeah that's cute let me just show you can you see that that's sold out but it might be back in stock soon also there are metallics classics and then glam the glam bands are like this one so they have the rhinestones so you can get different colors and with the rhinestones i think i might have a coupon code i'll either put it here or i'll put it down below but her website is square bands s-q-h-a-i-r-b-a-n-d-s square bands like i said she has so much stuff on her website but i think that you'll really like these um i have worn them just a couple times i haven't worn them much just because i just had surgery so i haven't been doing too much but i love these i love these so lastly julie if you are watching this from square bands thank you so much for reaching out i really appreciate it it means a lot and everyone else i hope you like this video i hope you will pick up and go check out the square bands website i think you'll really like them and what do you think about this wig y'all what do you think i don't know this is i think it's by hairdo it's really the first time i put it on it's out of my color comfort zone and it's also curly so i don't know y'all need to let me know because if not i'm going to send it back all right that's it thank you for watching i hope you like and subscribe and i'll talk to you soon bye", "LzlqI7M8HDU": "hey guys welcome back to no catchy name it's me ella today i'm going to show you how to add a twist to a headband this is not a tutorial on how to make the headband it's just how to close it to where there's a twist so for your headband you can use any size yarn and hook combo that fits with the yarn to make the headband in a long piece that fits the size you need i will link in the description box a side size list of the average headband sizes and um you just make like a long panel of this size like for me this is about a 22 inch uh panel and when you cut it off leave a long tail at one of the ends for sewing so for this one i used um home what's it called hometown yarn so it's a number six and i used a k hook but you can use any combination of any yarn and hook size and any stitch really but if you do have a stitch that needs to be facing outwards like a bubble stitch or something of that effect you would want it laying facing up on your table or whatever you wouldn't want it on the back side you'd want to face it up so that when you turn your headband it'll be on the outside so first you want to get your needle and put it on your end and a bunch of needles with bigger yarn is to kind of unravel it a little put it over your needle like that and then it'll go into the eye a little bit easier like that so you pick up your headband and you make like a u and then you rotate them both like this to make like a v then over here on the left side you take the right side and place it halfway over the left and then you fold the left over the right it'll make like a sandwich of a c shape right here then you take this leftover right side and you fold it around the back so it's like a c shape here so one goes this way and the other one goes this way then you take your needle and you sew all the way through here just connecting all the layers together make sure you pick up each layer each time so they're all together securely once you're done sewing you can weave in your end and then you just turn it inside out ignore my hand to pretend it's woven in and there you go that's a really cute twist noise in the background is my son for your headband and this would work with any stitch like i said if you had bobble stitches they would be facing out the right way this is just a half double crochet in the back loop only this gives it that ridged effect but that's how easy it is to twist a headband i hope this was helpful to the people who needed it and i'll see you guys next video bye [Music] guys", "WF-PaK_WQXY": "in this video i'm going to show you how to work the 11 stitch cable used in the hot mess headband pattern the hot mess headband pattern is a free pattern using worsted weight yarn from uu yarns available at the link below so for this example i've knit up a swatch of one by one ribbing using 22 stitches per the pattern and i've got two extra dpns set aside one will be a working needle and one i will use to slip the stitches for the cable so the 11 stitch cable will obviously use 11 stitches so we're going to place the first 11 stitches on our needle onto a spare dpn or cable needle if you've got one large enough because it's in ribbing we're going to be slipping alternately knit stitches and purl stitches until we get to 11. seven eight nine ten eleven so the first stitch is a knit stitch and the last stitch is a knit stitch so we're gonna hold our cable needle to the front and i recommend draping your working yarn over this cable needle or spare dpn it just makes it a little easier to work the first stitch so we're going to pick up our working needle and because the first stitch is a purl stitch we're going to insert our needle purlwise and then that's why i wanted this hanging up front we're going to grab our yarn and create a nice long loop that's awkward purl that first stitch and that's okay that that loop stays long now we're going to work in k1 p1 ribbing to the end of the needle okay so here we are at the last stitch and it's going to be a purl stitch we've still got our 11 stitches on hold on our dpn or cable needle we can set aside our working needle because now what we're going to do is work the cable and so we're going to knit in pattern off this cable needle so i find it easier to move my stitches to the edge and then you kind of cross your stitches we're going to move the working yarn to the back so that we can work this first stitch as a knit stitch and then we're going to work in our k1 p1 ribbing to the end of this needle okay so we're at the last stitch from our cable needle and it will be worked as a knit stitch and now it just looks like we've got a huge jumble of stitches you're going to see your long loop of yarn that was created when you created the cable and now we have to turn the work to work on the other side however because we swapped our positions of our stitches when we start working back across in pattern instead of being a k1 p1 rib it's going to be a purl one knit one rib so it's just the opposite so from this point forward your ribbing rows will start with a purl one and then knit one and you will end with a knit one instead of a purl one all right so i've knit a few round or rows past the cable and i just want to show you what that cable looks like you'll have a narrowing where the cable was actually worked and then it will go out to the full width just remember as you're working not to try to untwist the cable that's where you'll see your hole it'll look rather strange but so long as your cast on edge and your working edge following the needle or following the cable are in the same orientation you'll get a beautiful cable twist happy knitting you", "T29JULy96qs": "hey y'all it's alex from you should craft and today i'll show you how to crochet this twisted ear warmer this is a super simple project that's created using single crochets and if you're following along in the newbie series this is day six if you're not following along you can sign up in the description below um to get 30 days of patterns and tutorials to get you started with crocheting but anyway this ear warmer is super easy you basically create a large rectangle that you then seam together to create to create this twisting so let's talk materials all right so my yarn ball is falling apart because i've been using this color a lot lately um you might remember yesterday we used it for the bows i've used it for some other projects as well so please excuse the way that it looks right now but anyway you'll need a worsted weight yarn i'm using the brava that i just showed you it's from we crochet but you could use any acrylic worsted weight yarn you'll also need a j six millimeter crochet hook mine is also from we crochet and then you'll need scissors and a tapestry needle so there are six different sizes of this ear warmer um the full pattern is on my blog so head over there if you don't want to make the baby size which is what i'm going to do for my example and you'll notice that i'm already getting started with my starting chain i just did my slip knot as we get further in this series i'll be going a little bit faster um just so we're not wasting a ton of time like making a chain and doing things that you've already learned how to do but if you're watching this and thinking that you don't know how to make a chain or that you need to go back a little bit just check in my channel or check subscribe to the newbie series because we'll start off with chains and go from there so anyway again i'm making the baby size but there are six other sizes going all the way up to a large adult sized head warmer or ear warmer or headband whatever you want to call it for mine though i'm going to chain 39. all right so once you have 39 um and you want to be close to that number um but what's really important is if this will fit around your head it's okay if it's a little bit loose because the twisting will make it tighter so if you just want to double check then you can literally wrap your chain around your head there will be some stretching but just check and see if it can um so we're going to single crochet in the second chain from our hook and we'll single crochet all the way across our starting chain so for me since i've started with 39 chains oh no i'm going to end up with 38 single crochets so you can go ahead and pause the video and just finish crocheting row one again you're just doing single crochets all the way across your starting chain i finished row one now i'm going to chain one and turn my work and then continue to just single crochet across so the pattern on the website will tell you like how many rows you need to do for your size that you picked but if you're doing the baby size like me we're gonna do 10 rows of single crochets so you can go ahead and pause the video and then finish up however many rows you need for the size that you have chosen so i'm going to do 10 and then i'll catch back up with you when we are joining our headband in order to make this cool twist okay so i'm just wrapping up my tenth row um you should be done with however many rows were required for the size of headband that you picked um the next thing we're going to do is trim our yarn leaving a tail that's about 12 inches long but if it's longer than that it's not a big deal and then pull your hook all the way through and join your tapestry needle so we are going to make the twist so we're going to want our headband to be kind of like this where we fold the sides into the center but instead of just doing a straight join we are going to get our twist on which is actually way easier than it looks so take one side and fold it in half and then take the other side and fold it in half and then put these into each other so that they kind of make an s um like a little i don't even know what you would call it but you can kind of see that here's one side and then here's the other side so it's basically it's like this um and then they're folded together and we're gonna sew through all four parts trying to stay [Music] in the top stitches you don't want to go like too far into the next stitch but we're literally just sewing through all four parts in our s shape and you can go through it um a second time once you've finished to just make sure that it's super secure and also to kind of weave your yarn through a little bit more but this is such an easy way to make a really cute headband um because it's not the crocheting that's that that's difficult it's just that we do this cool join and it makes it look really complicated um just looking at one of these headbands i like had no idea how it worked and it just looks so fancy but all right now i'm at this point i'm just weaving in my ends and i'm feeling pretty good about it so i'm just going to do one more pull through on this one and then i'll trim off my yarn as soon as i had a little bit extra which is not a big deal i just trim it off and then you can weave in your starting tail as well again kind of sticking to this area making sure that our join is like super secure and then weaving in this and and that my needle fell off but i don't even care because i'm pretty satisfied with how well it's woven in so if you pull a little pull it out a little bit um it looks pretty weird but that is the inside so just flip it out and that's it so you can see we've got this dope twist the one that i did is really small this is like for a baby sized head but here's another one i did that fits me so this one's much larger i'm gonna fit an adult person um but again there's six sizes on the black so hopefully you find one that fits you or your kids or your friend whoever you're planning on making this for but thank you so much for watching um make sure that you subscribe to the youtube crafts channel and the you should craft blog and if you're a new crocheter or you're just looking for some super easy patterns be sure to subscribe to our

cooler months or for warmer months where you want something light but you want maybe to add a little bit of color you know a little bit of flavor in your wardrobe so that's about it let's get this thing started [Music]", "ZOhwIQjSDzE": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "6X2wwHh2pbY": "hey guys today I'll be showing you how to make this super cute crochet headband it's perfect for the wintertime and it's a super fun and easy quick project [Music] aside from Yoren and a hook you will also need a pair of scissors and a tapestry needle which will be used at the end of the video to sew in the ends so this project is perfect if you have any leftover yarn hanging around which is what I'm using here this is a wait for Hobby Lobby yarn it's I love this yarn brand I love this yarn because it has the gold shimmer to it and it's going to be perfect for this project I'm also using a size H hook or a 5 millimeter hook I also got the super cute hook from Hobby Lobby which I'm obsessed with to start this project it's going to be pretty much just chaining double crochets and slip stitch which are all pretty beginner if you're new to crocheting so the first step is to create a slipknot as you see here I'm wrapping the yarn around my two fingers and then I'm pulling it through the middle and then if you pull the ends it creates a slipknot which you can clearly move each ends I'm going to take it out and actually show you how to do it again so you're going to wrap around both fingers you're going to pull the loop through the middle as you can see here and then once you pull it you can fasten the ends tighter so once the supplies created you can go ahead and put the hook through the Slipknot the way I hold my yarn is I wrap it around my pinky I use my middle finger and my thumb to kind of gain more control and hold the work my pointer finger is used to hold on to the yarn which kind of leads the yarn over the hook so step one is really to start chaining we're gonna go ahead and chain 16 to chain you're going to bring the needle toward you go underneath the yarn and pull it through the Slipknot so the sixteenth chain is actually going to be our plus-one chain which we're going to be using consistently throughout the project as you can see here I've reached my sixteenth chain this is actually going to be the height of your project so if you want to make your headband smaller feel free to chain let or if you want to make it larger you can add in a couple more chains and it'll just reflect in the height so now we're on to our first rail row like I said before the 16th chain is just our chain 1 so we're actually going to be skipping it when placing our double crochets I'm just going to zoom in a little closer so that you can see that that's the 16th chain and then that's the 15th so we're going to be going from the second loop from the hook which I'm pulling apart here so first thing you do is yarn over you're going to put your hook through the loop you're gonna pick up you should have three loops on your hook as you can see on mine the next step is to yarn over and pull through two and then you're going to yarn over again and pull through the last two and then that's the double crochet you're going to be placing a double crochet in each chain from the hook so when you're done you should have 15 double crochets now that I've reached the end you can see this last knot here doesn't really look like a chain that's actually the slipknot so we're not going to go ahead and place a double crochet in here I'm stretching out my work you should see that there's 15 double crochets there once you reach the end of every row you're going to chain one and then flip your work your work should always be on the left hand side of you at this point in the headband become super repetitive so you're going to yarn over and place a double crochet in the last double crochet of round one once complete you're gonna place 14 more double crochets to bring you to the end once you get to the end of row 2 you're gonna notice it looks a little different and that's because we've been placing a chain 1 on the end of each row so when you're placing your 15th double crochet you're gonna go ahead and yarn over and place your hook right where my hook previously was once you're done you're running over you're gonna go ahead and chain 1 you're gonna flip your work and then you're gonna repeat row 2 for 29 more rows once you're finished you should have 31 rows in total if you want your headband to be a little smaller you can go ahead and reduce the amount of rows that you completed if you want your headband to be larger you can increase so once you get to your desired length you're gonna go ahead and flip your work in half you want to match up the ends to each other because we're gonna actually sew this together to make the headband so if you notice that one end is slightly larger than the other you might have added additional double crochets in your work so what I would do is go back and just make sure that you have 15 double crochets on each row what I'm doing now is I'm lining up each double crochet with the opposite double crochet I'm going to be sticking my hook into both holes and performing a slip stitch which is you yarn over and pull through both holes I'm going to be doing it again here so I'm going to place my hook in one end as well as the other end so you should have both double crochets on your hook and then you're going to yarn over and pull through I'm gonna go ahead and show you the selling at a different angle so if I've let my work toward me I'm gonna see both ends of the headband pressed together I'm gonna be taking my hook pushing through both double crochets that are across from each other going to yarn over and pull through all of the loops so now that I've reached the end of sewing my work I'm going to go ahead and double check and make sure that I didn't miss any double crochets if you flip it the other way you can see the seam as well on the outer side but it's okay if it's not perfect because we're actually gonna be scrunching up this area and you won't notice the seam at all if you're new to crochet I highly suggest you get one of these starter kits from Amazon I got this one for $15 and it came with a ton of different hooks and actually these scissors and the tape is tree needle as well so what I'm doing next is I'm gonna leave a lot of yarn to work with because we're also gonna be sewing the scrunchie part of the headband so I left a good amount of yarn to work with I mean it's better to have more than less what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do one last chain to fasten off our work and I'm going to pull the remainder of the yarn through that chain which will create a knot so that your work doesn't come unraveled at this point make sure you have the front of your headband facing up as you can see I tucked away the seam that I just sewed now I'm gonna be taking the yarn and I'm gonna be putting it through the tape astray needle and you're gonna be sewing in the scrunchie part now which there's some flexibility here so as you can see I'm kind of twisting the yarn to get it to fit through the tapestry needle I generally prefer the metal tapestry needles but I keep losing them so I'm just gonna stick with a plastic one today so now I'm going to scrunch my headband in half and kind of fold the ends with it as well to get it to look like a nice cute little bow I'm going to press these two ends together tightly and then sew back and forth about five times to get a nice tight knot in there so that the scrunch stays what we make the middle section yeah now we're on to the final step of the headband so as you can see it already looks kind of like a bow make sure it's just a really pull tight on the yarn to pinch together now what I'm going to do is I'm going to place my hook in one of the chain spaces in the middle it doesn't really matter which one cuz it's going to end up being hidden anyways I'm gonna yarn over and pull through that chain and then I'm gonna make a few more chain so I change between 35 and 40 you just want to chain enough that you can wrap it around that middle section a few times once you get to the desired amount of change you're gonna fasten off the end of the chains and then you're gonna begin wrapping it around the center of the headband pretty tightly to keep that bow shape to secure the headband you're going to take the original yarn they use to make the slipknot and the end of your chain and tie them together I tied them together like six or seven times just to make sure once you tie them you're gonna cut down the yarn and then I tuck them in behind the raveled part of the headband just to make sure that they don't come undone", "EmHCgJYtIhQ": "hey it's me Quinn straight photo straight floor comm every time I like to do a come-up product with you I guess I don't whether they're any good or not but sometimes it helps me if I look at some on YouTube and somebody else that says a B or C about it sometimes I can have one of my questions answered so sometimes I like to try and answer someone else's questions about a product I run I run pretty regularly like don't usually wear headphones when I run at least I go through phases I'll sometimes all wear them a lot and I warn for two or three months in a row when I run and then other times I'll go six eight nine months without ever wearing headphones when I run but this last summer I started listening to this audio book series um anyway it's stuck in my head I can't finish it I can't get through it I've got to keep listening to it you get through it um so any rate I've been listening to headphones a lot when I run lately and a couple years ago for Christmas I bought myself these uh em pal I think they're called bluetooth headphones from Amazon they were super inexpensive I remember how much I made from less than 20 bucks I think and they've been pretty good they connect well the external controls are pretty ok I don't love them but I don't hate them really the left one I don't think it's somehow I wanted to my ear I can't hear as well out of it as I can my right side I don't know if that's my ear problem or a headphones problem of course I lost all the adapters to visa the little headphone piece the rubber pieces I've lost all the extra pieces almost immediately again these little ear holder in parts so any rate and in the winter if I put something over my ears to keep my ears warm then it pushes these further into my melon head and that kind of stinks it hurts after a while it gets annoying so sometimes if I'm on a longer I'll end up taking them out coming back in time at any rate these work but they're not great so I start looking at different options and I looked at a whole bunch of really ridiculously expensive Bluetooth headphones any rate came across these on Amazon this is some sort of headband and this is just this thing was Bluetooth it's some sort of headband but I kind of thought well maybe it'll keep my ears a little bit warmer because it's winter and maybe a lot of speakers and it'll be more comfortable than the in the ear headphones I got this one because it says you can take the little speakers out and wash them and then you're right let's see how it works looks like there's a charging port right there and already I can say that the stitching on this it's just garbage I mean these are only 15 bucks but I'm no audiophile I don't demand super high quality stuff but the stitching if you can see I don't even know any rate the stitching is falling apart right there it's like right from the cellar classic any rate let's plug a manual charge him up let's see how they work not even know the speaker's feel pretty big in there so the DX you wear them over your ears just like the top yeah see already I feel like a dork it feels like the speakers are too far in front of my ears anything on backwards I don't will charge it up and see how it works by it so this um this side I don't know what to call this site if it's the right side of the left I guess I would try put this on the right side some right-handed and it has the controls on it that's a little light that turns on here a little red light and then um turn it off I guess that means it's charged money right I'm surprised it how kind of thick the actual speaker units are they seem pretty thick thicker than I had expected and I don't know what I expected but I expected something a little bit thinner than this um let's see they are [Music] yeah I mean there's 16 15.9 almost 16 millimeters thick which makes them feel I don't know they're pretty big I'm a big head this feels tight on me I'm usually between a 7 and 5/8 and 7 and 3/4 hat size so I do have kind of a big head but these still it seems a little tight but I think it'll loosen up I don't think that's an issue yes Wow that seems all right let's see if I could get them to connect with any sort of ease I don't know if you can tell they're doing their little buttons in here I'm have to read the instructions alright I've been reading instruction that says too long press the stop button now this is pairing what says connected now so let's see if it works yeah I can definitely hear it by out like our initial impression just sitting here in my office with the stupid headphones on like the headphone itself is right here and my ear is back here if I could stretch this and get it to go well then I can hear that really well but in a normal fit thing I mean the speakers are right here 1 inch in front of my ear it's definitely not loud yeah I'd be a little bit surprised if I could hear that well while I was running but let's go for a run and see if it had if it works [Music] [Music] okay so it's cold out it's not freezing I mean it's 35 33 was 28 this morning so these are definitely keeping the tops of my ears warm and I like that I'm louder by pulling them further down over my ears the bad part is that they're quiet enough that they're already at max volume and if they're right over my ears then I can hear them pretty well but if they're up a little bit it's pretty quiet like a car went past me I would never hear anything I would hear the car though which is great because that's one of the problems with the in the ear headphones is I hate not be able to hear traffic and dogs that are chasing me first I couldn't figure out the volume controls but now I figured them out you can turn it up turn it down track up track down or at least search a little bit the problem is I've got it on full volume all the time and like if when I was on Main Street with a traffic I couldn't really hear too much even at full volume which if it your listen to music that wouldn't really be a big deal at all but if you listen to this stupid audio book with 44,000 characters and a bunch of plot twists then it's not being able to hear it as a problem [Music] alright last mile or so I listen to music they're way better for music yeah I even have to turn the volume down to about I don't know where but roughly half and like it's still totally hear the music so it's something you're not that interested in paying real close attention to her he just want some background music it's it's pretty good for that I was you know so you could do worse but the cheapest one I found so maybe you can't do worse but as long as you're not some sort of crazy audiophile which again I'm not for music it seems she's pretty adequate all right so here's good i from running with the headphones on and I gotta say like the tactile feel over here the actual the the buttons it's actually pretty good and the feedback you can tell when you've pressed them unlike the plaints about these other ones is that this is the volume button here it's like up and down and then this is um pause and play and power um once these are in my ear and I have to reach up here to fumble with this especially if like on a cooler day I'm wearing gloves then it's kind of finicky and it's hard to tell if I'm pressing the up or the down and and I've used these a lot that's actually surprising I still fumble with those maybe it's just because I'm an idiot but uh I find these buds to be pretty finicky at the end of the day I found these buttons to be pretty pretty decent um again like I say let's sound quality isn't all that fantastic but I don't really care I don't mmm yeah when I was younger cared how much how well the sound sounded or the now if I was never into that I Biff it was loud it was cool I didn't care how it sounded really nice still don't one concern but I do have it's connected pretty easy I was impressed with how well and how fast it connected to my phone the controls all seem to work well the speakers they pressed a little bit again stuff my ears that's probably cuz this is new and it's probably little tighter if I stretch out over time the audiobooks I really couldn't hear very well when I was on Main Street near the traffic when I was on a back street with no traffic that I hear pretty well music wants to turn the music on around with music it was great dude told him is fine honey I just turn it down a little bit anyway and thinks you can work really well let me I notice about the construction of this and I saw a little bit yesterday about how it's not the world's greatest stitching your construction this also seems to pretty a pretty high cotton content which in something like this I don't know how long it's gonna last it's it's sweaty into even just now after only 5 miles it's really sweaty and so that's the bonus to something like this has wash these doesn't have to watch this over and over and over in the summer I wouldn't wear this they do it'll be with you hot as far as the cotton content if it was more of a lycra spandex or something they'd probably I thought this is gonna stretch out and stay stretched out I might be able to regain a little bit of elasticity with washing it but it's just a something I've noticed I can't wait comment on how long it's gonna last cuz I won't use it one time so I went to this pretty low expectations how do you only spend $15 on it and I gotta say better than I thought it was gonna be but it's not fantastic take that for what it's worth it's a pretty poor review of something is basically at the end of the review say hey whatever but after one use I you definitely can hear the music you can hear the audio books not as good as the music but fair connects well it's not uncommon durable it would definitely be a little hot in the summer but as far as when I bought it for four couple of tops my ears cuz they get really cold in the winter and being able to hear the audio books without blocking out sound that's great I heard three dogs I know I don't hear with these today so yeah letting in the ambient sound is definitely a bonus when you're running especially around traffic and and this accomplishes that it alleviates what I always consider to be a problem with these Oh any rate my take-it-or-leave-it review of the I can't even what it's called with Amazon the music headband I'll put a link to it in the description thanks for watching hey it's me Quinn stray photo thanks for watching my video if you enjoyed it click on like and subscribe if you're so inclined also if you're in the camera themed t-shirts I've got a bunch of really cool t-shirt designs over at my RedBubble store I'll put a link in the description I've also got a bunch of really cool stickers there as well thanks", "I1rEkvzPCqU": "hey guys this is our women and Buzz and my team to show you how to make a woven headband so for this tutorial I've chosen for very brightly colored different ribbons but this is actually made with four different lengths of ribbon all together it's just only two different colors I'll show you how to get this so to start I'm going to need 36 inches of three-eighths inch ribbon and I've gone ahead and glued together two different ends of these 36 inches of ribbon so each length the coral the purple the yellow and the green they're all 36 inches long not to start I need to figure out what colors I want to be on the inside with this heavy and it would be the purple and what colors I want to be on the outside with this head and do it either way so if I want my purple and my yellow to be on the inside for example they're going to be my top two ribbons right here did I start with so I'm going to go ahead and go with that so to start we're going to take my first blue together at long like the ribbon you place it right here in the incident and I want it to be at about a 45 degree angle so this is 90 degrees I want my ribbon running about 45 degrees straight through there now I'm going to do the same thing with my second leg big ribbon I'm just going to glue down right here and again I'm going to make a 45-degree angle okay let's get started so for my first move I'm going to take my upper left piece come over into the right and then I'm going to take my upper right piece going back to the first piece of their bin I touched I'm going to also go under to the left and now taking the last piece that I have right here on the right I'm going to go over to the left now I'm going to come behind go in between under my green over my red pull over to the right I'm going to take my green piece that I haven't moved yet bring him behind under to the right so now Here I am with two lengths of ribbon in each hand and I'm going to start the process over I'm going to take my yellow piece now go under to the left my green piece to purple I'm gonna take my coral go under to the right so now I'm starting over in step one again I've got two lengths of ribbon on either side I'm gonna take my purple go under to the left go over to the left going to bring my yellow through go over to the right I'm gonna bring my green behind over all right let's get going okay once you get down here to the end I'm just gonna have to kind of pay attention how we want this little impersonal book I go ahead and braid past the end and here's the best way I've found to glue down it's gonna come in here just to hear my pieces that are sandwiched together get them a little bit of glue kind of like we did at the top I'm just gonna merge these two pieces together with some hot glue I'm gonna do the same right in here fold over okay here we go that is a woven headband and I find that this is kind of an easier tutorial to follow if I'm looking at photos stills that way I can see steps one through five but don't worry we've included that too so thank you guys so much for watching and look for so many more tutorials on ribbon and those of my dog", "bDHVRGT9EVQ": "hi everyone I'm Bonnie from really reasonable ribbon and make time to crafts today I'm going to teach you how to make a deluxe checkerboard woven ribbon headband the weave is the same easy basic weave like we did on the last checkerboard headband but this time we're using a 3/4 inch white plastic headband which allows us to add the third row of quarter inch grosgrain ribbon the supplies that you're going to need are 1 3/4 inch white plastic headband some score tape this is optional but it really helps with this headband a glue gun 1/4 inch wide grosgrain ribbon each of the medium or dark colored ribbons is 26 inches long and you're going to need a piece of white or a light colored grosgrain that's three yards long today I'm using sherbert and grape as the dark the medium to dark colors and white as the light color that will wrap around the headband I selected these colors because they coordinate with the colors of the July ribbon club assortment from really reasonable ribbon each monthly ribbon Club assortment is a holiday or color themed ribbon assortment once you enroll you'll get a new assortment at the beginning of each month until you tell us to stop what a fun way to build your ribbon stash and try new ribbon styles I have a bow I created with one of the ribbons in this assortment which I'm going to attach to the headband when I'm done so I have taken my 3/4 inch headband and I have wrapped a piece of score tape around the center and both ends which are going to help us quite a bit to get started and to work the ends of the headband for this headband I'm going to start in the middle because the ends because the ends of the headband tapered down it gets a little tricky because you're going from a three-quarter inch width which is easy to weave these ribbons down to almost a half inch where they're not really fitting as well anymore so it's easier to start in the middle and work your way to the ends and the tape will act like a third hand to help us just to hold things as we're working the ends so I've taken the medium the colored pieces of ribbon and I've ly remove the covering of the tape and i centered them for us to get started and then for the white I have it on an angle because if you'll remember from the other headband you want the white to go straight across the front and then it's going to angle on the back of the headband so we're going to get started and I'm going to do my best to keep this in the center of the frame but I don't really know how that's gonna go because it's very awkward to work this when I'm making these headbands I am preferring to be sitting on a couch with my feet up and my legs are acting as a third hand to help hold the headband so it's probably a little awkward whoops I set this up too far ago and the tape is holding stronger than I'd like it to alright so we're going to get started and really like I said the tape is just there to help you hold things while you're getting started so that the ribbon doesn't just pull through until you get a few rows worked in so we're just doing a regular weave like you've been doing with pot holders since you're a kid over and under and around the back and you know another great reason to be starting in the middle is you now have a three yard length of white that you're working with because it's going to go around the headband so many times if we started on one end it would just be too much to keep moving that 3 yard around the headband so like with all my headbands I'm constantly adjusting snugging things up we'll pull these so that they're tight and you know keep an eye on what's going on in the back it's easier to correct a problem if you see it right away then if you wait till you're down here and you see there's a problem back up in the middle and I'm just going to keep leaving and adjusting until I get to the end and then we'll talk about ending and how to talk the ribbons in and make it as neat as possible ok so now I've made it down to or might apis and as you can see as it narrows down you're going to end up the ribbons are going to start to just lightly pleat which they're going to have to because we're taking them from a three-quarter inch width down to almost a half inch and they simply don't fit like they did at the top but we're going to do the neatest job we can and if you think about it from here down you really don't see when the headbands being worn most of the time anyway this is the part that you see that goes over the top of the head even if it's not seen though we want it to look as neat as possible particularly if you're going to sell these headbands because if they don't look neat when people are looking to purchase them they're not going to buy them so I uncover the tape because we really need like a couple extra hands when we get to the bottom and the tape really helps and when you first uncover it it's not as permanent as you noticed how stuck it was at the top because I got it prepared ahead of time last night so we're going to keep the weave going as best we can and this is the part that I would spend the extra time on I'm going to try to move through it pretty quickly just for the sake of the video so this one may not be as neatly finished as my others and as far as finishing it you just really have to play it by ear you have to see how the ribbons lie at the end for the way things are here I can see I'm going to be going over the pinks and under the purple so at this point I'm going to pull the purple up out of the way and I'm going to finish off the Pink's the Pink's are going to come around to the back and I am going to glue them in place so I am going to trim my pieces I'm going to quickly heat seal the ends and I'm going to add a little hot glue and tuck both of the Pink's sorry I'm trying to stay in the picture frame for you and get both of the Pink's done in the back so my white is going to come around I'd peeled the white back just to give myself extra room to glue down the Pink's I'm going to come around with the whites to the front and I'm going to now finish up the purple and bring it around to the back you can also add a little glue for the white to just to hold everything together I'm going to put a little glue on the purple trim that and this you're not going to have a whole lot of room because you really want the purple to end because you want to cover it when you bring the light around so there's not going to be a big fold-over on the purple so I'm just going to trim a little bit heat seal the end add some glue and tuck that down and then we're going to bring the weight over I'll glue that as well and the white I don't trim til it's glued on just because I want it to go right to the edge pull the extra glue off trim this and heat-seal the end talk them down and that's not bad considering I kind of rushed through it for the video now I mean but on the ends you have to play it by ear because you don't always end same way sometimes the Pink's are on the outside and the pro depending on where you are with the rap as you get to the end so we'll just the other side is just repeating the same steps and the same end and that's all there is to it the inside is actually not bad looking you'll see a little as you as it narrows down you're going to see a little of the color comment along the back if the back really bothers you you could always cut a piece of 5/8 inch grosgrain or 7/8 inch grosgrain line it trim the edges and heat seal and that would cover some of that up but I don't think that's very bad at all and if you look at the other insides the ones I spent a little more time on it's actually not bad at all so this is a great fun new headband and it takes the regular checkerboard headband just one step further for something really special thanks so much for joining me and learning how to create this deluxe checkerboard headband if you liked the video don't forget to give me a thumbs up below and subscribe to my youtube channel so you'll be notified when I add new videos happy crafting you", "PauUgb0jiAE": "Hey ladies so today I want to show you how to make the mommy sized twisted headband this fabric is fabric and it is from Fox and tops custom fabric I will leave the link in the description I am using a sewing machine it's the sinker heavy-duty for 4 to 3 and this fabric I really have it pre-cut so that way I don't take too much of your time it is 20 inches long by 8 inches wide so this is a really quick and easy headband to do so the first thing you need to do is you need to fold it in half for the pretty sides face one another so for this when we are going to sew along this edge right here in a zig zag stitch if you need pins or if you need clips to help you keep everything aligned you can however I don't so what I'm going to do is put it under my machine and begin to sew so I'm just making sure everything is aligned because I don't use pins so I'm gonna pause and just align everything so now if you have extra right here you can trim that and I'm just gonna do it with my scissors if you have the pinking shears you can do that as well so I'm just gonna trim mine halfway I'm not gonna get too close to the thread I did a zig-zag stitch so that way it will still have this stretch if you do the straight stitch you are going to lose some stretch and the zig-zag stitch just gives it the ability to continue to stretch you could back stitch if you wanted to the most part I just grabbed the two ends and I tie a knot in it just to hold it in place and then I trim it and you don't really have to do this because we're going to sew the ends here in just a few but this is just something that I like to do so now that that is done with we're going to turn it and if you can tell one side has the seam where we sewed and one side doesn't so you're gonna want to face the side that has the seam towards you so you're gonna want to make sure that your Center is centered in your fabric so there's my seam it's the center so I'm going to want to make sure that it's like that for both sides so then what you want to do now is you want to bring this over to where this edge meets that seam and this is where you can use your clips or your pins and then this edge back here you want it to match up with that seam right there so the next this strand right here is gonna fall back around that and I'm making sure that everything is lined up and I'm just going to clip it so then this remaining strand over here I'm going to bring it forward and around and I'm just gonna clip it so everything is clipped and then if you want to make sure that you did it correctly you can open it up and make sure that it looks like what it needs to look like what I'm just going to line mine really quick because you want it to have like this little twist right there so now that everything is aligned I'm going to put my clips back on there and I'm gonna give it a straight stitch right along there before I get to the end I'm gonna do a back stitch two times and then another forward stitch and then I want to keep my needle down and then I'm gonna lift my foot twist my fabric around so that way I can do another stitching along that same stitch line that I just created and then you want to do a back stitch and then a front stitch and then you can remove your headband so now you just cut the extra and now you have yourself a mommy headband if you have any questions you can comment below like I said I will leave the link to the just in the description of the Fox and tots custom fabric website that way you can search this this was a ready to ship fabric as you can tell the fabric is real vibrant in color so if you have any questions feel free to comment below thank you", "q_H0bKeKcVE": "[Music] hi there this is Laura from Traverse Bay crochet and today we're going to be making this beautiful TC twist headband it has lots of texture in this really cute twist in the front and it's really easy to make so let's get started for this project you can use medium worsted weight yarn or bulky weight yarn I'm going to be using yarn B and e-cell pakka and CityBeat it's a bulky weight yarn I want mine to be just a little bit thicker for the bulky weight yarn you'll be using a size i 5.5 millimeter crochet hook or a size H 5 millimeter crochet hook for medium worsted weight yarn so to begin we're going to chain 17 for bulky weight yarn or chain 21 for medium worsted weight yarn for Row 1 we're going to be double crocheting into the third chain from the hook and then into each chain down the row when you reach the end of your road chain one turn your work and we're going to single crochet into the first stitch and front post double crochet into the next single crochet into the next stitch and front post double crochet into the next so you will be doing your single crochets every other and the front post double crochet every other so every other post so this first one did not get get the front post double crochet but then we do it in the next okay so we're going to single crochet into the next and front post double crochet around the next and we're just going to repeat this all the way to the end of the row ending with a single crochet now we're going to chain one turn our work and for Row three we're just going to single crochet all the way back down the row now we're going to chain one turn our work and single crochet into the first stitch and now we're going to do a front post double crochet around the front post double crochet from the previous row and single crochet into the next stitch and front post double crochet around the previous post and just keep working in this way all the way down the row so we're going to alternate rows three and four until their piece measures about 21 inches I have different measurements for what size you're looking to make on my blog and I'll post the link in to the description so that you can make a size for a baby child a doll whatever size you're looking for all of the measurement for that okay so keep on continuing with the pattern and I will meet you back so now our piece measures 21 inches and I fastened oft and leapt in both ends okay so with your right side facing up we are going to bring together both of our sides here we're just going to fold this side in half and the side in half then they're going and just fold over kind of on top in each other just like that like a little sandwich so now we're going to sew this together through all of these ends here okay so just make sure you get all of them I'm going to sew them this way and just for good measure we're gonna go back down [Music] okay so we made it back down our row and then we're going to just fasten off I'm just gonna leave it in a little more [Music] let's get real good okay and I fasten off then and and I'm just gonna weave in this other end a little bit to fully secure that it's my son's toy in the background if you hear that and there and now the magic happens and we just flip it inside out and there we go we have a beautiful headband lots of texture it looks really good on and it has this really pretty knot in the front that just looks complicated but it's so easy and

you today sis with a new video the video that we're doing today girl i'm really excited about i'm featuring some new half wigs and headbands so this is going to be part three of my headband haul now this video is really special to me because all of the headbands that i'm going to feature in this video came from one of my wig slayer bays that i absolutely love you guys it is from the company the lee made got my whole package of headbands here and glee maid is owned by our girl jess the dragon s however jess has recently changed the name of her social media to jess monique thomas so i will definitely link all of her information for her social media as well as her company glee made in the description box below and the nice thing is just makes all of these headbands you guys by hand but i have one two three four five six seven eight headbands for you today and i have three new half wigs so if you want to see my review on the new glee made headbands and some new half wigs that i picked up then sis you ready let's go [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] so [Music] um so [Music] you [Music] um okay you guys so let's talk about it i absolutely love every last one of these headbands like no joke they are constructed so nicely i got all the ones that were crisscross headbands because i like maneuvering these better i like the width of them since i have thinning edges i like having the wider headbands to be able to cover my edges and i love the elastic strap in the back so at first when i saw that i was like um i'm not going to be able to pull my hair up in the back and yada yada yada but the length of the headband is so long that you still would not have much of an issue pulling your hair up just lay this elastic part around the wig in the back and you're going to be just fine let's see if i didn't try to put let me try to put this one up guys and i'll show you okay so i just threw it up on top of my head and just a sloppy kind of bun but you could definitely wear the hair up um and like i was saying the material goes over nice and far over your ear um the it's very very comfortable same thing with this side and then in the back you just use the elastic strip to cover up the wig in the back where the comb is in the nape so you can definitely get away with that i would also if wearing half wigs i have on my grip cap i would definitely either wear a grip cap or a wig grip i would not you guys recommend using any of the combs in half wigs because they will definitely pull your edges out you heard it from weezy do not use those cones these headbands um are very very soft they're very well made you guys like i mean you can't even see the stitching so i am very happy with each and every one of these guys let's talk about the wigs so i love the alpha woman by sensational gorgeous as a half wig loved love loved it i did review her as a full wig i will leave a link to that review up here but i love her as she's a perfect half wig for headbands and everybody rants and raves about annie so i definitely have to try old girl out and yes i get it i really did like annie she's the perfect straight yaki um headband wig to use for this new trend with both of those wigs i got no shedding no tangling so miss diani you are that was not the case at all sis definitely tangles as you guys saw and all i did was brush her with the paddle brush and she is definitely going to be a tank she's the kind of synthetic wig that's not going to last long but she's going to be cute while you got her on okay guys so yeah this is miss deyani and as you can tell i mean i can't even run my fingers throughout through her without getting snags so she's fine if you don't comb her right out of the pack but once you put a comb in her she kind of get in her feelings and then she starts wanting to tangle up but if you don't comb through her she looks very wiggy those curls in the beginning right out of the box she looks very very wiggy so i would recommend combing her but just know that she's going to be a tangler if i had to buy these all over again i would definitely buy annie again i would definitely buy alpha woman again but i don't think that i would purchase this particular wig okay i also did want to mention you guys with the headbands the headpan material on these it feels like they're cotton um which i actually do like because they lay very very flat as you can see but i just want you to know that they do feel like they're cotton and they're not like the spandex kind of stretchy material and the patterns on them are just beautiful so yeah thank you so much jess thanks for getting all of my headbands made so quickly i don't know how you do all you do you are a superwoman and i love you to dad so alright guys that pretty much is going to do it for this review let me know in the comments what you think about these headbands which one's your favorite and what about the wig so let's kiki

remember what i always say sis to show somebody a little piece of heaven today this is weezy the sexy grandma 2k and i'll see you guys on the next video [Music] you", "XHYaqjdtnbo": "[Music] so today I'm gonna show you guys how to make your own crochet headband it definitely took me a little while I just have to say before I do anything or show you guys anything that it takes practice I mean I didn't really understand crocheting until like maybe the fourth time that I tried doing it and then I was like oh you know this is actually kind of cool and then I started making things like this and these are kind of really awesome to wear if you do wear your hair up because they will definitely keep your ears warm but it still looks really cute they make really great gifts for Christmas as well so I thought that this would be a good time to show you guys how to make one also before I show you guys anything um the same technique and stitch and everything that I use to make these headbands can also be used to make scarves so I actually say this like by myself it's the exact same technique but instead of making it just this wide I just kept going with the original chain and then I built off of that and then I just made this really cool infinity scarf so if you guys would like to know how to crochet and how to make your own headband then just keep watching to make one of these crochet headbands you will obviously need some yarn a crochet hook and scissors and this is the yarn that I'm using I just got it from Michaels I like to use thicker yarn but you can use whatever size you want and for the thicker yarn I use a nine millimeter crochet hook so the first thing you want to do when making these is you want to make a loop and I think this is called a slipknot I'm not totally sure but you basically just wrap it on your finger and pull one side of the yarn through so that you can actually adjust the size of the loop once you have that done you just want to insert the crochet hook through the loop and then you take the side of the yarn that is still attached to the hole yarn bundle and you want to wrap it around the crochet hook and you're basically just hooking the yarn and pulling it through that first little loop that you made and it's super easy basically you want to keep doing this for the width that you want your headband to be because this is going to be the base that we're going to work off of so obviously this is going to make it how wide you want it to be depending on how wide or not why I guess you like it so it's all up to you I do about five and then once you get that width you want to add an extra little chain and you definitely want to keep track of how many chains you did because it's very easy to get lost now you want to basically find the second-to-last chain that you did so that extra chain you don't want to put the crochet hook through it I actually did this in this video because I was not paying attention just pretend that it was the second to last one but basically you want to wrap the yarn around the crochet hook before you do this once and then you will insert the crochet hook through that chain [Music] now this step might be a little confusing but you basically want to hook the yarn and only pull it through that one chain so again that would be the second to last chain only pull the hook through that one chain and then you're gonna loop it again and you're gonna pull it through all three this time so basically you're gonna continue on just like that throughout the whole thing so I'll show you again because it can be kind of confusing so I've just wrapped the yarn around the hook and I'm inserting it through the next chain I'm gonna pull the yarn through that one chain and then again I'm going to wrap it but I'm gonna pull it through all through this time the reason why it is so important to keep track of the number of chains you did in the first place is because it'll make this step a lot easier basically it'll just let you remember how many times you should be doing this stitch so I'm sure this is quite confusing so I'm just gonna go through it one more time you will want to wrap the yarn around the crochet hook and then you will insert the crochet hook through the next chain loop now you just want to hook the yarn and pull it through that chain and then you will have three loops that you'll see on it and then you'll hook the yarn one more time and pull it through all three loops so just continue to do this all the way down to the end of the second row the first two rows are definitely a bit confusing because they are slightly different than the rest of the rows because you're kind of only working off a chain and it does get a little bit confusing but it's not too difficult so when you've reached the end of the row you basically just want to do the exact same thing that you've been doing so just insert the hook through the very last chain and then you'll pull it through just like all the other ones and you'll have three on your crochet hook and then you just pull it through all three so when you reach the very end of your second row you will want to do one more chain so you're not gonna do anything different than your first chain this is just going to be a little loop and then you'll want to flip it around to start your third row you're gonna do it exactly like you did the second row except on the second row you're gonna see that there is a braid looking top to it so you're gonna insert the crochet hook underneath that braid so it should only be going underneath two pieces of yarn [Music] it's gonna be exactly the same they're all going to look like a braid on the top and you basically just want to do the exact same thing you will wrap the yarn around the crochet hook and you'll insert it underneath the next little braid and you're gonna do the exact same thing again wrap it around and just hook the yarn and pull it through that first little chain braid and then you'll have three on your hook again and then you'll just hook the yarn and pull it all the way through all three of them so now I'm going to stop talking and just kind of let you watch how I do it [Music] [Music] this is another part where it's very easy to kind of lose track because you might forget about the little stitch at the end so just make sure that you keep track of how many you're doing and it's definitely there I definitely made this mistake when I first started to crochet and my pieces were turning out kind of wavy and I didn't know why but it's because I didn't notice that there was another little stitch at the end and also don't forget after every row you have to chain one which is basically just making a little loop at the end so in case you don't get it already I'm just gonna go ahead and continue one more row and just kind of let you watch if you do get it already you can just skip to the end and see how to finish it off [Music] [Music] so it took me about 20 minutes to finish the rest of the headband after I wasn't trying to look through the viewfinder to do it it definitely was a bit distracting but this is what it should look like and also this would be a very great time to measure that it will fit your head because it's very easy to make it too small or too big or something so mine was about 20 inches long and also you want you do want to leave like just a tiny bit of space to actually join it together because that can actually use a little bit more room as well so just make sure that it fits snug enough that it'll actually stay on your head so when you're joining these together you're gonna do the exact same steps that you've been doing the whole time except you're gonna go through both sides so you just want to join the two ends together and then do the exact same technique so you just want to wrap it around the hook and then this time you're going to go through both ends so underneath both of the two little braided ends and you're going to just hook it through then you'll have the three loops and then you'll hook it through again and pull it through all three [Music] so when you reach the end you should have this little thing it basically just looks like a little braid that's joining them together you want to cut off the rest of the yarn that was attached to the thing and then just pull it all the way through so that you have this loose end now to make sure that it doesn't unravel I'm going to basically just weave that little tail in and out of the headband close to where I join the two ends together and I'm just going to bring it all the way over to the other tail that I started with so when I get it to the other side I'm just gonna tie a double knot and then trim off the excess and then it's all finished so it definitely took me some practice to get used to this and everything but it's very fun to learn how to do so that is it and I hope you guys liked it it might have been really confusing for you guys I don't know I tried to make it as simple to follow as possible without being super boring and like an hour long so I hope you guys got the gist of it and of course there are tons of videos out there to learn how to crochet and books and everything so if my video is confusing I apologize but I tried to do my best so please give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and you found it helpful because I really really appreciate it and don't forget to subscribe to me if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye", "7I5u-DIQqeY": "hey everyone how are you\nI'm here with Rivka and we're gonna be talking about the absolute most\nessential most important essential tool to head wrapping which is the no-slip\nheadband I remember a time of my life before I discovered a no-slip headband\ndo you remember the time of your life yes tree branches were your enemy wind\nwas your enemy tichels slipping off where your enemy having to use bobby\npins and clips or the subtle hand had like you know I'm having it I'm at a\ndinner party right now excusing yourself to go to the bathroom like pull it\nforward anyway the no-slip headband is a game\nchanger absolutely I would say probably the most essential tool for a beginner\nwrapper someone who's not ready to use the shapers yet should definitely start\nwith one of these I'll talk a little bit about the history of how we stocked and\nsourced our headbands when Wrapunzel first started we said okay\nwe have to have no slip headbands and I looked all over on the market the velvet\nthat we use for our headbands is absolutely most high-quality non-slip\nand velvet the way the no slip headband works is it's velvet and basically the\ngrain of the velvet doesn't it's not like an upward grain it's kind of an\nangled grain and when worn correctly and this is very important you have to wear\nit the right way not the wrong way when one correctly the grain of the velvet\nwill grip against your head and against tichel so therefore the tichel will\nnot slide off which is fantastic but make sure you're wearing it the right\nway because if you're not it will actually slip off just as fast as if you\nweren't wearing it at all so we found the perfect velvet it really lasts long\nand it really grips well and you know can even be revamped by putting it in a\nwash or dryer and I also really was very adamant about offering it in\ndifferent sizes because there's some out there on the market that have\none size fits all but we kind of realized that like not everyone has the\nsame head size right so that's very important that we offer as you can see a\nwhole bunch of different sizes and we're going to talk about all the different\nsizes soon when we first started I think what was it three sizes that we offered\nso long as the right small medium medium large or extra-large yeah and now as you\ncan see ten different sizes technically that is quite a lot more than three so\nand we started with just black oh yeah we were in four colors four different\ncolors we often asked what color should I buy and really I mean if you're gonna\ncover it up with the scarf and the scarf is opaque then it doesn't really matter\nthat much but some people like to match their hair color and some people do find\nthat lighter colors in the summer are better for summer like lights\nguys okey dokey so here's what happened the no-slip headbands are by far the\nbest seller here at Wrapunzel it's like when people say I want to wrap my hair\nand where do I start this is like the most recommended product that we have\nand when people ask other people oh go on Wrapunzel and buy the no-slip headband and\neveryone's like how do I keep my tichel from slipping off how do you make it\nstay and it's like no slip headband so we've been having some talks\nhere at headquarters about how to make already amazing product even better\nbecause we realize that depending on someone's head shape or where they want\nto wear the headband they're showing some hair at the front were wearing further back what they like a snug fit or a looser fit that we really could offer\nmore sizes me more options and we really wanted to inspire you all to actually go\nout there and measure your head and not just assume that because your\ngrandmother's head that you had a big head\nthat's not actually true because depending on someone's hairline or where they wear\na scarf someone thinks they might have a big head might actually have a small\nhead someone that thinks they have a small head might have a bigger head so\nwe really want you to go out there and use one of these measuring tapes to\nmeasure your head so we did away with our previous sizing our previous sizes\nwere small medium large extra-large we wanted\nto change that to use letters and letters for our Velcro option and\nnumbers for our number option because then people won't be making the\nassumption about what they've heard or not heard about the head size so we have\nABCDEF not G just F and two three four five depending on customer requests we\nmight offer some different sizes but we feel like this is as extensive you want\nto talk a little bit about the ladies here at headquarters and some day yeah\nwe put a lot of thought and time into how do you measure your head how do you\nwear your headband based upon the size of your skull or your hairline or where\nyou want to place it there's a lot of different variables that's why we feel\nthe the most accurate way to begin is to take a measuring tape and to measure\nwhere you want to place your headbands so I put in at the beginning of my\nhairline and I wrap this piece around it's going to be a little larger because\nI'm obviously wrapped but if somebody was going to wear theirs back they should\nplace it where they are going to start their headband I happen to have a little\nbit of a lower hairline so that changes the measurement but you just wrap around\nyou find your measurement on here and keep that as your size that unless you\nchange where you wear your headband that should be consistent there is give and\nstretched to our velour which is part of its beauty so that one headband does\naccommodate many different sized heads like a three inch spread typically and\nwe'll go a little bit more into detail about that\nabsolutely yeah so it's one of those things that when we actually really\nstarted researching it here I mean we've always been researching it but we're\nlike okay we need to do the ultimate spreadsheet and the ultimate\nmeasurements and offer and the ultimate everything like wow this is actually\nquite complex because as with convention like the stretcher that had been where\nsomeone wears it on their head how much how snug they have it where they're\nwearing it on the velcro that all really changes what the measurement is so we\nreally wanted to you know give an accurate spread and by the way\neverything that we say in this video is gonna be on spreadsheet offered on a\nwebsite and link to this video so if you don't catch what we're saying in terms\nof the sizing look at the spreadsheet and well it will also have all the\ninformation about the previous sizes that we used to offer so if you're like\noh I used to be a medium/large am I an ABC 3/4 you'll be able to find that as\nwell so I'm gonna I guess I'll do an example of like my own head and how to\nmeasure so best to you know if you have longer hair to pull your hair back if\nyou don't have long hair just leave it down and take a soft measuring tape if\nyou don't have a soft measuring tape take something like a shoelace or a\nribbon and then you can measure it on a flat measuring to make sure that you\nfind out where the zero is some measuring tapes have zero like kind of\nnot exactly at the end so I'm gonna measure it as if I'm covering my hair\nfully like right at the base of the hairline here on my head and if you wear\nyour headbands over your ears do the measurement that way and yeah okay\nso let's do it let's say if I'm wearing it over my do it's just so probably the\nbiggest measurement on my head okay I like it snug but not tight so I'm gonna\nyou know measure it snug but not tight okay no that is very good I'm measuring\nat 22 inches 22 inches so I'm gonna look at this sheet and say okay I'm 22 inches\nthat means that in an adjustable no-slip headband that has a Velcro\nI will likely be a medium slash this\nthat was the old sizing I'm gonna be a a size D or even perhaps a size E\nif I'm wearing it over my ears however what if I don't want to wear it over my\neyes what am I gonna do that let's measure it on my hairline again so\nthat's coming in actually it closer to 21 and a half yes so that's like not\nover my ears so over my ears adds an extra half an inch so with that at 21\nand a half then I would be still published size D I could if I wanted\na snugger fit and go to size C or on the know velcro one I could do either size 3\nor size 4 and that's really that's really gonna depend on what do you want\na snugger fit as I said like you know over time these can stretch a little bit\nnow what if I was going to show a little bit of my hairline let's see so some\npeople assume that when you will you had got farther back that it's gonna be a\nsmaller measurement that's not necessarily the case because some people\nhave a skull that goes up some people have a skull that dips in and though I\nthink mine actually dips in the middle so my measurement is probably gonna be\nsmaller but let's actually see let's see we were really surprised when you\nmeasured everyone's heads here at headquarters I guess I'm gonna do it\nlike yeah okay so here is my measurement and I'm coming out at 20 inches that is\na slightly smaller measurement if I was infinitely yes significantly a whole\ninch smaller and she's definitely significant when you're talking about\nwrapping those are around your head and having the right fit what we found very\ninteresting is the difference in preference we have a range in the office\nbetween 19 and 25 inches oh yeah so we feel like we really represent the\nmajority of heads up they so don't think that you haven't somehow\nbeen captured in our thinking but that everybody had a slightly different\npreference and you might expect that everyone wants it to be kind of snug\nbecause you're worried that it's going to fall off but that's not true some\npeople get headaches some people enjoy a little bit of a looser feeling it again\nif you're wearing it the correct way it still won't slide back even if it's not\nreally hugging your head so we took into consideration and most people will be\nable to wear at least two headbands just depending upon how snug or how fitted\nthey like it exactly do you want to talk a little bit about two options between\nvelco  and a no velcro sure in check what's calling one of them the\nadjustable the one with velcro is going to be called adjustable and the one with\nno velcro is gonna just be called no velco continuing velcro yeah so we\nstarted with the adjustable switch is great because you can change it\ndepending upon where you're wearing it over your ears behind your ears further\nback further to the front of your forehead it gives you that variation\nhowever sometimes if people are using the velcro strip and they end up wanting\nto pull it a little bit further past where they match\nsometimes scarves will snag on this or it irritates somebody's skin or it\ncatches their hair sometimes people have tried to find solutions with bobby pins\nand things to clear as this over but we came up with another idea which was to\neliminate the velcro all together and that way you just have the simple feel\nof the velour all the way around your head it's a slightly wider band just\nslightly so it does offer a little bit extra velvet and most people who get\nthem love them because they just so soft and comfortable you never have to worry\nabout this however I still prefer the adjustable because I do like to be\nable to pull it a little tighter over time all fabric tends to stretch that\nyou're using with a stretch so that's important to keep in mind that it does\nallow you to continue using it and perhaps a little longer I'm just gonna\nshow you how to put this on your head I also like I go got back and forth\nbetween them this one certainly if you are more detail-oriented I think it's a\nlittle more control over how like also if you're trying to tuck it into wispy\nends near your ears this one gives you a lot of control over that so with our\nadjustable head bands you want to have the label on the inside of your left ear\nbut also this is actually very important when you pet develop it backwards\nin the direction that the scarf might slip you want the friction of the velvet\nto be going in that direction like if it feels smooth when you do this then\nyou're wearing it the wrong way you have to flip it around but I'm wearing it\nright way right now so then you put it on like this whatever you want let's say\nI'm gonna wear it in the middle of my head but let's say I want a little like\nyour wispy ends by my ears away and then I'm gonna wear it like right at the\nbeginning and since I've chosen the correct size here then I'm really\nstarting at the beginning of the Belkis I shouldn't have any snagging issues\nwhen I first buy this but over a couple of months when it stretches out then\nI'll probably be able to close it completely against the velcro so that\nfeels really good that's I'm wearing right now this the C\nsize but it's like that's a little snug for me that's like a nice feel for me\nbecause I like it you know kind of somewhat cover snug and if I'm gonna\nwear it let's say the no velcro you know no velcro took me a while for\nus to figure out exactly how to put it on okay I want the velcro to go in this\ndirection on what direction do I put it on you want basically the fold to be\nkind of going down when you put it on your head you just pull it down hole do\nyou mean the seam yeah just no not the seam\nthe serged edge that's Laila's videoing it she's doing an amzing job Andrea has the serged side that's going to be further back pulled on my head and the foldered side\non the bottom okay so I'm gonna pull that back and it's\nso comfy it's a really really comfortable and then you just want to\nmake sure it's going in the right direction yes it is and that feels\nfantastic okay so have we talked about everything to do with everything or is\nanything too else to go on so far I think we've covered all the main points\ncovered most importantly the chart that's created with the old name being\nreferenced the new size will be on the product page for when you buy headbands\nyes we have it all here this is like it's actually gonna be much prettier I\nthink our graphic designers Atara's gonna like put some swirls and colors in it\nand that will be available and as always we are here to answer any of your\nquestions and we really hope that you find the right size and style of no-slip\nheadband because it is a game changer so just to recap yes we want everyone to\nmeasure their head and be as scientific as possible about this because it makes\na big difference as we've seen three different sizes can be worn based upon\nher placement and from there you'll have the recommendations on the product page\nwhen you've measured your head what headband should you be looking at\nand we'll give you a couple of choices you have to decide for yourself\ndo you like things snug loose do you want to have an option for both\ndepending upon the day your mood mm-hmm a headache potentially coming more the\ntype of scarf you're wearing said that's the first place to start the second\nplace will be to go to our product page and then if you have any further\nquestions you can always unless an email is an\nemail yeah okey-dokey thank you all enjoy happy wrapping", "y5AYt3G89rs": "hey everyone it's Sabrina today I have a date your celebrated headbands and I also added some

having a sewing like me glue is the way to go you can create it with tons of different colors tons of different items you can go with bows or beads just like me keep on watching to find out how you can create your own headband so here's what you'll need a pair of scissors of course some beads or maybe a boat depending on what you want to do glue either craft glue or crazy hair ties that match your hair a marker and a ruler and some old shirts which you don't mind cutting you ready well let's begin so as you guys can see I already cut a strand from the gray shirt and I just use the bottom of the shirt you want to do the same thing with the white shirt and again the colors are optional I'm just using gray and white so first start off by marking off an inch like I did with the ruler and then you want to start cutting and what you're gonna do is cut all the way around the t-shirt and keep going at one inch so keep cutting as you guys can see I'm going a little bit past the seam and again just keep that 1 inch it doesn't have to be exact so hopefully you can see that I cut off the entire bottom of the shirt and this is the whole entire strand now our ruler comes into play you want to use it to measure off 20 inches and then cut it off this is about how much you need for it to go around your entire head so there is our 20 inch strand so what I ended up doing was cutting another white strand from this shirt and now I'm just measuring it off with the previous one so I can cut it to 20 inches as well so in all you want to 20 inch strands that are white so remember that gray strand I showed you guys at the beginning of the video well now I'm taking it and measuring it off and this one actually splits in half perfectly so we have 4 strands now two white and two gray okay so we can now take our two hair ties and pull them through each other if you guys didn't get that then maybe you guys can rewatch it pick one side of the four strands and bring it through once out of a hair tie you want to make sure you face them inward so now take your crazy glue and start gluing section-by-section so keep adding the crazy glue on top of each layer until you glued all the four strands down and that's it for one side now we can start braiding this part is kind of tricky I actually had some troubles myself as you guys can probably tell but you're just doing a four strand braid and I'm trying to figure it out but you can just braid just just try to braid as well as you can and bring the strands together and just do this all the way down so as I was getting closer to the end I was getting a little bit better and a lot faster at it can you guess what's next now you have to bring the other four strands over the hair tie and again bring them inwards and begin gluing them strand by strand if you have any extra material now is the time to snip it off both sides are now secured and we can start designing you guys ready to be jewel your headband so I'm just using some beads from an old headbands Adam kind of broke so reusable you guys keys anything you have and you can just place the beads anywhere you want at random and different spots I am placing most of mine at the edges and just all the way through the headband I'm alternating from bigger beads to smaller beads have fun with it be creative and do whatever suits your style and here's what my complete a headband looks like I love the gray and white combination and the beads just slip on your headband and you're ready to go I love it because it's not too tight and it also holds back the hair very well this is it for the do yourself headband I hope you guys like it and you enjoyed creating it with me you guys so much for watching this video let me know what I'm gonna do yourself videos you'd like to see if you enjoyed this video make sure you thumbs it up and let me know see you guys in my upcoming videos bye guys", "JGQG7hWXwPU": "welcome to Littlejohn's Yarn today or to\nbe making this crochet plaid headband if you liked this tutorial make sure you\nsubscribe I come up with two new patterns every week let's hop into this\ntutorial today we're gonna be using a 5 millimeter crochet hook and to create\nthis plant pattern you're gonna need three different colors of yarn we're\ngoing to use a burgundy a red and a black color in worsted weight yarn to\ncomplete this pattern we're gonna start with your black yarn we are going to create a\nfoundation single crochet of 60 I'll show you how to start a foundation\nsingle crochet you'll begin by making a slip knot make sure you work loosely\nchain two one two insert your hook into the second chain from the hook pull up a\nloop then yarn over pull it through one yarn over pull through two you completed\nyour first foundation single crochet for your second one so you can see better\nyour work turn your work up this way you'll be able to see a V on a top of\nyour work it's kind of hard to see with the black yarn but once I start the\nneedle you'll be able to see insert into the V that you see up top yarn over pull\nthrough the V yarn over pull through one yarn over pull through two and we'll\nrepeat turn your work to the top so you'll be able to see the V up top\ninsert your hook into the V you see I have the V on my hook yarn over pull\nthrough the V yarn over pull through one yarn over pull through two when I\ncomplete this I usually have a little chat in my head so I'll let you guys\nhear the chant so this is what I tell myself be one - that's my first stitch slow that's a\ncomplete stitch so I'll go back in and complete the next one be going through\nthe v1 that means go through the first loop - that means go through the last\ntwo loops one more time turn your work V one loop two loops we're going complete\nthis for a total of 60 foundation single crochets actually I want you to stop at\nthe 59th stitch and we'll complete the last one together to create a ring so\nI'll meet you at your completion of 59 oK we've completed 59 stitches so to\nconnect both ends we're going to work into this strange empty space right here\nso let's complete our 60th stitch insert your needle into the V like you usually\nwould turn your work up look for the double V now take your other end in that\nempty space we're going to insert our hook now we're going to finish off our\nfoundation single crochet as we used usually would so yarn over pull through\nthe V or both stitches yarn over pull through one yarn over pull through two\nand now see your work we have our single crochet V's up top we were going to slip\nstitch to join into the very first single crochet so this one Casey the V\nwould be our very first single crochet and now our work is combined we're going\nto chain two one two we're going to double crochet into the same space and\nwe're going to double crochet in each stitch around I'll meet you at the other side of your\ncompletion of double crochets we've made it back around and we're going to slip\nstitch to join into the very first half double crochet chain two one two we're\ngoing to begin front post half double crochets to do that you'll yarn over go\ninto the post of the double crochet not to chain two next to it but the post and\npush that stitch forward and complete your half double crochet and we repeat\nwith the next one yarn over go behind and push this post forward and complete\nyour half double crochet I'll show you how to do a front post half double\ncrochet again we're going behind and pushing the stitch forward yarn over and\ncomplete a half double crochet we're gonna front post half double crochet all\nthe way around and I'll meet you back at the other side we've made it back around\nand we're gonna slip this to join into the very first front post half double\ncrochet it's kind of hard for me to see myself cause the black yarn okay slip\nstitch to join chain two well chain one no chain two\nsorry my mistake and we are going to double crochet into the same space double crochet into the next and we're just gonna work half your\ndouble crochet into the third stitch and we're gonna change colors of the yarn\nhalfway through so we're halfway through your half double crochet and this is\nwhere the plant color chains comes into play we're going to change the colors of\nyour yarn I'm using that um burgundy color okay yarn changed and now we're gonna\nput three more double crochets well double crochet into the next three\nstitches and work your um yarn as you go so this would be one make sure your yarn\nis laying flat because we're going to continue to work with the black yarn in\nyour next few stitches put your second two and your third one and we're gonna\nswitch colors halfway through again three now put your red yarn down and\npick up your black yarn to switch colors and pull it through the two now we're\ngonna place three more double crochets it's actually pretty easy just switching\nback and forth one - and do your third one but halfway\nwe're gonna change colors and this would be our third we're gonna place the black\nyarn down we're gonna work over top you like that again and pick up the red yarn\nchange colors to pull through so let's do three more I'm double crochets one\ntwo and we're gonna do half of our third Lois Hart weaving in your ends at the\nsame time and those are half a third and we're gonna switch it back to black\nagain all right let's put in three more double crochets one - and we'll stop halfway through three\nand once again we'll change colors complete this alternating colors all the\nway around and I'll meet you at the other side okay we have made it back\naround and we are going to slip stitch into the very first double crochet this\ntime we're not going to change colors because we're going to transition into\nthis same color on top of the black I already cut the black yarn previously so\nslip stitch to join chain two one two we're going to double crochet into the\nsame space one whoops that's your first double crochet and place two more double\ncrochets we're gonna have stopped halfway through the last double crochet\nso there's your second one and we're

workers so you may have seen there's been a bit of a buzz around these headbands and it's been because the people who have to wear the face masks for long periods like the nurses and health care workers and that have found that the elastic bands kind of they'll rub behind their ears or on the top of their ears depending on which design they're wearing I've seen a few other really clever solutions using crochet or sewing techniques so I thought I would bring this to the table so it's just a comfortable and stylish alternative and I hope it becomes the thing this is my first ever video tutorial so I'll do my best to make it easy to follow you will need the written pattern for the measurements etc so if you don't have this please send me a request and I'll be happy to share that with you and you can get me on Carrick macrame on Facebook and Instagram or Carrick macrame at gmail.com ok so if you want to find somewhere that you can secure your elastic band somewhere like a rail that's what I'm using or you can either just pin it to a pin board you can do it free style and just do it like on a table or in your lap but it just makes it a bit a bit tricky okay so I've attached four of the four of the cords already and I left one out just so that I can show you how to how you want to put that on okay so here you'll get the loop and you want to pop it over the top of your of the elastic band or through at the middle so it's like this and then with the legs you want to put it through the middle of the loop and just put through so you can see I would look like this and then you put it that's a larks head knot that's how you attach my stomach Rami if you haven't already done it so I'm just kind of going to assume that you haven't done macrame so excuse me if I'm telling you how to suck eggs alright so once they're all on the elastic band you can adjust them accordingly you want to number the cords one through two term and they all be different lengths so you can just adjust it here there will be a couple of centimeters give or take so don't worry if it doesn't seem like it's the right length I included a little bit extra in the measurement and so yeah don't worry if you think it's gonna be too short you'll end up something a bit off alright so let's get started you want to start with Korda number one the one that's furthest on the left so this will be your first working cord and you want to hold it diagonally across your work and what you're going to do now is a double hitch clove so each each cord as you go along will be tied to this twice so a double hitch clove is it's quite a simple not really so you it will look like this and it would be and then you pull it nice and snug to the top and then you do it again so the loop that you make here when you cross over the leg will come back through the loop okay and then you want to do that up to corden umber five so from core to two chord five and then you'll stop and you'll start from other side now this is good okay so just to give you a little tip you just want to adjust it a little bit so that there's the same tension on each chord yes it will help the consistency there you go that one okay and then you're going to do the same from here hold it diagonally and you're going to do double hitch cloves all the way to this side you okay so gonna continue and you're gonna make where you're gonna start from one two three four five six card it's going to be your it's you're working cord you're working colors the one that you tie the knots around say you know double hutch sorry double half clip oh my goodness I can't talk double half clothes hitches well these nuts anyway so you do that to the end there when you're doing this because I'm going to speed the video up in a in a moment once I've gotten to through the button you want to keep stretching the whole workout because if you don't you're going to end up with quite a big headband that's got a lot of give in it so my head is 55 centimeters diameter circumference whatever it is and yeah I stretched mine out quite a lot as I was going along so you just want to hold the top and give it a little little tug and make sure that the crosses are a bit more of this angle than that angle is you're going to use up a lot more cord if it's if you're having to if they're like that whereas if they're a little bit more vertical you're gonna end up not running out of cord at the end as well so that's quite important okay so we're going to start from number one again you hang on I've made a mistake I was getting carried away I was thinking about something else that happens a lot you can you can just untie it so each cord has to go around you're working good you want it to be going around twice if it's gone ma'am more than twice then you know you've also gotten carried away with daydreaming but that's fine you can you can just and until you've just got the two you okay so we're gonna be putting our first button in now so you want these four chords in the middle this these are going to be what's called your filler cords so that would be held in between the square knot cords so with number cord number three and code number eight these are going to be your you're working cords and you want to make your first square knot okay so with a square knot I'm not very good at explaining so it might just be easier to watch the video a few times so you want to make a four with the cords the cord in your left will go in front of the four filler cords but behind your other working cord so you're working cord for the one that's in your right hand you want it to go underneath the first working god and behind the for filler cords and then you want it to come within this loop created before if you like and pull that up through okay so you have a cross on either side of the filler nuts so it looks like this and it holds it nice and snug so you want to pull that up to about there you don't want to pull this really tight you don't want to squish up these four filler cords you want them to stay fairly flat because you're going to do a few of the knots and then we're going to flip it around and these are going to go through that hole so that's what's going to create the button and you want it to keep its eyes so the the mask can hold on to it well okay so these are alternating square knots so you want to do the same that you just did but the other way around it's now a backwards for the same as before the the loop of the four will go in front of the for working chords but behind your this the working chord in your left and the working cording your left hand will then go underneath underneath the four filler chords and through the loop created by your backing chord on your right okay so again you see you have two crosses either side where the material crosses and you have this core kind of leap shape and as you pull it tight not too tight obviously you and I remember to keep it nice and flat you can hold the knot and pull the cord a little just to make sure it's secure so this part here this is what I call the bridge of the square knot so you always want to be pulling the cord through on the other side on the same side of this so I'll show you what I mean so you have the four again like this and the cord wants to come through on the same side that you've just created that little bridge so in case she gets you forget which side you've just done the knot because it's a lot to concentrate on to be fair then that will help you to do that so you want it also another way to remember it is to start out to start the next knot is you want the four loop to be on the opposite side of the bridge that you just made okay so there is your for loop now I've just lied to you it's the same it's the same side the bridge will be the same side as the for loop okay you want to be pulling the cord through the loop on the same side as the bridge okay so you want to do that a few more times so that you have eight of these little bridge fellows there so one two three you okay so once you get here you're going to get this for middle fill Accords and they are now going to be fed around and through that hole I have a little crochet hook that I like to use for this trick so you want to be right in the middle right underneath the X this little hole here and you just want to take all four of the cords and you want them to go through that hole okay okay key so you see now this is the best bit you are going to be creating the button so you can see it's like a nice little nubbin you can push your thumb up underneath here and pull down a little bit just to secure it in and again pull the whole lot tight nice and tight okay now we're going to lock this in because if we don't it's just going to wobble around all over the shop so to lock it in we just do one more square knot okay try and keep these in the same now this not you want to do quite tight so it's it's easier than for the elastic band to go around it and to hold it on hold nice and tight and then the other one the other that something's going up okay now you're going to repeat steps one two three to create more of these crosses so you're going to do steps one two three seven more times okay so you're going to have seven more of these points of cross okay so let's go okay so once we've done the button keep little macrame button we're going to do seven more of steps one through two three okay you okay so it's starting to get a little bit low so I think I'm just gonna twist it around the rail maybe just once for now you've got to think about your posture as well you don't want to be you know working too low because you you get carried I do anyway you get carried away in the knots and you don't realize how bad your posture is so make sure you're comfortable and carry on you okay so after the first button I've done two more rounds of steps 1 3 2 3 so you want to do 5 more I will skip the video forward and I will meet you there and then we'll do the second button together so you want once you've done the button you want 7 more rounds of steps 1 3 2 3 ok ok so your work after you've done the 7 rounds of 1 2 3 after the first button should look like this ok and now we're gonna do the button so let's just wrap it around again so yeah you should have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 crosses after the button and then your other button is going to fit under that one okay so again you want to take the form middle courts and then the court either side of the four and there'll be you're working courts to make your square knot okay so again with the for the working chord on your in your left hand you hold the loop it goes over the working over the filling for the working chord in your left goes in front of the the other working chord but and then behind and underneath all of them and through the hoop there's one square knot and then you're going to do one more square knot but on the other side so this is an alternating square knot if you do this they're not the square not the same [Music] direction like if you were going to do all of your knots looking like a four then you'll get like a nice spiral effect it's really nice but not for the button okay so you wanna have one two three four five six seven eight of these little bridges and then we're gonna pass the filler cords through the hole just under the X and take those two working chords that you just left out from talking in the legs and you're going to make two more alternating squats to lock it in nice and tight with that one okay and then you're gonna do steps one through two three two more times I think yeah two more times you okay so after your last button you should have two more rounds of 1/3 2/3 the Unitas I've got these little knots here this is because this is my practice run I suppose and I ran out of court so the I had to tie a bit more on but don't worry because the measurements that I've given you guys I've made up for this so you will have enough cord you won't have the same problem so taking all these so yes after the two crosses now we're going to do what's called a barrel nut so you want to use all of the cords apart from the two on the outside these these are going to be your filler cords okay so you want to catch get a piece of cord I've got quite a long piece I think 10 or 15 15 centimetres should be more than enough okay so to do this you K keep all of the filler cords in your hat in your palm you put one end of your wrapping cord to about the same length as well that where the X stops you want to put your looping needle or your knitting needle you want to have that yarn needle whatever it's called you want to put that just next to your wrapping cord and you want to have the loop at the top okay so you know hold them all nice and tight you're wrapping cord is going to go just behind the needle and then you're gonna it's quite tricky you've got to hold it all quite tight because you do want to go loose here and then you wrap it around the whole bunch that you have in your hand we didn't want to start that far down start about an inch down from the end of the cord so you can gently work this knot once you've gotten the first loop around it gets a bit easier once the hold in place okay now you want to wrap your the wrapping cord around the filling cords just up until you reach the top of your cord so about here okay so I've gone round one two three four five six seven times now you want to get the other end of your wrapping good pop it through the loop you don't want to pull it all the way you want quite a lot quite a bit of slack here so that when you put it down through your barrel nut doesn't you don't end up running out and punching the whole lot together okay so holding the barrel nut you're going to pull your wrapping cord tight you want to do it kind of bit by bit you don't want to just pull it all up tight okay so you still have a little bit of this and poking out the top which is this piece you want to pull that tight too so okay and then we're just going to poke that bit through the back and then you can just trim the bill ok so yep you should have something that looks like that and then you want to I'm gonna have to just take all of this off because you're going to attach it now to the hairband you're nearly done well done ok so I'm going to keep it on here it's going to be easier to film it so this is the other end of the elastic band make sure I do it like this I don't tie onto the rock okay so move the elastic band just as you can see so you'll have your hairband here your headband sorry and then your hairband here you want the barrel knot to go through through the hole of the elastic band and you want to keep these two working cords over the top so you can secure it all together the square knot or a few square knots ideally however many you can squeeze now this you want these songs to be quite tight but not too tight that it distorts that bit there you can make them a bit tighter on the next ones okay probably get before alternating square knots maybe even just the react chili that'll be enough okay now you can take your your yarn needle and behind so the bit that's gonna be facing the hair you can try and poke it through just one of the cords really should be enough see just when I tuck these away and hide these these strands here and to make it easy you can poke a little bit of or you can wrap a bit of tape around the answer you don't get this fraying sort of fringe getting in your way okay and then put it down to one you have to work at it because it's Thank You Doki all right finishing touches now yeah so you can just snip these two off about yeah and this will free guy I can get it and you can't see so from the end of your barrel nut you want to give it a little bit it's up to you can cut it right out tight if you like but I'd like to leave a little bit because it's just cute okay okay so you have finished your hairband now you can now you can adjust it to so that it fits your head as obviously this is going to be my that's going to be too too big for me but everyone has different size head so now they have the elastic band all tied on there you can't just pull pull the elastic hair band through and adjust it accordingly so you can just cut cut the elastic band here and tie the hair band back together with just a normal reef knot and that will keep it nice and secure and there you have your macrame headband with the little buttons for your mask well done and thanks so much for joining me and glad you liked it and you wanted to to give it a go so yeah mm-hmm thanks very much bye take care and yeah thanks for if you're a worker and NHS I can thanks so much for all of your all

and just whip in the ends and to do that just go through using a tapestry needle go through a couple of stitches like this and to make sure it will not get loose just insert the hook and come back to the opposite side and usually i just wanted to make sure it's very well attached so i go through some a little bit of other stitches for the right and left i just wanted to make sure that this tail right here won't get loose so once you are happy with the results just go ahead and cut the rest of the yarn so this is what you should have and now you can just turn your headband inside out so just turn it inside out and you can adjust the twist right here and it's done beautiful headbands to warm your ears on this winter as i mentioned this is the teenager size and it's around 19. if you liked

okay so the first thing you're going to do is fold your fabric pretty sides together and then just sew along the bottom leaving your sides open [Music] now you're just going to go ahead and turn your fabric [Music] now make sure your seam stays down the middle [Music] now you're going to fold the band make sure your seams stay facing towards the bottom go ahead and tie your knot now go ahead and bring both ends together we're going to go ahead and sew that edge now you're going to move your knot and you're going to cover that seam that you just sewed so your knot's going to be placed right on top of that [Music] keep moving the knot till you completely cover the seam but just make sure you don't tighten your knot too much [Music] this is what you should end up with now you can add a little bit of hot glue to the knot so that it doesn't come undone or tightens too much when you put the headband on and you can also sew parts of it as well if you need to i hope you guys like this quick tutorial and thank you for watching you", "xEHTPerlvWE": "hello everyone and welcome to koi fish gaming this is joy koi and today i'm going to be showing you how to knit this very beautiful twisted no no cable needle uh knitted piece it's really really easy i have been going crazy over it because it is so pretty i've made two in this color and it's really really fast and simple so uh yeah i really enjoyed making it and i think you guys will too it's a really really simple pattern and i designed it myself and uh it's in the one by one rib stitch which is just made up of knits and pearls so yeah it's really really easy and you guys could get the hang of it and it's a beginner level project which means the absolute beginner would be able to knit this all they need to know is just the simple knit and purl stitch so it's really really easy so now let's get to what materials you're going to need okay well i am using wool ease roving stripes yarn it is a really wonderful yarn by lion brand yarns i really love it it's a size 6 super bulky it's really really thick um but it is roving so you have to be a little more gentle with it when you're working with it and also you need a 17 usi 17 13 millimeter needle it's 80 acrylic and 20 wool and it is a 3.5 ounce or 100 100 gram uh ball of yarn now the reason i like this is because the guide shows you um how many balls of yarn you need for a scarf or a hat but it doesn't show you headbands so that's the only flaw but yeah we're gonna get started on this i really really love this project and i think you guys will too so let's get started so here are the things you're going to need so you're going to need some scissors and i prefer sharp ones mine are kind of dull but those are the only ones i can find a tapestry needle or you could call it a darn or a yarn needle mine has a really nice big eye which is really good for this type of yarn but since it's so thick you might just want to weave in the stuff with your hands and you're also going to need a measuring tape or a tape measure and um this is the one i'm going to be using and the overall dimensions of this well how long it's going to be flat because it's knitted with straight needles and some yarn uh it's going to be 18 inches but you can make it however shorter or however longer you would like you're also going to be needing some needles i'm using plastic needles today but you can use whatever needles you like mine are a nine millimeter needle uh i'm not exactly sure what that is in us but you can get tons of plastic and metal and wooden needles at michael's for very cheap okay so those are all the materials you'll need for this awesome headband and uh yeah i'm very excited to get knitting because this will be my second one i've knitted and it seems to be everyone's favorite color in this daisy color this is called daisy but for the wool-ease roving stripes i like to use the inner pull like the center pull um of this yarn because i just find it's a little better and i just prefer it compared to the other one because i have cats and my cats will go crazy if i use the outer pull and the yarn is flying everywhere so yeah let's get started all right so we're going to begin by making a slipknot so here i'm going to show you how to and i'm going to be casting on with the what i call short tail cast on method i don't really know the real name so the way i make a slip knot is i wrap the yarn around my finger to make it look like an x then i take the um i take the yarn and i put it through and then it makes a slip knot magic that you can do it whatever way you like as i said i'm going to be doing the short tail cast on method not sure the real name but you'll if you know how to do certain cast-on methods you can do whatever you'd like but i find this cast-on method that i do here the best one for this project okay so the way i do it is i put it up through my thumb and i am not going to be really showing you and breaking it down today but this is how i'm going to do it four and i'm going to be casting on 10 stitches you can cast on i recommend between 10 and 16 stitches but depending on what type of yarn if it's size 6 size 5 or size 4 worsted weight super bulky or bulky it depends on how many stitches you want or if you want it a little thinner on your ears like not covering your ears all the way or if you want it just um really really thick against your ears that's completely it so you decide it's really what is your preference okay so we're gonna begin and as i said i'm gonna be doing the one by one rib stitch which is a very very simple stitch it's made of only knits and pearls the first stitch is a knit so i knit english style you might knit continental but that's okay so there's knit and yarn from the back to the front purl front to the back pull some yarn there knit purl knit and um the one by one rib stitch um the first stitch is always going to be a knit and then the last stitch is always going to be a purl if you have casted on an even number of stitches otherwise you're going to get the still pretty but not as what we're going for seed stitch okay okay knits the second last stitch will always be a knit stitch and purl that's our last stitch now those casted on stitches might be a little tight but that's the whole pattern you're just going to keep repeating the knit purl knit purl knit purl for the whole entire project and it's really really simple um so you can just keep doing that uh throughout the whole entire product um you can do whatever stitch you'd like if you'd like to do stockinette i just prefer the one by one rib stitch because it's just so basic and so easy and simple for me and it makes a really nice clean stretchy finish i'm going to be working this stitch until it measures about 18 inches and i'm going to be measuring it along the way just so i know how much i how far i need to keep going [Music] okay so i have knitted almost all of the um all of the rows i've needed to i'm almost there i know that this is the last color change that i need to do um i wanted to mention that the reason i chose wool-ease roving stripes for a yarn that i use is because it's really nice and thick it's really nice and warm and i really really like it so here i am and the colors are really really pretty really nice varieties okay so now i'm just casting off by knitting knitting two stitches and then pulling the bottom one over the top and it's really really really simple there's lots of videos you can watch to know how to do that okay so i'm gonna clip my yarn clip meaning cutting it um pull it through and there we go all right so our final measurements are 18 inches so now is the interesting part where we make that really magical twist in the middle so you thread your yarn through the um through the needle um and as you can see it's a little rough on the inside but that's why you only show the beautiful uh outside to that twist okay so we're gonna fold it here all right here we got it and that's where our heads gonna be but this these two ends that we have here is where the magic the twist will happen now as i said you don't need a cable needle for this so it's really interesting to see how this works so you're gonna you're gonna take one of the ends and you're gonna make it almost look like a mouth i like to think of it looking like a little mouth to an animal or maybe a crocodile and then on the other side you're gonna do the exact same thing and you're gonna put one of these sides on the other side um and the inside and then the other on the outside and honestly just making like this zigzag almost thing between the different yellows or whatever color yours is all right so now i'm going to grab my needle and this is where we're going to actually do the sewing so this is this might not come too naturally i found it kind of did for me but it depends on the amount of experience you have knitting these kind of things so you're going to put them all tightly together and i like to make sure that all the ends are poking and really like a sandwich all squished together and i'm gonna take it through uh make sure that all four of those uh parts are all um sewed through are weaved through i don't know whatever you'd like to call it then we pull it through all right there we go we have our first one all right so now um now we're going to i'm just making this a little more secure because you don't i don't really like to see holes um near my twist um so it's completely a preference all right so now um i'm just pulling that up a little uh so we're gonna do the exact same thing we're gonna put our needle through all four of those parts um like that all right there we go and we're almost done and you know when to stop it's completely your choice when to stop just make sure that you have them all securely weaved through or sewn through to make sure that you don't have those holes unless you prefer that but i don't find anyone really does okay keep weaving that through okay all right there we go and i like to just do an extra few sews through uh my stitches because i like it to be a little extra secure because i never like seeing things coming undone or anything like that so yeah it's a little a little bit of everyone's preference i just like it to be secure because i do uh have a bit of my own little business and i don't like to give things away that will just instantly fall apart all right so there's a sandwich and we're almost done so uh this is where the magic happens okay we're gonna twist it and there you go so if you pull it on the opposite side you'll see that beautiful twist on the inside it's not very pretty um but the twist is what really makes the headband i find and the smaller the yarn the more stitch definition you can see in the one by one rib stitch um but you know i like to just keep looking at the twist and then i end up i'm just weaving it a little more to see where those holes are that i want to sew through and make more secure um and overall this project takes me about 30 40 minutes and it's really quick and it's almost instant gratification and it's always like an ooh ooh-la-la kind of thing so yes it's always a fan favorite there it is i just love um doing the seaming and then looking at it and seeing that twist for the first time it's like magic it's like getting ice cream on a really hot summer summer day it's like it's like that for me um but yeah now if you are a crocheter i will let you know that you definitely can crochet this um with the slip crochet stitch i'm not exactly sure double slip crochet stitch i'm not i'm really not sure because i am not a crocheter um but you can definitely do this in that almost one by one rib stitch knit pattern that crochets do um this usually is crocheted but i wanted to put my own spin on it and make it knitted um because i am a knitter not a crocheter but interested in crochet that's for sure now i'm just gonna tie some knots i like to tie two or three and they look like really big really big knots uh once you do like the one or two or three uh but no it really isn't um and it won't make uh make it hurt on your head or anything like that um you can sew through um that little spot where we make our twist a little looser if you like i like to do it a little tight because i don't like to have my things loose like i said um but it's completely up to you if you're giving it to someone or just for yourself if you find that the weaved in spot is a little too rough on your head or a little too bulky that's completely fine you can do whatever you'd like and it really does depend on the yarn and how tight you knit your stitches um [Music] all right last few little knots there and uh we'll be done so this is a awesome project to sell at markets or on etsy stores or at your own little business um or just keep for yourself or give to a friend it certainly is a lovely project and i always enjoy knitting it i've only knit two i'm sure i'm gonna knit more in the future because i just love it and how fast it is it's almost as exciting for me as hats i am obsessed with knitting hats um but there you have it um this is in the color daisy with the wool-ease rubbing stripes i barely have any yarn left but it's really really really awesome to work with this yarn and create this and i hope you guys had just as awesome as an other experience as i did so i hope you guys enjoyed and thank you so so much for watching this is koi fish gaming signing off bye", "wGO12LUQlIk": "okay I got a new set up I'm up to me a few seconds to figure this out okay I think we're there um today we're gonna talk about headbands and I'm so excited about it I love headbands I love hair accessories in general of all things girly but you don't understand my love for headbands has like it's been around for a very long time I know headbands are kind of a thing right now again which I am thrilled about I've always thought there were things when people like Oh headbands for an InStyle now they're back guys they've always been in style for me and whether that's a good thing or not I've been wearing them for forever and I thought it would be fun to not only do a little headband haul cuz I ordered some fun things from Amazon I want to try on for you guys a couple of them I've tried on previously but I ordered one set that I haven't tried on yet and it's a little wacky so I'm kind of curious to see what its gonna be like I didn't have time to do it before I found in those videos so we're gonna get real live reactions from like on camera for that but I did want to show you before we get started because I think this kind of proves my point of my obsession with headbands my original headband cookie jar or a jar of headbands cookie jar full of headbands this is what I'm trying to say I've had this since I think middle school maybe even high school and it just holds my greatest treasures look at that fall headbands some of these are just they're just so good and I was like weighing in a headband you know before Blair Waldorf made it a thing and then I just feel like I went in over the D like into the deep end so I thought I would show you before we get started on the haul just a few of my favorites from over the years because they're just too fun not to share so this one is probably the original I think this is the most Blair headband Blair Waldorf headband I own I got this one at Nordstrom and I wore this for most of 2007 truthfully I think I wore it to like every single party in college that year I definitely wore it to New Year's Eve I vividly remember the outfit I wore that night but I remember getting this and thinking like this is I've hit I've hit the peak of my life with this headband another fun one was this one from j.crew which I'm considering bringing back this year really like this one got this one at j.crew and I think it was still in college and I got it and it's just a good one it makes my head hurt a little bit so I don't often wear it but it's just very like prep-school and fun also I'm gonna get my I'm getting my hair down on Wednesday so just pretend like that's highlighted um but it's very prep school and like just cute and fun that I showed you the oldies let's get to like some of the new fun ones that I recently ordered from Amazon ok so the first one is this one I actually got this in a gift bag believe it or not and I found it on both H&M and on Amazon and on Amazon you get in a pack of like I think 6 for under $20 which is crazy but I really like this mauve color it's really pretty it's actually extremely comfortable I can wear this for hours upon hours which is awesome unlike a lot of headbands that I own it took a little pause to change my lipstick so that matched the headband because I felt like it was looking a little off but I really like this headband it is so comfortable to wear I actually like wearing it with my hair not parted so hair pushed back and then kind of pushing the headband back and pushing it forward a little bit and I just think it looks nice it's like a nice little like pick-me-up to any outfit I think it'd be really cute with a chambray shirt jeans white t-shirt pretty much anything it comes in a ton of colors and it's just so easy to wear I'm back with a new color lipstick on that I matched is this next headband because those things are important to me do not ask but they are so the next set of headbands are these really cute I think they're adorable there are Gucci inspired headbands there are pack of 4 for $14 so my best friend Betsy was over here last week and she was like hey have you not seen the cute headbands on Amazon and it's like well no what are they and so she sent me a link while we were sitting at the table and I bought them on the spot and they came in and I was like wow you're right there SuperDuper cute I love the little bead detail I think they're gonna be great for the holiday season they come in tons of different colors I love the Navy and red um you could wear it you could go old school Blair Waldorf's style and wear it like that which is kind of fun again $14 for four that's great okay so this next set of headbands I'm like kind of concerned about because they seemed a little aggressive I've been on Pinterest and I saw like these padded headbands and I thought yes that is a trend that I can get behind and I ordered these headbands from Amazon it's three four I think less than $10 I don't know but they're so pretty but when they came in the Velvets beautiful but when they came in I'm like is that aggressive I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure that I can pull this off let me show you though the vibe let me show you like with so that you don't think I'm crazy okay so look at these videos Fabio's people on Pinterest looking so good with a padded headband I mean come on right can we do this with our lives I don't know although she looks amazing look at that so let's just try it and see I don't know though guys cuz I mean this is a little much and I think this is kind of like I mean they look fabulous but I think that's about this because my headband is so so here we go let's just try it let's just say this is the headband okay first thoughts it's a lot it's kind of a lot but it's kind of fun it's definitely it's a look that's for sure I think from this side it's kind of pretty like maybe if you did I can updo it could be like a whole thing maybe for the holidays I don't know in the front it's kind of crazy though right let me like consult Pinterest but wait she's doing a middle part let's try it let's try a middle part let's see if that looks better again I got to get my hair done so I'm not sure anything's gonna look better but we can try here we go okay yeah I can see like if my hair was done this could be better I don't know guys it might not be me I might not be the padded headband girl although you know what people change that could be if you are confident enough to wear this thing I want to see you in the headband but I think I'm gonna try to figure it out because it feels too good to be true right I think so so anyways that's all I had for you today I thought it'd be fun to go through some of my old headbands some of the new ones of course everything will be linked over on today's blog post to make sure you hop on over and check that out the link will be in my profile there if you have any questions though feel free to leave them in the comments I'm here for you and please tell me that if you guys figure out how to wear these padded headbands I want to know do I need to like get more volume in my hair um I'm gonna work on it though cuz I feel like we can come up with like a really good really cool look for holidays with this um stay tuned", "kvpUjZkc8pg": "hi welcome to the untidy artist today we'll be making a really simple ribbon headband that requires no sewing for so many beautiful options for ribbon and trim the only difficult part of this tutorial is just making one let's grab our supplies fifteen inches of your favorite ribbon scissors six and a half inches of stretch braided elastic this is 3/8 of an inch wide a ruler some grosgrain ribbon matches and my trusty glue gun set on low go ahead and measure your ribbon to 15 inches and then grab your elastic one tip with the elastic is to make sure the elastic is a smaller width than the width of your ribbon so I've got my six and a half inches of elastic there in your ribbon upside down and we're going to add glue to the very edge so I put a big dab of glue right in the middle of the edge there and then a little dab one on each side one in the corners there and then over it lap your elastic by half inch and fold each edge into a V so it wraps around the elastic and then you're just gonna do it to the other side so weaving of the ribbon upside down take the elastic and you'll need to flip the elastic around because it's going to need to slide over your head so make sure that the elastic isn't twisted and do the same thing to the other side and now we just need to finish it off take your girl grain ribbon and to get the proper measurement I wrap my ribbon around the edge of the headband over the elastic in the ribbon one time and overlap it and this gives me the length that I need to wrap around so measure two of those one for each side and then still off the edges with a match so that it doesn't fray and once you have that step done the final step is to attach it to your head so flip the headband upside down put a dab of glue right in the middle press down pour ribbon and you're gonna move quickly on this part put a little dab on the front side of it and then another dab on the back making sure that you get the edge of the ribbon press it down gently making sure it's nice and secure these are so fun and easy to make that I ended up making quite a few to match different outfits for myself and my daughter's the stretch elastic makes these headbands really comfortable to wear and where there's no sewing involved in this tutorial you can make them very

quick review [Music] [Music] you", "O0CIxuoUOg8": "hey guys thanks for tuning in again what's up what's up i'm here with a wig review hip and wig review from you nice from amazon so if you want details then stay tuned what's up you guys thanks so much for tuning in again i wanted to come to you guys and show you this beautiful water wave slash curly unit headband unit from you nice hair on amazon let's jump right into it as you can see the typical headband wig has the three combs but this one doesn't have a comb in the back which was really a little strange but it's okay it does have the velcro velcro straps just like all the other ones and this is a very high quality unit i really like this one the hair is beautiful so i just flick my hair back in a simple ponytail and just proceed on to throw this thing on very very simple i know you guys have seen ton of headband wig reviews but i wanted to show you this curly one because i hadn't showed you this curly one yet before i did a loose wave one but not a curly one so went ahead and put it on the headband was really really easy to put on the one thing i ran into like i said before it doesn't have a comb at the nape at the back so it did ride up a little bit so after this video i actually ended up sewing on a comb in the back just to make it more secure i definitely do recommend adding a braid at the base of your neck just to keep your hair from ripping out from the comb in the back so i did have to put a bobby pin here to at least just hold it down for this video i'm going to go ahead and do my baby here with some got to be gel this is what really really makes these headband wigs pop of course you don't have to do it but yes i am using my toothbrush i know you've done it don't talk about me i couldn't find my baby hair brush so now that my edges are done let's go ahead and put on one of these headbands i did get these from amazon so i just want to show you guys this curl pattern is so pretty it's definitely more curly than water wave but i'll get into that later i did go ahead and brush this wig out in my loose way video a lot of you guys were like hey you know what does it look like brushed out i want to see how big it can get i wanted to see how big this wig can get and let me tell you this hair is buttery soft it was so soft no tangles no shedding it got huge too like i was feeling like diana ross my earring kept falling out like diana ross vibes big beautiful curls so soft and i was not expecting it to get this big but it was really really nice i loved the softness of this of this hair i know the gray one doesn't totally match but it's okay so that's it like literally if you wanted to walk out like this and just put it in a high ponytail with it big like this it would have been perfectly fine because it is so cute and realistic looking i love this hair so this is just a mix mixture of oil water and a little bit of mousse so i just wanted to get the wet and wavy side of this hair as well so it's very versatile you could wear it big and bushy or wet and curly either way these curls really really popped it was really beautiful so i did want to put a little palmer's coconut oil cream um just to add a little bit more moisture moisture to the hair um i wouldn't put anything heavy on this hair maybe a little mousse and maybe a little bit of moisturizer but that's about it it doesn't need much and these water wave curls are just so gorgeous and easy to achieve like look at that it was so beautiful and so super soft you know i keep it 100 with you guys i would not recommend a unit that i would not wear and pay for myself this one is definitely a gorgeous wig i wish i could have gotten it in a longer length but 18 inch plastic was the only one offered to me but it is okay this one is really really beautiful and worth it so of course i got to show you guys how versatile it is and i know you've seen it before but i just wanted to show you guys this one because i hadn't did a curly one before so like i said the only downfall was the picture on amazon was so much looser i was expecting a much more looser pattern but this one is like curly but if you look at the reviews of this wig some were curly some were looser so i don't know um i just want to make sure that if you order this you know what you're getting make sure you select the right wig water wave versus curly i definitely would recommend this curly one though the water wave one the curls may not be so popping so i definitely like this curly one i love the half up half down styles and this one can definitely be put up in a high ponytail as well without it looking too short but of course i didn't put this in like super super secure because there was no comb in the back at the time so excuse how puffy it looks um but i definitely will fix that my earring i didn't even realize my earring was off but gotta put it back on but yeah how big it looks in the back is because it's not really secure and i couldn't pull it up tight like i wanted to but it's okay thanks so much for watching you guys and definitely stay tuned for more videos bye you", "N1KNq27iGW8": "hey what's up

today I'm going to teach you how to make this diamond of woven pattern with the grosgrain ribbon a hippie but first before we get into video if you are not subscribed to my channel go ahead and subscribe also make sure you have your bail notification turned on so you get notified every time I upload a video if you'd like to check me out on our social media that is also linked below in the description and let's get into it so guys this is actually the video that I was recording last week I did not come out as it should have and I just said forget it and didn't upload the video at all so what I mean here is four pieces of ribbon cut at 24 inches long I'm going to go ahead and take the lighter and secure at the ends of the ribbon just just helps it not to fray you don't have to use different colors if you don't want you can use ribbon of the same color and still get the same effect for the hip in okay so now that we have that part taken care of we are going to connect the ribbon so for this particular project the way we're doing it you're going to connect opposite colors together and I'm just using my glue gun so this is one piece now go ahead and do the same thing but the other piece okay so now that we have that term we're going to take out ribbon and we're going to crisscross it just kind of like so just kind of cross into an egg's okay so now we have that part done so this is what your image should look like right now so now we're going to take our headband and you're going to so this is the outer side of the hip in this is the inner side you're going to hot glue the ribbon to the inner side of the headband just like that okay so see this we are about to start the process and if you're you if you're not using the same colors as me that's okay I'm going to be referring to mine as yellow and blue because those are the colors I'm using so you have right now two of the same colors on the left and two of the same colors on the right I am starting off with my top right and then I'm going to be starting on my top left but you'll see as we go along I'm going to walk you all the way through it so you're going to start by taking your top right and crossing it over to the left then you're going to take your top left and cross it over to the right so right now you get to the same colors on each side then we're going to bring this yellow one around the back and to the left so you can see how we have that so right now you got three colors on one side two colors on the other so now we're gonna bring our blue over and now all the colors on this side we're going to take our yellow and bring it over and then we're going to take this blue through the blue and through the yellow that's over on the left side and now we have our first weave and the pattern is the same on the back so let me show you that again so right now you should have opposite colors on both sides so what I like to do let's see if I can find it I like to put and then clip to hold my ribbon as I'm going down okay so I just have this little clip here and I'm just going to set it there to hold this in place while I'm going down I want to make sure you pull very tightly with your red okay so what we're gonna do now is take our blue bring it over we're gonna flip this yellow also on the other side so now you have them all all the colors on the left side we're gonna bring the top yellow over here through the two blues so now you have one color on this side three on this side we're going to take this top blue put it through the yellow and blue ribbon and now we're back to opposite colors on each side and as you can see I didn't pull it tight enough here so it's a little bulgy so I'm gonna try to pull the yellow just to tighten it up and you see now it's tightened so let's go ahead all the way through and do this process [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I hope you've got the hang of it now I'm gonna go ahead and finish this off and then I'll show you how to finish the edge off and then it'll be all done so we're down to the last little bits of this I'm just gonna go ahead down with you with the rest of this it's so hard doing the sideways guys so sorry for all the movement but it's just a little difficult trying to show you guys how to do this sideways it's kind of like what they call the fishtail braid when you make it similar process sorry about that my yellow didn't want to come over so I'd say about one more round and then we can finish this off so it's pretty that's pretty good for this so we're just going to make sure it's pulled tightly so yeah as I was saying I like to glue the energies together just to help me stabilize while I'm trying to complete this last step so that helps me out and now I could take this off and it won't unravel so you're just going to cut that use I like to cut mine at a diagonal a little bit and I always save scraps I use these for hair ball or something so now you're gonna come around through that and just fold this in and then the same thing with the other side and your own step are all done simple easy fun is actually a stress reliever for being when I do these and I just love the color combination for this one I have made this one and then we also have the one I did last week which video did not go right you can see this is yellow on the outside blue on the inside as this one is blue on the outside and yellow on the inside and then I have these two also that I made and the one that I just showed you so if you have any questions about today's video guys please let me know in

today I'm going to show you how to make these for two different hair bows using the same template and we are going to put these on headbands but before we get started if you are not subscribed to this channel make sure you go ahead and subscribe make sure you also like this video also make sure you're following me on instagram so you can get updates of anything else that is going on in my life or this channel so let's get into it okay so what you're going to need for this project is hot glue gun I'm going to use this exacto knife the extra glue stick just in case I needed I have a piece of soft elastic and I also have some nylon and nylon headband we are going to be using this free template that I found online as well as some white felt and some leather sheet okay so for this we are going to start off with making the template or cutting out the template I'm sorry so what I like to do is place everything down so I can trace and cut okay so now that we have everything traced it's time to start cutting I shortened this just from experience working with it I know that the template piece is rather long and I don't always need it that long so I shortened it just slightly [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so let's start putting this together so I'm gonna prepare a elastic it and I'm just gonna put some hot glue here no I'm looking at the right side of the elastic and I just glued it together you can sell yours if you like so we start with the big piece first and again you could sell this as well I think I glued myself there we go okay and this is the second piece [Applause] okay so this is what it looks like so far and if you would like you can put some hot glue tomato glue this just a little bit to the bigger oh just to give it a little bit more stabilization like that so now what I'm gonna do is take this hip in like so and then our centerpiece here take that around and I would suggest also using an erasable marker or pencil or maybe some chalk I'm just doing this for our tutorial purposes which is why I use the regular pen and so here is our first little bow really cute really simple really easy and you can do this in different colors you can layer it differently you could take a couple of the pieces off you can make this how you want you can add rhinestones other decorations anything you want you can change the color obviously you can use grosgrain instead of felt this can be done in so many ways so let's move on to our next one yes so for this one I am going to use my x-acto knife to cut this out and as you can see I'm not using the second layer to the bow I'm only using one layer and I'm going to use this piece of paper because I don't want the exacto to cut into my table now this I cut from a brand-new pair of regular womens nylons and I just cut it about an inch in and stretched it out and that's how I got the roll like that on the inside if you need a video please let me know and I will show you how to do that or I will put it on my blog be careful when use an exacto it's very sharp make sure your little digits are in the way when you're working with anything too sharp that's enough to cut yourself or anyone else [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so this is simple easy to use now the process is going to go the same you're going to put it together the same way as we deal with the jolt although this is a lot firmer because it's a leather sheet okay and also be careful working with a hot clue because as you well know I think it's very hot okay so now for this one this is pretty much the same you're just going to take what I like to do is take the bulb and put it on the back side and then instead of putting the bow on top of a headband I'll put the headband on top of the bow that makes sense especially with this one because it's so delicate and it's a lot thinner it makes it easier to do it that way so now we're gonna take your centerpiece okay and as you can see how you see how it's so large I don't need all of that okay and there we go simple easy really cute you can make these and another time again if you want to just secure this a little bit more so that's not flapping about put some more hot glue so that is it for today's video guys I hope you liked it I know it was quick I know it was kind of basic but I got a lot of things going on so I didn't want to leave you guys hanging so I figured since I'm already working on new headbands and things like that for my website that I would show you how to do it if you're like me and you like to make things on your own these are greatest gifts you can make so many in so many different ways you can use some many different types of fabrics different styles make it your own guys I love making hip ins

to you and if you are already part of this family big regards to you all right so in today's video we are going to make this beautiful headband pearl headband that i'm wearing we are going to make it and then um yes that is basically it so don't forget to subscribe to the channel like the video and post your comments down below let's get into it [Music] okay so for this tutorial what we will need is a a less band preferably the smaller size you also need your glue i'm using the e6000 i'm using the e6000 you will need your cutter your cutter jewelry wire now this wire comes in different colors though with bronze there is gold very silver so depending on how you want yours to look you use yo i chose the silver because that's how i wanted to you also need your trimming or your ribbon i'm using the satin ribbon in white to do it you also need your pelts now with the spells i have it in various sizes i have a size 14 mm here a size 12 size 10 and then a size 8. because of how i want it to look you can decide to use one size for all like i did in this one but i prefer to use various size because it makes it look nice so yes let's get into it so the first thing you need to do is wrap your um ribbon around your melon um sorry alice band got us if you don't like the color it comes in some alice bands um metallic comes in silver and gold i was trying to get one of those that i couldn't so i got this one so you just have to wrap your ribbon around it so glue your ribbon and then start wrapping it around make sure you cover everything that will mix your that will make your way to look really professional you don't need to actually glue everything you can just glue from the tip and then you're okay to go even when you get to the middle you can glue it and at the end so you can glue it okay so now i'm getting to the end i'll just cut and then go ahead and wrap it glue it you and then cut the excess so this is what we have we'll put it down and then we are going to take our wire and start threading our and tell someone so we'll start with the smaller size i'm taking about eight of them i'll make it so i have the first time on my wire two four six eight and i'll the next size that is the size 10 i'll pick eight of those okay i picked six so i have two full six of those and then i'll pick the size okay eight okay so i've picked eight of the size 10 10 or the size 8 i'll pick 2 of the size 12 and then the 3 size 14 the bigger one and now i will go back now it seems long enough so what is going to happen after i measure it around its around the um colors and the excess will be the size eight so i'll take it off so now i have to go back into the sizes now it's a countdown so two of the size 12. eight of the size 10. and i'll put 10 of the size 8. okay so this is what i have this now this is what i have you can see that it's actually bigger or longer than the alice one so all we do is i'll put my other band in i know this is the middle bead so that should be in the middle and then pull it around it so that i know how many i'm taking so i have this this is the middle piece so i'm having one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 18 14 15 16 17 here you should have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen system another seventeen here and i think that is okay so it means all of this is success that i'm going to take now you will ask what about these ones that is still on the front i'll just pull it back like so and then pull this on let's make sure this this one doesn't get in the way you will need and yeah now we are going to right and wire the tails onto the alignment so you will need longer of the wire available i think this is okay and then the next thing you do is you take the other end and then wrap it around the edge of the other stand about two and three or four times like so and then put the splits on it like that straight ahead i have to take this back a little okay i think this is okay okay and this is it so when i get to the end here i'll just wrap the wire around it like i did for the side like this a few times and when i am done now i am going to wire and wrap the wire around the toes all the way so i will take the wire not on the pill but the space between each two pills then i'll put the wire so because the space there are wires move on the next stays between two girls so that's what i'll be doing making sure that the pill stays right on so make sure you tighten it as you are going now it seems we might be having an excess here um so everything you might be having an excess so now i have to go back and then take one from here and one from here so i'll have a balanced um head crown or headband this thing's a lot of work but you still need it to be perfect so i'll take one off from here and then when i get here to i'll take one from there so we are going to start the whole process again wrap it around the edge a couple of times and then now start wrapping it in between two pills so so so now you'll find that my wire is almost fine that shouldn't be a problem it's let's have nothing shouldn't be a problem i should end it repeated where the last ended and keep it in now so this part that is why i didn't cut it i will now unwrap this and then like i said i'll take one away from it so this time around it is going to start from here so that i'll be able to are all those fats so wrap it around the edge a couple of times and then you start okay so i'm so sorry i didn't realize that the videos don't but i cut it since i'm just covering the small part so i've cut the wire now i'm just going to continue to wrap it around so i get to where the other wire ended and then i'll move a few um pills via a few ones and that is basically it so if i've gotten to the end the last part that i wired i will make sure i put the wire there again the end of the wire again so and then you make use my cutter to make sure that the end of the wire is really tucked in well so that it won't be obvious where you ended and then you won't be pulling your hair or anything like that so it's well tucked in this is it guys this is everything it is so beautiful i am seriously in love with these um headbands pale headbands it's so glamorous yesterday i wore it to a program and everybody wanted some so i'm going to be making more

you how to get this twisted look here for your ear warmers here's another one that I did in a different color I have finished up my ear warmer and now I'm going to fold the right side in so this is the wrong side facing up with your wrong side facing up you're going to take your ends and fold them in half like that and then you're going to put them together like this just kind of interlock them just like that this one in this one here in the middle they're gonna want to slide down so just make sure you pick those up each time before you run your needle and yarn through them so just get them lined up neatly well as neatly as possible there we go one thing that will make this easier is to go ahead and have your yarn threaded through your needle before you get this setup cannot tell you how many times that I've had to redo this because I didn't have this part done now you're just going to weave your needle through these ends here make sure that you pick up all four ends and then just pull that through you don't want it too tight so just give it a little yank there and now come back through this other side here make sure you have all four ends there and then pull through I'll do the same on this side you're just gonna keep repeating this make sure you drop down and get any loops that sunk down there all right three more to go see that one right there is kind of slanted down so I'm just gonna grab that and pull up [Music] all right last one now give it a little tug to make sure it's not too tight and before I finish off here I want to turn it right-side out and make sure it looks okay so turn it right-side out and it looks fine so I'll flip it right I'll flip it wrong side out again [Applause] then I'll just go into the next loop there and not it [Applause] and then just weave in your ends and you're finished when you have yourself a cute twisted headband", "sbTNyO5Bw-8": "all right guys we are back with another one from nia wigs all right my loves let's get into

tell by the title of this video we are going to be doing a boxycharm unboxing I have a few different packages actually I have my boxycharm from this month and then I have a package from Hello headband that I order from I'm wearing this one right now excuse the difference in tone myself Tan wears off on my hands because for my job I have to scrub in too cesarean sections so myself Tan wears off of my hands but not my face I thought this box was smaller than the other one but it's actually not I have my January boxycharm here too just because I I was gonna do an unboxing with that one but I never got around to it honestly so I thought that these were like different in size but they're really not I don't know why I thought this one was smaller when I first got in the mail we have a one two three four five full size products in here first one that catches my eye initially are these luck sea sponges so I'm really liking the packaging of this I think it's super cute with the little compartments and how it shows all three sponges it says lexi complete sponge set baked contour in detail so there are three different sizes whew I'm liking that one so this one has the two flat edges like that and then this one reminds me of a Real Techniques sponge it has the rounded egg part and then the flat part and then we get this cute little one really liking the texture of these I think I'm gonna like these a lot and they didn't come or they her they came at a very convenient time because my sponges are grimy they need to be tossed I really like these I think I'm really excited to use them next up is what is this Kat Von D insanely rich eyeliner in the shade trooper black so this is pretty much just like a cold liner for your waterline you know wow it's very that was just one swipe so I'm super excited to use this I think it'll be super pigmented next up we have Wu from CIT London everyday vacate coconut setting powder so it says apply generously to areas with concealer to bacon set makeup leave on for three to five minutes and sweep off the excess for a crease free soft focus finished lightly dust oil prone skin using a large fluffy brush for a soft touch matte finish so initially I feel like this is just smell good because it says it's coconut give a little bow and it looks like you get a good amount of product so let's open it up so we have a sifter which is nice because we don't want the product going everywhere I use airspun like every day and I really like it but thus if there's no sifter well maybe there isn't you get it I just take it out I don't have a sifter in it right now and it's been getting everywhere my cat just jumped up on the chair oh it does smell good Chandler no it smells very good I'm gonna have to read some reviews that I'm used to using like a pigmented powder because when I was in high school I used to get a lot of flash back and I'm not about that life anymore so next we have the pure four and one can correcting primer energize and rescue with aloe coconut water and probiotics the packaging is super pretty and iridescent so I'm kind of I'm not a big primer girl like for every day but when I work I definitely need a primer because I worked old hour shifts and girl by morning it's a hot mess okay so this is pretty watery I don't know let's we'll wait for it to dry and see how it I'm gonna rub it in and see it doesn't have a smell to it I don't know it feels very watery but it does say silicone free so it's not like the the thick consistency you know it's not sticky or anything so that's that's good but it's really smoothing my hand feels super smooth after putting that on so I think I might like that all the last thing I have here is the QMS medic cosmetic QMS Medi cosmetics intensive eye care day and night cream and let's see so it comes they have a fresh smell to it I mean there's not much I can really say about this because I'm not gonna put on eye cream right now but I'm excited to use it I really like trying out new eye creams and stuff so that boxycharm is done and I'm gonna go into my January boxycharm which I have already opened and played with her is actually quite a few products yeah no there's only one product two products that I've taken out and I've been using them daily wander Beauty trip for two blush and bronzer duo and I really like the blush um but the bronzer is a is a highlighter it's not even a bronzer I I can never see myself using it if I'm going to be quite honest but I really like the blush next thing that I got in this one is the Too Faced diamond light diamond fire highlighter so this is super cute packaging like shout out to Too Faced for this packaging because so it looks like this if you hear that that would be the noon the noon alarm here in my little small town the the tornado siren goes off at noon so if you hear that that's what that is but if you don't hear it I won't even put this in the video but anyways so this says it's your time to shine super cute and then this is the actual highlighter so it looks like this it has a cute little super cute packaging so you push this in and pop it up and it looks like a little diamond box how cute is that so that's what it looks like next I got eight hour radiance for an old sleeping mask so it looks like this so it says apply a thin layer to clean dry skin allow it to absorb into the skin no need to wash off so I'm assuming you just wear this overnight this smells very good what does that rhyme like upscale hotel toiletries that's the next thing I have is this Elemis super food final veggie mask nourishing prebiotic green mask advanced skincare feed the skin with this versatile super green mask formulated with avocado and broccoli seeds oil rich in omega fatty acids to help support the skins moisture barrier vitamin C and passion fruit acids help brighten for a fresh looking complexion that look oh that smells good so I'm really loving the smell it doesn't smell like broccoli so that's a plus um I'm excited to use this I think that's sounds really good veggie mask I mean I'll at least I'll be getting my veggies somehow because I don't need it okay the last thing I have in my January boxycharm is this ace beauty vintage John eyeshadow palette it says the vintage dog palette features 12 colors that are reminiscent of the beautiful sunrises witnessed in very location various locations around the world and is a sister palette to our Scarlett dusk palette each color has been carefully milled and pressed to provide the easiest application in the most excellent color payoff so I think that's a super cool idea sunrises I think that's so pretty so this is what the palette looks like very pretty packaging I love that it has a mirror and I think it's very pretty colors okay so after my initial swatches oh I put these swatches on my hand and I forgot I can't turn this hand like I had surgery when I was little and if you know me you've heard this story seven million and one times but why did I do this myself I can't turn my wrist like that like I can't turn my wrist so we'll try that we'll do that so kind of like I'm just a focus they're pretty chalky honestly I mean the swatch is super uneven there's a lot of fallout on the swatches and the only one that really is like speaking to me is this blue yeah cute idea cute concept I really like the concept of it with all the sunrises and stuff but we'll see how often I actually use that palette last but certainly not least because I'm the probably the most excited about this one is my package from Hello headband if you don't know what that is it's a heavy em store that is based out of Peoria Illinois they can make all of their headbands they have super cute designs yeah it's a small business I really like to support them and I love their headbands I'm wearing this snakeskin one right now from them and I got a big noggin and let me tell you I have the hardest time finding headbands that stay on my dang head and these ones GameChanger let me tell you so I have one of these I have this one and then I have two waffle twist bands so they're like thicker bands that twist up here and I really like those by ordered so I'll show you what it looks like I ordered two more two patterns so they sell out super fast so if you're wanting if you're interested if these cut your eye I would join their Facebook VIP page it's just hello headbands VIP and they let you know like all the restocks I'm not exaggerating when I say these sell out if like within 5 minutes all of them every single one so I every time that I have ordered I was on the page within 30 seconds of the launch because I mean I missed out on these two that I just ordered like once already and so I set my alarm I was on that page and I ordered them because I wanted to get him so bad so with every order they send a little sticker I'll do this one first so as you guys know I work in labor and delivery and so they've been asking for like ideas of new prints and so I threw out the idea of like baby baby footprints I thought that was super cute I actually did get one of the owners attention and they commented and we're like that's such a good idea we'll see what we can do so hopefully that's in the works because that would be super exciting and I know that my co-workers would really enjoy that too but for now I ordered this this band how cute is that oh my gosh I'm obsessed with it so this this one is a little different than the twist bands or the wide band wide twist bands up here because this has like a little knot and this one just what can lay flat and twist in the back if you want but this one I don't know I mean there's really no getting around that so it's like super textured material but I'm gonna go ahead and try this one on okay so super cute I really like it I think it'll be so fun to wear at work with the little hearts and the little EKG patterns so I think I think that's what it's called ekj I haven't got a nursing school yet so don't judge me if I'm wrong but I think that's super cute it's super tight um it was kind of hard to get on but they stretch but like not too much they don't stretch the plant where they fall off but they stretch to where it makes it easier to put them on so I think this one will be super fun to wear to work I think my co-workers will really like it and they I mean they always are like asking me where I get my headbands and stuff so I think they'll really like this one but this is super cute I can't wait to wear that to work okay I'm literally obsessed with this one it's so cute but like I said I'm really digging this pattern right now so like everything that's this pattern I would be like I love it but I'm really digging this I think it's so cute and will be super fun to wear to work just like all of the rest of the ones that I wear I think that finding this brand was a little bit detrimental to my bank account because they're not entirely cheap I mean they're affordable if you're wanting to really spend money on headbands then I mean so be it and it's worth it for you like me I have no problem spending fifteen dollars on a headband twelve dollars on a headband because I wear them to work every single day but for someone who just buys them to put their makeup on to hold their hair back while they put their makeup on I'm not 100 percent sure it's worth it but I name listen game changers like these are the best headbands I have ever had in my life and I'm not sponsored I mean I have like 27 followers so I'm their subscribers so I'm definitely not sponsored so I'm really digging this I'm really really loving these headbands I think that I'm gonna be ordering lots more and yeah you guys should check them out because they're super cute they have all different types of patterns they also have like matching baby had headbands so like if you have a little girl how cute how cute can't wait to be a mom honestly that pretty much wraps everything up thanks for watching I hope you guys enjoyed me unboxing my boxy charm and my headband I see me try them on and stuff if you guys liked

"1cE1Vxsn2zs": "[Music] hey my loves welcome back to the channel so i'm here with another video um if it's your first time coming over to my channel thank you so much my name is dionna marguerite i hope you will love what you see you hit that subscribe button you also hit that bell so you don't miss any of my upcoming uploads you don't want to miss out if you're an og thank you so much for coming back i appreciate you i love you put everything in me okay now this video is sponsored by uh beauty forever this is what the package looked like when i got it in the mail um this is not my first time working with beauty forever i've never had an issue with them so yes ready for it so it is a headband wig as you seen by the thumbnail um when you receive your unit i did get some wig caps i did get some really cute headbands these are kind of summery so i think i'm gonna go ahead and um make sure i have these for next summer but yeah so i'm gonna go ahead and open the wig this is the wig it is brazilian hair 16 inches and here is another headband this one is more fall because it's got like kind of a black back black background so yeah this is what the wig is looking like it has the netting and the stuffing um as far as the construction you have obviously the headband which is pretty stretchy um you get one comb in the middle and one comb in the nape personally i would love a couple combs just on the side just so i feel a little bit more secure to be able to put it up and all of that stuff i know i mentioned that in another video um yeah so this one does not have adjustable straps along with the um headband so i'm hoping that this wig will not have any issues staying put so here is the actual um texture of this unit it is a water wave texture and i love it so the luster seems to be really really nice it is super duper soft i'm not getting any shedding right now at all so yeah i am really loving it so i didn't um as you said i just literally took it out of the box so i'm not i did not wash it i did wash my own hair though just today and i did my baby hairs the way i like them um i know i did get a couple requests to show what the wig looks like without um having the baby hair shown so let me go ahead and show you what that looks like because there are people who suffer from hair loss suffer from all different types of uh reasons why they're they don't have edges so um and then some people just straight up damage their hair over the years so you want to grow your edges back out and this is a perfect wig to do that with um crazy thing is this wig is fitting really nice like really good i'm shocked by that because i was really thinking it wasn't going to fit good because of um and not having adjustable straps but this fits really good this is what the hair is looking like if you don't add any baby hairs or you know you just kind of wear it literally as a headband wig and nothing goes so let me go ahead and put this headband on real quick so you guys can see what that would look like just kind of spread it out so yes this is the headband wig i think it is perfect um even without the edges being shown put her up in a pony and right now even with the um with there not being any um combs on each side i still feel that this wig is fitting really good it's like this wig in a ponytail really good this is gonna be my gym wig once my lazy tail decide to go to the gym this is gonna be the wig that i wear because it looks so natural look at that i'm going to worry about my edges being out nothing so i'm going to go ahead and take this off really quick and then wear it how i like to wear mine and that's just pushed back just a little bit and i just wanted to start out the video with the no edges because i want you guys to know do not be embarrassed about what's happened in the past to your hair what you have allowed your hair to go through some people have bleached their hair whatever the case may be or is some type of medical ailment you don't have edges it's okay get this wig because you can still slay okay so um you can still slay the headband when wig trend and uh flawlessly at that so me personally i just like um and i lost a little bit of my edges going through post part and stuff but um i got i got my diet together and i started to take my biotin so that's why my edges are back to normal but honey it's okay it's okay so yeah let me i just wanted to say that because a lot of people just feel like you know just because everybody's doing it a certain way you have to do it that way too and that's not the case so i'm gonna just take some of my lotta body and i'm just gonna run it through this hair real quick again these curls are so pretty like look at that that's freaking words so i'm just gonna go ahead and put this back on [Music] and do it just like that and honey you can do you a half up half down style real quick let me show you guys that cute little top knot bun whatever this is gorge i love it this is super cute this looks like it could be my hair like no i love it so you guys have to and it's so full too it's so full i'm not really sure of the density of this but it's really full this is a really doable length if you are not a fan of super long hair i'm with you on that and this one you know i don't like long synthetic hair but you know i'm with you if you not fill in the long hair and especially if it's still pretty hot where you are this will um be perfect for you so yeah let me know what you guys think down below of this headband wig from be forever i will leave all of the links down below definitely check it out they're always having sales things of that nature so definitely make sure you are taking advantage of beauty forever okay and yeah let me know what you guys think and i will see you queens in my next video put out into the world what you want to get back and i will see you in my next one [Music] deuces [Music] you", "nW6Y2BlMsTQ": "hey guys thanks for watching we are going to attempt to make a tutorial on how we hook our headbands we sell link headbands solid Chevron's and a lot of people are having trouble hooping them so we use a thick stabilizer it is a cutaway and we literally slip our headband onto the stabilizer just like that there's a seam on the we keep our seam on the bottom well I'm sorry trying to get afraid there's like a thick seam and then we also have the back seam okay so there's the bottom one and then there's one on the back we try to make sure the one on the back is centered and we always keep the thick seam on the bottom so now we have our hoop we literally slip that in through the back just like that that is lined up so that we know it's in the center and here's the fun part so kind of I don't I mean I don't know if it's a trick the more you do it the better you get if you press we're up on the top our brandies holding her right hand if you hold down the headband and then with your index finger you kind of pull it taut and then you press it down on the opposite side that is completely you can see you can see it is very tight but yet you can get a couple fingers in and then we pulled the headband over the screw the tightening fastener or whatever and so it doesn't stitch to itself and put it right in the machine so we'll do it one more time for you to see it and yeah it's pretty pretty self-explanatory a lot of people are like ah the headbands been eaten by my machine and honestly it's just the more you do it the better you get we've used to cut away we've used tear we've used no-show mesh this is just what works best for us we also use the 8 by 8 pre-cut sheets so we take our headband around put the hoop inside and we're going to help hold it on the one side put our index finger to pull it taut which also helps line it up in the center and then we just push down that is that is all we do so there's our headband and the back of it is like that yeah and kind of the exact same thing except it's instead of it being horizontal its vertical on the single needle so hope that was helpful", "Ih0-f20z4YE": "hi everyone this is Bonnie from really reasonable ribbon and today I am going to do a tutorial on how I made the chevron pattern woven ribbon headbands that I'm showing you here if you watched my other woven ribbon headband tutorial you'll see that it is very similar there's really just only one change in the order when you're weaving the ribbon to change the pattern to Chevron look I think that I've decided I like the half inch headbands for this particular weave the best because it shows off the chevron pattern the best this is a 3/4 inch headband and that one's not too bad either but when you get wide into the 1 inch you kind of lose the chevron look a little bit now that there's anything wrong with it so if you like that look that's great too I just like how the 1/2 inch ones come out a lot better so that's what I'm going to be doing the tutorial with today so what you're going to need is a plastic half inch headband an alligator clip or two just to hold your weaving in place it should go and I'm using grosgrain ribbon 3/8 inch wide you'll need four pieces that are about 30 inches long also I've found that you want a good contrast and your colors to show off the pattern better so make sure that they're not too similar or you'll lose the look this one I even did a black and a hot pink which is really nice too so I've already heat sealed the ends of my ribbon and today I'm using grosgrain but really don't limit yourself to grow green because different kinds of ribbon look really nice for the headband I've done um satin ones and diamond satin ribbon and they're all just beautiful grosgrain seems to be used more often but it doesn't have to be grow green so I'm going to glue make two long pieces that are red and pink so I'm going to why some glue to a red the end of a red piece and attach the pink to it I usually overlap like 3/8 of an inch so it's like a little square there and same thing with the other and to get started we're going to stack these on top of each other in an X pattern and I typically just go with my dark colors on the bottom and lights on the top but either way works what I'm trying to do is to keep whatever color is going to be in the lower left side I want my end on the upward side on the bottom which is what's going to give you a nice finished edge on the inside I don't know if you can see that but you want your pattern to follow through on the back as well as the front and that will do that for you okay so I've got my X light color on the top dark on the bottom and I just need a little bit more glue to attach my headband to the ribbon okay so once again if you watch the other video this is very familiar because that's exactly how we started the other woven headband so the next the first step we're going to do is take the pink from the upper right and bring it across the headband and on top of the red ribbon on the bottom left side and now we're going to take the other pink and fold it over the same way onto the right so now we have two ribbons on each side we're going to take the pink ribbon and we're going to go around the back between the red ribbon and the heads and that's going to lie just below your other group of two then you're going to take your red bring it around the front and now we have full four rhythms on the left side now for the other tutorial if you watched it our next step would be bringing the red up from the back but the change is we're going to take the pink and go around the back between the red and the headbands bring that up to the right side and now we're bringing the red over on top of the pink and that's the beginning of our Chevron and you're just going to keep that same pattern going the whole way the red is going around the back between the headband and the pink ribbon pink is going to come around the front on top of that red so we've got two groups of two on the left the red is going to go around the back between the pink and the headband bring it around pink is coming across the top see our Chevron starting and you can always use these clips as you go if you want that way if you get interrupted you have to put it down start unwinding pink around the back between the red and the headband red comes across the front pink around the back between the red and the headband red comes around and you can see the Chevron right away start and as we go now if you've done it right and you turn it around you're going to see the same pattern on the back as you see on the front and that's what we have so I'm just going to continue with the same pattern until I get to the other side and then I'll pop back on and show you how to finish it off okay so here we are on the other end I was pretty quick right actually in actual time it was about seven minutes it was really too long to show you the whole thing with me weaving it but here we are at the end and I'm doing my last set okay you want your last one to pull the lefty and just a little bit losing control here the good thing about this type of weaving is you have a little room to play you can push it up a little and then do your last round and then you can adjust it back down if you think you're a little too close like I just was okay so I've got my last Crossing braid down flip it up I can push it back so it just covers the edge and I would put a clip there just to hold it so it doesn't come apart now this this one ribbon I'm going to pull back put it out of glue here the whole bit fold it back over so it's in the position you want I usually line the upper and lower ribbons together and let it dry and now we're going to do the same thing on the back pull up the top one and put a dot of glue on there and then back over the top hot glue and I don't really get together - so we're going to make it work okay now you want your ribbons to just cover the end of the plastic and like I said you have a little room to move so you can actually either pull it up or down to a degree just so it's going to cover the end of the headband and when you have it where you want it a little head bit a little glue on the headband and hold it down and then the same thing on the inside pull the ribbon back a little and shoot some and just going it together till it's dry get some of that extra hot glue out of there okay now we're pretty much done we're going to cut the ends off I usually follow the edge of the ribbon and then this one you just got eyeball and you're either going to bring out your fried shack or your lighter and you want I definitely heat seal these ends or they will fry and look at a messy very have finished piece give it a try today you'll master it in no time thanks for stopping by and have a good day", "f3eNZvWoD0k": "[Music] so here are the things that you're going to need for your little headband so you're going to need any kind of worsted weight yarn so this is just the regular like size for yarn I found this bottle fun grey yarn that I had so I think would be really cute you'll need some scissors you'll need some kind of a stitch marker so this could be a paper clip actuals to twerkers you can use anything that you could just hook on to a stitch to remind you like this is where you start it a tapestry needle if you don't have this it's okay you're crocheting your hook will work just fine and your 5 millimeter crochet hook so these aren't the only things you need to make this super cute headband so let's get started just a reminder I did not create this pattern this is not mine I found it online and I thought it would be a fun thing for us to do together so I am by no means claiming credit for this for this also I painted my nails and wouldn't you know that they've already chipped off I tried you guys I tried okay so the pattern which I will link below says to start by chaining 56 so this is for an adult sized headband it does give options for smaller sizes for children so these are like super customizable okay so I started with my Slipknot and now we're going to chain 56 so [Music] hate my ball of yarn is gonna cause me problems just gotta put on the floor I'm at eight nine ten this follow behind you guys eleven twelve thirteen even not in my well fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty did you two three four and I totally lost count that's okay I feel like this should be 56 but I definitely lost count somewhere in there but I'm just gonna go with it it should be fine and I know it looks small when you start but it stretches and once you add your stitches it's gonna get bigger okay so now we have our 56 or however many that you decided to chain now we start now we slip stitch into the first chain so my hook is over here we're gonna take our end we're doing we're gonna take our end so our very first stitch now you want to make sure that your yarn is at twisting or turning or anything like you want to make sure that with the way you connect it is straight so you're gonna bring it around so I have my end and I'm going to slip stitch into the very first stitch now I know we haven't learned slip stitch yet so basically you just pick it up find my working on here we're a hot mess here today okay so a slip stitch is just yarn over and pull through both so it's just a little connection stitch so now we have a connected circle okay pretty easy so this is where your stitch marker is going to come in handy so what I like to do is mark this connection this is a helpful reminder of where your first stitch is so you know like when you've completed one full round so I just hook it on into my first stitch so I just remember where I am okay so that was Row 1 and we're going to move on to Row 2 which is begin working in the rounds we chain one so just chain one we know how to do that chain one and now we have double crochet around so we haven't learned the half double crochet stitch but I'm going to teach you because it's super easy so just like with the double crochet you're going to yarn over first you're going to insert into your first stitch you yarn over and now you see how we have three you're going to yarn over and pull through all three stitches so that's a half double yarn over insert yarn over pull through so now you have three stitches yarn over pull through all three so that's just a really simple half double crochet stitch and that's the only stitch that we're going to need for this entire little headband so you're just gonna keep going through my nice I'm always fighting with your heart you're just gonna go through and did I do there that's right you're just gonna have double crochet in all the stitches around if you counted you should be doing it in 56 stitches so that's something to be mindful of when you're doing it okay so basically you just do this this is super easy pattern really nice beginner project working in the round is sometimes tricky so that's something to get used to but once you get the hang of it it's not too bad you guys should see my camera setup right now I have it set up on like two Bibles and a Bible commentary in front of my face so I am reaching around and crocheting this way but I wanted it to be a little higher so you could see a little bit more but it is a learning experience for me to learn how to crochet around obstacles okay so see I'm at a point now where I'm having issues picking at this stitch I think it was when I was slip stitching or change the Jing I hands I miss you guys so this is kind of slow moving this first round just cuz it's harder to find the stitches but once you get this first round in its gonna be really easy there's my I not I must have used this yarn and pulled it out of a project and that's not okay so I'm just gonna keep going around I think you've got the hang of the half double crochet by now and I will meet you back when I have made my way all the way to this first stitch wait I'm back and I'm a few stitches away from joining up with my stitch marker so we're just gonna keep what are we doing we're double crochet half double crochet we're just gonna continue until we get to our stitch marker here right I'm gonna do right here and now I should be meeting up Oh looks like I've got one more stitch that I can do here is it working in the round is a little tricky but once you get this first row in you're gonna be totally fine I'm gonna go right here and do one more and now I have pretty much met up with this so now we're going to join to the first half double crochet so what this means is we're going to slip stitch into like that first like chain one that we did we're going to go like this hole through again and there we have our first row so now all we're going to do is repeat exactly what we just did so we're going to repeat row two until we have eight rows or more they said you can make it as wide or as narrow as you want it so totally up to you so row two all it was was chain one and now we're just going to half double crochets going to keep half double crocheting all the way around it's easy to see the stitches now because like our row is kind of already established so you're just gonna go all the way around and you're gonna keep going around then you'll join at the at your stitch marker with a slip stitch chain one and keep half double crocheting around so I'm gonna finish this up and I will meet you back when I have my eight rows or like why'd I want it when I have that done I'll meet you back and we will finish it together all right all right we are back I have my eighth rose and I just have a few more stitches to do here and then we get to fasten off here when I finish I have one more stitch to do okay and so how we're fastening off is I just did my last stitch in the row and here is where we would join with the next row so you would join with a slip stitch and that's where I'm going to stop so the pattern says to leave a long tail it's about 12 inches so your tail I'm just gonna leave probably about 12 inches or so the more if you have more it's fine so you're gonna cut it off drop your anyone anyone and now what you do with your yarn that's cut is you're going to wrap it around yarn over pull through and you're gonna pull all the way through so now we have this little knot you're gonna tighten it up and that's how you cinch it together so now we have this super cute little headband i'm so excited about i'm going to take my stitch marker out because i don't need that anymore so now what it says to do is to weave in your first tail so not the long tail that you have with this little tail that you have from when you begin so how you do that is this is your tapestry needle this is where this comes into play so there's really no rhyme or reason on how to weave in your ends but i will show you a technique that i use that seems to work the best so for this particular one I'm just gonna take it and weave through this bottom edge so I like to go in and out of the stitches for a little bit more than an inch an inch 1/2 inch and then I'm gonna pull it through pull it all the way through and now I'm going to take it back so going over the opposite stitches I'm just gonna take it back the same direction that I can no rhyme or reason just getting it in and then pull it through and then you have visible and left but you can go ahead and cut that little end off make sure you don't cut your project and yeah you can hardly see it now we're going to make that super cute little cinch that's in the headband pattern you think so I'm gonna do this right along with you I have not done this yet so this is this is new to me so it says to work with your seam so my seam is right here so I'm gonna go with that so it says to pinch it in half and then you want to fold these edges up so you see how we have like this little sandwich here that's what we're gonna go with oh okay so I should have put my tapestry needle on first hold on a second thread your needle first you could probably do this with the crochet hook I know I mentioned in the beginning that you could do that looking at it now it might be a little difficult but you can try hold up so I have my tapestry needle threaded on that long tail that we left I have one cinch in the middle and then I folded the two ends over and now it says I'm gonna turn it bare with me guys like I said I'm doing this for the first time with you it said it's just to kind of like thread through them so it says to do it close to the surface so that mine is crooked okay I'm gonna fold it again so middle fold 2 little fold pinch together okay I lost my needle and I can't see in here okay so I'm gonna thread through here thread through here and thread through here so I've got three sections on my needle and pull through it says to do this a few times to secure the cinch so I think what I'm going to do is wrap it around and do it again so I'm gonna keep the stitches going in the same direction yeah that looks good just to make sure that that cinch is going to hold I'm gonna do it one more time make sure I've got all the little bits in there there we go it says tie off underneath and weave in tail so I'm not sure what they mean by tie in underneath because I'm not really sure so I'm just going to like go under here maybe I don't know I'm gonna loop through this and I'm going to make a knot and I'm gonna do that one more time so I'm just going through this way looping through my [Music] there we go so now I've got a really good knot in there yeah it works I know it says just a weave in ends so I'm gonna do the same thing where should I go I'm just gonna go in here same thing just kind of weave your way through about an inch inch and a half go back around same direction he came doesn't have to be perfect pull through that frustrated child in there and now we're just gonna cut our end off you can kind of just tuck that little end and no one will see it and there's our cute little cinched a headband look how cute that is I feel like my cinch looks a little different than what it should but that's okay you can play around with that you can make it however you want so there you made a headband and I'm so excited this is such a fun little project I know I completed it in less than an hour so this is a perfect thing to make just pop on your favorite show with one of these up you can give it as gifts you can sell them Gosha is a great moneymaker you can sell these for like 10 bucks people would buy them for sure it's a good way to use up yarn you name it so I'm going to attend to my cranky child and I hope that you had so much fun making these and I can't wait to see yours I'll talk to you guys later happy crochet [Music]", "JQY2LlrtCQ4": "hello and can we get some yeah we have today brilliant hair bags so we can design some nice hair bands for Kimberly's hair yeah we're

things so you can check out the playlist and I'll be adding this to my creative Ville playlist and I just crocheted this is like one of my first full projects there's absolutely gorgeous well actually it's supposed to be a headband but because my hair is so dark it kind of looks funny on my head so actually instead of putting the buttons on the ends of the headband which I can do if I change my mind I put a button here and I'm gonna use it as a powell for like a scarf around my neck sorry I didn't trim off the little end piece there that needs to be trimmed but anyway I got the tutorial from OVW and what I'll do is I'll link the videos no sense of me doing a tutorial she's done a fantastic job I'll link it like up there somewhere so I'll link to her video for the tutorial for this absolutely gorgeous I did mine an organic cotton this is just organic unbleached cotton and it's so so soft and this is actually organic color grown cotton for the little leaves and flower I did leave separately and they're not in a tutorial from OVW but they're pretty simple so anyway it's an absolutely gorgeous headband and it would look nice on somebody probably with blonde hair but it does look a little silly on my head but it looks really really pretty around my neck and it's so cozy and warm so anyway that's my creative Vil vlog as well as my make it Monday and it's how to crochet and if you follow OVW she makes it so so simple to teach you how to make one of these so you can check it out I'll link her video right here and you can visit my blog at colorful canary calm don't forget to

gonna come live at 8:30 it's only like 8:15 there's something so I'm a little early but I'm here I wanted to show you all um make this really cute headband I needed to make a few click products for some Christmas gifts and I even done that Christmas Eve and I am so so so so so brushing it right now so I had to figure out something super quick and super cute to make for some family so that's why I made actually this is my second one I like me to today you know I had a lot of other things going on mom life but um yeah so we're gonna make one of these together and if you're on here say hi tell me where you're coming live from so I can knew who's all here watching and crocheting with me I did put up a materialist earlier so you could crochet along with me if you wanted to if not you can always watch the replay and crochet this cute little headband later but um you should probably know that how to make a few stitches on you should know how to chain half double crochet and you should know where the hidden loop or the third loop of the half double crochet is so that being said this is a very super simple easy headband to make I will show you real quickly how we can make this headband super quick super cute I love it I don't know I'm just like in my house where I go super it's really bright this is um Karen century soft I told you you wouldn't eat that here in simply soft and this I used one and made this one happy out of here so there's a lot like probably get like four headbands on one skein of yarn this color is blue mint it's really pretty I don't even know if I've seen this in this store a lot usually they don't have this color at the stores I go to I ordered this one off Amazon so you will need Caron simply soft or a similar worsted weight yarn and a five and a half millimeter i hook and then we'll get started and like I said if you come live and you are here say hi tell me where you're from tell me what's going on I'd love to chat with you while I sit here and crochet this beautiful headband so what you're gonna do is you're gonna make a slipknot you should know how to make a slipknot now we're gonna chain and we're gonna change so 46 56 58 59 and 60 so we made a chain of 60 now we're gonna um join with a slip stitch to the first chain and we're gonna be careful not to twist it yet or yeah don't twist it just join to the first chain y'all find your first chain put it on the hook make sure your isn't whist it and then join so now you have a beautiful this is the beginning of your headband this is like super simple you guys so now you're gonna chain one and then we're gonna just have to have a crochet and every chain around so we're just gonna have double crochet hi guys if you're here say hi tell me where you from tell me if you are click layers so which you probably are if you're watching this video so I'm gonna just half double crochet and every stitch or every chain around sorry every chain or half double crocheting it until we get all the way around and then the fun wiggins not really it's all fun to me I just love crocheting um I haven't written this pattern down yet that's why I'm just doing this super quick video for you all it shouldn't be like that long at all at all at all this one that probably only takes like a half hour to an hour to make one not bad so you chain sixty and then you join with a slip stitch to form a ring being careful not to twist and then you chain one and a half double crochet in every stitch wrap or every chain around sorry stitch chain stitch so right now we're still just half double crochet and every chain around it was a long day today I am so happy to be sitting here crocheting the kids have the kids have one more day of school I'm done there on winter break know where to help me they will all be home that's gonna be fun y'all don't know I have four kids for oldest just well youngest is old is he ten months old he's ten months and as you can see I just like half double crochet over that Lake beginning chain and I make a really beginning um tail I usually have a really long beginning tail so that it's like I have a lot more to crochet over and then I just think it's more secure if I do it that way I don't know it's just me have a really really really long tail so yeah Santa Claus is coming to town [Music] mm-hmm if you're just coming on now I will tell you what I've already said I said um leave st. we began my chaining 60 and then joining with a slip stitch to form a ring being careful not to twist that beginning chain and then we chain one and we started half double crocheting at every chain around and I am almost to the end of this round but not really you'll see why um this is actually I'm actually playing slower I think it's because I'm on video and video sorry a little nervous I don't know why I'm nervous I don't think anything he's here anyways mm-hmm so we got all the way around as you can see mm-hmm but we are not gonna join like normal we're not gonna join Smee it's a nice it's nice and straight we're not gonna join what we're gonna do is turn it around like this and then begin working on the other side of that beginning chain so we just twist it over once and then we'll begin working over there which is super honest we're just gonna keep going so mid-late went out we're gonna keep going so just keep half double crocheting instead of joining with a slip stitch we're gonna half double crochet on the other side of your beginning chain all the way around so each round instead of having 60 is gonna have you guys dead 120 to complete a whole round I will show you want to take it none of this last 260 which for some reason is taking a little longer than usual but anyways then this hub man super cute guys and you know it's really awesome about this I'm gonna give you a little secret um if you go to my Etsy page you'll see that I have the pattern for my winsome rap it's really cute and it goes around and it's basically the same exact pattern but just on a larger scale it's male thicker using a bigger hook using Caron simply soft use a bigger hook a bit longer stitches longer beginning chain you could get a beautiful wrap and it's actually it's a lot creepier because you do use a bigger hook for that so now we're just half double crocheting around still on the opposite side of our beginning chain and here comes my little boy glass focus on me oh go get Lucas he's in his room mic headline tell you so hard so hard doing anything and be single like it okay you just seen the nice mom version of me that was a nice mom I'm always a nice mom so we're almost to the end of this round which is round one which took forever it felt like but it really did it because let's see I don't know I guess it doesn't tell me how long I've been on here but I don't think it's been a long ten minutes or so okay so as you can see when you get to the other you'll be able to join it looks like it's ready right there but there's one simple twist in it just there's a little twist which is what this will be right here see it's twisted in one spot flat all the way around the back and what's really cool about my pattern right here is that it looks like there's two different stitches but there's one so now we're gonna join we're just gonna join right there and then for this row our around and the rest of the consecutive rows we will be let me draw some mark I'm mark Brock I use this stitch row counter around counter whatever all the time it's making any tiny little buddy right here best friend okay so we joined and now we're gonna go when I get a trim that tail usually I wear glasses you guys I think that's another reason why I'm going slower because they usually wear glasses but the glare is not good the glare is not my friend for my glasses so you will chain one and now what we're gonna do is we're just gonna have to hook crochet in the third loop now you can find your third loop if you're looking at your work looking at it and you see the front loop and the back loop right because we don't know where those are you have the front the front loop the back loop and then the third loop is this loop this bottom loop right here see we're gonna be working in that bottom one that's the third loop they hit a loop of the half double crochet so you chain one and then just half double crochet and the third loop of every stitch around okay see now I am left-handed this should be like easy to see you just go into that third loop and then you'll have that cool little ribbing which is awesome so you have double crochet and the third loop every stitch along which is another 120 if you're wrong 121 crochet and the 30 of each half double crochet round and from here on out the rest of the pattern is the same exact way each round see cuz as we're working we don't have to worry about twisting it again because it'll automatically twists it's like already twisting so you're just gonna keep going and I will keep and I'll keep turning on its own and you'll work 120 half double crochet in that third loop and then once you work those 120 you'll be right back to the beginning and then you can join it start the next round and the next round is exactly the same as this one and we do for this one I did eight rooms I like mine a little bit thicker I think this is a really good size so I did eight rounds to make this oh I think six looked okay to so anywhere from like six to eight rounds is really good I think and if you want to go I guess if you wanted to go a little bit that car you could probably go a little bit like maybe up to 10 at the most I wouldn't go any further but this one like I said is eight rows total so we just crochet away in the back army not the back the third the hidden them I hit the loop below the back loop across Shia yeah I know I said I was gonna be on here at 8:30 which is in two minutes from now but hopefully y'all understand what I did and then I'll be able to finish the video and it'll be available to watch on replay at 8:30 or a little after you 30 absolutely after a 30 so we're just half double crocheting around and every stitch inside that thirdly for the previous round just you we keep going going and like I said I did not write this pattern down so if you want to save this I will get to writing it down I won't get to it I will put it on the blog section a section of my update shop but as you know it's Christmas coming soon and super busy super super busy but um I will get it done as soon as possible and but in the meantime if you want to save this pattern or save how we make this headband then I suggest you either when I post the video I don't know if you can do it no no probably not um you can hit the save video thing you know when I see videos there's like three dots to the right on top of it and you can click that and hit save video and you'll save it for later and you can watch later or you can hit the share button and that'll just post your timeline and then you can rewatch it whenever you want so I will try really hard to get this written down I mean it's not that but I would like to include pictures and the taking the pictures part will be harder for me to get done in time or so it looks like I am almost the end around you almost the end of round two and we were making this beautiful head wrap if you're seriously high let me know where you're coming from let me know if you're a crochet or two [Music] but know why you love crocheting so much I started crocheting when I was I was in high school it feels like I'm still a teen but I'm not eighteen thirty-one and I started crocheting fake freshman year of high school my mom taught me how to make the granny square and like for real I loved it I could not stop crocheting I made everybody granny square blankets and I had to do an art project you could like do whatever you wanted you just had to like do an art project and I was like oh my god I can crochet so I did that I was just like obsessed and like I remember going to study hall and bringing my crochet bag with me and just like sitting there in my study hall crocheting away it was funny oh my god I had I was a trip everyone was like what are you doing grandma think I'm not a grandma anyways now around round three we sorry I just like totally we got to the end of round two sorry sorry sorry sorry put a half double crochet and the third loop the loop of that stitch and then we're just gonna join it with a slip stitch to that one to the first one join with a slip stitch we're going to do the same exact thing for the next rounds three to eight we're just gonna um chain one and a half double crochet and the third loop of each stitch around we're just gonna do that just and you know what you should all this pattern is like super easy it's super easy to make and I love it like I said because it looks like you're using two different stitches because it twists but you're really not using two different stitches you're just using the one over and over and over again and so since the twist you see the back of the stitches on the front of the stitches which i think is super cute also like I said um my winsome wrap pattern on Etsy uses this same exact technique just on a larger scale so if you want to make a big like shrug wrap that leg goes around your shoulders and stuff um you can totally check that out and my patterns are on sale right now I mean they're all 15% off right now but um so there's that but yeah this headband is super cute and I did two to Browns already so so if you are here say hi let me know where you're coming live where your viewing me from if you like crocheting if you crochet why you love crocheting I already told you when I started crocheting I was like in high school I love crocheting because I actually know why I love it I love it because I just love being creative I love the fact that I can take a string of yarn that is 315 yards long and just turn it into something totally awesome I think it's just like one big long strand like just a long strand and you can turn it into anything like literally like you can turn it into a headband you can turn it into us what are you can turn it into anything a mermaid tail fin turn it into a hello you can turn it into you know socks oh that reminds me if y'all love crocheting and you our crochet errs you have got to see my new pattern that I'm working on I made uh posted pictures I don't know there's pictures everywhere hold on I will show you this pattern I have to take good pictures of this so you can all see the quality of these but this pattern is coming out like super soon for y'all hold on these are gorgeous these are just everything pretty and looking but the detail is so pretty and I like them because you can express them up they're beautiful so the pattern for Diaz is gonna be coming out very soon very very very soon okay let's just do a quick recap of how to make this pop in because I have to keep my glasses on so I can cope yes sir um so quick recap of how to make this haven't you begin by chaining 60 and then you join with a slip stitch to your first chain being careful not to twist the beginning chain then you chain one and half double crochet in every stitch around and then once you get all the way around you do not join you will twist it one time just twist it so you can work on the opposite side of your beginning chain so your keep going this is still round one it's not you just keep going work on the opposite side of the beginning chain and then we'll come all the way back around and you will have a total of 120 half double crochet in that first round every round is now gonna have 120 stitches so then you'll join and you'll begin round 2 by chaining 1 and then half double crocheting in the third loop of every stitch around every 120 stitches are wrapped around 3 to 8 rounds 3 to 8 you will do the same exact thing by chaining 1 and then half double crocheting in the third loop of every stitch around oh man join and then you won't end up with this beautiful headband and I hope you enjoyed this live video yeah peace out y'all", "ktIVk6Dwtt0": "hi and welcome to my video tutorial on how to make woven headbands woven headbands our custom created headbands using ribbon and a plastic crafting headband the ribbon colors can be chosen to match outfits or school colors the possibilities are really endless for what you can create with one basic weaving pattern the materials are going to need to start are going to be a plastic rafting headband there are different sizes that you can choose this is a half inch headband this is a 3/4 inch headband and what I'm going to show you is on a one-inch headband these headbands come in either black or white plastic most people use the white plastic but depending on the colors of your headband you may want that black background but the headband really shouldn't show if you've woven a nice tight pattern what you're going to need to start in addition to the headband is about a yard of each ribbon that you're going to use each color of ribbon you are also going to need a few alligator clips these are just going to be used to brace the weave pattern as you go so that it doesn't loosen in any areas you are going to need to take two colors of your ribbon and this is 3/8 of an inch grosgrain ribbon that I'm using and you do what what you do is you take two different colors and you glue them together you can see the back of this headband about a quarter of an inch is glued together using a glue gun and I glued the navy blue and the white together and the light blue and the red together you form an X with two pieces of ribbon and then you glue that to the back of the ends of the headband in this case this headband is going to have the light blue and the white ribbon as the inner diamonds and for example this headband was also created using four different colors the light gray and the black are the inner diamonds and the outside triangles are alternating white and pink this headband is going to have the two colors you place on the left are going to be these inside diamond colors the two colors on the right are going to be the alternating triangles so once you have your ribbons glued to the back of your headband and an X like that you're going to take the top two headband the top two ribbons and fold it down like this now what you should have is on the right you should have a top ribbon and a back ribbon and on the left you should also have a top ribbon and a back ribbon in this case my right ribbons are obviously the red in the light blue and my left side is the white in the Navy now you're going to start your weaving pattern what you need to do to start is to take the top right place it underneath the back ribbon and pull it all the way around to the left you should have gone underneath this back right ribbon which in this case is the red so now you have three ribbons on the left side one on the top two on the back and just one ribbon left on the right you're going to take that right ribbon fold it over the front so all four ribbons are now on the left side you have two ribbons on the back the light blue and the white two ribbons on the front the Navy and the red now you're going to take the back upper ribbon the white ribbon bring it to the front placing it between the two front ribbons so now you have the one ribbon on the right and three on the left take the top front ribbon place it underneath the ribbon on the back in this case is light blue place it underneath that back ribbon and now you're back to that same starting position where you have two ribbons on the right one on the top one on the back two ribbons on the left one on the top one on the back I want to brace it starting about now with alligator clips so that the pattern so the weave doesn't get loose now you keep going the same way bring that top right ribbon around the back to the left take the right ribbon fold it over the front take the top back ribbon place it between the two front ribbons be sure to hold these ribbons tight too while you're doing this so that you get a nice tight weave and you don't have any gaps in between your ribbons and now take this red ribbon oh I just went underneath this white ribbon on the back continue that pattern may take you a little while to get the hang of it and that's okay the first time I made one of these I think it took me about an hour and I had to unwrap it and start over again quite a few times when I made mistakes I try not to pay too close attention to what colors I'm wrapping around what but more getting a feel of that pattern of the left top underneath these two the reason I do that is because once you start creating headbands that you don't want for different colors you may only want two different colors if you're used to paying attention to what color goes under over what it's going to get confusing if you have multiple ribbons that are the same color just get used to the pattern that you're leaving and definitely keep those alligator clips on there to hold that pattern tight do not want gaps otherwise you'll see the headband and it's not a very pretty headband without ribbons wrapped around it and if you do let go and lose that tight grip on the ribbons the alligator clips will stop it from the whole thing unraveling will only unravel to that point where the alligator clip is you can see the nice pattern developing where I have the red and the navy blue outside triangles and the light blue and the white as the middle diamonds and you just continue to wave until the headband is completely covered I'm gonna stop here and pull out a headband that I've already finished so that I can show you how to finish off the end that starting point is nice and tightly glued on there with the hot glue that you use to attach the ribbons now you're going to want to make sure that when you end that it's nice and tight like the beginning is I have this headband that I actually only use two colors you can see that it's striped I used a cute pink skull pattern for one color and then black for the alternating color when you get to the end you're going to want to continue the weave pattern just past the headband end if I peel these back a little you can see that I used the black headband this is one of those times when you're probably going to want to use the dark color for the headband so that if any does show in these spaces it's not going to show a bright white when you've used dark ribbons so you're going to want to continue the pattern just beyond the end of the headband to take an alligator clip and hold the end starting on one side peel back those two finishing ribbons I pulled back the pink first and then the black was underneath put a little bit of hot glue directly on the headband and pull back that black one first since it was under put another dab of hot glue basically just put the pattern back together with the pink on top you're going to have to do the same thing for the other side be careful why you do this so that you don't loosen any of the weave found and pink back this side was finished off just like the other side now you can take the alligator clip off and you're going to want to take a pair of scissors and cut the ends the extra ribbon off don't cut so close that you expose the headband underneath though just maybe like an eighth of an inch away and do the same with the other side now you certainly don't want to leave it like that because these ends will fray if you don't treat them you can use a lighter or I always use my wood-burning tool you definitely have more control using a blood burning tool and you just lately touch it to seal the ends and also to smooth any sharp edges just lightly go around very carefully finish that off and now you have your finished headband depending on the colors that you choose you can achieve a stripe pattern by using two different colors the pattern this pattern is made by using four different colors you just have to choose which ones you want for the inside diamonds and which ones you want for the outside triangles this look was made with using the same color for the inside diamonds white and the light blue and the navy blue for the outside triangles this headband was also made using four different colors this headband was made using only one color of ribbon it's a pink lollipop style ribbon and I made this on a half-inch and this example was made using the same color for the outside triangles and one color are two alternating colors for that inside diamond", "4kl43U1nD2c": "hello again today I'm gonna be showing you how to crochet this headband it's actually a really quick easy project from beginning to end it takes me about 20 minutes to complete and that's exaggerating it's just really quick and easy I love using these for the mornings when I have to wash my face or when I'm putting my makeup on it just keeps my hair away from my face I also love using them if you love taking morning walks or afternoon walks they're just nice and thick and they keep my ears nice and warm and they're just very comfortable also if you're having a bad hair day you throw one of these on and you're good to go so I'm gonna be showing you how to complete this really easy project let's get the tutorial started the tools you'll need for this project is a yarn color of your choice a pair of scissors a crochet hook a thread similar in color to the yarn you've chosen and a needle this is the crochet hook size I'll be using we're going to begin with the flower I'm gonna get my crochet hook cause a little bit of pressure rotate it all the way around and begin a chain of two this one here counts as one and two now I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and I'm going to go into the second stitch there's my crochet hook I'm going to grab the main source of yarn right there bring it in through the loop and there I have my three little loops I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it in through the three little loops so I'm going to be going into the same second stitch ten times exactly the same way I just did I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook go into the second stitch grab that yarn bring it in through the second stitch there's my three loops wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it in through the three loops again gonna do the same thing so I'm going to continue doing this ten times I've just gone in a tenth time you could see they're the perfect little circle to attach these two together I'm not gonna wrap the yarn around my crochet hook I'm gonna go directly into the following stitch grab that yarn bring it in through the loop and directly bring it in through the other side and there I've completed my round circle from here I'm going to be doing a chain of six this one here counts as one two three four five and six from here I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and go into the following stitch grab that yarn and bring it in through that stitch there's my three loops I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it in through my three loops now what I'm going to do from here is again a chain of six this one counts as one two three four five and six again I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it into the following stitch there's my three loops I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it in through the three loops again I start with a single and I'm gonna make a chain of six I'm just going to continue doing this all around I'm done going all the way around and this was the last stitch I had to place my crochet hook in through but I want to join this piece of the flower petal to this one so what I'm going to do is I'm not gonna wrap the yarn around my crochet hook I'm just gonna go directly into this stitch so I can connect it to the next flower petal because they're all connected as you can see through there I'm gonna bring the yarn in through there and I'm going to bring the yarn in through there and I just gonna let me pull the loop that just connects all of them together and this is the back part of our flower this is actually the part the front part of the flower so what I'm going to do to the back area I'm going to get my scissors and I'm going to cut this loop right there a piece of yarn I'm gonna get the loop place my fingers in through there grab that little tail of yarn and bring it in through there and I'm gonna close it off coming in towards the back of the flower so I'm just gonna press right there like that and this is like I said the back of the flower unless you want the other site to be the back then you would close it off to that you would not make the knot to the other side but because I want this to be the front of the flower that's why I want to close it off to the back so what I'm gonna do back here zoom that in a little bit I'm going to place my crochet hook in through a stitch grab that yarn wrap it around my crochet hook and bring it in through there once I've made the little loop I'm going to grab the yarn one more time and bring it in through the little loop and I'm gonna press so that could be nice and tight okay and there we have it what I'm going to do now is I like to do it two times so I'm going to go to the following one do the same exact thing grab that yarn bring it in there's my loop I'm just gonna pull it all the way out and just press again I'm gonna get the scissors and I'm going to cut off this little extra tail like that and to this this is the little tail from where we started what I'm going to do to this one is I'm going to go to the center of the flower and this is the front of the flower and I'm going to grab place my crochet hook in through there and I'm just gonna bring it in through the little loop like that bringing it to the back side and I'm gonna do the same exact thing that I did to the other little tail I'm gonna go in through one of the stitches grab that yarn and bring it in grab the yarn again and bring it in through the new loop I made and I'm just going to press and try not to press so hard with this one because this is the one that'll make your the center of your flower tighter so let me show you I'm gonna press this one and you're gonna notice that the center goes tighter when I press it is hard as I can and the whole center of the flower will be closed off so you have the option of doing that but I want my flower to be a little bit open from the center so I'm gonna go in there and make it a little bit bigger and I'm just using the opposite side of the crochet hook that's about the opening I want for my flower so now that it's like that I'm gonna go in one more time and just do the same exact thing you now I'm going to get my scissors and I'm just gonna clip that part off and there you have the back part of your little flower and there's the front part of your little flower now it's time to begin working on the warm winter headband I'm gonna get my crochet hook and begin the same exact way rotating my crochet hook around and I'm going to begin a chain of 60 now depending on the length or the measurements around your head that's how long you're supposed to make your chain I counted around mines comfortably I measured up to a chain of 60 so depending on whose headband you're working on measure their head around and just do your chain that long so I'm just going to continue doing this 60 times I've completed my chain of 60 here are my two ends you want to make sure before connecting them that your chain is really aligned and straight to each other this way you don't get any twisting later on so I'm gonna get my crochet hook and I'm gonna bring it straight into the first stitch there it is I'm going to grab my main source of yarn and I'm going to wrap it around the crochet hook and I'm gonna bring it in through the two loops and there I've connected my two ends together from here what I'm going to do is I'm gonna make a chain of three so I'm that there's one counts as one two and three I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and go in to the I'm gonna skip this stitch I'm gonna go into the following stitch so I'm placing my crochet hook in through there grabbing the yarn bringing it out and there's my three loops I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it in through the three loops from here I'm going to make a chain of two and I'm gonna start this one's one and two I'm gonna wrap the yarn around my crochet hook I'm gonna come back to my original chain of 60 I'm going to skip the following stitch and I'm going to go into the next one grab that yarn there's my three loops I'm gonna wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it in through the three loops I'm gonna again make chain of two this one counts as one two I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook going back to my original chain of 60 I'm going to skip the following stitch and going to the next one and just do the same thing I'm gonna do the same thing until I get to the other side I've gone all the way around to where my two ends meet what I'm going to do here I ended with a chain of two I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and I'm gonna go directly into the big stitch left behind by the first row so I'm gonna place my crochet hook in through there grab that yarn bring it in there's my three loops I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it in through the three loops and I'm gonna make a chain of two this one counts as one wrap the yarn around my crochet hook bring it in again there's two wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and go into the following stitch and there's my three loops and this just continuing the process ending with a chain of two one two and just continue doing this all around row two I'm beginning row three and I know that I'm beginning Row 3 because I'm passing the short little tip left behind by the first round so what I'm gonna do exactly the same exact thing we've been doing I'm gonna wrap the yarn around my crochet hook go into the stitch big stitch left behind by row two I'm gonna grab the yarn bring it in through that big stitch there's my three loops I'm going to wrap the yarn around my crochet hook and bring it in through the three loops and I'm gonna end again with a chain of two this one counts us one two again wrap the yarn around my crochet hook bring get in through the following stitch and I'm just gonna continue doing this all around this row and I'm just gonna continue doing my head band is gonna be seven roasts long so I'm just gonna continue doing this all along my Stabbin rows I've come all the way around to my seventh row what I'm gonna do on these last ones I'm first gonna end with one single little loop I'm gonna go directly in to this stitch grab that yarn and bring it in through that loop just like that now I'm just gonna pull the loop and cut off the main source of yarn now I'm gonna press my loop making it big so that I could place my fingers in through there I'm gonna grab the little tail and I'm just gonna press it very carefully now I'm gonna flip this to the back and basically I'm gonna do the same thing I did with the flower I'm gonna choose a stitch I'm going to grab the yarn and bring it in through that stitch there's the little loop I've made I'm gonna grab the yarn again and bring it in through that little loop and I'm just gonna press lightly because you don't want to press too much just lightly again I'm gonna go a little bit lower and do the same exact thing choosing a stitch I'm going to grab that yarn bring it in through there there's my little loop I'm gonna grab the yarn and bring it in through the little loop all the way and press it again now what I'm going to do here is a little knot and the way I'm going to do that I'm gonna go in through the stitch I'm going to wrap the yarn and I'm gonna bring it in through there and I'm gonna make a knot now I'm gonna get my scissors and I'm just going to cut off the two little ends I'm gonna come to the bottom side which is this one right here where we have the little tail and I'm basically gonna do the same thing here we have the finished headband here was the last row and here was the first row uke it looks even to the entire little headband and if you twist it to the back that's what it looks like so what you do now is you're going to get your little flower and you're gonna place it exactly where you're gonna want to have it so I'm gonna be sewing mines on there I have a thread similar color to the yarn I chose and I'm just gonna be sewing that all around from the back here's the completed project there you can see the flower let me flip it to the back so you could see where we attached the flower it's not even noticeable and basically these are just very comfortable the stitch is just nice and stretchy and these just mold very nicely around your head I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and try these out be safe and I'll see you next time bye", "xLwgksMVLLw": "hi I'm Leslie Barker I cover health and fitness for the Dallas Morning News and today in my fit to be tried segment I'm talking about headbands headbands that I wear when I run I'm you I used to just wear you know cap or a visor and then just kind of discover these headbands and even though I look look goofy an advisor viola even worse at a headband but anyway I really do like them so I brought three of them that I've been wearing and I'll just kind of kind of kind of rate them so we'll start out first of all and again bear with me and I try and put these things on because i just do not have the headband gift anyway so first is this nike swoosh when it costs like six bucks it makes me look like you know I feel like LeBron James when I wear it but um anyway you know it's you know it's fine it's fine i thought i can get maybe two miles out of it before i start to have to wipe my face i I'm the goofball scale 1 being not a goofball and five being just awful like for when you say a 4 with this one okay and like I said it cost well I say six dollars ok this is the next one this is called a Bondi band and these are really kind of cool they come in tons of I don't know prints and stuff I got this one before I did the half marathon and in December who the dalles half and so let's see kind of put it on like this I don't know why don't I get hippie with this one whatever but but you know it really does keep the sweat off my face and all and i figured when I wear this here the day I ran maybe five miles before I had to wipe my face off goofball factor to maybe a three costs about nine dollars but they're always having sales on those things okay now this one this is under armour and I've kind of recently discovered rediscovered whatever under armour and I really do like this this one is just called the to call the under armour perfect adjustable headband because it has a soul adjustable thing in back which I really didn't think I was going to like but it's fine it has these I don't know these band things that kind of attached to your forehead or something but so you put it on or you put it on better than I put it on of course but um anyway but I love this I just thought that it was just great and get this on straight of course I can't but you know just pretend that it looks like it should not look cool but anyway but I went through my whole run before I needed to wipe my face off and I probably could have gone even further I think I went seven miles before I needed to so it was good and the goofball factor if I get it on right maybe one maybe a one and a half anyway it was 1399 it was on sale and i'll probably get myself another one of these so there you have it headband day I'm Leslie Barker with the Dallas Morning this thanks fine", "DTyjsP6oc-4": "glam up your game with Mueller MRAP it's the fashion-forward look girls are wearing both on and off the field trying to make a Nimrod headband here's how you do it wrap the EM wrap around your forehead to get the right measurement tear it off twist your headband just the way you like it you can do a tight twist or a loose wrap tie the two ends together in a knot with MRAP you're good to go in and out of the game here's another way to make an MRAP headband without tying a knot take your M wrap and wrap it around your thigh two or three times tear it off roll your head bend down your leg slide your head band off your foot now you have a strong pretty headband ready to go", "J6VpMyH86Do": "brain training all by yourself so you can quit pornography for good and reach your full potential i'm dr trish lee let me tell you how you can get in on advanced neuroscience all by yourself without working with me but i must tell you i would love to work with you because many people need support in the journey and i'm going to explain to you at the end of the video how working with me is different than brain training by yourself but i know in today's day and age people need tools to be able to use all by themselves that don't come with a huge investment so i am here for you and i'm going to tell you how to do that okay so i've had a private practice for many years uh in glorious chapel hill north carolina where i help people by offering them very advanced neurofeedback brain training that has computer systems that are very expensive so i can individualize and personalize the care for people as is necessary for their each individual brain now the reason i'm telling you that is because that awesome technology that was only available in my office for a long time has now been taken by the muse company and put into this awesome little headband which i have been using for years now the way that it works is on the inside of the headband hopefully you can see it there's five frontal lobe sensors up here in the pre-frontal cortex there's also two sensors in the ear pieces that will regulate the temporal lobes just above your ears that are very important areas for emotional regulation now we also know from neuroscience that the areas up here in the frontal lobe are very important for attention and working memory so this is the area that is impacted for add and adhd executive function which is planning organization anxiety and addictions tends to reside right there in the middle of the frontal lobe on the right hand side is impulse control and judgment now we know from the science that most people's frontal lobes are the areas of their brain that give them difficulty when it comes to pornography addiction that's the area that is likely keeping you going back for more making it difficult for you to make another decision and pivot and go the other way it's the areas that need calming when your brain is feeling stressed and anxious and it's the areas that need stimulation when your brain is feeling bored and it wants to be excited it is the area that is most impacted by pornography addiction which means you can benefit from this headband at home all by yourself i'm not part of this company this is just a headband that i have been using for years and i know will serve you so the way that you want to use it is you put it on you have to do it under your hair but i'm not going there right now put it on and have the sensors connect to your scalp and you want to start with a five minute session when you're feeling your best this is not habit replacement especially at the beginning what we want to do at the beginning is change your baseline brain performance pattern so if you've been watching pornography for a long time or even if you've just been watching it frequently and consistently and with some level intensity for a little while what happens is your brain is getting used to larger amounts of neurochemical release dopamine in particular just to feel okay and i know it's a discussion for a different day because people say i'm not escaping i just am entertaining myself it is to a certain extent escapism and we know that people go back for more because their brain needs to be calmed soothed and stimulated simultaneously so what that means is your baseline brain performance pattern if mine is here yours is here it needs to be brought down from an active mode into a calm mode that's exactly what this headband does and it will generate a graph of brain performance every session that you do so when you do a five minute session the goal is to take your brain from active to calm then after you're successful at getting your brain calm for five minutes you can increase your sessions to seven minutes to 10 minutes you can go as long as you want but i would recommend only going 15 20 minutes at a time because it can be very difficult to keep your brain common focused using this headband it's like neuro meditation so you're getting into a meditative state but you have to work to stay there that's the difference between the service that i provide and i'll tell you in a second but when you're using this neural meditation headband it is pulling your brain back down into that common focus mode so you won't have to go calm and stimulate it as often and you can pivot and walk away from the habit it can be the difference maker and success in your recovery and your reboot program versus not and i've talked to so many people that say you know what i quit the habit and i haven't watched in a year but my brain's no different it keeps telling me to go back for more i'm able to fight it but it keeps wanting to go back you have to re-wire your brain for it to not want to go back when you stop watching you're just counting on it unwiring when you use this headband you're also rewiring simultaneously it can be really really important that's why you want the headband okay so now let me tell you the difference between what i do in my home brain training and coaching program i use the muse headband but it does not use the muse app it uses a specialized brain shift program app and in my app you can watch youtube videos or you can play games or you can do audio so what happens is it's no longer just sitting in the muse app the way that it works is it's auditory feedback and it's a beach scene and when your brain is very active the beach scene scene sounds like a storm say that three times fast the beach scene sounds like a storm when your brain is active as you calm your brain down and it goes from active to neutral to calm the beach scene changes and now it's lovely little waves it's like you're sitting at the beach and if you really calm your brain down you'll have birds perch on your shoulder and will give you positive feedback but it can be kind of boring to listen to and you lose attention especially if your brain needs to become and stimulated it can be difficult to sit there when you use my specialized home brain training app now you can just watch youtube videos you can watch anything that you like and the videos are designed to entertain your mind so that your brain becomes more neuroplastic we want your brain to be more pliable so that the energy in your brain can be shifted more easily because your your mind's entertained watching something that you like you can even watch me if you want yep yes you can but you can also watch ted talks you can watch movies you can watch funny videos cat videos if you will you can watch anything that entertains your mind so that your brain gets in the zone more easily and when you use the specialized home brain training app i get a ton of information in my online platform so it generates a graph of brain performance over time so i can see every single session and then it lines it up and i share that with you in our home brain training program every 15 days we meet for coaching i show you what your brain is doing and i use the data which is really important we use the data to provide strategies and techniques based upon what your brain is doing on every individual day i'm able to personalize it i'm able to individualize it and we're able to use the information to also shift your behaviors so you know how i talk about this we're going to rewire your brain using state-of-the-art technology in this app and we're going to do that from the top down but then we're also going to use techniques and strategies that are built on neuroscience to change your routines your habits your thought processes to teach you about your emotions so you can release the negative ones and tap into the positive ones and together that is rewiring your brain using your body and your mind as we train your brain from the top down that's a comprehensive approach that is a game changer that's the missing piece that is why do working with me and using home brain training can be the difference maker in your success so get started get started with your home brain training all by yourself with your headband and if you need more support and you're ready to shift your brain it's a four-month program where we work together if you're ready to do that you can go over to my website and it's on uh the porn brain help page that i am here for you can shift your brain into that new better mode and typically we can do it in four months and then i can teach you how to keep it there forever okay so remember control your brain or it will control you", "zn4K8QDDstw": "hey y'all welcome back to my channel today i'm gonna be reviewing another curly hair wig we're just gonna see how these curly hair wig companies be holding up y'all because you know that's a new look just gotta plop on and go so today i'm gonna be working with i wear wig they sent me another they sent me another wig um i've done a couple wigs on this channel for them so they sent me their short curly haired wig i will have the dimensions um the dimension why i keep saying that y'all just specifications the specifications of this hair i will have in the description box down below but we're going to hop right into this we're not going to make this long we didn't do these kind of videos before so we'll do blah blah blah let's just get right into it so i already took the net off because i just want to see how long it was but these are the curls so it is similar to one that i did before but i think these might be like just a little bit looser but you know what i'm thinking maybe we try and make this one a little bit more full so i'm gonna grab a brush in some water and i'm gonna be right back all right y'all so got my spray bottle got my water and got some mousse so we're gonna take this off [Music] and put this wig cap on yo i think i didn't use this wig cap because i thought i had got bleach on it i just want to make sure before i burn off my edges i think it's clear okay so we're gonna put this on slide this yeah pull it up brain cells y'all you can definitely lay your edges with these kind of wigs i just as y'all know just for demonstration purposes we just gonna get right into it so i took a little bit off then we're going to take out swiping and this one has a comb at the top two combs at the side one at the back with the bands and yeah all right so let's see and then you have your standard um velcro i wonder if this one's gonna be even shorter than the first one i did with y'all oh actually y'all this one look a little bit longer this one like kind of sit on my shoulders whereas the other one you know it was like a bob and if y'all see me turn it it's because i have a mirror right here excuse my ashy face y'all you know what grad school is grad school so i don't even need to say no more because you already know what that mean we looking chopped and screwed chop chopped and screw i always be looking chop chop screw okay so this is cute but she's a bit flat so like i said how about we this don't have too bad of a hair smell honestly y'all um how about we fluff her out a bit so i'm not looking crazy why don't we why don't we do that so i'm gonna take some water and just a stop right here now let me get down because what is up with me in these old school like so i'm gonna tell y'all if they're shedding too we don't see so let's wet her a little bit listening play so now i'm going to be using the shea moisture you know what we ain't even going to do free promo no more now i'm going to be using samos but just because i love y'all it's the coconut hibiscus curly mousse but they should really get at me though because you know i'll be using a product sometimes all on my wigs but i just took three pumps and let's just kind of clump these curls back together so it's not as big and i am getting some shedding i want to be honest with y'all i am getting some shedding it doesn't seem excessive though like i have not ignored it i have not washed this hair um and like this is the first time i'm like opening it with y'all so i haven't gotten to like you know get the shed hairs out yet i just don't want it as um i went define curls but i don't want it as flat as it was before if that makes sense which all like that was more like factory um curls which i don't think looked too good it was just very um straight so i like to kind of disrupt them by brushing it out and then reapply some mousse and re-brush it and i find that that tends to separate it enough without making it look like some wet noodles ryan little i just wanted to fill it out so it wasn't so um wet noodly like which as you can see it is not like that anymore and this is super cute this is a little bit of a longer look but i am for sure feeling this like this is super cute y'all like okay this is definitely like everyday school vibes like let's just plot this on and go this is like oh i'm going on a cute date like it's a chill laid back we going mini golf and we're going go cart and we going to the movies like something cute because you can always put the little like headbands um over it like you don't have to wear this one like you can put this on and then that you can put like a different headband over it or like a scarf or whatever like but i feel like this one is super cute super super cute let me give y'all a close look don't judge my little ashy skinny lips stiff nowhere honey stiff wear stiff wear but yeah no i think this is super cute y'all so i hope you like this video let me know down below if you would get a wig like this if you like the shorter one like what kind of looks are y'all going for i honestly i lowkey want

these two really pretty embellished headbands they're so incredibly easy to make and I think they look amazing they're a great way to add some fun and sparkle to your outfits but really quickly before I get started I just wanted to say that if you like this video and want to see more from me please subscribe to my channel that'd be super awesome and I'd be really grateful and yeah without further adieu let's get into the video so for this project you'll need some embellishments some padded headbands and some e6000 glue and an applicator but before we move on I have a couple things I want to mention the first is unless you have some really small embellishments you aren't going to need an applicator and the second is if you're gonna want to buy the smaller tubes of the e6000 glue because I heard the larger one doesn't store well for this first headband I'm just gonna be adding some embellishments to the top you can of course create whatever sort of design you'd like but I do have a couple tips the first tip is if you have any melons with holes in them be careful and putting them on the headband if you push them down too hard the glue is gonna come through the holes and the second and third tip is to glue the embellishments on in three sections and to hang your headband over a pillow while you're waiting for it to dry by doing this you can always make sure the section that is drying is laying flat and here's the completed first headband I think this one looks really designer ask and as a bonus it totally looks like something that Blair Waldorf er we're moving on to headband number two for this one I'll be gluing embellishments on the front I don't think I've ever seen a headband with embellishments on the front like this but I thought it'd be really cool and sort of look like a crown anyway tip number one from before also applies now but tip number two not so much because we're gluing things on the front so everything's going to be laying flat and here's the completed second headband I just love how feminine romantic it is and yeah that's the end of the video I told you guys these are super easy to make anyway I hope you guys liked the video please subscribe if you want to see more from me and I'll see you guys next time thanks for watching and bye [Music]", "LHuYK2-OrV0": "[Music] different textures colors materials hopefully this will give you

lace braided style it's like a matte satin headband daisy chain gold braided double strand pearl and gold daisy chain style double strand gold a plain simple headband last but not least a scarf style and also this style so my first one is going to be this lacey style very pretty bright hot pink red tone lace i've always been a bit awkward with headbands because i get self-conscious of my ears sticking out a bit or you know my forehead or whatever i get a bit self-conscious and so when i see like a headband on someone else i try to wear it that way and it just doesn't feel right to me so here is headband number one a lace textured thin headband this type of style they flatten the top of my hair and i feel like that does not suit me look number two is just a simple headband metal headband with some crystals so this came in a two pack so this is like a rose goldy copper color and it also came with the silver from primark and they were two for three pounds and actually i must have purchased these middle of 2020 so maybe they're still there so this one's nice if you just want a really quick pop of dimension i'm looking smart doesn't sound in as much as the lace one and actually here's a navy one that came with the pink lace so it was a set of two i'm quite sure it was h m or maybe primark but these were from years ago as an elasticated underside and two metallic gold braids are kind of like this and you can expand the second strand bring it back a bit it's quite a boho look and then you could wear a bit more on your forehead ah you get the gist you know what enough of this one i never claimed to be like a stylist or expert so yeah so this one's really cool this is from china i will put a link in the description if it's still there i'm sure it is a black navy and a dark green um i love how it's satiny but matte like a matte satin and i love the braided look so very simple stiff on top so what i like about this one you could just slip it on and you're ready so yeah i'll put the link in the description another plain fabric that you can just kind of slip on just to add a pop of color quickly during a rush just pop it on i'm sure this one as well was from h m or primark next we have this one i believe this one was from h m so this is like a knitted metallic and cream so cream and gold this is the back this is the front the metallic headband i like it so this type they're kind of easy to find in shops i'm not sure where i got this one but it has the teeth so this is good if you want to keep your hair out of your face like if you have curly hair i have really thick hair it would not suit me if i use the teeth to go back that's really messy and come quite in handy if you want to put on a face mask or wash your face please so because it wouldn't suit me taking my hair off of my forehead i wanted to wear it i would just wear it like this but you could probably see the teeth at the top so it would look a bit weird let's see if i can push it in i can't see in this lighting if you can see the teeth but yeah so my next one is a very popular one it has a knot twist in the middle the center this is the underside elastic so i really like these and when i tried wearing it when i purchased this i believe this is h m or primark i want to say yeah i can't remember h m and primark yeah so this was maybe two years ago and i really wanted to look nice with this but i i just couldn't get it right they suit most people they really do i think i'm just not confident with how it looks on me or how i'm wearing it how i'm putting it on um so this flattens the hair a bit too but the knot gives height and you could really turn it anywhere you want so this pushes my hair because it's quite small yeah it doesn't suit me so i would have to wear it a bit differently and then that's too tight that doesn't look right i think it's because it's quite snug on me next one is this one so [Music] this one's probably h m or somewhere like that rather than putting the underside under my hair a bit more boho so i know a lot of then this one this one i believe was for sure h m but a long time ago metallic floral lace style you can bring it down over your forehead a bit so last but definitely not least is the scarf style so this was from primark and so every season i believe they have a couple of scarves you can use them to tie on your handbag to maybe add a pop of color to your outfit or tie your outfit together or you can use them as a headband so i folded it up so here we are not bad i quite like this one because you can adjust how tight it is it doesn't flatten your hair too much so yeah it's quite quite nice i like it and you can get them in all types of colors so there's that i hope you enjoyed this demo of all types of headbands and i hope it's given you an idea of what might suit you i hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions or suggestions please let me know in the comments and thank you for watching", "jiJtA1U_jrw": "hey family how are you so as you can see from the thumbnail today is no other than another here video and as we all know there's only one type and one type only hair i like wearing and that is headband wigs clear ways are the only ways i like to wear because it's easy it's convenient it's simple and those are all the things i love as you know i am a mommy i don't got time to glue cut pluck bleach dot lay slay it i it doesn't fit my lifestyle i genuinely don't have time to do those things so i always wear my headband wigs i wear them under my hats i wear them under my caps however i wear when i'm doing an asd i just wear them because it's just like it give me a a different vibe you know and i vow to try every headband wig for you the length texture style cut and color i told you i'm gonna try each and every one so you can know which one works perfect for you and you don't waste your coins okay so again today this headband wig i really stepped out of the box i'm not gonna lie i don't think this is gonna be the one for me but i'm doing this for y'all not for me i jus it look like i'm greasy and it may look like i'm sweaty but i'm not i just put mad coconut where you want me coconut is good for the melanin see sidetracked it so i'm definitely doing this for y'all not for me i want to try every headband wig every headband wig just so you can know which one you love the best today's hair video is sponsored by you nice hair this is my first time ever doing a collaboration with this company y'all know the companies i rather die for so let's see i don't know don't say this might be you know who knows but like i said i really really stepped out of the box on this one let's get right into what comes in the packaging because i'm all about free free heavy on the free okay i like when they give you free things in the box i love it so let's see what you nice let's see what they came with one two three four five headbands i love when y'all sent me a box of goodies as you all know i i can't get jiggy with this um these chunky headbands it's just not me it looks really nice on something you know what i promised y'all i would try it but i can't how much maybe i'll try it it's just not me but i love when they get these headbands honey i just they come in handy now let's get straight into this unit are y'all i'm nervous and excited i'm like nerve skated like i didn't just say me yo i would never i would never okay so let's try it i'm stepping out of my box just for you let's see so today we have 24 inch 1b j99 unit and they gave us another headband in there get into the unit get into the color girl like i said the same nieces i don't know i'm nervous but it's different it's very different than what i'm used to but we're gonna do it we're gonna try it okay i love love love love love that the roots are black it makes it look more natural honestly this hair is soft af it is hella full baby this is actually full from the roots to the tips look okay giving me life i'm nervous about this color i'm not gonna lie to y'all this is the headband unit and the reason why they call these headband units is because it's literally hair sewn onto a headband no plucking no gluing no dyeing no bleaching nothing it's just a whole unit sewn onto a headband i love when the headbands come with a comb this one has a comb in the front and a comb in the back so it only comes with two combs and of course we have the headband what i am liking already is that this headband looks tight and secured i like this already honestly girl i'm nervous what we got to do now is try to do something with this here also oh my jesus this is trifling honey triflin usually what i do i know a lot of people you love to braid you're just the braider and you love braiding that's not me i do know how to braid but i hate braiding i don't have time to braid and i'm not going to do it period i'm not going to braid it so i'm going to comb this out i'm going to put it in the ponytail i'm going to do my edges and i'm going to call it a day and that's what i'll have on under this week so give me one second and i'll be right back absolutely easy that you can even have your significant other in this case my lovely girlfriend girl so i usually just put my hair in a ponytail and i braid the back i don't know why she taking so long to do this one braid i don't know what you ever get and it's not funny [Music] just a little bit of edges i'm not all dramatic and i ain't got time so like i said this is the unit i don't know why i was just dreading putting on this unit i just editing i just feel like i would look dim but um here goes nothing i'll make sure these little edges is dry you could put a wig cap on if you want i don't but yeah so what i do is oh she is long honey take the front comb and just stick it in right there honestly i'm used to having side combs but this one doesn't have one take the back combs and secure it in um as always i tell you some people like wearing it like that if that's your preference do you boo boo it ain't mine i'm gonna just move this here out of the way so it don't get caught let's see how this thing do straight i'm a flat iron i have to get used to the color maybe once i play around with it a little bit i love a lot about this unit i love how full it is the color is starting to grow on me sis it's starting to give me a little imagine putting some layers in this and did you see who is she can you imagine putting some layers in this and and curling her up okay it's rolling it's going on me it's growing on me it's starting to happen it's starting to pull up in that i feel like i want to go sing some r b i feel like i want to just sing some r b music like that like my man cheated on me and i ain't got a man nobody cheated on me like i want to sit by the window with a cigarette in the coffee like no i'm not gonna cry i'm not gonna cry like it's giving me those vibes let me let me give y'all a look let me give y'all a look honey let me give y'all a look i'm excited it's growing don't be hold on starting to absolutely fall in love with this unit again this unit is from you nice hair all the links to this unit will be directly down in the description box below", "i1Z-NoqhrlI": "hi good evening folks i hope you're all okay and that your week is going well so far um i've had if i can speak properly i've had an influx of stuff i've got lots of packages i'm going to do three um unboxing stroke reveals tonight and that will still leave one two three four that'll still leave an another five uh because if i do them all tonight i'm gonna be here until after midnight and i'm really pooped and need my bed uh so yes give me one minute i've just remembered i've left my scissors in the kitchen so i'll be back in a sec ah right apologies uh there if you were caught a glimpse of the uh the chaos that is my life here at the moment um we're still having a a major mocking stuff out session and trying to throw things away that um that we're either not going to use or we can't sell or are just no good and you know we don't need them anymore right anyway with the scissors in hand this is the first package that i'm going to open uh as you can see it's from hugger gear and basically these are the headbands that i wear most of the time um i wear them as as either pony bands or bands to hold my bun oh just so that is it's out of the way when the work because it's it's just more convenient to have it like that when i'm at work because it's not getting tangled in things if it's fastened up and well out of the way so without further ado uh i've not bought any of these for a a good couple of years uh and since i last bought any they've had quite a few new ones added onto the website understandably it was a couple of years ago i last bought some uh but they do have an offer on most of the time and i think it's it's something like buy one get three free so you get you get four for the price of one basically um i've got um a mystery one as well uh so in this package i've got four multi-use headbands and one that is no that is a winter one uh with the wheat ones you can use them either as hair bands like that or you can use them as a scarf or you can also use these bands as a face cover um but the winter ones are double-sided and this is how they come packaged so oh drought i've already got that one that's oh this is going to be the mystery one right um i can't remember what this pattern is called but it's it's one that i've already got upstairs this is a nice one it's this uh this blue tartany type one uh when when you open them up uh that's what they look like when you when you take them out of the bag these ah yes it's it's stretched that way rather than that way there's there's no give that way but when you do that you can stretch it quite nicely um you get the um the hugger logo the hugger logo on one area at the bottom of the band and you get it on the other side of it as well so it's it's all it's all on the same level uh and you can you can fold them in half you can roll them up and use them in various ways but as i say this this is the mystery one that i got and i do have this one upstairs and it's one of the ones that i originally bought a couple of years ago uh they wash really well you can put them in the the washing machine um with a normal load of clothes so that's that's quite good i'm pretty sure that they didn't used to come in these um ziploc bags as well which is what's really good actually you could you could use these bags for so many things the bag itself not the contents i'm talking about here and if you if you're going away you could put like little toiletries in there as well uh so yeah a reusable packaging and um a multi-purpose headband so that's that's that one this one i wish i wish i could remember which one is which and i haven't got the computer opening open because of the the glare back on my face uh but the ones that i've got here that's the mystery one i've got a school's one i have a long one and a rail and the winter one which is called illusion so i'll show you that one next find somewhere to put those this this is the winter one illusion and as you see when it comes out it feels it is quite a bit thicker partly because it's double-sided uh so yes it looks like that on this side so it's got a nice little optical illusion effect uh you've got the logo there and turn it over it's there as well on the inside it's this really nice really really soft and dusky pink fabric so if i take my specs off i'll show you what i mean about what you can do with it so probably easiest to do that first roll it up you can have it like that if you want uh bring it down use it a bit like a neck gate to keep your neck warm rather than carrying a scarf with you and they're really space effective as well i mean these you can scrunch them up and put them in your pocket and they take up virtually no room at all you can pull it up over your nose and mouth have it as a face covering for for example if you need to use public transport or you need to go into a shop something like that you can one of the things that they show you on the website is you fold it in half so that so that one part of it uh in effect telescopes into the other and then scrunch it up like that and you can have it as a headband like that uh you can do it so that it can get a bit of a twist to it and so it kind of shows you know both um types of fabric that are in it so that's a really really nice one i'm actually quite chuffed with that one um as i say i can't remember which is which on these ones i should have maybe had a quick look before i started with this video the uh winter bands are a little bit more expensive uh they do also do ones that benefit charities as well uh which is quite good to do with they do a lot of different charity ones as well uh i will put a link to their website downstairs and examples of the prices so that if you want to have a look you can do there's this one so that's quite a nice one i didn't really prepare for this video very well did i sorry about that guys i should have written a few things down before uh i started filming it but it's been a a tired day at work and uh yeah i just want to go to bed and go to sleep there's this one and this has got like a sugar skull's design on it as well you can see the logo down there which will be on the bottom right of the screen as you guys looking at it i think uh one of the things that they do as well when when you're when you're on the website they have what's like a little bit like roulette wheel and it um it gives you more office as well which i think that's how i came by the uh the the mystery headband and i've got another one with skulls on here now then this it's it's these two cluster it's that pinky color down that side and black and white at this side but if i turn it over you've got this bluey greeny color now open it out and it it fades from the black and white and pink down to the bluey greeny that's pretty cool in it so yeah as i say um i last bought some of these couple of years ago um they're really nice to have and i mean i've probably got so many now that that i can i can probably do a different one every day for about a fortnight um but i really do like them i really do like them a lot and they're just so convenient to have so i'll put the link to their website downstairs so you can see what's what and if you fancy fancy ordering any you know have have a look have a bit of a rummage around and um you know see what see what you think have a look at all the categories uh this isn't something that's got to be restricted to over eight teens so anybody of any age can have a look um if you're a bit of a younger person watching this and a year um an idea for to point your parents in the direction of for uh christmas presents maybe give them the website address and let them have a look you know if there's some that particularly take your eye you write the names down of them and and let them know that the you know that the multi-use they're not single sex either they're the unisex i mean some of them look a little bit more feminine but but others men women boys girls can wear them you know it's up to you guys but but i think they're great you know they're really worth having and um you know just just have a look if you don't want to get any then you know that's okay as well right so that's it for this video i hope you've enjoyed it um i'm gonna um skedaddle now so i hope you enjoy the rest of your week um and i hope that your coming weekend is good be nice to yourselves and to each other and just go careful out there yeah uh keep your bodies with you weather's a bit changeable make sure you've got something warm maybe a hooker band to uh just keep your neck a little bit warm and maybe pull up over your face if you need to go into a shop uh right folks um i'll see you in the next video i hope you've enjoyed this one see you later bye", "B1DVdwsDL3Y": "this tutorial is for the simple Jersey City facial design place headband a with four

to be all about accessories I have some headbands which is a huge trend right now some hair barrettes some statement earrings and a couple pair of sunglasses that I'm gonna share with you all I will link everything below because as I'm filming I might not remember where I got them from some of this stuff I've had for a while and I hope it's all still in stock so if you're interested and the latest accessory trends keep watching so I'm going to start with headbands and one of the latest trends is padded headbands you're seeing them at Christian Dior and on different runways and it's all the rage right now so the first one that I'm gonna start off with is a pink padded headband that is super cute and I love to wear headbands with my hair parted down the middle just you know parted down the middle and slicked and I usually gel it but today I didn't so I'm just going to put a headband on and show you guys what that looks like let me grab the first one so the first one is this pink padded headband and I love how it just changes your whole look it's a statement piece I love this shade of pink this is a velvety and pad it just means that instead of it being flat it's just more of a raised and you can see on the side from a profile how it's just more of a raised look and I love this one and I have another one in orange and it's basically the exact same head just a different color and I've been wearing this one a lot lately just I'm really into orange right now I love orange makeup Orange everything and so this is the orange one love this one too and I also have the same type but it's not as padded I got this one I know for a fact at our local mega beauty supply store I thought it was cute you know they were trying to do the padded thing but it wasn't as padded as it should be I think this headband might have been a dollar ninety-nine or something but I thought it was a great neutral color and I wear this one when I just you know really I'm not trying to make a huge statement but it just keeps my hair team so that's that one the next one is an all pearl headband which I have been loving the only issue that I have with this one is because the pearls kind of turn they rotate it slides so it doesn't stay in place like I'd like it to and I don't think pins will hold in it so I'm constantly adjusting this one it's super cute though so I wear this one a lot like to church when I wear my pearls and things like that and also a thing that I have been seen is layering headband so they're taking like a huge padded one like this and maybe putting the pearl one in front of it like this to get more of a layered look and I think that that is super cute too and also I find when I do it like this the purl one stays in place because it really has nowhere to roll to it might roll forward a little bit but this kind of helps secure it so that's a super cute look to me raise this up a little bit and the last headband that I'm gonna show you let me just kind of fix what I've jacked up here the last headband that I'm gonna show you is and I believe what all the headbands have been inspired by which is the iconic Velvet pearl headband and this one is made by Lea Lisa doughy and I think that it is just so freaking beautiful the quality is awesome and it's just a statement on its own you can throw this on with anything and all of a sudden your outfit is like hey so those are the headbands next I'm going to move on to barrettes hair barrettes are a thing right now too and the ones that I love are the pearl ones so I have two different ones I have a rectangle pearl looks like this and then I have a triangle pearl that looks like this and they're being sold everywhere I've seen them on ASOS I've seen them just pretty much about on every website so the way I like to wear these as I just like to take them and clip them like right above my ear and they're really cute layered so I might go up just a little bit and do the triangle one so that's just one side and that's how that works I like how they're big so that's a statement in itself but then you can take it up a notch and you can actually repeat it on the other side so then you have a whole party going on in your hair it's very I believe like twenties inspired it's super cute and I like to do this just to amp up an outfit and so those are the pearl barrettes I found these cute barrettes that I'm getting ready to show you next on ASOS and these are a triangle jeweled in a tortoise print these are like gorgeous so that one looks like that and it came in a set of two and that one it's like that love these ones too if you don't like this little thing sticking out right here you can put them in the opposite way you can kind of go down with them so the thing that sticks up is more behind instead of in front and that I think looks better but you can wear it both ways and you can wear one you can wear both you could wear two on one side these are super cute too just love the jewel and the it looks like it has like a rhinestone and then like green pearls it's really cute the next one that I got is also from ASOS and it is a huge pearl clip with like a wicker on the outside deep this is so big look at that one oh my gosh this is my first time actually like putting this one on and it came in a set of two and they're not the same the other one is a like a leaf a gold leaf [Music] and that's how that looks together that's really cute too I could see this like with an all-white dress that would be cute and so the the only downside with these four Reds is if you're not careful it will pull your hair so that's that I'm gonna move on to earrings and I will do you like that okay you guys these are the first pair of earrings that I wanted to show you these heart-shaped embellished earrings they are humongous and I have been on the search for these forever ever since I was watching an episode of American Idol and I saw Katy Perry wearing them I said I've got to have those earrings they are so cute and I searched high and low I found the designer that makes them but they were out of stock everywhere and I just happened to be browsing this website that I'll link below and I found these earrings and I got them it took about two weeks for me to get them and my daughter actually snuck into my closet and wore them before me but I love these so that's the first pair of earrings this is the second pair of earrings I got these from ASOS they are a green beaded hoop they actually had a matching headband but I waited too long and when I went back it was gone it's a thin beaded kind of translucent head them that matched these and I was so bummed that I missed out on that because it would have been so cute together but these are super cute that's the second pair this is the next pair of earrings it's a white tassel earing I got these from DSW shoe warehouse I was shopping with my grandma and found these in there and I thought they were cute so I snatched those up also at the same store I found this cute bag it is a little triangle bag it opens up like this and you so it can kind of sag like this and I don't know who made this better and this is the next pair of earrings I found these cute little raffia earrings on the Asus website and I thought that they were perfect for summer nice oversize statement earrings that will be really cute with basically anything black/white and I thought that if I could find a cute little raffia bag these would be adorable love them next I got these hoops with pearls inside of them I found these when I was shopping at Dillard's the other day and I thought they were super cute the brand of these is Landry and they're there they have some weight to them I think they look really cute with my pearl headband I love hoops I pretty much wear hoops every day so to find some with a little bit of embellishment but they're still neutral and classy I think that it's a win-win love these it's the last thing I have for you guys is a couple pair of sunglasses that I picked up from that same makeup beauty store here in Dallas and the first ones are all black and they have pearl trim I just thought these were super cute I love sunglasses I probably have 50 pair of sunglasses and I thought these were just so cute so that's those and the second pair in my last item for this video are these cute pink tinted sunglasses and they have little bumblebees on the side I thought these were adorable got them at the same beauty supply store I think these might have been 12 bucks maybe and these might have been 10 bucks they're super affordable and they have just tons of sunglasses I've gotten several different pair from there I lose sunglasses all the time so I am not spending an arm and a leg on sunglasses even though I have I don't think I'm gonna do that anymore so that's it you guys I hope you enjoyed this video of all my cute new little accessories and I will see you guys next time

you're right this is a beautiful looking wireless headset if you're an audiophile looking for the best headset for music just stop this video yeah you're right just stop it this headset is great for almost anything else I wanted to show you this headset after almost an ear of using it but it's with a huge discount and gathering for just 45 years dollars and the price of these Plantronics 818 is usually twice that much the three main reasons I like them comfortable excellent build quality long lasting battery life and they're Wireless if you have to often communicate with colleagues and friends I cannot think of a better handset note that these have been especially designed for gaming the communication protocol is not bluetooth so you always need this little dongle apparently I'm using Plantronics for quite a while now this is the older model of these series the nine nine five two very significant differences the new headset can be used while being charged I really dislike that for the older one and they no longer use this leather light coverage on the earpiece and you can see the place where I actually broke my old headset I actually haven't applied a lot of pressure on the material but they just broke and duct tape fixes zero and because I want to be completely fair about this product here's a disadvantage the mini USB charging port you're right not a micro but a meaning USB charging port a little inconvenience there are easy to find inexpensive adapters though you can get one from the link in the description that's what I wanted to share with you this time if

you know so you watch so you watch some more [ __ ] give me some feedback you know I love that too anyways guys in this one some ones and this one's gonna be a little different I've been actually looking at the carts and everything you know I'm saying doing my like research on which ones are like pretty good for me like as in like what's gonna be like best for me type [ __ ] like I want to get a nice car and not just know 510 thread and that's what I'm like kind of talking about I don't wanna I'm trying to look for something like my buddy Earl he has the Ares Pro I'm pretty sure that's what it's called and that has like a specific it's a specific battery for a specific car and that's basically what I was looking for you I feel like those are pretty nice I did some research and I saw that the pack spots are pretty good they had packs pods out here so I was like yeah yeah I'm gonna get a pack spot you know [ __ ] yeah I heard really good reviews from them I saw some different videos on myself pretty pretty good stuff about him so I thought why not give him a try you know definitely I was researching cardis and pods like that was because for work you know saying buddy boy back in the workflow and I'm saying I'm trying to do some discreet and someone low-key on the go in this that's why I think car DS are friggin perfect for you know then that I might think red ribbon in my bunker smoking a nice fat joint got my hands on some blueberry headband from rhythm you know I'm saying and I've been smoking on this since Saturday it is Thursday right now or Wednesday I'm sorry I've been smoking on it for a nice five days you know and I'm actually surprised by it because he's right here I feel like I've had point two fives and three miligrams and i run though i run through those in like two days you know and this one actually lasted me almost a week I'm basically almost done with it puffing on this bad boy you know I've been puffing on it all day actually to get a nice review on everything you know I'm saying overall I'm really happy with these but let's get in-depth there enough for the background story to even let's get into this I got my you know shot to rise that's where I got it from specifically this is this is the box right here it's the pax era of rhythm balance 500 milligrams you know I'm saying I opened there a day after I got it from rise you know and I got the I got the unboxing video right here so yeah I was able to get my hands on a pax era from rhythm you know it is one other balance they got balanced energized and relaxed I'm pretty sure that's what they are it is a nice hybrid of 500 milligrams you know it is a blueberry headband you know blueberry itself is pretty nice and well-known and same with headband it's really well-known as well got this out of rise and Niles it is a half millet it is a 500 milligram cart or pod I should say and then total the total th II came up to 84% and like the way you open this bad boy was pretty I think it was pretty unique you know it's really locked and certified you gotta push this in and then there is like a little there's also like a little a little tab I want to say so another little piece of paper inside there other piece of cardboard I mean that you gotta push that and then as well push that other piece of cardboard in and there's another slim piece of cardboard on top and you just pull that bad boy right out and I really like the packaging first first things you know packaging is really nice you cable and I like how they would they put blueberry headband right on the actual pot itself which was really nice it's coming out from rhythm rhythm hasn't really I got to say I've had some nice stuff from them yeah it's pretty nice guys I've been puffing on it for like I said for five days and this guy's been pretty good cars like the vape hits and everything it's really smooth really tasty you taste those SERPs for sure pax era blueberry head back from rhythm a 500 milligram pot what's really cool about the pax area and what pushed me to actually get this compared to other card cards or pods is that it actually has like a web support system has an app but not for Apple users only for Android but at least you can I still go on the web app itself you can just go onto Google and then type in the PAX web app it'll bring you up to this should be the first one it'll bring you to the home page of this you know just click connect now you know ask you which one is your device as a pax era they don't tell you to put in the serial number on the back of your pax pod device and then you can connect through a Bluetooth you've got to shake your device until it turns blue on the light and then you're able to connect through it once you do connect you're able to get to this screen and I'll show you all this stuff right here you can starting out you can what's really cool is you can lock your device and no one else can like hitting if let's say you left it at home or something you know what nobody's to be hitting your chez while you're gone you can lock it from there another thing is also for the pod results it said it's coming soon just to see all the results for your actual pod itself that you got from the dispensary but what I think is really cool is when you go to add your actual pod to this so right now I'm going to select my state and then apply it's all rhythm rhythm is the ones that are making these pods and hybrids indica climb sativas and even CBD I'm gonna choose mine I have blueberry headband and I go press this plus sign before that I'm gonna show you guys 84 THC blueberry headband which is DJ short blueberry I'm Rolo G Sour Diesel pre-money a bubba kush is a hybrid trainer featuring lemon earthy blueberry and future aromas and pleasant brush even gives you a description of it and the genetics that's really cool but yeah you go press this plus sign to add it to you to your packs air device and then what's really really cool is that it gives you the freakin expert tongue which is amazing expert temp is the pod and preset for optimal temperature for the string is chosen by the extract and extract is the one who's making this there's the one who's telling you what's the best temperature to smoke this out of for the best experience and it's a 700 you can go ahead and just drag this and put it at 700 and boom just like that boom just like been you can have your [ __ ] set and controlled all through the web app which is awesome blueberry headband tasty percentage everything you can even lock it from here and just test results are coming soon which is pretty cool but yeah that's another reason why I chose this pax era pods compared to other ones another really cool thing is that since I'm only gonna be smoking out of these packs vapes as in a pod wise and instead of going through each dispensaries website to see what's on them I need to see if they even have these I can go straight to the packs itself it's they have partnered with Jane so you can just hover their pods in our region let's go ahead and click this tab right here and explore now they'll bring you to this page go ahead and enter in your location and you put in my zip code hmm you know tell me what's in my region you can go and select the distance if you don't want to go too far let's say I'm only trying to go 20 miles you know this is gonna be what's around in 20 miles I know it's a cold nice car that's good if you can get like to switch my loud we do well yeah I can go right here and check where it's at you know let's say I want that brownie sky right here go and click it show me where the two stores near me that have it rise Mundelein and that leaf right here does say uh medical I'll go actually back and switch this recreational exhale make you see only when I got to actually that's who excited right there you know go ahead and click the Mandarin Jack and I'll tell me which soars head rise nails yeah you know yeah guys that was pretty cool another thing I just wanted to throw in there yeah guys I'm like I've been saying I'm really I'm really happy with this I'm really happy with the purchase and with the pot itself as the taste goes I'm really happy with that as well you can definitely taste the terpene so you can definitely taste the headband you know let's talk a little bit about the strain the strain itself the strain blueberry headband is indica dominant I'm pretty sure it's like 60/40 or 70/30 something like that you know and it's a hybrid I really think it is a well-balanced hybrid because I've been smoking on this all day even at work you know I like it's it's pretty so I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's you Florrick it's calming and uplifting and then it's also it's also kind of energizing so I get a little bit you know a nice like eyeless let's get it let's get this [ __ ] done you know I'm saying I don't get that set back like we're like crazy indica like puts me up excuse me pushed me on lock you know I'm saying push me puts me unlock puts me on the couch like I'm not trying to work on highs hell no it was like a perfect well balanced hybrid I want to say and that's like that's really good you know blueberries a nice is a nice strange so is headband you can definitely when I was hitting this you can definitely taste the like sour D and OG in there like he was definitely you really Turbie on that and then you got that nice aftertaste of like some blueberries like some berry ish berry stuff you know it tasted really good and as far as like you know let's get it let's get another puff right here sugar a quick because I'm on two right now no that's like 50% haven't charged I'm pretty happy with this with the battery so I'm gonna do a nice review on the actual pockets of the packs era in the future I need to get a couple more pods to get it up you know a nice official review let's take this it's really nice really smooth really tasty I give it basically I want to give this like a ten out of ten I'm gonna give it a ten out of ten I think this is perfect honestly like even to the end I'll show you guys to the end like it gets a little you know most most cards do get a little target still still pretty golden I want to say but yeah guys this I'm really happy with this I want to give this guy's a ten out of ten this is the first one so you know might be giving it a biased review because it is the first one and I haven't actually tried other ones you know I'm saying but this one's definitely gonna be a ten out of ten I love the flavor of it I love the smoothness of it everything as far as the high goes it's definitely as definite like I said it's definitely a hybrid because like I was it was nice I was up there you know I'm saying I was uplifted but now like euphoric you know I'm saying I was it was calm at work I was chill and I was also like at the same time kind of like energize your new sounds and I bet let's get it you know I'm chill I'm relaxed I'm mellowed out it was nice it was a good clean hi I want to say definitely a hybrid because like the other day I wasn't really that like lazy you know when as far as like you would think blue would have been since it's an indica dominant I think it's more like a 50/50 I want to say cuz like it maintains that that balance and it's really nice and that's I guess why they call it that balance now that I think about it you know and it's I really like the high O's calm calming uplifting and I want to say it definitely a little bit energizing yeah guys that's all I got for you guys I hope you guys really enjoyed this review you know I'm really happy with my purchase out here from Rhys and I also if you guys haven't seen that video you know go check that out on my bike over there and cop some

and double crochet in the last chain two and turn okay row four skip the first front post double crochet around the next double crochet into now this is where we start to cross the cables so you skip three these three right here and you're going to front post treble crochet around the next three so there's the first one second one and the third now you need to go back to the first you skipped and start here you need a front post treble crochet around this one and then the next one in the next one [Music] now it looks like a twisted up mess but it'll all straighten out within the next row so then your double crochet in the next two working the road normal front post double crochet here the yarn and then double crochet in the last so here's what your piece should look like after row four chain two and turn skip the first and back post double crochet here double crochet into and this next part is the part where it seems like a lot of people get confused so you just you need a back post double crochet around six starting on a camera waitin up here a little starting with this one here which would be your C one two three it would have been your last front post treble crochet that you worked so you're just going to grab it here like so and then your next one is right next to it now your third back post double crochet will be worked around the fourth the front post treble crochet you made in a previous row now the next ones are a little tricky to grab you don't be afraid to separate the stitches so you can get to them easier so your next back post double crochet will be worked right here and this one your next back post double crochet we worked here and your final want to be worked here last time now double crochet into that post double crochet on the next and then double crochet in the last here's how it looks from the back in front of the piece should look like this so then you chain two and now from here everything is a repeat the rest of the patterns are repeat until you join at the end and then work your single crochets I'll go through it one more time so this would be row six that we're on skip the first because this is your double crochet front post double crochet here double crochet into front post double crochet and six and double crushing to I post double crochet and then double crochet in the last alright so that was row six chained to my turn skip the first back post double crochet double crochet into and that post double crochet around six don't push it in too back post double crochet and then double crochet in your last space here which can sometimes be tricky since you're working into a chain chain two and turn so we're now on one two three four five six seven round row eight skip first front post double crochet in the next double crochet into skip three and then work three front posts treble crochets starting here second one so we've got one two three run post treble crochets work your force here it's goes right next to it and you've got your six double crochet in the next two front post double crochet around the next and then double crocheting the chain too so here's ro8 I'll show you one more time how to work along the back chain two and turn skip the first and back post double crochet around the next the yarn is on the floor right now okay double crochet into and then you need to work six back post double crochets and you're working in the order that they come to you in if you stretch them apart here you can see the first one the other two are kind of buried but if you just look along the front you work your first one here second one here third one here so back post double crochet second one goes here third and your fourth back post double crochet is here not that great your fists back post double crochets worked here and then work your last double crochet two back post double crochet and then double crochet in the last space Jinju turn and that's the repeat you'll continue to work those same four rows until you reach about 48 rows now I know I crocheted tightly and I've gotten some comments on I believe my blog and Ravelry that if you're a looser crochet or you probably don't need 48 rows maybe 44 you seem to try it on around your head when you get to the end you need to you'll need to hold the ends together and you just slip stitch around along here well I'm going to show you real quick here I need to chain one when you slip stitch you can also if you don't want to slip stitch the ends together when you get to the very end of the pattern you can sew them together to whatever you prefer but I like to slip stitch because then you don't have to fasten off and rejoin when you have to work the two rows of single crochet so to slip stitch across I change one grab these two loops here and then grab these two loops go under the second loops the second loops on that other piece so the other end slips - so you continue to slip stitch all the way across and then you'll begin the edging which will run all the way around single crochets and then you'll chain one and do another row of single crochet", "eEMOMRgt_dI": "good evening and welcome it's dirtyriver420 bringing you guys another strain appreciation video now uh i actually think i may have done this strain before um but i'm actually not sure i think i've done blueberry pie and headband by itself even headband

this straight because this [ __ ] right here is a [ __ ] fire i'm really happy to be back in texas and just smoking all this fire ass weave um but right here let me put in the light this is the blueberry headband me super like sticky and just [Music] real musky um with a wild smell on it man yeah this is some fire really happy to be uh smoking this one all right so this uh collaboration collaborative effort if you will from blueberry kush and uh headband sorry forgot it guys um but oh wow oh wow wow wow it smells like it almost smells like like a kiwi like if sprite had like a kiwi in it like that's what it was spelled like this [ __ ] right here [Music] listening to some cushion oj man i gotta i gotta actually stand up and back up for you guys and you guys have to check out the

ahead and take a nice fat rip with me this is the first rip on video that i've taken in here i've probably [Music] but this is the first one on camera i don't have snapchat or uh instagram or any like social media that i'm just like able to show [ __ ] on now so i'm like really focused on these videos and it actually is a lot more meaningful to me but it's actually a lot more meaningful to me um just the youtube in general like making videos makes me want to put more into it but cheers y'all [Music] [Music] [Music] man that's great [Music] oh man about to get something for y'all something that you can interact in if you so cheers [Music] sorry guys [Music] y'all know i had to grab that tissue [Music] celebratory crack one man crack one small point to you guys [Music] man let me know what kind of beers you guys you guys drink i drink doseki's uh bud light lately wow okay so the effects of this bad boy first of all once you get over your initial coughing fit and possibly choose to not smoke after that choose to or not choose not smoke but choose to like you know pass on the next rim nobody would blame you with this straight um it definitely has the same properties of headband like i feel a little like warm halo kind of like going around my head but i know blueberry kush is kind in my opinion kind of a weaker version a weaker version of like some like fruity type of push it's kind of like on the lower end you know [Music] but uh it's mixed with the headband in a way that it almost has double the potency but you like the headband brings the blueberries flavor out a little more that makes any sense so i mean if that has [Music] oh man this used to be my go-to song off this mixtape but yeah uh it's got me really [ __ ] high like i feel ditzy you know what i'm saying and i've also been smoking a shitload today like i don't know why we sold like [ __ ] 10 bloods at work and two of them were like [ __ ] bats like eighths at least inside the [ __ ] back [Music] and it's a lifestyle that we choose all right y'all the second rip [Music] cheers [Music] [Music] so [Music] mental effects [Music] what this drain mainly include it makes music sound really really good like kind of like that up version of shrooms like when you're like kind of coming up oh makes me sound really cool i don't know what [Music] mental uh efficiency [Music] but sonic arousal i guess it's a very very nice it's very smooth going down you blow it up that's what you're gonna call it i love headband i don't really like blueberry fish but overall i'd probably do this straight like a 6.5 that's that's pretty [ __ ] good [Music] but thank you all for smoking drinking with me um i really really enjoyed moving making this video the next video will be showing y'all around this place i was gonna do it on this video but i'm gonna find some nice dabs here pretty soon and i wanna kinda do that so that was blueberry headband i do appreciate each and every last one of you guys

peace", "0riPxusbeKU": "hey you guys what is up it's stonerville here how's everybody doing today so today we have headband here for a little debut i did a little research on this before actually remember this time um this strain is derived from og kush and sour diesel and the two couples get together and they make this beautiful little headband stream which i have here in this blog let's go ahead and show you guys what the feed looks like um let me just turn my camera around that way that's headbands headband not bands it's just headband okay we have a beautiful little chocolate vanilla swirl one because i thought it would go good with the stream um smells good smells pretty damn beautiful i'm just gonna make sure it's dried up because i didn't dry it with the wire this time i just actually let it dry let the sitting and let it dry that way there we go okay um i think yeah we're gonna take this in down here a wise toys once made by stoner which end do you smoke i don't like that word stoner even though my name is thunderbelly i don't like being called a stoner i don't like labels i really don't i think saying oh i'm stoner dude that's so cringy like what are you doing okay right off the bat i'm gonna earthy flavor right now that first that was like very earthy very um you know and kind of tell that they did what they did with this knowing that knowing what strands created the strain it makes perfect sense okay so the aftertaste of this is dirt it tastes like potting soil it's very good though it's not like a bad dirt taste it's more like a really good dirt taste i still don't feel anything yet down i'm kind of wondering i'll take three or four hits now by this point i'm usually yeah i'm feeling it you know the fact that i'm not it makes me wonder this is a creeper oh y'all know how i feel about creepers [Music] actually it's almost like she said hi hi she was like a little warm i got a little warm all right so we're going to be doing the headband standard for girlfriend earlier my internet was acting up and my stream was lagging i was having issues so i ended up just um turning it off the [ __ ] light again all the way over there of course you'll see me wrapping the etsy today with my little earring a little pot leaf here i don't i don't know where my other one is i've actually lost it somewhere i don't know it's in the room but go check them out man clover fairy creations c-l-o-v-e-r-f-a-e-r-y creations yeah i'm promoting because i deserve the promotion they do a lot of good work let's light this [ __ ] up let's get back into the stream review hopefully my internet doesn't [ __ ] [ __ ] on us this time okay all right so the coffining not horrible so far um i already saw the string i'll start again this is headband headband you guys i still have another nugget from the old the last stream that i had and um the difference is crazy but they look the other one is really orange and hairy and this one is like white has a lot of white crystals um the smell is definitely a diesel eliminate type smell it's very strong also the string is a creeper it's a very creepy screen but yeah the flavor is really nice when you first take ahead of it when i first lift this bottom up i could really taste it now i can really taste the wrap but when i first started to taste the weed and um it definitely like it started off as like a you know celery type flavor like a lemony i definitely got lemony type uh vibes from my you know taste taste wise um and then after like after i blew it out it tastes like dirt i got like a very strong earthy flavor um it wasn't bad you know like when you say dirt most people think a bad taste no it wasn't bad it just tasted like dirt so take a foul lip outlet back lit rip i would say all right so that little cosplay got me um so i guess it's a little bit more of a coffee type stream um it does get you like your get your cotton mouth going pretty quick i don't feel the weed yet i don't think it hasn't hit me yet but the cotton mouth has hit me i'm starting to feel cotton mouth so you know it's a little tinfur i love these wraps there they they're good these are part of my second favorite next to philly's i need to get some phillies soon we need to have a little throwback night phillies in a fire and some [ __ ] mice hard that's really it's the blind digger the vlog's really getting me it always does anyways um it's the perfect throwback night because oh my god that's literally my whole entire teenage years [ __ ] phillies or white owls it was mostly white i was because philly's feelings were like a special thing for me you know if i got phillies it was a special occasion because you had to go to the hedgehog to get phillies you couldn't get him at the gas station so it was like a special thing if i got phillies but um philly some drinks and have a fire you know get everybody together just have a great ass night usually we don't match up a few months up my friends would usually bring some beer whatever he says beer i'm not a big beer drinker that's why i usually got mike's hard you can get it for north and gas there so it's cheap you know and it's not bad i'm not super big on it i mean i i used to like it but i drink i drink it so much that at this point i'm just not big on it anymore you know that's how it is with [ __ ] smeared off pineapple i don't really can't drink that [ __ ] anymore last time i drink i literally have a video of me that my sister took and i was plastered because i had [ __ ] drink like the whole entire six-pack in like maybe two hours and i drink it pretty quick like i was pounding them down i was um i got really drunk and i started singing mercedes-benz by danish joshua i don't know if you guys know that song that's like oh lord would you buy me a mercedes-benz my friends all drive porsches it must make them men i'm not gonna think that was on yet yeah that's like a little bit of it um it's a good song but yeah and the next day i had a really bad hangover i felt like absolute [ __ ] and yeah that was like the last time i drank pineapple smear off and then after that the next time i drink pineapple i'm just not big on pineapple anymore in general i guess because the next time i drink pineapple was brunette's vodka it was pineapple vodka and my body got pretty [ __ ] shit-faced and you know a bunch of [ __ ] happened like it was really awkward you know yeah um so we got up really early and i was like yeah i can't take you home yeah so i went home and the whole day i felt like absolute [ __ ] i had the worst hangover in my life like all right so i feel this during now and it's you know it's nice um i have a lot of cotton off caught in my scale would be like eight right now i did um as far as how i feel i feel kind of like this mellow yeah i don't really feel like i want to be like clean around right now you know like i'm not feeling that but i'm not feeling like really lazy you know i just [ __ ] chill i gotta kick back and play some call of duty or something you know yeah for sure all right so let's review this stream so headbands um mother well the mother and father of the stream is diesel sorry i'm sorry i can't even think what it was i literally my head just been completely blank just now yeah sour diesel on og kush is the maker of the stream those two strands came together in a little while affair and they made this as their baby headbands yeah the names are always wonder about the name where they get the names from like you know whenever the person created this where they come from they need a headband i think it's had bandages or something like that but yeah like who thought of who was just like yeah headman that's what we're going to call the story anyway back to the review um as far as the coughing like i was you know i was coffin was a little mild but i was smoking blood i'm sure perfectable wouldn't be as bad once always a little rougher for me you know all that tobacco and stuff it's always rougher for me so i smoke a lot and yeah yeah um you think that'll make it better but yeah but yeah uh so i always have to say there's a 0.5 for that because it's not going to get a lot of points for the coffin because yeah the coffin was kind of um i couldn't really do it but i guess i could move on but um as far as the high goes the eye is really nice so far i'm feeling pretty great you know i feel very uplifting and stuff alright so i would say we're gonna take it up to sex with that yeah and the flavor flavor is very nice the nice little aroma aftertaste that it gives you you know after you exhale a little aftertaste it gives you it's something it takes you back to your childhood a little bit you know just kind of i don't know it brings you back gives you some memories so for that and even you know there were almost love and everything too white smiles and all that together um i'll definitely take this straight up to a 7.5 i would say that's where i would leave it at and you know that's i think that's moderate that's like a yeah it's good but it's not like the best you know what i'm saying it's like right there it's like almost there it's almost five stars yeah i like it though and i'll of course keep you guys updated on the after as always you know um but yeah i'm i'm really liking it right now so i really bad taste in my mouth though i'm not black yeah that's why i'm putting it out because it was getting towards the end and the end of that blunt there wasn't a lot of weed it was more in here that's just how i do it towards one end that time that's weird because in case i do want to put something in there like a crotch i usually don't use scratches but sometimes if i roll the paper down and use a crotch but i told me if i'm really celebrating you know that's a celebratory what a big fat one and that's like something i would have to share with somebody i couldn't smoke that i don't know that's why i don't want to pick that one so i don't like smoking that [ __ ] by myself you know it's not fun celebratory blood has to be celebrated you know smoked with multiple people you all gotta [ __ ] celebrate that [ __ ] with the blood you can't just have one person enjoying it mean i really like the stream i would definitely recommend it let's look at my eyes you guys can tell me from back here i can see glare so it does affect your eyes a little bit some strains don't want substrate to do and you know i don't know that's weird like i'll smoke so i'm sure i could keep this [ __ ] done like i could smoke big attack once and everything and my eyes will be fine i'm still learning i'm just learning like time without the brain so i'm pretty proud of myself for this even though i know you guys that part looks really shitty i'm [ __ ] proud of myself [ __ ] you guys [ __ ] the haters because this is hard for me to do i was never really taught i never really had nobody to teach me how to do [ __ ] like that you know that's why i always just wore my hair straight because that's the one that i know how they was just straighten my hair so i was always straightening my hair and you know that's what's it really like i pulled it up you know i never had nobody really teach me how to do that shadow like makeup or anything make up something else you know i had to kind of learn myself that's why i don't i just really don't wear it i can do the basic stuff as you can tell you know but i go for a natural look it doesn't make up when i go for a natural look let's go ahead and try it in the bubbler and get more i can get this [ __ ] taste i don't know me yeah i'm still getting the same um [Music] dave that sucks so oh i'm telling y'all the nails [ __ ] legit oh yeah it almost has like a sweet taste too i saw that taste it was nasty 10 out of 10 recommend yeah i'm not coughing that bad either so i'm gonna take the coffin up i'm gonna take it up i'm gonna take it to an eight [Music] i mostly get it wrong sorry guys yeah i mean that's nice that's really nice um so i would definitely recommend this stream guys so if you're looking for something to try go to your local dispensary and see if they have a string um like i say you can look up lately is the best place i promise you guys that is like one of the best websites ever if you're looking for any reviews on screens they literally have everything on there and all the reviews are good you know it's literally awesome [ __ ] like you need to read the comments and see what other people have said about it and stuff and it's yeah it's good [ __ ] so i would definitely recommend checking that out um appealing to like this thing right just really accents it very nicely hey guys this is the whole look though you guys want to get one of these earrings man i'm hearing like this there's a bunch of cool ones dude um i don't think she really makes these ones anymore this is like yeah so one time little thing but other ones that they have on the website because i haven't seen them on there anymore anyway that's what i have on the website some of them are bugs the bugs are limited though because they don't actually kill the bugs they find dead bugs and they use them if they're still good enough they use them and cast them but they don't actually kill anything that's another thing and they're all actually eco-friendly packaging they really put a lot of work into it you know it's not like they just ship something out they actually wrote out a little letter and everything to you guys it's all special [ __ ] and they make little coffins and everything else they don't kind of show you know resin casting flowers yeah you just check them out when they're on etsy they're pretty good you know what i have stuck in my head right now this daddy tells song and it's uh the cheeseburger larry he goes to the girl out there and he's like he's like this i would you like a cheeseburger and a milkshake with that as well wait that's what he said i'm sorry he said to them i would like a cheeseburger and a milkshake and fries as well she said sorry but we're closed now but we opened tomorrow he said i am

i went over there because they're open 24 hours he went over to denny's and got himself [ __ ] some bacon and [ __ ] and then he came back for his cheeseburger it's so awesome i didn't know this how i got older but veggietales is actually a really christian kids thing yeah they're like it's super christian oriented they promote and stuff that explains what my parents always has watching vegeta [ __

real I just like this time you see this pot they're not meant to be metal even to be sinful silver though I didn't see this made of plastic so the sponge should be more like stuck to the headphone

options to transition to gray one of them is the easiest one and that is cold turkey you basically do nothing you stop dyeing your hair and you allow your gray hair to come in and your colored hair to grow out that is the most popular method to transition to gray hair and while that is the most popular it does have its challenges so i'm going to share some tips with you in just a moment on how you can get through that cold turkey stage and also what to expect during that stage so as i said the first step is either do nothing go cold turkey stop dyeing your hair and let it grow out your second option to some can be considered very drastic you can cut your hair you can let your hair grow to a comfortable length and then you can chop it you could chop off the colored ends there are some people who transition for a year or two and then they chop there are some who chop right from the beginning and that is up to you and how comfortable you feel about having short hair again even with this particular choice that you choose there are some challenges but i have some tips for you to help you to get through that stage as well and then we have our third option to transition to gray hair and that is you can color your hair you can go gray overnight literally but it's not really overnight because to get your hair to the color gray takes a lot of steps i recently was watching a youtuber a hairdresser on youtube who was mentioning how to get your hair which is a dark color especially if it's black all the way to gray is like 10 shades away so imagine how much removal of color that that is going to take and that's not something that's necessarily going to take overnight there's a famous stylist jack martin who had did jane fonda's hair and became very popular on instagram for the transformations that he's done on women getting them to gray overnight but basically there was a couple of sessions that he would do where he would continue to lift their color with a couple of sessions so they would come in on different occasions and get their hair um actually it depends on the person's schedule because it can be a whole day thing and if you're used to getting your hair braided or getting weaves and how long that takes it's similar to that process to be able to lift up the hair you can do this yourself but i would not suggest it i would suggest for getting your hair that light to leave it in a professional's hands and not just any professional someone who knows how to get your hair to that color without completely obliterating your hair because when you think about it what nature already does with our hair fading gradually or the loss of melanin and we get a gray hair or a white hair they're doing that in a forced way to your hair and a bonus tip if you don't want to go through that permanent hair color route or the time that is invested in that or the money because think about that if you want to go to a professional get it done right you gonna spend some money on that you can also try temporary colors like hair waxes and that's actually something that i've done to with synthetic hair pieces that i love but they're not in the color gray and i want to add some gray highlights to them there are some hair gels and hair waxes on the market that you can purchase so that you can put on your colored hair and see how your hair would look all gray the caveat with that i'm going to tell you some of the limitations of that method and also some tips to go with that so for us to recap the three ways that you can transition to your gray hair is grow it out do nothing stop dyeing your hair you can cut your hair cut off all the colored ends or you could get your colored ends lifted to a gray color now something i want you to know when you're starting your gray hair journey it's a pitfall many of us can make but i want to remind you the right way to go gray is the way that works for you don't let anybody tell you that the best way is to cut it the best way is to grow it out know the best ways the best way is the way that works for you so there is no one way besides the way that works for you you can do it differently there are also some people who say okay i'll try option one and i'll let my hair grow out and then they decide nope i'm gonna cut it or nope i'm gonna go to a professional and get it lifted to gray so again remember that the choice for how you want to gray is in your hands you don't have to feel limited there are options for you now let's go into some of the pitfalls that you may encounter with each of these different choices and some tips that i have for that the very first one is growing out your hair the hardest part of the grow out method is how long it takes and the first couple of weeks of grow out when you when it doesn't look intentional yet and you're dealing with you know those like couple of inch of roots the ones that you were so quick to color before now you are intentionally growing out depending on how long your hair is it can take a year two years maybe even three years to fully grow out that hair color and sometimes that can be really really tough so some suggestions that i have and tips to get you through that stage pictures document document document it's been said before that sometimes if you're just sitting watching a kettlebell it's not going to go by any faster so by taking a picture the first day that you do it then maybe you know each week or weekly you'll be able to look back and see that progress is happening more than you think documenting is really good to help with the patience aspect of this stage another thing that you can do especially the first couple of months to deal with those roots is headbands headbands are your best friend to be able to cover those roots also if it's appropriate where you work or you know for your lifestyle head wraps are another amazing option to help you to work through those first couple of months of dealing with the roots my hair was already very short so it wasn't really easy for me to do headbands at that time i actually wear more headbands now than i did when i was transitioning and it's okay please don't shame yourself if you find it very difficult to deal with the first couple of months of the growing along with coloring your hair permanently you don't have to color all of your hair gray you can do highlights you can just color the hairline gray and leave the rest of it to do its natural thing again if you go to a professional or someone who knows how to do this they will be able to give you some different options so that you can gray as comfortably as possible another thing that you can do to help you through the grout process especially if you're gray and natural is you can use braids you can use twists like i'm wearing right now although this is a wig a passion twist wig actually is not uh my own hair this is where headbands are also amazing to cover it's like a headband wig my own headband wig that i made then we have the second option as we mentioned which is cutting your hair and even with that you know dealing with your hair very short can be like a new thing to deal with in its own challenge but similar to that if you can wear extensions you can wear braids you can wear wigs another thing that if you still have some of your l'oreal spray root spray you can spray your roots in the beginning to help you get through the first couple of weeks until it looks a little bit more intentional another thing that can be a struggle as i said dyeing your hair permanently gray is dealing with the stress that that puts on your hair cuticles when you lift your hair that much so i would think trying things like olaplex things to build up your hair you have to be very very diligent about how you take care of your hair since you lift it you know that much so that those colored ends don't break off from all of the things that they went through and you might need to give that your ends much more special attention than you even have to do for your gray hair that's growing in naturally another thing with the temporary color it can be a hassle to every time you wash your hair reapply it again and if your hair is very long that could also be a hassle a benefit of cutting your hair short if you want to put if your hair is already short and you want to see what it looks like you can easily add the temporary dies to your short hair with these different temporary colors that i've used from mafajung and from gemini naturals gemini naturals is more of a gel based temporary color and it's a richer deep color the mafajong is more of a wax it's heavier it's thicker both of them wash out very well from your hair you have to wait till your hair is completely dry and you don't have as much transfer as when it is wet and sometimes it is better to use these color waxes and gels on hair that already has product on it as opposed to naked hair or freshly washed hair i've learned that i've applied them to hair that my hair already has gel or product in it and so it just kind of is like literally what makeup is you know you put a primer you put um concealer and then you put the foundation on top that's kind of like what the wax and the gel is like when you put the color on there there's no one way that works for everyone besides the way that works for them so don't feel like you're boxed into one particular way to do it and i want you to know that i am offering one-to-one zoom consultations if you need someone to hold your hand through this to help

gender what the hell is gender sounds like some kind of phony word popularized in the 50s to create a false distinction between one identity and their biological sex am i in a ballpark here you're

transfer them i watered them very heavily too and they've been here since yesterday they are doing really good actually under that 4,000 watt garden everything is perfect at the true 24 he's a bit low

breast cancer and has received chemotherapy and treatment from her care team at dana farber cancer institute if you'd like to support dana farber's cancer genetics and prevention program please visit the link in the description below to make a donation for today's project i'm using loops and threads impeccable yarn in the color soft rose and the centro 48 needle knitting machine i'll also be using an adapter along with an automatic screwdriver which will help speed up the process i'll link below to all the supplies used in the video today and please remember to subscribe to the channel to stay up to date with my quick and easy knitting patterns and tutorials starting the counter now to begin i'm casting on to my centro using my main color i wrap my yarn around the last needle and then thread it back and forth behind it in front of each of the needles until the end of the row once i finish the row i put my yarn through the tensioner and choose medium tension even when i use my adapter i usually hand crank the first few rows just to be on the safe side now that i've finished up about three rows i'll move my adapter into place making sure that both the adapter and the machine are securely attached for this hat i'll be needing 110 rows in total when using the adapter it's tempting to run it constantly to go as fast as possible but i prefer to stop at the end of each row to check that i haven't dropped any stitches if you notice a drop stitch right when it first drops it's easier to fix than if you notice it a few rows later i also want to mention that if you decide to work with an adapter i encourage you to carefully read through the safety requirements and follow the directions from the manufacturers of both the adapter and from the screwdriver at around row 75 the hat starts touching the table so i'll stop knitting for a moment and pull the work up within the machine let's continue on and i'll see you at the last row [Music] okay i just finished 110 rows in the soft rose and it took me a total of 18 minutes from first row to last next i'm going to cast off my stitches i'll cut a really long tail at least a couple of feet if not more and using a darning needle i'll begin to pick up the stitches off the machine as i slowly turn the wheel i start going one by one at first and once i get a few stitches in i'll begin picking up three or four stitches at a time after i pick up the last stitch i'll pull the work and stretch it out until it looks like a long tube then i'll use the tail to cinch the bottom closed and thread my darning needle through the closure next i pull the bottom of the hat into the inside to meet the top ensuring that the long tail is sticking out of the top then cinch the top of the hat and tie the two tails together as tight as i can without tying so tightly that they break casting off and assembling the hat took me 10 minutes which puts us at 28 minutes total so far next i'll add the knitting tag and i'll link in the description below to the shop where i order my tags the last step is adding the pom-pom i like to attach the pom-pom a few different ways in a few different directions to make sure that it's secured really tightly our hat is now complete the knitting tag and pom-pom took an additional six minutes leaving us with a total production time of 34 minutes for this beautiful hat that i'm making for a very special friend i'm off to package this up to ship to my friend and don't forget if you'd like to support dana farber you can visit the link below to make a donation if you have any questions
