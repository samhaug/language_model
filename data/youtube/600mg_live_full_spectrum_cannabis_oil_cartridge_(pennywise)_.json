{"zjSLPXz_9dE": "i'm dena mitchell with secret nature and i want to talk to you really quick about our vapes [Music] our newest distillate formulation is averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids that's almost double from our previous batches hang on charlie i don't think they heard that right play it again for the people in the back averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give them a try white fire

extracts are flooding dispensary shelves and overwhelming consumers with choices from BHO to co2 and from shatter to vape pens how do you know what's actually selling we talk with industry experts to get their take [Music] by far the highest quality date cartridge is BHO live rat centers like the color clarity taste a lot of these other co2 companies or distillate companies that do cartridges they'll actually introduce terpenes after the fact of processing or they'll take fake terpenes orders store-bought turkeys and this way on the libraries and Parks you're assured that it is exactly the terpenes of that plant and exactly that plant alone highest-quality big cartridge I would say my resin myself but BHO the highest quality bait cartridges are probably going to come from live resins I think live resin cartridges are the most accessible for everybody as well as keeping the quality up without a doubt you know fresh frozen libraries and makes the highest quality baked cartridges [Music] live resin and rosin probably have the most flavor and terpenes as far as I've seen I don't know if that's going to change anytime soon it seems like companies are doing some pretty amazing things as far as flavor goes these days BHO for sure it seems to be the only one that you know extracts all the terpenes out and you know actually has been flavored to it mostly anything that's live resin BHO is gonna have a lot more turbulent nose live resins gonna always have those terpenes it's kind of hard to get rid of terpenes when you have like resin when you have a dry material you're kind of chasing that turn pain dragon almost of trying to catch as many as you can of rendering they're juicing later on depending on what you're trying to go for the librarian is generally going to be with cleaner products that's fresh frozen it's also generally gonna be I just hear it more often being used for top-shelf product to keep the flower intact when it's being turned into extract so live resin you pretty much are getting more of a taste and flavor you'll hold 30% more terpenes out of the living plant then that's if you hang it up to dry so we actually handpick the flowers in the field we freeze them in the field and that maintains the full terpene aroma so generally you'll get you know five or six two things in the mixture when you when you dry the PM with the freezing you get all the monoterpenes and we end up with sort of anywhere between 20 and 25 different terpenes in our product and we've also been getting oil up to about 18% to be.we when we process a plant fresh it smells the exact same and the extract that it does in the flower preserves all those terpenes and just makes a far superior product", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me

hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "zrQKILuOYfc": "welcome to blue crayon extracts today I'm going to show you a little bit about our products or CBD babe cartridge product it's full spectrum CVE has 750 milligrams of CBD in the 1000 milligram cartridge and then we also have a 500 milligram cartridge that contains 375 milligrams of active CBD that's roughly around 3.75 milligrams per puff depending on how big your puffs sizes are and then same goes for the 750 milligrams CBD cartridge it's about seven point five milligrams per possible on average so I open up the little container here and inside I have the USB mini charger the battery battery sold separately but you know we we ship it in the in a box like this but then you can put it inside your container which is kind of handy and then we have the actual CBD distillate vape cartridge here that comes in its own little container which you can stand up on its own or you could you know some you know some people like to put actually on the battery pen itself its standard 510 threading on this and then you can the container there now vaping CBD is you know is entirely different way of ingesting it then then through your digestive tract for the digestive tract you're only absorbing a certain percentage of the total amount of CBD that's in the product whereas vaping it you're getting and practically entirely all of it and it's going directly in your bloodstream so when you vape CBD you know you're feeling the effects almost immediately so it's great for you know after a sports event and you have aches and pains you can you can vape after that you have a big meeting or a big presentation it's always good to vape a little CBD before those and you know you you get the instant the CBD the benefits of the CVD and this is CBD distillate so it's got a it's got a high viscosity to it it doesn't really move much until it's heated up and when the oil is heated up it turns into a vape vapour basically what else can I tell you now our carts our cartridges are actually really high-tech cartridges they have eight oil holes in the bottom of the cartridge so that all the oil when it when it keeps up and drips down at all get you so no oil ever goes to waste and then we actually have there's there's our top airflow holes on the cartridge at the top and that allows you to pull the air up from the top as opposed to the bottom of the cartridge or the bottom of our cartridges are sealed airtight so there's never any leaks I'll show you let me show you imperative cartridge competitors cartridge so oil they have side holes not like bottom holes like ours and the oil gets stuck in between the side holes and then that they're bought the bottom of their cartridge is not sealed and so you'll you'll get leaks sometimes coming through the bottom of these so back to our cartridge here I know if you have any questions you can always just shoot us an email at support at blue chronic stress calm and let me now show you about let me show you all about the battery so basically to turn on you click it five times five times in a row and then it turns along and then for the lowest setting is 2 point 7 volts it's white and say you're just you know you can hold it down it has a 10 second time timeout so you can hold it down take your puff release it the second setting to advanced settings you click it three times now it goes to the second setting which is three point one volts this is a good medium setting the first setting actually is great cuz you can really taste the terpenes in it once you start getting up to a higher setting you kind of burn off those terpenes or heat off those terpenes and so is it it all depends on your personal preference and then the third setting the highest settings is 3 point 6 volts and it's the color red and you click it three times and it goes to red now this also has a quote this pen actually has a cool feature where if you're let's say you're out outside on a hike and it's really cold out and they'll you know the CBD distillates you know pretty solid you can there's a preheat setting where you click it two times and then it'll go for fifteen seconds it will preheat your oil so if it's cold out it will it will get it going and then when you take your first take your first puff off it will it will help hit nicely and I'm gonna go ahead and take a puffer like I said has a 10 second shot off so you can never really overheat the distillate I hope you enjoyed watching our video today and again as I said if you have any questions please email us at support at blue crown extracts calm thank you", "dh5AVKuMJ4c": "the Joe Rogan experience gotta get off the CBD oil man his mess around your brain man you can't be too relaxed right yeah that's CBD [ __ ] it saves vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel that feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right Advil yeah yeah it's it's it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time yeah I never realized it was doing what you said yes I was more achy than I should be and then like you know bad night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom coming ahead yeah then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right", "Cpx1fHVOass": "this is what when you have stage 4 pancreatic cancer all my tribe mates

with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get

"dU9NVR4mOx0": "[Music] hey everyone today we're gonna be giving you a list of our top five oil cartridges so that you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a like if you found this video helpful and leave us a comment with your feedback take care everyone", "ySeN-3BjSU8": "we have two different types of oil right we have distillate right full spec yeah forget about what we have yeah out there in the universe there are different things yes out there on the universe atom so since the head of a major cannabis lab founder of a major cannabis brand I got the deets so so full spec is basically true - true - flower form so you know they maintain the the cannabinoid profile that exists on the flower terpene profile and they essentially just concentrate it so we do that with cryogenic ethanol here so we make a cryogenic ethanol concentrate then we reintroduce the same terpene profile extracted the supercritical co2 to the oil so the the profile of the terpenes and the cannabinoids is almost exactly what you would see on the flower just concentrated now most distillate based concentrates are more you know you would consider it to be more of like a THC isolate products so we try to concentrate really only the THC delta-9 profile and then a lot of groups will just put that in a cartridge by itself but a lot of groups like us reintroduce the supercritical co2 extract it's her teens - the distillate product then that goes into a vaporizer cartridge or syringe so you can't really call that a full-spectrum product because it's not really reminiscent of the you know the profile as it exists on the flower it smells more strange specific but distillate based right streamers is a dream specific full-spectrum exactly so that's the big difference there you get that Megan", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "qOa_EvfGSqE": "hey ladies keith richardson here today to talk to you all about the difference in the cbd oil and the cbd flour when you smoke it so whether you're vaping using the vape pan and oil cartridges or smoking the hemp flour in a hemp flower joint or pre-roll i'm going to go through the different effects and kind of you know the different just forms and methods of consuming the cbd in this way so let's get into it first i'm going to talk about the oil we just recently added the cbd oil cartridges to the site and the main difference with oil and flour is that the oil is extracted from the flour in my opinion it is more potent and it takes less for you to feel the effect so either uh when you're smoking the actual hemp flour bud like this like how these are this is orange gelato i have here so whether you're breaking this down and smoking the hemp flower buds or using the pen both of these methods are going to give you a buzz you will feel a high when you smoke it is not as intense as smoking marijuana but you do have a very euphoric to me the buzz feels very similar similar to drinking wine now for me and my tolerance the vaping the oil through the pen is stronger to me than smoking the flour like i only have to hit this like two three times and i'm good like good good so the oil is in my opinion stronger than smoking the flour but for you it may be different so they both work well for anxiety for pain stress relaxation for sleep the effects of it are the same and even the activation times are very similar so after you hit a joint a few times you know you're going to feel it the biggest difference in consuming is going to be that the vape when you vape through the pan like this it has no smell and you can really taste the terpenes so we have four different flavors this is bala berries i have here we also have plushers which tastes more like grape we have golden say banana and we have orange gelato so when you vape it in the pan you really can smell and taste those terpenes whereas when you smoke the flour you can smell the terpenes but you don't taste it as as well as you do when you vape the oil but they give you very similar effects so this is perfect for moms and even dads who don't want to let their kids know what's up they want to be very discreet with the smell you can have this in the car you can even take this to work nobody would know what this was zero smell the smell that gives off is actually very fruity and pleasant so that's the biggest difference this is a little bit um you know smoking hemp when you're smoking through natural methods isn't harmful for your health but this is a little bit milder on your throat for people who are concerned with smoking the flour sometimes smoking a joint is a little bit too harsh for people some people hate the smell of smoke they don't want to smoke in their homes you know it may be a little bit too loud to cover that smell up a lot of people don't like the smell getting in their clothes or on their fingers so this is what the oil is really great for because no smell very discreet and you're going to get all of the effects immediately so it's up to you and i'm going to show you guys really quickly too how to use the the batteries that we have on the site that go with the pins so let me grab a new cartridge so this is what a brand new cartridge will look like you have a little your oil thing in here so you get the oil in this one and then these are the batteries this is a five zero one thread battery it's rechargeable so you get the battery and you get a charger in the pack so basically the cartridge screws off and on and i already know a lot of you guys are going to want to know how long will one of these last based on research they say one cartridge should last from 50 to 100 hits but it depends on how often you use it so it may last a couple of weeks for some people it may last some people a couple of days for people who only use it you know sparingly a few months so it's going to vary from person to person but basically you would get your oil cartridge you take your pen and you just screw it in very simple very simple screw the cartridge all the way in with this pan right here you click it five times to turn it on so one two three four five the pin is now on then you click it twice to preheat the oil i actually had turned it off that first time my bad so that was turning it back on then you click it twice to preheat the oil and you see the light is turned in color so once it's green it's ready to go you just pull it you don't have to hold the button you just pull on it and as long as this lit up is ready you could probably offer each one pull it two three times say reheat it you just click the button twice that's it and then it's going to be ready to go within a couple of seconds so you hit it as soon as it turns and again very few fruity very mild but you immediately feel that cbd getting your system it's like immediately uh a gush of relaxation comes over you so you start to feel it get into your system right away and then to turn it off you click it five times one two three four five so now the pin is turned off and that's how it works very simple so we have all these products available for you guys via the pwlc online canon boutique you can visit us at www.pwlc.store make sure you like subscribe and share this video drop a comment below um let me know your feedback what you want to know next so just to tie this all up with a bow smoking the flour and vaping the oil give you very similar effects in terms of how impactful it is for pain for stress anxiety relaxation for pms but the major difference in smoking the two products is that the vape oil no smell you can really taste those um terpenes and with the flour is very effective as well but you're definitely going to smell it once you burn it and so you know to each his own i recommend them both for me my preference is the flour but you know the oil it's kind of something i'm still getting used to i'm such a flower girl like i think i'm gonna always prefer smoking the flower but the oil is beautiful it really is beautiful so let me know how you all like it and i'll see you guys next time", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not

you", "AO00JRgsgTM": "hey guys I was looking online for some more information about the no not just the vape pens but the hempseed all and I found a little bit but I didn't find any videos and I didn't find a whole lot on the vape pens which are these here and they've got I just kind of wanted to go through with you what I have learned about the vape pens and I like to use the one that's got the wick right here which is the same one I understand for the e-cigarettes which I don't even smoke cigarettes or e-cigarettes but I do like the vape pen with the hemp seed oil in it and there's a lot of information that I've got to share with you but I wanted to start off first showing you this little kit that I got there was other stuff that came in here I took them out but what I've got in here now - I got my charging cable I got my hemp seed oil itself and then I got the vape pen which all fits right in there little case and you zip it up the in sticks out so what but now it's curable you can carry it around but back to the V back to the pen the button up here you click it five times to turn it on one two three four and five okay when you hold it down when the blue is on that means it's working see it's smoking out of the sides right there okay but you don't have to turn it off because it's off when you're not pushing the button but that blue light needs to come on is showing you that the element a heating element is working through the blue light the heating element is working so you don't have to hit it five times again to turn it off and the main thing is to keep these wicks saturated with the awl and this is unrefined all hemp seed oil now adding all to your vape pen this is what I do I remove the little cover and this part here unscrews which opens up down in here now in the middle try to avoid not getting any in there because that's the airway what you do is open up your bottle and as you see I don't need to add any but get a few drops here and you just kind of lay this on the bottom half here and let's just go underneath the airway there and it'll go underneath and fills up this chamber here which in the wick pulls it up into the heating element area and then put this back home [Music] tighten it up not too tight but tight enough like I said once it's already on it turns itself off when you release that button you don't have to hit it five times each time it will it has memory and then hold the button down and it's heating up draw it deep into your lungs hold it for a minute - just like smoking a joint and then let it exhaust it you're releasing and you'll feel the change you'll feel a lot more relaxed rot away you know the type of business I'm in can have a lot of pressure to it so in the evenings I'll do three hits like that and that's all I need for a while this juice right here would last a while a week or so for me because I'm not on this pin all day long I just use it when I need to and then underneath here is where you use your charging device charge it up and the light I believe is red when it's charging and when it's fully charged it turns green right here I don't think I left anything out but if I did we put it in the comments if you want to see anything else like this let me know if you like it like it if you hit that bail you'll know when I'm putting up a new one [Music] and I got a little audio file I'm gonna share with you with some sliding pictures and it will give you a lot more background on a hip seed oil and here's what I got to share with you the internet studies shows unrefined hemp seed oil don't have any additives like propylene glycol or vegetable glycol which comes with a cigarette switch heated at high temperatures can turn into formaldehyde the body creates some formaldehyde anyhow humans

my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm

Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]",

United States of America Jupiter research is one of them all right the screaming coils you are on here buddy shout out my brother thank you so much as one of my patreon supporters right there big shout out the screaming coils my brother brother alright so here we go um yeah that's a sale day the sale over at nature's gifts that was a 35% off sale day kind of a doorbuster deal normally I can get that for about $14 but down to 11 is really nice okay on a normal day no discounts at all it's about 1718 dollars for a gram of distillate so that's that's average price for a gram of disciplic no you have use concentrate in terms in the cartridge yes I have used concentrate in turrets in a cartridge as a matter of fact all my terpenes are inside right now but I do have a very large assortment of different terpenes and liquidizer that I use in cartridges if I want to try that the only liquidizer that I really recommend using at this point due to my caste is true terpenes actual Turkey and liquidizer and all that's used for is turning a very thick distillate oil into something a little more liquid so that it will run adequately through a lower quality cartridge it doesn't actually break down any waxes or anything like that like you would get in one of the wax liquidiser or something like that it just goes into a pre winterized distillate and thins it up a little bit so it runs adequately through a cartridge necessarily I recommend right now other than that you can add terpenes to your distillate to thin it out but as far as liquid izing wax and putting it into a cartridge I've heard good things from the company wax liquidiser I've never used it myself I used one product from Nexus a wax liquidiser product from Nexus which is a company that does products for liquid izing wax for a cartridge and I was very unhappy with the results I didn't like the the heaviness on the chest I didn't like the flavor I did I was unhappy with it so I did not recommend it in my video there is a video of me doing that online and I don't recommend doing that that that was just my experiences one I've heard that farm to vape is another quality company the company I use is kind of a no-name company so I'm not surprised that it was [ __ ] to be honest with you anyway let's read some more here here my upgrade trans bud 0.3 huh we'd finish that super quick yeah exactly but what this is is uh if you go to a dispensary and you're like I've got some really bitchin oil just handle this card and say here go man take this [ __ ] home it's a got point three in it they can get plenty of good pulls off of it plenty of effect they know what it's like they know the flavor the battery is disposable when it's dead it's gone you know it is what it is so I mean it has its place is meant for industrial events or industry events and things like that tasters samplers if you have if you're an extractor yourself and you want to try your product you do a DAB you taste it out you put it in a cartridge they've got these that are point one point one gram it's just you put in there in your sample you just sample it through a nice high-quality very small ceramic core cartridge and you just get a taste of the flavor and then the effect that you're getting point one is plenty and a cartridge to get a couple good rips off of it so you need to smoke it all day to know what the flavor is to know what the effect is anyway getting off on it but point three is plenty for what we're gonna be doing we're gonna be using it for different events walking very discreet that is about as discreet as you can get right there very nice unit we're gonna fill this up we're gonna show it to you I think you guys are gonna be pleasantly surprised this little unit is is quite cool alright and uh just just for comparison purposes just because you guys would probably appreciate it we're gonna hold up the point three the point five and the one gram cartridges so you've got your point three right here you had your point five right here and you got your one gram right here all right I I deal with cartridges sometimes pretty regularly I specifically want to know as much as possible about the cartridges that are coming out see the shop that I go to nature's gifts retailers of fine cannabis they have a vendor day every single Saturday and they guarantee that one product of every genre one edible one concentrate one of everything at least is on hella sale from every tier top shelf low top shelf middle shelf low middle shelf budget super budget they have everything on sale at least one product from every single tier guaranteed every Saturday like this this was your middle tier right here your middle tier got down to $13 for this super [ __ ] bad-ass this is cherry pie slightly we got some cherry pie oh gee right here 89.2% in cherry pie oh gee look at that crystalline [ __ ] right there 13 dollars a gram all right you got your distillate which is a low budget discipline this is a double delicious brand double delicious brand insolent and it was on sale for $11 a gram okay then they had a doorbuster deal which was $13 for low top shelf not quite full time but low top shelf turf crystals $13 or $14 for some turf crystals of a jungle cake which is something I didn't get any I don't like the farm I don't appreciate her work but it was quality it is quality so there you have it anyway Oh once again I want to give a shout out to all my patreon supporters thank you guys so much I really appreciate you guys pitch it in these are the direct result of my trip to the Indo Expo here's the press pass right there you guys paid the gas to get down there and I really appreciate it okay you guys paid some of the gas to get down there but you guys were a big part of it you're the only reason I was really able to do it and I appreciate that so this content is thanks to those four patreon supporters we got John Warner or JR Warner right here we got screaming coils you can say thanks to him right there we had Joel Kennedy say thanks to him right there and we got rien and Foley I don't know if she's here yet but if she's not you say things to hurt whenever you guys see her on the screen feed right on right on right on so now that I've been jacking my job I'm gonna do a dab I'm gonna grab this just let her fill up some cartridges you guys ready for that all right thank you so much for tuning in by the way let's get this done all right not too much on you're gonna have to open up another jar here pretty soon but not yet this still got a little bit of the terpenes in it yes sir yes sir yes sir I got me some OG he cush busted me a bottle of ji cush terpenes out did a drippity drop drop he drop onto my crystals here came up with some OG Kush crystal dubba dubba dabs very very delicious I used the last of my wedding cake here recently I cried a little bit in my goddamn Cheerios when I did it but I did it because it was so damn good all right folks let's get a dab on what's up Dave from Detroit man hope things are turning up turning up for you my friend if not it's Sunday it's Sunday Monday I'll probably worse so live it up live it up right cheers for years folks okey-dokey okay what the [ __ ] was I talking oh my damn great hey Loretta how's it going um did you catch that Cassie uh he wants you to do some goddamn he wants you to pay do some commentary on your mail videos well I see that anyway no I don't need terms lover things I'll have to check that stuff out for sure I literally don't have anything out here and I should have everything out here and I literally I don't have any other but [ __ ] it doesn't matter ah cells there all the time never ear said no dates price gave me down man I know sorry man I'm sorry I really apologize man I don't know what to tell you I would never ever ever condone traveling across state lines with concentrates or marital products of any form but hypothetically speaking if you live near a recreational state times like 7/10 for 20 different dates like that you can get concentrates I was able to get up a very nice quality concentrate one time for $7.00 a gram if you're used to paying 25 dollars a gram think if you were just to save up a little bit and you were just to do a road trip for personal use of course it would definitely hypothetically be extremely worth it you need to think how much do you pay for 10 grams normally $70 I've seen one gram go for $70 okay so mathematically speaking hypothetically of course if I lived in Idaho I would not be buying my cannabis in Idaho hypothetically okay but that's just me and I would have no way condone that don't do it drugs are my drugs man okay man now I have heard I have heard of people getting on an airplane right flying over to the the areas you know I'm saying if you're paying $80 a gram all right seriously you get a plane ticket for 160 bucks that's 2 grams right you get $300 saved up right what's that 4 grams so now you're out six grams of dope right you get on your plane ticket to fly over to a recreational area you get a wonderful experience a wonderful experience an absolutely wonderful experience what it should be all right and with that $300 you buy 30 [ __ ] grams 33 [ __ ] zero okay and then hypothetically don't do it hypothetically but don't do it you box all that [ __ ] up into a box and you mail that [ __ ] to home then you get on your airplane you fly home today why would a wonderful vacation I just had and you know a really a really bad person might get home and sell six grams of that distillate for 80 bucks and then they would have a free vacation in 24 grams of distillate don't do that it's not proper but if you do the math all that [ __ ] checks out every single piece but anyway um now that I've talked long enough I'm gonna blow my nose a little bit and then we're gonna do this damn distillate thingy that I've been talking about we really narrowed it down to six people huh there used to be a lot on there now it seems like that might be a bit of a stretch for a lot of people you know what I'm saying traveling all that distance for something now you need to think there are at least two people in this chat right now they use cannabis medicinally as [ __ ] all right couple people are dying right how you doing reasoning how are you I'm so Washington State for example does not have mandatory pesticide testing for their product a lot of people in an uproar about that I don't know exactly what parts per million my medicine has in it now you go to any one of these illegal states you're buying dope from some dude on the corner pesticides are in that maybe none make me they're not using a single bed sure why not now Oregon California Denver a lot of legal states they test for every [ __ ] thing all right just think about that if you think that clean medicine will make you live as much as one [ __ ] day longer is it not worth going there is it not worth going there just to do that just to have that peace of mind that that whatever the [ __ ] you know what I'm talking about but anyway we're off on tangents now like I said we're gonna bring you guys in we're gonna take you guys and bring you in to here here excited about that you guys seem excited I can tell the shade screams shaking and [ __ ] you guys are just twitching the mission I can see it I can see it I can feel it already how you do it didn't get right up close personal image engine it's weird got a big nose all right here we go I'll give you guys a reference point there's the desk you can't see me and the desk at the same time I'm sorry okay but it's also much darker here because the light glares much better cannabis marijuana THC okay we have here in the half gram cartridge this is the C cell cartridge by Jupiter research we have here a point three gram disposable pin this is also by C cell we want to take the mouthpiece and want to take the other mouthpiece we want to keep these handy we want to keep these handy for one [ __ ] reason and one reason filing as it states in the directions if you are reading the goddamn directions it says right here immediately after filling install the mouthpiece and twist clockwise to tighten all right bayar to install the mouthpieces and two minutes are filling their result in leakage you see that [ __ ] do you see that [ __ ] so if you're filling up like [ __ ] 50 of these cartridges you need to [ __ ] think about that they stay right [ __ ] there they are to install the mouthpiece within two minutes of filling may result in leakage okay maybe you should do 10 [ __ ] cart runs or some [ __ ] right depending on your system how many do you want to do in a row before you [ __ ] timeout you know what I'm saying I mean you want a failure rate as low as possibly production quality as high as possible [ __ ] do I know I'm just some dude [ __ ] smoking weed right okay here we go now what again what I am utilizing at this particular point is some mango secret recipe distillate that chance they send the cheapest [ __ ] blend of trash he swept up off the floor but it's pretty clean so I'm pretty happy with it other than that here you guys go I just lost another viewer you guys upset about that I'm doing exactly what I'm title said I'd be doing guys ready here we go okay this right here the oil is plenty malleable as you can see thank goodness it's sitting in front of that [ __ ] heater alright we're gonna go right over to the tip there oh there we go and here we go now here is the C cell let me introduce Ian go around a little bit a little bit okay all right I do have some god dang dang do air right there but I'm gonna set this back up a furnace heater you guys know I'm talking about right screw that mouthpiece on very nice okay there we have our nominal C cell cartridge so this is the 0.5 grandma grammar all right so there's back over in front of the heater here let that warm up and here down in there now this is the point 3 this should be nicer I've never done one of these before it's the same basic deal to spray the oil in all right they say point three but if you're a [ __ ] jackass slapped me you can point forward a [ __ ] you think I [ __ ] can I just [ __ ] did I [ __ ] did okay all right wow I sure put a lot in there you screw the mouthpiece on just like that and right there you've got a very very sexy little [ __ ] unit right there what the [ __ ] do you thing about that all right that is sexy as [ __ ] this was in much oil Jupiter where the [ __ ] reflection on there Jupiter liquid X Jupiter research calm there's a phone number call them tell them John [ __ ] sent you they don't but it does I talked to somebody at the place they like yeah oh not bad not bad not bad I'm gonna set that over there right next to the other one and I know when they were built let that [ __ ] cycle slow and warm and go for a minute or two well I do another one don't you know and then we'll get that blowing some smoke what do you I say what do you say what do you say what do you say what'd he say all right message retracted holy [ __ ] oh he took all of this messages back that's weird Costra well there you go that's weird just imagine doing that I'm just kidding hey me [ __ ] painting style sorry you're painting and that sucks very badly very badly sucks sucks learn my favorite never go away we race no I care about the pain slowly oh there you go see there you go hello glitch on my and I basically missed that process hope it's only for me we're only doing this journey this was for almost 30 years no glitches for ii feel the Grinch is here too god damn it is that why everybody left yeah that's fine couldn't pissed off about that actually got kind of glitchy huh I lost a bunch of [ __ ] viewers too I bet right on well those of you that are still with me thank you so much I certainly do appreciate it I did the last of my dad's that I have in this jar and the last one my dad's that I have in this jar so I'm gonna have to open the dad's that I have in this jar so those of you that are going in to be in Seattle for the Seattle Hempfest make sure you hit us up we will definitely be excited to see any and all people that would like to come through well yeah we definitely see anybody that wants to come on through I've got like I said I've got my email ready to go we're gonna be smoking and dabbing all the way through the old Hempfest there it's gonna be awesome should be a whole lot of fun really really looking forward to it um last year was a good time this year here I've talked to some more people got a little bit more of a organized method to my madness going on so that will be extremely exciting [ __ ] it's quiet in here without that goddamn heater going I'll tell you that much right now I'm competing with the silence right now and the silence is deafening holy [ __ ] I could play some music you guys like that get some music going on here and get a couple of copyrights get a couple of copyright strikes going haven't gotten a single [ __ ] copyrights factory that you play some [ __ ] music Dudley do-right [ __ ] going on do Dukes to

my music right oh man why don't yes this is very very very very very very very good I like this a lot THC am eighty five point nine very very nice very nice super crystalline structure extremely high quality when the light comes through it or you can see there's no oh you guys can't see [ __ ] you like that hell yeah can't see [ __ ] I can see [ __ ] though it looks [ __ ] amazing it looks like it looks fine you guys have figured out all that really does is [ __ ] with the camera beyond goddamn words I gotta get a better camera I've got to get a better camera [ __ ] so dark it looks I don't know if I turn this down just a little bit I squat down if that [ __ ] helps it doesn't [ __ ] see I need to get a better camera I need better lighting if you'd like to support the channel patreon blah blah description underneath the blah blah blah [ __ ] blah okay here we go over and do another dab if your dad dog the Big Chill the other night Oh cause my parents sounds like they were just saying yeah yeah yeah there's music that exists that's that's for sure you guys name some that's a fact alright I appreciate classic ballads does that make sense to anybody cheers [Laughter] Wow that stuff is just so so very high-quality you know what I'm saying this goes back to what I was saying earlier about road trips this is just like I said this is $13 maybe $13 a gram for this the only real color in that is a little bit of almost no torches allowed no it's like laughs right that's why I'm gonna have an email I'm gonna have a silicone rig hopefully all right what music now well I just I gotta tell you I listen to horrible music my wife can inform you of my horrible music if she wants to Madonna she needs you Oh probably the reason our music some of the non carborundum another [ __ ] right yes at him fest but you can they have a bad check they have a bad check okay they have a bag check they checked your bag for torches they check your bag for rigs okay now what I normally take the Hempfest is to take bubbles my little bubbler my little bubbles I'll grab her for you hold on this is bubbles she's very very neat she's very cool she's a very awesome she's quite awesome and if you dump the water out of her and you invert her a hundred and eighty degrees upside down you can put right here the crotch of your pants right there this will add to your manliness by pushing your scrote all the way out and proud onto a platform like most will be able to see greatly this will shoot down one leg this will go down the other wait a little bit and it will be stable enough if your balls are holding it good did you sit there high and proud and nobody'll feel it unless they feel this far down from your crotch which they don't do that so all right I normally get this one in no problem I walk this one right through the old gates there and uh my torch I have a Newport blazer torch and I'm a bit of a mechanic a little bit so I adapted it a little bit to where it's about smaller than my fist and then I just take I take this okay then and I take my torch and away we go I'm very popular because very few other people have a torch and a rig in Hempfest so that's pretty neat but this right here this is my go case all right and all I need to do is replace this glass rig right here with a silicone rig and there's nothing in here that is not allowed in him fest by the way I'm press I've got a [ __ ] VIP press pass backstage everything pass so I'm not sure I even need to convert to silicone but just to abide by the rules I'm gonna make sure I get my goddamn rig in there one way or another you guarantee that [ __ ] um and now that's my go get I take that whenever I go anywhere hashtag mini nails the [ __ ] whatever and uh mini nail will be there they will be at Hempfest by the mainstage they should have two big banners coming up they're an amazing company they make an amazing product make sure you swing and see them Blake should be there biron should be there should be a lot of fun for everybody all right hello Colin dope how you doing me deep dip dip sorry if I'm blowing your name to [ __ ] there Colin where's clay Colin how's that wait what's responsive bosses text don't torture as an infant that's right new person like you videos without music I I don't I don't really appreciate music very much very loudly in the background sometimes I like something playing but that's just for whatever I'm being silent I tried that once I had [ __ ] I had Cheech and Chong playing in the background on the television while I was doing a video just so that I was whenever I was like they were saying since Shannon you can hear strategic Charlie and even if you couldn't hear the words you knew it was there in the car doing the thing in the road with the [ __ ] with the mayonnaise jar and the piss anyway um and then everybody gets a good laugh out of that boom they [ __ ] hit me so fast you'd think they were [ __ ] paid to do that [ __ ] yeah that [ __ ] boom boom bam bam BAM that can't happen brah how's my first year on [ __ ] YouTube and I was like sorry man I had no idea um Hempfest is in Seattle it is in it is in Seattle proper Merle Edwards Park Inn on the seafront bay front seaport whatever the [ __ ] it is on the coast of Seattle er out in Elliott Bay yeah that's it Elliott Bay back where highway 99 used to go just hop off the ferry turn left walk until you run into the [ __ ] hit fast man dollars to it that's what I'm gonna do that being said I really look forward to you all you guys being there and um and there should be a whole lot of fun oh you live in Californians do they got him fest in California cannabis cups in California matter of fact opinion where you live they got northern [ __ ] Hempfest southern folk and infest central [ __ ] infest cannabis cups from all over San Francisco has old [ __ ] cannabis cup Oh goddamn nine yards man I'm oh yeah [ __ ] I guarantee it just felt good a Google cannabis cup near Anaheim and that should come up like a [ __ ] you have it [ __ ] Northern California's some of the best because Humboldt all that [ __ ] but anyway back to why we're all on here this thing has a title the title said some [ __ ] and that's what some [ __ ] and the title said it was talking about cartridges it was talking about putting cannabis oil in vapor cartridges well friends this right here it's cannabis oil this right here is the tube cannabis oil came in this is the vapor cartridges right here you got one vapor cartridge that's permanently installed on a battery it's called a disposable go I just made that [ __ ] up this is a liquid ex by Jupiter research C cell to be exact the other one is a liquid sakes glass cartridge this is a C cell cartridge from smore the brand C cell they are the main distributor of C cells more devices so that being said we are going to give a bit of a pull on it it's pretty cool how that lights up I don't want to draw on this son-of-a-bitch too fast I think I filled the other one up first this one has a preheat this is that mango I was talking about so these cartridges I have found personally and all the devices that I put them in like this magic 7/10 right here from bat mod it's not too bad I think it runs about 3-4 this Drago right here from a mod it's pretty cool it's got one of them resin [ __ ] faces on it you said resin on Hertz light absorbing [ __ ] doesn't matter but uh this goes from like 2.4 up right this right here this has variable voltage this goes from 3.4 up right this one here and this is variable voltage from 2.6 and up yeah this one here and it doesn't say I'm pretty sure this one is like 3.2 and up and then this one here this says it has variable voltage but it doesn't say what it is this is the the air space so I have found while testing all these different batteries to this what's [ __ ] new these C cell liquid 6 510 thread glass cartridges right here they work best up to about 3 point 4 volts over that you start getting a burnt flavor that continues through the life of the cartridge if you hold the battery down for a long draw that's that's just what it is that's what it is that's not saying that the cartridge is no good that's saying that the cartridge is so efficient it vaporizes oil perfectly well at two point four to three point four degrees or volts it doesn't need four point five volts to activate this cartridge if it does then you will burn your cartridge that's just something to say and don't whenever you run this this cartridge through like I had one I ran through a uh I ran through a CB d5 battery it was a two battery kinda like this one right here alright and it wasn't clear on the voltages so I wasn't sure what the voltage was well I ran my cartridge to it it burned my cartridge like you could taste if it tasted bird to [ __ ] and it didn't taste like that just before so I took the mouthpiece off I drew the oil out I'll put the oil into another cartridge a brand new cartridge and the oil tasted good again it was definitely the burn cartridge and it was telling that battery we have not used that battery since because that didn't have clear clear instructions for the voltages I didn't even review that battery pissed me off so much I didn't want you guys to buy it and then not [ __ ] realize that but anyway that is what that is these these these are very high quality cartridges they can be bought at the link in the description Bay part smart comm if you click down there click that link go in there it'll take you to the home page looking cartridges look for parts alright this right here I don't know if it's drawn to very good I'm half we worried about it I don't want to burn up the cartridge because this is the first woman I've ever had but it shouldn't take any longer than the [ __ ] another one they're the same [ __ ] technology right not fully tasting the oil just yet tasting a little bit of something but it doesn't taste like it's possibly a good thing I don't know there are a couple bubbles but none of them are actually over the holes see that one is above the hole so I'll let it saturate for as long as it says they let it saturate so I'm pretty excited about it hopefully it works good we're trying more time then I'm going to kick the [ __ ] out of here and I'll let you know how this goes on Monday morning on the wake and bake have you seen any thank you so much me okay there was some there was some mango there you go alright I'm being a little bit of a [ __ ] with the goddamn thing because I don't want to burn it up this one here is completely contained I'm not even sure I think the only hair draw is that little tiny [ __ ] that little [ __ ] right there you can barely see that little rectangle right there there we go oh yeah see now she's born that's what I need to do it needed to get warm you get one view that well there we go all right well that's pretty good there that actually cloud it out really nice there at the end there's a big-ass [ __ ] bubble right there though someone let that summits rise up out of there so there you have it uh what am i goddamn glitter of all kinds of [ __ ] focus over there um got some videos coming up with some of this [ __ ] over here just let you guys know and as always say Kinkos I certainly will do that yes I did sir Locke I got this liquid x class cartridge had an event so I'm trying that out I think it's gonna be super cool all right that being said you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in I really do appreciate it we will see you bright and early Monday morning on my sister channel wake and bake with C&C once again thank you so much y'all have an absolutely wonderful day peace", "ttL9Q67w7Nk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my name is Stefan from the pottery I'm here today to tell you a little bit about ascend Ravana's top-line oil the one that I like right now is tangerine dream the reason I like this one so much right now it's testing 89% active cannabinoids and it's actually testing 84% for THC which is really nice this one specifically is a really good sativa unlike most sativas though it doesn't make you feel too jittery it's very relaxing so for instance I like using this one when I play music sometimes really good for that you can be social on it it's very nice so and if you guys are looking to try it and come on down to the pottery at anytime comment below with your favorite strange chip [Music]", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you subscribe this delivery should be the last delivery for the giveaway the 420

guys are toking on something good um and keep on toking my friends", "9HLGL5fEt2k": "[Music] hi guys I'm van Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are doing a helpful Pro tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel

Oregon made the package is made 400 side plant base yeah I like that it's very serious about the environment so that's your your cart it came with a cap [Music] so with the sativa dominant strain and what do I get from it so piney woodsy kind of tastes like it's really again giving me a herb well I think all of so that what I'm getting from it I got notes is the earthy pine woodsy taste all them to come together this is giving you a look at her beau blend you know when I first started very benign I was like okay this is a little it's kind of little peppery but not so much so I put it more towards to her beau side and for me what it is this a cheaper strain so I found myself to be very focused very focused and I chose us in particular because I was doing before I was getting ready for work and I'm like you know I let me not mess up and do something that's not put me to sleep now I would definitely recommend this if you're about to do some work whether it be gardening whether it be school work because like I said for me it has has it had me focused and I like that and this is something I would do definitely in the morning yeah before I start my day definitely we recommend again it's an earthy Pineywoods he kinda tastes enjoyable you want aces this um see like lesson pressing in here putting it yeah somebody answer I see we burn in your throat yeah yeah this is not this doesn't bring it though that's important so it's smooth yeah it doesn't burn your throat and again this one for me it's just a cheaper so but against the TV affects people differently some people

operating officer of honeystick and today we are bringing you guys the just batteries twist battery which is a project that honeystick did in collaboration with just cbd one of the leading producers of cbd and hemp products so i was speaking with just cbd management when we had this idea to go in on this endeavor and what we said is we wanted to create an awesome twist battery that works well with cbd carts and to make it really stylish offer some cool color options but what's the key thing is to make it really affordable so you can actually get this twist battery that's a high capacity high powered battery very good quality covered by both of our companies warranties on vapehoneystick.com and also just cbdstore.com and i'll drop those uh those two links into the description you can get them on there for the low price of 9.99 so below 10 bucks is going to get you a super high quality battery from reputable companies that have a warranty on them and this isn't your gas station convenience store battery this is still a good high performance battery now the main thing that i want to focus on because it is a very similar informant function to our honey stick twist battery that we offer so i'm just going to do a real brief run through of the features and the functionality and then the main thing that i want to focus on are the awesome colors and packaging that we put together and now this twist batteries will work great with your um pre-filled tanks 510 tanks that you get from the dispensaries from cbd stores all over anything that's a 510 slim tank is going to work well with this thing it's also going to work well with slim wax and dab applications things like our silencers and wax tanks and definitely be a very good reliable power plant for those so once we do just a real brief preview there of what options we have that you guys are watching now i'm gonna run through the form of functionality and the instructions for this just batteries battery so for the just batteries you're gonna see you have the button right here you're going to have the twister knob right there each one of these kits is going to come with a charger included so for 9.99 you are fully turnkey minus the cartridge that you would pick up at your dispensary or your online cbd store now before you get started you're going to want to make sure this battery is charged if a battery is completely drained it could take you about two hours to charge the battery all you do is take the charge that's provided you're going to screw it in and you are going to make sure to get this onto a charger now i always warn everybody when you're looking for a charger for this stick to desktop computers and non-apple wall adapters stay away from any apple adapters and also stay away from rapid chargers laptop computers or power banks because they won't properly charge a device or might not charge at all so that's a very common troubleshooting question that we get now the first thing that you're going to do is get this on the charger light over here when you plug it in is going to blink while it's charging then it's going to go solid which is the light that's around the led it's going to go solid now to turn the battery on once it's charged so i'd show you the example the led you'll click it five times repeatedly rapidly one two three four five and as you see it blinks up and as you see it is green when i push it now what does that green mean this battery is sophisticated enough to where it has power level indication so when you push on your vaping and the light around there's green that means that you're running basically a full charge once you get down to about a half charge that green is going to turn from green to an amber that's going to mean you're running half a charge or below you probably want to start thinking about charging your battery pretty soon then when your battery is close to being you know needing a charge or dead for that for that word um you are gonna it's gonna turn red now once it turns red that means get this thing on a charger you got a couple hits left so that has a good power indication level so you know when this thing's going to need a charge you're not going to get hit with just a multiple blink no you know surprise power adjustment if we zoom in real close you see you have a little twister knob now you have a little twister knob and you also have numbers going around the battery now this goes all the way up to four volts as you can see there's a little uh divot there in the twister now whatever that little divot thing there number that lines up with means that's the power setting that you're on and you can do that for example right now i'm going to just move it on over to 3.5 so you can see and you can scroll it all the way down to the minimum which is 2 volts now we made the minimum 2 volts it's because we've been getting a lot of demand from people who are now into this low voltage vaping and these ultra low resistance carts that need very very low inputs to vape properly to give you good flavor and activation maintain terpenes and cbd profiles so we want to make sure you have a very nice low starting point from 2 volts but you can bang with the best of them at 4 volts okay which means you can bang out some serious power out of out of these carts to give you guys some monster rips out of standard five-time carts now this battery does have preheat functionality which means especially for cold weather climates you uh you might have a cartridge that's a little seized up needs a little low voltage a little warm up to get it going when the battery is on what you're gonna do is you're gonna go ahead and push this button two times quickly and fast i'll do it right now and what you'll see is you'll see the color light up blue rainbow it's changing colors that means it's preheating at any given point during that time you can push the button one time you're exiting preheat mode once your cartridge is preheated this is mainly for colder climates or cartridges that have gunked up or things like that so since we've gone through this battery the form and the functions let's run through and show you guys a 360 of each one of the colors just so you see what you would be purchasing and what your options are with this amazing battery let's start off all the way over here and check out our slate gray now the slate gray is a matte color very deep gray if you don't look closer it's not under the right light you might even think that it's black i mean this is what this is the same paint that they're putting on those beautiful expensive mercedes and bentleys those amgs those g wagons they are beautiful matte colored slate paint i think this is very stylish battery very clean if you want something more plain we can transition over to the black battery you're gonna have to edit that out how long does that go for you go over to the black battery let's do a nice little 360 of that now this is a matte black it's pretty flat but it does have a really nice pop to it you see of the just batteries insignia there the next color that we have is a matte gold so it's not a sparkly gold it's matte but it has this nice champagne deep champagne finish to it definitely a very nice unique option there on a color then we have a shiny rose gold right here i want to make sure we get it in the right light so you see that it's not like a stainless because it's like a kind of like a copper like if you had an ultra polished you know penny probably want to dim the lights to show so there that is your rose gold and again you guys will have some really nice detailed pictures on both the the just cbd store and the vape honey stick website then you have a matte silver again it's not a metallic or polished it's a nice matte silver no real sparkles but a real nice uh finish on the paint there and then for those who want more of a shiny silver we have the full stainless which is a brushed stainless steel finish nice and reflective the way that they're coated they're not really going to fingerprint up and get dirty so this is really nice clean cut for that metallic look and then we go over to a blue this is a nice aqua that's very similar to our our honey stick blue that's a very popular color that we wanted to uh to emulate here because we have a lot of fans of this blue color and then lastly we have a nice red we wanted to make it shiny to look like your favorite red sports car or fire engine style this is a really nice deep clean red let's do a nice little 360 here you see that just battery insignia the twister so as you guys can see for ten dollar for under ten dollars on these batteries you cannot go wrong at that price with getting a high quality battery that that has really nice finishes and looks for them that'll power up your 510 thread carts you have endless options on the colors here very classy very good functionality reliable and again warrantied by our companies for

the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it do you like it do you not like it what do you think you think I'm right

really cold and empties out the water anyways dude let's get into the what i want to do today about the review for playing jane i definitely have some fire right here in the car i kind of tried it already but i'm gonna try it again but i definitely love let me see if i give you a closer look at it no nothing okay there it goes so sorry about the glare let me see i could just okay so this is the plain jane girl scout cookies 750 milligram uh cbd so this i believe is one gram oh it's okay i don't know this it looks like a one gram cart whatever um but anyways i'm gonna open this up guys because i'm like definitely gonna be smoking this or vaping it i should say um let's see if it has a smell to it like it almost it almost like to be honest whatever like this is one of the cbd carbs oh sorry i'm not zoomed in on myself okay let me see if i could show you all closer look at it no nope [Music] okay there it goes so it looks like a record like a regular you know one of the descartes but what's cool about this is that look at it see that bubble right there most cbd carts are going to like flow to the top with you know in like half a second but this one is very very thick um it's very um yeah look at that [ __ ] dude like it looks like a thc card to be honest like it's crazy it's only 30 dollars like most people that sell cbd carts and want to charge between like 40 to 50 dollars whatever um some people want to charge 25 for like a half a gram like um honestly whatever like this is definitely some like okay i'm gonna try my i'm gonna try it on my relaxo it's a m9 from relaxotec um it's cool because it has like the the pod system cart which you can fit pod systems and then you can put uh the t 510 thread whatever so anyways guys yeah this is the review on uh plain jane girl scout cookie and um definitely i tried it out already whatever i'm glad i could take it out it looks like it's using um a ceramic coil i mean a ceramic um tip or whatever i think might be ceramic coil inside too but all right guys let me get into it i've been talking to that much but it definitely it smells really good and like it just has a feel of a tac card like it's ridiculous okay anyways oh [ __ ] it wasn't on whoops sorry about that guys okay okay sorry i have to change the settings real quick you know green blue red all that [ __ ] wow wow okay so definitely get some very good vape amount of like cloud smoke whatever a cloud bait that you get is definitely very nice um the taste of it's very very uh very s subtle but it's there and it's very sweet um it it tastes like it's like concentrated cbd and terps honestly whatever like that's you definitely get the terps and uh that's the cbd whatever um like it is not harsh in the throat at all whatever is very very smooth um very it tastes very pure like it's just the two ingredients whatever that's supposed to be there yeah you definitely you get that girl scout cookie taste like you definitely get that like like a sweet like it's kind of hard to describe whatever it just tastes really good like honestly that's pretty cool that they [ __ ] like they got i believe this is how cbd cards should be and like so far whatever my favorite was a farm life and um black water had a good like thc eight um but it was half a gram and no terps they just added terps to their stuff so i haven't tried that yet but at the moment i believe this plain jam was gonna be my top choice um the farm life had some good flavor and stuff and but the crystals um felt like it took up a lot of space whatever so i believe there's not enough like juicing that's supposed to be in there um but um this one is definitely it just feels like a thc car which i really like whatever it's very thick but it this is definitely cbd it's definitely 100 legal and um but it just it just to me it has like a feel like how thick it is and the way the color uh the taste and everything it just [ __ ] it's the closest you're gonna get from a t if you're gonna switch from a thc card to cbd whatever and like not have a big difference it's definitely i would i would definitely recommend this guys um [ __ ] 9.5 out of 10 like honestly like this fire um i like the fact that they use the ceramic white coil whatever like uh the metal one's pretty good but i i prefer the ceramic because um excuse me we're burping up tea um i feel that like these type of ceramic ones whatever if they do have a ceramic coil then like it doesn't um like the metal ones or something that the oil will get real like thick and like like dark colored and i feel like it has a higher chance of it burning the coil and then from there it's you know whatever your vape is going to taste like [ __ ] but the ceramico i never had any issues with it i always got to the end no discolorations and definitely the smell taste the smell and the the taste of it didn't change so um yeah guys anyways that like i said i recommend this i'll leave the links down below for instagram and their website they're definitely a fire ass company um some you know like they have some very good products on cbd whatever when it comes to flower they just i think they just added lotions and solvents i don't know what to call them um i forgot what the name of it is but i think it's some kind of like i don't know it's something to be honest whatever i don't really use it whatever so i don't know too much about that thing might be like for like chapstick or your skin or something but anyways um yeah they're definitely always adding new products they're always like you know changing up stuff whatever adding new strains every [ __ ] couple weeks i see a new strain on their on their website so that's why i saw the cat's meow make sure to go check out that with that

the inhalation tutorial now inhalation can mean smoking or vaporizing but we don't recommend smoking as the health hazards are unclear so our focus today is going to be vaporization vaporisation often also referred to as just vaping is when the cannabis bud or concentrate is heated to a point at which it can turn into vapor and be inhaled but not to a temperature where it burns the actual plant material many people use vaporization for immediate relief of acute pain migraines nausea or trouble falling asleep among other symptoms it can also be used as a lifestyle moderator enhancing relaxation potentially decreasing anxiety as well as for just simple enjoyment some things to be aware of as you vaporize are that the onset time is generally immediate traits that are vaporized can have additives at times and any additive can at the very least introduce impurities and at worst create health risk one common additive is propylene glycol and recent studies do show that it could not be very good for your health so just know what's in your medicine especially if you choose a concentrate like the ones found in vape cartridges as with all cannabis medicine it's best to store cannabis away from any heat source and out of the Sun so if practical just keep it in your refrigerator vaporizers can vary widely in shapes sizes cost and quality so just remember that when choosing which vaporizer to buy the technology behind vaporization can vary as well popular heat sources include an electric element convection or even induction heating all of these have their pros as well as their cons potentially today we're going to focus on vaporizers that uses bud flowers as well as talk about vape pens which are just a very common way to vaporize because of their accessibility and discreteness we won't demonstrate a desktop vaporizer but this is actually a great option because it allows you to adjust the temperature that you're vaporizing for a list of recommended high quality products and discounts go to the resource section of our website alright let's jump into the demo so you can get acquainted with vaporizers so let's talk a little bit about vaporization but before we get into these products whether we have in front of us I want to touch on the technology that's used because of any of these intake methods the vaporization is really the only one that directly uses technology now it does so because it has to heat the product whether it's a bud or concentrate up to a certain temperature where it can actually turn into vapor and be inhaled that is vaporization but as we've said not to a temperature where it's burning the plant material or the concentrate and therefore is different from smoking now in order to heat the substance it has to use some type of element some of the vaporizers like this vape in here use an electric technology they have something like a coil it gets heated heats the concentrate to go into your body this vaporizer uses a convection oven to heat a bud or flower - then vaporize and be inhaled the technology that each vaporizer uses doesn't necessarily have a direct benefit or disadvantage for your health but certain technologies can be cleaner than others and heat more evenly so just pay attention to that and if you want to eat out a little bit you can educate yourself on the array of technologies including electric convection or even induction technologies used within these vaporizers that are both portable and what we call desktop let's start first with this vaporizer here this is a portable vaporizer that uses convection technology as you can see this vaporizer uses bud or flower you pack the flower into the small oven cover it and it uses technology to then heat that and you can inhale the vapor generally to get the medicine in there you want to do it without disturbing or crushing the trichomes which really hold the cannabinoids and turbines within the plant without disturbing them as much as possible and that's why we use a grinder now a grinder has metal spokes inside of it and it grinds the butter flour it just all pieces so that it can be both packed and heated more evenly now let's move on to a vape pen this is a very popular form of a vaporizer as you can see it's very discreet and extremely portable as you can also see it uses a different type of medicine from this flower vaporizer that I just showed you it uses a concentrate now these are generally referred to as vaporizing cartridges or vape cartridges you buy them separately it's gonna take it apart for you and show you how it works this is the battery and this is the cartridge the cartridge obviously is what contains your medicine these can be replaced over time and used with the battery which is recharged in general some batteries have a button on it to heat and some you just heat by inhalation only now things to keep in mind when using a vape pen is that you can't particularly know your medicine as intimately as when you have a bud for example you can't smell it directly and sometimes you just don't know as much of what's in your medicine so that's where you really want to get to know your producer and you want to have very clear labeling on your product before you take it so you want to know what the cannabinoid ratios are and what other elements are in this cartridge some producers add other elements into the vape cartridge that are not medicine related now this is for various reasons they may want to allow the actual medicine to be vaporized more easily and that product for example propylene glycol is one of them allows for a little bit easier consistency when heated the other is to make it last longer or to carry a flavor profile for example a little bit more easily so that you can enjoy it so there's various reasons why people use additives in to vape cartridges but we recommend if possible to just use pure as pure as possible is really best so get to know your producer get to know where you're getting your medicine from know your cannabinoid profiles and know if there's any other products besides cannabis in your vape cartridges so as with any intake method really pay attention to what you're dosing is the great thing about vaporizers is that it's a little bit easier to incrementally dose given that the effect is generally immediate and you can control your own dosing by how hard you inhale and how long you inhale for as with everything we recommend starting low and going slow that means taking a small inhale for a short period of time doing a sensing exercise seeing how you feel it's really easy with vaporization because it's immediate and then if you do need more of an effect or want more of that medicine you can go ahead and go to the second dose that way so just be cognizant of how hard you're inhaling and how long you inhale for when using vaporizers [Music]", "eC4XsUNW2_I": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to a TC spot

cartridge kit is produced by Benna leaves out of columbus ohio this cartridge comes with both a medical cannabis oil cartridge for vaporization as well as the disposable vaping unit itself like all disposable cannabis oil kits the pen once used can simply be discarded this kit does not include a charger which isn't fortunate sometimes pens can run out of battery before the product is completely cashed packaging for Ben alleles is okay the vape kit comes packed in a sealed black pouch labeling is easy to read and the pouch is modestly easy to open the pen itself is a little more frustrating Venna leaves took this opportunity to place their logo and a THC warning on the vapes battery though I understand the methodology this removes any discretion a patient may have when vaping I ended up actually peeling the Ben aliefs logo off for more discretion in terms of taste Benna leaves Gaia is pretty average the flavor is neither bad nor is it really very memorable there's a strong citrus currant that provides an enjoyable mix of orange and lemon notes this flavor leans less sugary and more akin to a citrus rind with an occasional bitter bite medicinally vape pens don't always do the trick for my personal needs however I intend to find that pens are quite excellent for relaxation providing a smooth experience with only mild euphoria and Gaia provides exactly that a relaxing way to de-stress after a tough day though perhaps not as potent for me as some of the other oils I've tried on the ohio market i enjoy the soothing sensations on my back and abdomen that this vape provided overall been a leaves gaia is a dependable oil that's mild on flavor and euphoria rather it relaxes indie stresses while offering strong citrus notes to soothe the senses if you're a vape enthusiast Benna leaves gaia is worth a try final rating three point eight out of five be sure to LIKE and subscribe below or share this video on reddit or social media and don't forget to visit WWF or 2000 HIO

steezy premium concentrated vaporizer cartridges and pens before we get started with the review I would like to thank the guys at steezy for sending out the cartridges that we're using today and setting up this review if you'd like to learn where to purchase them or to learn more about them please check out Steve's e-comm or find them on weed Maps now let's get started here's the unboxing of the steezy starter pen kit this is the pen that you will need if you're going to use any of the steezy cartridges inside of the box with the pen you have an owner's manual instructions warranty information you also have a USB charging cable and the steezy vaporizer unit itself and you can see we have a real simple kit there nice-looking little vaporizer unit but of course you're also going to need a cartridge that we're gonna unbox one of the indica biscotti and inside of the cartridges you will find also an owner's manual to tell you how to use it as well as the cartridge itself and you had you can say this is where the magic happens with this product here and we'll get it and talk more about the oil inside of these cartridges in just a second but first let's take a closer look at the pen and the cartridges themselves the pen is actually metal I thought it was plastic but upon inspection it's actually a nice metal pen there you've got the microUSB charging cable in the bottom and at the top you have the elements or the connectors that will connect it to the actual cartridges it's a really nice shape and design and it's very very small and stealthy it fits right in the palm of your hand and it's very light and you can see at the bottom of the carpet cartridges there's a little cap that comes off and that shows you where the connections is that'll connect it to the device you plug it into device the device flashes a couple of times blue there's also a light at the bottom on the heel of device and I'm not sure if it's intended but that cap that was on the bottom makes a perfect little dust cover to keep the land out of it and so yeah that that's pretty much it on the device list now to get to the most fun part of it at this little usage and the testing of the steezy concentrate pin first you're gonna charge it up that blue light there will be red while it's charging it once it's fully charged it turns blue you know it's fully charged and then comes the hard part and isn't making a decision we had 12 different flavors to choose from we had a for each of the indica as the hybrids and the sativas three or four of those were actually flavored as well but most of them were just strained specific and I tell you what they taste spot-on this is some of the best taste and cleanest wax I've hit it's a very very enjoyable experience the taste is smooth you can get a big hit if you inhale for a minute it does after about 10 seconds or so it will automatically cut off but believe me you'll have plenty of big enough hit for maximum head this pin is really great it's so easy to use the taste was incredible on all 12 of those different strains believe me I've tested them all and they're really amazing they're a distill it so they're out 90% THC and man you can really feel it let's go to the pros and cons oh the pros are that is so super easy to use it it's very clean of all these cartridges I had there was no leaks no breaks or any kind of problems with any of the cartridges the taste is amazing you can get big hits or you can get small hits and it's very strange specific no additives and the extract themselves cons are the battery life is a little short and the packaging on the cartridges tastes a little bit like or smells like on the issue anyway I still think it's great I'm gonna give it 4.5 stars out of 5 it's amazing so if you are in the market in California you can please check out Steve's EECOM that's st III is UI comm and you can find out where you can purchase those and you can also look them up on weed maps under

Nick from disk have a pen and today we're going to tell you about the difference between using a ceramic made cartridge and a cotton wick baked cartridge [Music] alright guys so when you have your 510 threaded cartridges this guy or this guy you're gonna have two types one of them is going to be a cotton whip like this and one of them will be a ceramic heating element like this guy well they both have their advantages and disadvantages if you're trying to do a lower voltage meaning the lower power setting you want to go with the cotton cartridge they can't handle such a high voltage from the battery which would mean you know if you know especially if you have one of the ones that are adjustable where you can turn it up or down you're gonna want to keep at a minimal setting because if you put too much power into one of these guys you risk burning it out early or you know you could turn your juice dark and black because it just stresses the heating element out too much now with our other guy these ceramic these are gonna be a little more up to date where you're gonna be able to run them at a higher setting not super high but with the spinner batteries or the adjustable voltage batteries you'll definitely be able to turn it up a little higher and will give you a little more of a kick with your v the way you can tell the difference is if you look inside the barrel of this one the cotton one you can see a little cotton poking out at the top of it as opposed to the ceramic where you have kind of a cage sitting down on it onto it and you'll have some wick holes where you'll see where the juice will flow in both of them are gonna be 510 threaded and both are gonna be acceptable for batteries like this so you know again just to make sure if you're adjusting you're gonna want to have a ceramic type that'll let you turn your battery up a little higher we recommend a voltage no real higher than about 4 volts that should be the highest you go if he's something a little higher but take it bit by bit and then if you're using a traditional cotton cartridge that's gonna want to stay at a minimum about 3.7 volts you don't really want to turn it up much higher than that and obviously the question too is well what if my battery doesn't adjust well then you're fine for both you know that's going to run at a lower setting that'll be acceptable for both types so if you

jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my tolerance is so high they gotta take like [ __ ] point for size dad's and I'm like damn bro you you literally could [ __ ] kill the whole Grammy like four or five dads you know for them it's just like whatever and I'm like but anyways everybody again I hope you guys are enjoying these videos man these are all just reviews you know there's literally just educational videos like I'm not not convincing anybody to go smoke or anything like that this is just for people that already smoke cannabis users you know cannabis patients just for the knowledge you know just a relaxing perfect high you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them

that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know

down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit because I used two views that [ __ ] and I would wake up like three four in the morning cough my lungs out it was everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this review makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe click that Bell so you guys get notified every time we upload let me know the comments I'm blowed done when you guys click the Bell I give you guys a shout out anyway I mean Hayden and here we have this [ __ ] ro it's kind of dope huh yeah I'm not to take the pic like this oh nice and I approve this is far tastes good too", "UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "tj5L-tOIUz4": "hey guys this dab connection we're checking out the roots broad-spectrum disposables and these is the th oo one the standard C self disposable for half grams it's similar to the city trees disposable as far as hardware and so if I'm really liking these been using these for a while they're probably coming towards the end which was and typically try to review them this was a hybrid this was an indica and the hybrid I believe was per Digium and the indica Master Kush I'm gonna take a hit off it just you can see it hardware hits good of course the disposals not gonna hit as hard as like the vessel battery on a cartridge but for disposables I like this and the one they use on The Weekender the great thing about this is the effects so it's they call it a whole plant broad spectrum also broad spectrum and I guess that has something to do with like using the whole plant in the process or something but the effects is interesting so these don't really feel like a regular cart when you hit it it feels like a very strong version of a very good like hash joint and I'm not sure of your militants but joints made with like very premium water hash fact there's a place called Nirvana in West LA that used to sell it like premium water hash that's like made with nugs is kind of what this tastes like and kind of what the effects are like as well it's very relaxing yet still energizing it just feels more kind of like you smoked the joint but that was really strong and you really can't go wrong with that and another great roots product I mean their cartridge right now we list as the best best cartridge in Nevada and I got to say two thumbs up for these definitely a great product and give me another hit here yeah the master Chris tastes amazing the predicament days bad either but that master Kosh is an amazing taste there we go roots broad spectrum thanks for watching guys is dad connection and have a great week", "gA_u309IDA8": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing an avatar or avitas cured resin a cartridge all avatars as far as i know are single origin extracts and they make um distillates cured resin and live resin carts and pax pods as well so they're super high and super high quality from what i've seen so i haven't tried one before just do the price tag but i've been wanting to try one for a while so here's here it is and i'll give you a close-up and then try it out and let you know what i think [Music] let's try this thing out and read it um talk about it so forth so this is made by avatars which as i said seems to be a pretty high-end brand i've wanted to try them for some time um the strain is cherry og which i looked into it seems to be a mix of cherry thai afghan and lost coast og which all seem to be pretty old strains so this might be a fairly old strain as well this is single origin hybrid cured resin meaning it all comes from same grow of cherry og you're not getting a bunch of different growers people's cherry og so that adds to the price tag of these carts that's pretty exciting though uh that just makes you feel that much safer with what you're getting and know this proper um the strain and everything about it really it is cured resin i opted for cured resin over live resin because i'm actually one of the probably one of the few people who i think i like cured resin more than um lime resin i like i feel like generally a more complex taste and it has more more terpenes that live resin is usually overshadowed by like beta miracin pint um limonene a couple others like that where some of the heavier ones seem to stick around in the curing process and get more interesting ones so anyways um very nice looking packaging as you can see very sharp um these are i think 40 recreationally um i got mine i think it was like that'd be like 32 med and then i got 25 off that bringing it down to like i don't know what uh eight dollars off that twenty four dollars or so i know it's like 36 for the live resin then a little cheaper than both of these for they also have ultra which i think are distillate carts all of them are single source they're all a little pricey they all look really good so that's probably part of it oh okay let's get on the back first on the back you got cherry og one gram thc coming in at 82.3 percent or 823 milligrams for a container cbd is at loq um you've got 10 total terpenes in this and um okay and then you got thirty percent of that ten percent is beta cardiophiline i guess i'll just say that um what it is of the total thing it should be three percent beta cardiophiline one point nine percent selenidine one point one percent pinene one percent limonene one percent cedrol c-e-d-r-o-l i'm not familiar with that one that's exciting um nine point zero point nine percent humulene zero point six percent alpha cedrine and then alph um zero point five percent alpha terpenial so as you can see pretty complex and also a lot more terps that you don't really see so often oh weird anyways that's someone going down the street that's cool so this was made on what is seven um march april may june okay july i'm terrible with months sorry this was made on july 13th 2020 and tested on july 15th a little bit older than the other cards i've been getting but still not old at all really in the in cards i start wearing one they're about like a year older um you got light scale labs report id they even have the report id on here so you can look up their um lab reports how cool is that um and then they got the uid so you got everything there all the general info a lot of info on the terpenes which i like and potentially more if you look at light scale labs who they run a lot of tests or a test for a lot of companies around here a lot of the good ones especially i see use light scale labs and some lower end ones we'll use rose city but i don't think there's any real like correlation uh i think it's just a lot of lower end companies have a lot of like lines and brands like mana and lovely and um a lot of things like that so they probably just use the same people usually all right so when you open this up you got this which is super cool i probably should have showed you a close-up but i'll take a picture of it and post it in here too um let's see if focusing helps at all not too much but that's all right so what it says says avatars natural additive and flavoring free no pg vg or peg which is um okay i don't know i just uh don't remember the what that stands for but it's often used in vape vape juices and whatnot that says for best results store upright at 65 to 75 fahrenheit ensure the battery is fully charged for best taste use a 3.7 volt battery not recommended for refilling okay um and then you got same stuff but in like a little picture form got full battery 3.7 volts i think that's just the cart with a little up arrow saying store it up right and then at 65 to 75 degrees fahrenheit and then you also get this interesting thing definitely will know if you ever got a fake if anyone tried to fake these because these are pretty intricate little packages so you got that which kind of holds it up oh wow i'm gonna have to use scissors which luckily i have some right by yeah it looks like you gotta use scissors to open this there's really no easy way to open that might be able to find a way but i don't really see the need to so i'll just slice that and here you are really beautiful oil in there very very clean looking i know nothing wants to focus on this but that's alright and i'll take that sticker off like i always do very nice looking looks vaguely cloudy on the camera but it doesn't look like that in real life it's very very clear so again you get a jupiter c cell high quality c c-cell very no leaks or anything like that so all good jupiter is always fitting my vessel jupiter's fitting everything i swear those are some of the best cartridges you can get all right so it says for best results 3.7 volts which i'm 99 sure is going to be the um the middle setting on my vessel so let's try this out cherry og beautiful vapor production as usual with jupiter c cells that taste is so good damn that is a good good card right there it's already one of my favorites right now that's so good just an effect on everything so far or we'll see about effects i mean but like taste and vapor production that's smooth in the lungs and everything wow that is a solid cart high quality right there these might be like my new favorites a little pricey so it's hard to grab them as often but that is seriously good so it's a pretty clear taste too that's when you get i guess i don't know if it's from like single origin or just the quality of the production or what but i mean i have no problem like getting a good taste off that very very much like you got a very like earthy taste to it i lean heavily for earthy on this one which is weird it says it's mostly cardio filling um let me get that yeah now it's kind of like a not not very spicy because all the other terps and i don't know if it being cured matters at all but it's not a very spicy but it's very like earthy not very herbal but like very earthy um and then you got some nice cherry undertones see where they get the cherry from um yes i'm just like sweet cherry tom um i would say cherry because like usually there is definitely like a berry taste i'm not quite sure what ter what terpene it is but there's definitely like a berry taste that cannabis can produce and it usually reminds me of blueberry or like rasp kind of like raspberry but it's definitely like a heavier berry like a blue or something like that but this one's a lot sweeter and like a light way so it definitely reminds me of cherry i mean you can just see the vapor production on that that is intense it's got it they got it dialed in for 3.7 volts for sure that smells so good too that just like very light cherry after like an herbal tone or i mean a earthy tone that's crazy how clear that is so you know i buy a lot of i don't buy like a lot of low end cards except for the hushes but i don't expect flavor from those but these are just a whole whole different level um i didn't think about it till afterwards but these i think 40 bucks wreck we're a half gram these are four grams but we're a half gram half rock hash rosin cards i think it's live hash rosin that goes for 45 so next time i'm gonna buy one of these i might just go for a half gram live rosin to really get the best cart because but otherwise i think solventless these are some of the best cards their live resin cards are probably incredible um but i prefer cured resin as i said all right i'm close this video out thanks for watching everybody thank you avatar for making beautiful beautiful oils and great extracts like and subscribe um click the notification i don't know if you can do that do all this stuff

welcome to cat abases today we answer the question what is a box behind fate this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can get a free gift with a code rough two on any product you purchased there including the Steam Cloud box mod like we used in the video today so what is a box mod vape box mod vapes are essentially vaporizers with advanced features and high-capacity batteries you get extra long life for those batteries and the extended power range that it needs to accommodate large tanks for ecig juice and also for the large puffs that many serious vapors chase after it was actually the ecig market that first popularized box mod vaporizers but because they're also great for travel with their big batteries and because they're powerful and will operate the numerous attachments for cannabis they're also growing in popularity with marijuana users as well you could find attachments for using dry herb wax as well as the THC and CBD oils and they're also compatible with almost all of the 510 thread cartridges so why would you choose a box mod vape for one of the big removable batteries make it easy to replace or upgrade the batteries you can also keep a spare battery charged making it great for long trips and for extended use the ability to have such a wide variable wattage range allows you to use the large tanks with the custom wrapped coils the things that the serious papers and the cloud chasers go after but it also allows you to lower down the wattage to use it with the smaller cartridges and coils so you have really maximum compatibility box mods really offer maximum compatibility with attachments when it's compared directly with other types of vaporizers and not only are many attachments made exclusively for box mods but most of the others that are not made exclusively for them will work with them if you adjust the settings of the box mod appropriately and so what kind of attachments do work with the box mods so you have dry herb attachments where basically usually just a ceramic oven that's inside of the attachments for the Box mod you have the wax atomizers which are the coil atomizers that you would use if your atomizing wax or shatters crumbles and things of that nature then you have the big tanks or the ecig or ejuice tanks and these can be infused with cannabis but also they could just be your regular nicotine or just standard flavored juices and then what really makes them great is that they're compatible with almost all of the 510 thread cartridges and so those are your prefilled THC or CBD type oil cartridges and those are really the rage these days and means that they work with those it's really great but there are some things you have to be careful of and that brings us to the drawbacks so what are the drawbacks of box mods well one is that they can be expensive compared with your standard single-use vaporizers that could be quite a bit more expensive but to most of us it's worth the cost another drawback is that there can be a little bit of a learning curve to use them because they allow you to use a really high wattage or a low wattage but if you use high wattage on devices that aren't used intended for it you can hurt your devices and so that's the last drawback that I'm going to point out is that you can burn up your atomizers if you use too high a wattage and that is specifically or particularly true when it comes to the 510 thread cartridges most of those want wattages down into two to eight watt range but you know if you put your papers up on 25 and 30 Watts you'll burn up your cartridge really quickly so that's one of the drawbacks of it okay well I hope you enjoyed this video on what is a box mod again this video was sponsored by a New York vape shop so

cartridges from black tie CBD no terpenes or cutting agents have been added to this at all they're nice jupiter-c sell cartridges and they also offer a really nice battery it's a self-drawn o button and it holds a great charge it's pretty good I don't mind it I generally hate non push buttons but this battery works for me it comes in a full gram cartridge and right now I believe they're 49.99 and we offer an exclusive discount code through the hemp bud form its hemp bud forum and I believe that will save you 10% off your entire order at black ties [Music] so if you've ever tried distill it it's got that distilling flavor but it also has some natural or carring terpenes in it that were present in the hemp that was used to make the distiller just distill it by itself does taste sorta bad so if you're not familiar with what purity to distill it tastes like unflavored sort of like burnt rubber maybe a cache bowl just generally just kind of gross ish this has a nice herbal base a bit of pine hints of lemon citrus notes pie a little bit of distill if not terrible tasting not the best tasting cartridge around the effects are fantastic as it's pure distill it at 60% CBD full-spectrum all the other cannabinoids are present including a small amount of THC I believe the effects for me are just spot-on with what a good full-spectrum CBD does it calms me relaxes me slows the anxiety down that I fail relieves tension generally in my body that's what I use CBD for and these effects come on instantly as do most vaping products for me and I would find this particular cartridge to be a hair on the night time you can't I wouldn't reach for this during the day for whatever reason so that mellows me out nighttime cartridge hit me with the comment below if you've tried these let me know what you think peace [Music] [Music]", "gqGxit_NiQ4": "what's up guys be green 91 and today we're checking out one of the first legal vaporizer cartridges in the Canadian recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "kQmL3zc2sOk": "hey YouTube how are you I hope you guys are having a good day and if you're not I hope by clicking on this video you're feeling a little bit better today's Monday okay and I'm back again with another cart review oh I picked up another cart that I have not tried okay I did take a couple of puffs off of it but I didn't like actually like experience everything so this is gonna be pretty exciting oh garden sky doggy and this I don't know um but this is an indica named live resin okay now I was like what is the difference between all the other cards and then the live resin like what's different about it well I looked it up online and I wrote my little notes down so I guess live resin an onion flower rather than a dried cured flower so I guess the other types of cards which are called dis lint or I don't know I don't know if I said that right but basically those I guess are made of flowers that's already been cured you know it's chilling and it's already dry so that's how they make their you know chemistry happened with those kinds and I guess what's live resin it's fresh frozen flower if that makes sense so I thought that was an interesting found the raw garden site because on the packaging you guys it has your little warning it has the manufacturer date the batch number and all that it tells me like the percentage right here on top of the sticker but yeah on here it doesn't say much it just says ingredients 100 percent frozen fresh frozen whole flower Turpin's and cannabis oil so those are the ingredients in this wax well card it says no trim no additives ever and that's all it really says and then it tells you like how to use it and the dosage you should take or whatever once you open it up so this is the inside of the box it just has like a little container where your cart sit so it's all box name inside of the box so that's cool and then in here is where it's all at and you push down and you open it sometimes I'm having trouble okay got it open yay okay so um in the thing that's what the color looks like okay this is beautiful it's so light it's just attractive you know it looks cleaner to me it feels more natural but that's just the color that's just me talking on the card of course it has a California sticker and then it has the raw garden and then it has their little symbol so on a symbol uh logo logo yes yes yes and then on the card screw on thing that you just take off once you're ready to use it and then it has a little top it this is what the mouthpiece is looking like okay that is the opening hole and then sort of those say is just you know regular white little tips screw her on and let's start this smoke stash I have not smoked today yet it's my first time yesterday I got really okay story time I got a little drunk okay and then I think I had three beers and I have well three beers and a half is too much for me I don't drink often at all rip and oh my god I was so sick you guys it's like I just started feeling really like woozy and like just tired and I was just not having fun anymore like I didn't want to be drunk anymore and I threw up like I was sitting in my car and I was just chilling first I went outside to catch some air you know I was with a couple of friends so I went outside to get some air all feeling better and you know you [ __ ] up even after you go outside and you don't feel better like the fresh air isn't helping it's not doing anything so I already knew what I was going into so I was just kind of walking around kind of like chillin then I just then I sat in my car and I was [ __ ] sick I just was like okay you know when you feel like you're about to throw up like it's coming you can't stop it it's coming it's exactly how I felt you guys I threw up I didn't throw up all over me you know I threw up outside of the car I have not smoked since then because I got so sick I came home I think I don't even think I took a shower but I laid down I slept I woke up at 12 I ate so I don't know how I survived but here I am okay it's website and I wanted to focus on some of the little facts that they have on there what they claim cuz like I said on the packaging it isn't much so I wanted to kind of tell you guys and also with the live resident another fact if focuses on maintaining is strong and pure flavor and honey I can totally agree with that because the first hit I took of this when I was leaving the dispensary oh my god like I was so freakin late I was coughing my ass off it was really pure like as far as the flavor it literally tastes like you got some like dab or like wax and you took an actual dab you know out of it Raik that's what it feels like it feels [ __ ] well now feels it tastes really good and the flavor is definitely very like weedy you know and another few few facts from raw garden so they claim they are a hundred percent natural farm-fresh cannabis so they only grow fresh cannabis they're not using stuff that's been sitting somewhere really grown plants so all of their flower you know that's extracted for their cards or their wax or their diamond saws there's so many different stuff from them it's all California cannabis grown in California valleys so if you guys you know support that I definitely do because it's like if it's a closed source it's more of it's not past past past no fillers and their product no added flavors and no additives and I [ __ ] with the no added flavors part because I don't really like the extra stuff just for it to taste better or something like I can care less but anyways I'm gonna stop rambling and we're gonna get lit and I'm gonna and I didn't bring a water what is she thinking amra all Gardens definitely gotta take little hits with this oh my god yeah yeah you guys I'm warning you okay if you guys are I'm telling you guys take little hits off of this when you first get it if you haven't tried one of these already because I have not tried this so I'm a whole new person to this you know it's a very it has like a wax taste okay like this is an indica sky doggy so do not expect a no type of light you know fruity stuff from guys like this is the flavor is like like I said I'm gonna tell you the flavor okay very very wax like that's exactly how I describe it I don't think it tastes like any type of fruit or any type of like you took a DAB and that tastes you have in your mouth but a good damn you know not a nasty not on whatever something you just whatever no a good clean wax tab out of a clean break that's how I would describe it okay had a terrible night yesterday though I [ __ ] fell asleep like my whole [ __ ] like it was turning out to be cool and I did a lot of stuff yesterday but as far as like I went to the grocery store then I went to the dispensary and then I think I ran like two more errands and that's after that is when you know somebody when I first went there I had positive thoughts I was like I'm gonna have two three beers and I'm just gonna drink I'm not gonna smoke and at first I didn't even smell them they were smoking at first okay and then you know it was fine I got drunk I got confident so but I did throw up it was fun being drunk I felt really faded but then I just pushed it pushed my own limit I knew I should have stopped when I should have stopped but yeah I mean other than that you know as far as what other flavors have you guys tried if you guys are watching this and because this should spider like I love it okay like oh and let's do that bubble test y'all like I don't think it's fake so if it comes up fast is it's it's a full gram so I feel like this should last me a while because I mean I barely take few hits and I'm high so like I said it's good it is an indica so I mean they probably have other flavors where you guys are at so it might be different stuff I don't know but as you can tell my voice is like recipe now because I'm a little high and you know this did it [ __ ] it did it [ __ ] nothing I don't know what else to really say about it but I definitely recommend it it was I think where I got it from 55 before tax and then would tax a little bit more so you know you do what you do as soon as I'm done filming this video I'm gonna go edit smoke some more you know is honestly let's do a rating one to ten what am I gonna give it once and for all it's a good 9 okay I'll even give it a 10 I just haven't smoked all of it yet and then I'll definitely tell you with an empty car to be like yeah what do I really think about it this [ __ ] hits but yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on what is your other flavor that you have tried that you recommended me trying let me know you know let me know but I'm gonna go because it is getting a little darker and I'm pretty much [ __ ] I don't know talk about hang out of 10 it it tastes like what it claims you know the no fillers no added flavors no additives it definitely feels like that it feels really like pure just Tacey [ __ ] pounds in your face baby hits baby hits you guys oh my god but I'm gonna go I'm gonna edit this video maybe smoke a bowl or whatever you know the huge the user dues but I hope you guys are having a good day and I hope this video made you feel a little bit better because it definitely makes me feel better making them and yeah let me know let me know well I'll see you in the next videos so you don't know anyways have a good day have a brighter day and have blessed day", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "le8Pgcb0uaM": "Roja brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel cannabis connoisseurs I hope you're all taken care yourselves and each other out there Sheeran and chemo back on the channel here got another product to review for you today we've got a 510 threaded vape cartridge from sundial cannabis called lemon riot we got 0.5 grams sativa hybrid coming in at 791 milligrams THC one point five milligrams CBDs are gonna be hitting about 79 80 percent THC on this less than a percent CBD it's a heavy hitting THC vape cartridge from sundial tried this strain before in flower sundial product the lemon riot really enjoyed it purchased it a few times it's got a great taste a nice citrusy lemon taste flavor in the bud really looking forward to see how that translates to the cartridge here for some beeping you know what without further ado let's get this package open it's a little bit of a unique package I haven't seen one like this before um yeah it's okay I will let you know it was packaged in November 16th 2019 and like I said it's a 0.5 grams let's without further ado let's get it okay I'm really excited to try this guy I just want to rip it open so um we're gonna go to a so on the top here it says twist in a line and push up so we twist what are we twisting here yeah sometimes these things are not too clear okay there you go so we want to looks like we're aligning here Oh push the top oh look at that it's kind of crazy little pop so push the top off you got your cartridge in there just like that kind of neat let's take it out of here if we can yeah it's a little foam thing in there it's kind of neat like a little push pop so still some wasteful packaging right you know Canadian legal cannabis wasteful packaging but go to I mean it's kind of a neat package and I do like that you kind of have somewhere that you can put this afterwards if you in between cartridges so that's kind of cool so let's put that cool package over here and let's see what we got all right so here's your standard 510 threaded VAP cartridge oil looks you know not bad pretty clear not too bad looking for oil I've seen worse doesn't look too murky kind of moving a little bit in there when I move it that's good it's kind of what you want to see in your oil I think so for my experience this is a nice color you got the sundial branding on the one side and the other side you got your THC warning sticker along the bottom here says lemon riot and yellow let's take the little mouthpiece condom off and yeah we've got our most about the charger on our battery let's take it off standard battery here for a 510 threaded cartridge let's screw it on and there you go so looks like ready to rock so without any further ado and let's jump right in I'm really excited to try this out oh yeah you got that citrusy lemon flavor kind of a earthy kind of taste to it as well I was expecting to be hit over the head with just lemon citrusy flavor there's a bit there but it's got a little bit more of a an earthy flavor to it you know kind of hummus almost like kind of piney in a way yeah you definitely definitely kind of get those hints those notes of lemon citrus on the inhale and on the exhale you get sort of a earthy piney taste now this is a really nice balanced flavor to this I really like it but it's surprising I thought it was gonna be a little bit more like BAM you know hit me with that citrus lemony flavor but it is there a little subtle but it is a good taste I like the exhale flavor is a little bit earthy kind of piney good sort of a class of cannabis flavor going on with this um it's been about what 40 seconds since I took a drag I almost feel like again a little bit of effects going on here this is my first hit of the day haven't had anything before this I like to come into these reviews kind of fresh so uh first impressions packaging is pretty nice design I don't know no I'm not gonna give it any awards on design there's kind of a lot going on here you got the white top the yellow bottom you got the branding there it's not going on it's alright but for taste so far really enjoying it lemon citrusy piney earthy on you so it's really nice great flavor so we're gonna get this marinating here we're gonna check it out gonna hate this up throughout the day put it through its paces okay so for the last couple days just exclusively they've been using the Sunday lemon riot vape here I've got to say I like this thing hits you hard it lasts for a while and it comes on pretty quick it's it's good B it's about eighty percent THC so you know it's gonna hit hard but it lasts for a while it's gonna last you about one or two hours on set right away what you're gonna get is a nice daytime sativa high you know cerebral head kind of focused energetic happy overall gets through your day really good babe I like it recommended value wise you know these things run about fifty bucks seems to be about standard for a 5-10 credit card trade you get about they say 0.5 grams in there which is standard for these unfortunately we'd like to see something your tanks come out and some cheaper prices but what can we do right we're gonna get there for what it is though you get a good value like I said I've been reefing on this thing for two days oh three to five five second drags every time and you know we still got quite a bit of oil in the tank as you can see it's gonna last you for a while we're gonna get you through value eyes give it a thumbs up effects wise two thumbs up you know even the packaging I know I like to rip on the Canadian legal weed packaging I like this packaging you know it's got that pop top push pop you got a little container that you can put it back in here you want to switch cartridges back and forth is it a little wasteful a little much yes but I do like it what can I say I like their packaging this one so value effect is good values good effect is good taste flavor yeah this where you might be a little disappointed you're expecting a real citrusy lemon hit you over the head with flavor you're not going to get it that's what I was expecting as well - what you get is you know a little bit of lemon citrusy on the inhale on the exhale more of an earthy piney kind of flavor and that's definitely the more dominant flavor that's a tasty hit in the mouth afterwards I don't not like it it's not bad it's just not what I was expecting at all when I got when I went and got something named lemon right because I have had the flower before does have a really strong citrusy lemony taste to it didn't really fully come through on here but I gotta say I'm not disappointed with the taste that's there so overall everybody I'm gonna say definitely recommend a limit right sundial 510 0.5 sativa cannabis faith cartridge here for you that's the end of my review thumbs up recommended let me know what you think as always leave me a comment read them all reply to them all like to hear what you say have you got any questions comments concerns I

coming all the time and until next time stay safe take care of yourselves and of all just keep smoking", "86vKJe4EKvo": "[Music] [Music] once about simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title this is a white widow cartridge yes I repeat a white widow cartridge and for those of you who don't know what white widow is I'm sure most of you do know what what white widow is what would it was like a really really old stream like growing up this is the strain I was smoking in high school you know and that was like 10 15 years ago you know I'm saying so it's definitely something that stuck out to me and I was pretty cheap it was 20 350 for a one-gram cartridge and the company is free cannabis company I've tried them before I seen them at Halle flowers and I purchased one of their cartridges for it but believed a dollar or something you know something cheap because those at Halle flowers but this was 20 350 or $23.50 for a gram and yes it's I mean before you don't even need to guess it's gonna be distillate I believe I mean it doesn't say on here at all anywhere on here but I'm sure it is and I believe it has life to repeat air life resin terpenes is what it said on weed maps so yeah white widow in a cartridge man I haven't seen white widow in like flower wax or a cartridge in like ever I don't think like I don't have any off the top of my head I really can't think of a brand that really just brought a white widow flower or in a cartridge or wax but let me know if you've seen any brand use white widow I know why what it was very subtle after strain right now you know if I can get it in flower form in wax form I'll definitely pick that up you know I'm saying so off the bat you can see right here just get a closer text I don't know right off the bat you see free cannabis company see it's 84% - you see with 4.5 CBD not bad let's just open this we're gonna be using my chill battery oh yeah this was 2350 I authenticate or nine it's not gonna be the strongest cart because it is distillate based it's not full spectrum live resin or anything [Music] I get a really piney taste from smell right here it's cool right here so that should be the thumbnail yeah you can look at it right here very nice very similar to that I've select it is plastic I believe yeah it is but this isn't flat like select I've already tried the the blueberry one pretty good [Music] it's a weird I've actually tasted this kind of taste before it's like that black licorice kinda but very uh it's very minimal taste in the other ones not too bad but definitely not a taste I really like but as you can see the vapor production is there I really enjoyed the blueberry one better than this this will taste funky but then again taste is a preference thing you know some people don't even like blueberries you know I'm saying so you might like this but it's kind of a weird taste but I've tasted it before and if I had to compare to something maybe like a light black licorice taste then again I don't really eat black licorice that much if not at all so I wouldn't know I mean it tastes some more similar to that it's like a weirdness to it so take another hit for you guys see the cloud smoke \u00e4j-- [Music] you know what I like to do I like people on the fan as well but let me just tell you about this again so basically if you haven't seen that video already I mean which I've already probably uploaded before this I picked up two cartridges of these and two grams of wax because I wanted to prepare myself for what's to come within the next few weeks you know I might not be able to get a better selection than I would have two days ago you know I'm saying so it's better to be prepared I don't know when this video is gonna come out maybe in like a week or two from when I film it but hopefully you guys enjoyed it I'm gonna take another hit for you another thing Pizza guys [Music] you", "Oulri9qCTkg": "YouTube what's up guys how you doing make sure you have subscribe button make sure you that like button if you liked the video today this is new to Keystone integrated yesterday it's the rhythm energized cart a Dutch it's pretty high eighty 2.33 five percent THC bust this thing open and check it out comes in a nice little container rhythm it almost looked like it was leaking I hate these cartridges for Oh like looking at just like nothing in there sure ow yeah it definitely was leaking you can feel it's all sticky all over the side of it which isn't cool I'm going over these cartridges like I'd swear I want to be doubled try to pee a Dutch energise rhythm cart good takes good picture hard I just hate that house like give me a lease to the jeezum man but very well to medicate you and Keystone's father's well the cartridge on it happens I mean but I like TDI cartridges more than I like really any other cartridge for the grass roots are good but kind of pricey this is on sell thing was 45 bucks man that tastes good that tastes good rhythm PA Dutch definitely an energizer and find your rhythm yeah I was wrong", "EMmYy7VGXZs": "hey guys his dab connection and we're going over transferring oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "I7NPjm1VlrA": "hi I'm Nick

"how's everybody doing this gelatine connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today so today what we're going to be doing is we're going to be taking some millenium extracts blueberry which is a 70 percent THC and we are going to be putting it into this cartridge which as you can see right here is an eye crusher JC 1:05 standard 510 thread cartridge all right well let's heat this up and get it on okay prepare the oil you're going to fill the cartridge with take your cartridge remove the mouthpiece now you're going to want to take your applicator and put it as far into as possible then slowly begin to dispense your oil into the cartridge [Music] if you have a very thick oil you'll see that it takes a while to move farther down into the cartridge that's just something that takes a while to do make sure you get as much of it as far down as possible we're going up filling up the rest of the cartridge once it is full leaving a little bit of space [Music] take your cartridge would you know filled with oil put the mouthpiece back on it's over screw it closed now we're going to take this cartridge and let it warm up a little bit and that all those bubbles float on out of there so here it is all ready to go this is the eye crusher JC 105 as you can see right there I crusher it's a very popular 510 thread Partridge we are going to be trying this out on our ego - very nice battery we've had for a while all right let's try this thing out for function [Music] all right well there you have it nice smooth flavor on it seem to work good got some nice function on it all right well these can be found at vape parts Mart calm you make sure you swing over there and have a look at them if you're looking for some cartridges to refill they've got a very nice widest orbit well thanks for tuning in uisidenav salute wonderful day peace", "21X3JqB2EBM": "welcome to the basement [Music] yes what's up new to guess what man we back today and today we're gonna do a review on something a little different got this little package today of course I got the little sticker and everything like that that always comes with to the phone's product but today we're gonna do the Twitter phone's be calm and not only we're going to do the favicon but it came in this nice case so then if you're gonna go and it says it's a travel case so I don't know if you could take you on the plane I'm not going trying to do that so this is the travel case this is the car this is the gelato number 33 to see what this bottle looks like is it thick okay thanks see my house is kind of cool right now got my a/c on it's 90 degrees outside and gorge yourself when I got this out the mailbox the box was actually hot so maybe I'll all use a little thicker but it still looks pretty good so I'm gonna start here of course we got the tweeter phone's battery that comes with it charge it that has the little tweeter phones logo on it which is cool this really looks cool it's rad so let's put this together and see we working here I know this thing should have some charge on it we're gonna test it out so it does have charge it has three voltage settings and the way you change the voltage you press the button here three times now let's see with a song okay that's green I think Green is the medium that's blue that's a lower setting and that's red so actually it's the other way around I think but whatever it is and you press it two times to preheat so now is preheating we're gonna stop that way I wanted to get to and not a bad taste not a bad taste tastes almost like it has mint in it and let's look at the it also comes with the letter to law enforcement of course I love having that this is how to here tells you how to operate that animals and this product has 65 point 93% cannaboids and the total CBD percentage is 65 point 87 percent Wow that's a lot okay so this is not the full special product or a broad spectrum so right now we're dealing with discipline so that's what this is all about right here so this product here is good to calm you down you know if you have anxiety or if you just want to relax this is what this is good for it doesn't taste bad I also want to try a few different flavors so I kind of like it me as far as the effects I'm really not getting too much of an effect in it that was my second time pulling on it so give me a minute I'll let you guys know how I felt but it doesn't taste bad that's the most important part I know I heard a lot of people complaining about I hate the way it paints and this one doesn't taste bad the Delano 33 pretty good good job three two forms I'm just waiting to see how that this affects me right now I've had anything today I didn't smoke any flower no CBD babe juice because I do they I'm starting to feel a little calm now all that CBB inside here it's not a work already yeah absolutely so it was definitely doing what it's supposed to do I'm feeling a little calm or a little better than what I did when I first started shooting this video so you know I got a weap calling this over meanness all we really do with this thing here man I like it so I'm definitely gonna be ordering some more cards from Twitter forms few other companies I'm gonna try them all out you know I'll let you guys know exactly how this thing goes be back with you in a few feet", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "BQgkVTCGKAg": "[Music] oh man got a full house alright sorry guys what's up sausage gravy biscuit glad grower forgot my ashtray got burned down with you guys make it some vape cards this morning testing them on yep being down at the dispensary cuz they ain't making them clean yet like uncle Harley so here's what I've been doing I made up my little necks I put my live rosin I decarboxylated it and my decarboxylate er see this now it's not rapid led it's ardent this is my D cardi carved the rosin and then I winterized it for a second that didn't really pull anything off so I just then I warmed it back up and cut it with this is what I cut it with little yellow bus honey liquidize oh come on these gaskets man they need oiled right off the get sometimes yeah these things are a pain and I'll ask so just use a little residual [ __ ] left over and oil the gaskets with it like that there's always a little stuck on the tip you gotta get one of these little blunt tip needles once you suck it up in your syringe this syringe was full they got a squirt in slow the D carbs the color it makes it dark I don't give a [ __ ] this cuz I know these pens don't get up to know 436 degrees my nicotine pen don't get up that high so I don't think you're really getting in those other pens I don't think you're really flashing that [ __ ] off it's not D carbon even says it's THC a you're not getting at all let's put it that way you're gonna get all of it miss it's gonna feel stronger even though the THC contents probably lower I'm guessing this morning 50 60 % maybe 70 I only cut it a third and use half well it's like a half half of what's there like I had 8 grams of live rosin and I used 4 milliliters of little yellow bus honey liquidizer there we go clean vape cartridge was all ready to hit that's shocking I didn't think they'd do that the librarians real thick and sticky you'd never even be able to get it in here right unless you like heated it up and then put it in scold him hot and then then did it but then it wouldn't burn it wouldn't even drain down anything so you have to like make liquidize it so that's an emulsifier it's flour terpenes right you can actually buy straight cannabis terpenes but they are unbelievably expensive you ain't gonna buy now 120 milliliters of it for you know 100 some dollars it's gonna be [ __ ] the one Scott has it's goddamn it [ __ ] gasket there you get like three drops for 20 bucks literally the actual cannabis terpenes that their wildly expensive I could see why you know your yields are just probably all the guy got off one freakin plan if you watch that in dokas channel at all Howie he always tries to show you how to make concentrates with a coffeepot and he they make excellent CBD products too by the way but they're I think they're in Europe sorry I gotta pay attention one doing I forgot what I'm saying that's how good that glue pen is I'm not a big favor either UK but you know anymore even though it's all legal and stuff here there's still a huge stigma so people love the stealth of the vape pen they're like man that could be at a family function I could literally walk outside for two seconds nobody knows I did [ __ ] and I could put up with their [ __ ] for another two hours yeah I'm almost out of juice I think that's about it I just might fill up this one I got here about last a little bit it's getting thick that's not good trick is go slow so yeah once you get your harvest alive rise and then after I harvested out the decarboxylate er I I warm it up in the microwave for 30 seconds inside this thing and then you then I measure out this little yellow bus honey liquidizer in the pen right and I like if first you got to make sure you you know your weight so my weight was like seven point nine right at eight so I use just under four milliliters of the little yellow bus honey liquidiser it come out almost perfect it was a little bit thick but I just didn't want to add any more so what's happening aap it's having to Jane joke grows that do a little work this morning getting these vape cards ready before I headed to the post office got packages going out today maybe these are gonna be better I don't know if you got any of these or not sausage these are definitely gonna be Wow way better it was taking me five polls to really feel it now I'm feeling that wanting to just like it's a yeah dee carbonate makes a huge difference wow that feels like it's twice as strong I love that glue it tastes just like gorilla glue to using this yeah I used to no flavor original orig sup j420 you came for 20 I know I said something to you already buddy and shout you out with a mess aap glad you still up in here I found your big bud see that I popped and then I hid my panty dropper with it so we collaborated on the string you didn't even know it what do you want to call the big panty dropper there's granny panties and then we got panty dropper we could have big-girl panties you know ladies they put your big-girl panties on here's what I done so far today these are all complete liquid gold so it looks like we don't make [ __ ] well once people taste my weed in there and they always oh man how much do some of that bud these are clean Jane no lead right because we don't use shitty coils no uh no vitamin E no coconut oil no butane harvested [ __ ] weed not washed with nothing no propane no MXZ 12 12 X or whatever it is MZ 12 X all we use is little yellow bus honey live liquidizer and live rosin I don't know if you guys have a pricey live rosin carts out but a real live rosin cart is not cheap a piece of email me the PayPal me the shipping I'll send you it to you something I say I send you something for your giveaway too I'll send you one of my earlier prototypes the one right before this fall harvest man I just put that grill glue into flour this morning nice she's gonna be nice so here's how we make our s oh I'll just do a quick tutorial and I'll do a whole other video when I actually make it so you got to get you one of these from Amazon you can get them anywhere between 40 and a hundred bucks and I'll tell you the price difference why I got what I got this is a counter top distiller okay see it plugs up the top part plugs into the back and then the back part plugs into the wall right it's got this digital temperature readout setting things this is a this is really handy I mean you can boil it off outside but it gets dangerous when you do that [ __ ] this is highly flammable liquid I mean you can light it on fire it's been this is what they the s alcohol is no joke this I have to pick up in Kentucky because they don't sell it high enough proof here see that that means it's 95% pure alcohol so what we do first is out pour two bottles into this right - fresh bottles pour it straight in and then I'll run it through and what that does is that flashes that most of that 5% or that yeah that 5% of water off because you don't want no water in your RSO is if you to get it evaporated off you got to get it to 212 degrees and we know that you lose your thtve at 2:15 so you don't want to do that and your THC delta-9 so then here's some alcohol that's come off the RSO already see it comes back I use this because that shit's not cheap that bottle is 50 bucks are you doing a gallon at a time you know you just flashed it otherwise if you don't have one of these you just flashed it off into the atmosphere and you're gonna get about 10 15 milliliters IRS oh maybe yeah so these are the setup fits together and then you're gonna make your distillate pour it in here set your temperature to 78 to 79 degrees centigrade okay that's where alcohol boils off I don't know what the Fahrenheit equivalent is because nobody uses that where they make these I guess so but they do list you know the alcohol flash off what these are made for is there wine distiller to turn wine into brandy right so or to clean your water up what's everybody saying my chest not scrolling anymore we got more than 14-inch at how's what tastes frosty the hybrid are the vape cartridge this one tastes just like real glue number four no [ __ ] I was like hell yeah to come from live rosin this shit's good it tastes like the live rosin it's real smooth this little tiny thing I'd give one of these kind of volt that's what I've been using or use you want to use our kind of vape cars head our airflow is the same as just about everybody else Platinum vape and all them you need a battery with let me see see how it's got these little notches for air flow if you don't have that you'll never get air I mean it's all it'll seal itself right up shut because the whole see it the airflow holes right there my joints off the power all right it's back to the IRS oh alright so this is what when I say we'll put it in the still this is the still and it's nice because it's safe it can sit around your counter time you don't have to worry about blowing up your house we have known some people here in Michigan their kids were making a shatter or whatever and they blew the burn their parents house aunt killed their parents we don't want that [ __ ] to happen here's the digital readout when you start out you hit set 79 degrees and then it'll fire up on its own but we don't want to do that because there's nothing in it and it catches all the alcohol this nice little thing I think mine was like a hundred bucks your you want the one where you can adjust the temperature so I'm come in there just set to distill water and they get too hot and you cook your RSO you're not getting that that stuff to the right consistency at the very end that's what separates the the good from the okay and it's a long process and the way I do it I do it the way I do it so that so that it also D carbs in because it's an oral medication you want it to hit right now this doesn't get quite hot enough to be carbon okay you need to get it up to 200 degrees so so what I do is I get to this big old pickle jar we got you still see I didn't want this alcohol had particulate in it and I didn't want to filter it out so I'll just run wash my next batch of weed in it right so because I don't want to run it through that I just got it all cleaned out so on I grind up my weed first and I just run some [ __ ] all right here's what I do and take the weed normal that way stick in the food processor stems it off cuz it's all got medicine on it right we're not smoking it we don't care how harsh it is pack this [ __ ] nice and full you candy stem it if you want it'll blow through the processor easier but it really doesn't matter you don't have to chop it up if you good I was really grinding the [ __ ] out of it yesterday cuz I was harvesting beans at the same time this isn't seedy outdoor bud this is this is just foxtail bud [Music] [Music] and do our pickle jar got some alcohol in there yeah you're gonna want to fill it up to where it's almost it's completely saturating the cannabis right it's almost got not enough weed in it right now man where's Mook at you just want to see this oh crap I don't think I put 21 plus up first I even put all the trim and [ __ ] back in the same bag with this looks like that's gonna be hash or honest low [ __ ] floods or foxtails out so bad guys the first time grower and I think he he was worried about Ripper put a security light on them what do you think happened to him they look humongous they're foxtail all out and they're frosty is all get-out fright you know smoke your brains out but I can't do nothing with it smoke it it's getting man all right so I need material for assault worse than I need bud or smoke that's kind of blood we use Ferrari so we don't use moldy bud Japan get away with it y'all you know you just give them dead mold spores and all that sick just it just doesn't seem a that : it besides what if one's for doesn't [ __ ] die and all sudden it's gonna put off thousands and millions more so I don't think they can Hamilton quite frankly I've had this discussion with my mom and she's the smartest person I know see you later Jane thanks for stopping in it wouldn't surprise me if they did that's for sure I mean all it takes is for it to stay on an air bubble and they are microscopic so they may be able to live through the they may be able to live through the alcohol bath but they're not gonna live through the decarboxylation process of mine that kills everything everything gets dead at 165 degrees and we go over that so so just in case anything did that I didn't see or you know even survived the bud wash survived this alcohol wash it's not clear surviving my deep car process but I still will not use moldy cannabis it's just the risk outweighs the reward that's why you gotta look at don't ever look at oh I'm losing this I'm losing that you know you might lose something more important like your ability to breathe will see the [ __ ] that fell on the desk normally I fill this jar fill it full and then I'll tell you how to make it even a nice like pretty color once you get this fluid filtered out of here right if you stick that jar a full liquid in the sunshine for a few hours five six hours it will take the green color out and they'll make it a nice golden color via Charlie Jackson there's let's keep this in the smaller jars push it out of your way should sleep that passion there Jackson where'd you put grandpa's we'll do that all right so then you gotta get your pretty black hair tie that your daughter leaves laying around everywhere because she's a slob yesterday first some of the rice strainer that's right first I strain it with the rice screener because this you have to be careful unless you'd like having one of those special cone funnels we want to squeeze the alcohol out of the material if we can that way if anything spills you're not 100% after we're gonna do the race for you some guys stop here you know they don't mind a little plant matter in their RS soul but it's not just for us so I start people you know a little cleaner look in frankly I think the more [ __ ] you leave it the better that works for you but I don't like it either tastes nasty we should God you look up in the house I'll leave it up for you brother I told my girlfriend want to conserve water and stop showering you so much she told me I I don't think you have a showering problem I think you have a digging up corpses all groan oh my god it's horrible they're gonna give a little squeeze over it's just a little squeeze then we'll throw this in the trash and they'll be back to add the rest this is how we Satan on the alcohol squeeze that [ __ ] out of there oh this one fits way nicer and it's a tighter screen I like that I got an invention for this too I just come up with it yesterday Scott's gonna help we work on the prototype one thing I miss while working at GM in have it shop no more clean this bowl out there so then I like to filter eyes down a little bit more so next I grab me a coffee filter rubber band I gotta be careful with this we in a recovering alcoholic this alcohol that's so strong you really should wear rubber gloves you can literally get drunk from the [ __ ] soaking into your skin so cuz I'm hardly wants to stay on the wagon and I don't want my life to fall into shreds I'm not gonna get drunk on blue-eyes Moses today got my rubber band I got my coffee filter come on maybe I don't have my coffee filter right because I don't have on my coffee music put the coffee saucer over the jar what I just do with my rubber band I just had at the back of the tape and see what the [ __ ] I did with it Oh see I need smokes weed alright ready guys so then this is a long process cuz this [ __ ] takes forever to drain no that ain't gonna work I'm gonna fall oh my goodness sakes well because this has so much alcohol in it disinfect the st. erst okay all right I was going to leave this propped up in the corner on the desk you have to take my word for it drinking but it goes really slow there see it running down in there it's gonna take a while I had a mail this morning I had a mail from mr. green body but he told me he runs rings I like running rigs and you can see how healthy his [ __ ] is you can see the difference is it's not a big one at first but I could tell over the overall health of the plant like how well they they handle [ __ ] like right now we're doing a breeding project with some Brazil Amazonia it's supposed to be the most mold resistant strain there is I mean it fights off mold in the Amazon those kind of wet conditions cassoulet and and it's supposed to be highly pest resistant I can say it's probably the one plant in my grow area that I haven't seen any spider mite damage on whatsoever so in our p.m. that we've had like a spot here and there there's all come from the spider mite damage so it didn't get in OPM but it really hasn't been exposed to any yeah it only happens when your leaves get really damaged nice that's cool Hamilton I gotta make sure that chats still scrolling it hasn't won usually when I get more than four 14 people in there it wants to stop so so back to regs and Femmes I think just the overall health of the plant they just seemed to I don't know maybe because it's not scientifically propagated I guess but even with like even with good solid back breeding and I was listening to Vader talk about this they kept asking Vader well I don't you have feminized see why don't you have feminized seed and this he may have him now this is right before he started ocean grown or right when he started it and he said I can't get it better than ten percent female seeds and until I can get I mean ten percent Hermes or you know our males he said until I can get it better than that I don't want to say they're feminized well I mean that's what everybody else is calling from a nice seed so even at that there's a 10% chance right you can still get a male right so that means the math should be 1 out of 10 so if you're getting 2 or 3 males out of 10 the chances are you got you you might not know it but you've got red pollen from somewhere if you're in an area where somebody's grown within literally if you're outside growing if you're within two miles of somebody with a male plant outside there's a height there is a probability that your plant could get pollinated they can go up to 2 miles in the air that's another reason our area is surrounded by trees and overgrowth and [ __ ] try to filter that [ __ ] out I'm excited for that Sour Diesel means soil life we're talking about that Sour Diesel last night what would get a good run on average that shit's [ __ ] just [ __ ] because it was farm-sauce it ran yeah got pregnant I'm gonna try to run a sense of million see what happens so then after this shit's all done we put it up in our still of course with this still this big you're gonna want to make dual you know a larger quantity at a time even if you just got us save it well some guys do is they'll take their product from here from the jar and then cap it and stick it in the freezer and what that does there's all the fats and lipids that are in that mix well glob you late just like on spaghetti or chili you know you see if you leave it sit out the sauce you'll get that grease I'll come coagulate on top so then they'll filter it again and what happens and they do it through a vacuum process because it has to be quick before the fats melt back again right so then they filter it again cold filter it and then that's how you pull the fats out but once you do that boy it's really hard to work with I mean you got a harvest at all is liquid and then hope it doesn't get too hard in the syringe so I stopped I stopped winterizing the RSO for that reason it was really really strong I mean stupid strong I didn't take a single pain pill for this seven fusions I had my back my mom my mom helps her with that bad breeding stuff cuz before I started I was like nah I don't I don't understand this is Mendelian charm yeah so what that's I mean the probability I'm a math guy and it just everything's a guess you know what I mean it's like you got a mom and a dad you're gonna get brothers and sisters now you're not identical to your brothers and sisters in any way shape or form so you have to take the the biggest baddest brother or sister and sister right in this case and then you got to try to then even have to isolate her genetics so how do you do that so then you got to find a male with similar structure I've all these beans you pop and then you cross them right and then you do this five more times so breeding males males very difficult bought there's way to skip a step and this is why feminized seeds became so popular besides the fact that you have a high probability right 90% chance of getting a female say well it's actually seventy-eight percent chance you know 22 percent 28% chance 72 percent chance I'll be female the rest are gonna be Hermes er or males and that was a study if you're into Korean farming at all this Korean guy did a study where he did 300 beans and that's what the numbers he came up with and he did it like more than once so he said that's the you know that was the probability so so it'd mean breeding is never an exact science right it never but if I would say if you're unsure whether or not things were I check all my beans anyway because you don't know I mean you could get powned from outside blow in the window and hit your plant and you get some beans that came from somebody else's mail who knows just keep checking your sacks it's not that difficult you guys behave c'mon I had a feeling one of them mr. greenbags was gonna be a boy the way that [ __ ] was ahead and I was like come on girl but I did pop pop too because the regs in the math you know the math doesn't always come out one time I popped all my pain wrappers a ridge right first time I popped them I got eight nails out of ten eight I was like well [ __ ] man and then one died cuz I mean it was just it was one of them weird fee tones you know the first f1 something once in a while you get you get something incredibly stellar out of f1 your chances of getting something just ridiculously whole new great strain is really high but you also have that that chance that you're gonna get the really weird one you know the stunt did you know the mass always the same right it's got to equal out that's what the yin and yang is all about Santa and mrs. Mook he yeah he's uh why don't have any of his new stuff but I have his like his uh his ice applesauce and that last batch he ran but I told him to wait because I want I still haven't put his library together I got a whole library for him but I still gotta finish just putting it together I just finished harvesting all the seeds and sausage helped me get that done last week by prompting this [Music] I got more stuff coming off yeah I just thought yesterday I hit a hit my panty dropper with glass big blood that I've feminized pollen that I harvested this summer so I'm going to get a few beans from that and then I'm gonna feminized that clone you know what I mean great now I have oh my god I lost count last time at like 67 strain different strains and beans and I just popped should I pop another six this week I think all right you know scared Roby me too I want to make sure he'd get onto YouTube it's gonna be staggered of course because there's no way I'm gonna be able to flowering out 24 they're not gonna be it already at the same time the only getting on his grow off though email me or whatever you need to do you ain't got pay power whatever all right guys I am going to hit the head get me something to eat take a break and I'll be back at it later if I do something different if I harvest something else or if I do another step on this oh let me show you my last step okay once you start cooking this in this still up here right get it all cooked off and I still puts the alcohol in the is a clean jar when you open it up when this kicks off that the temperature I got it set at it'll be real liquidy normally you guys will keep running keep running it and then harvest it out of here but this thing's so big and it's hard to get up in the syringe when it's real thin it gets real stinky real easy so so what I do is I leave it the alcohol in it so it's easy to make handle and then I bring it to the oven I'll put it on bake 200 until it comes up to temp and then I cut the oven off and this is a D car process as well as the finishing process you see it bubbling right now that's alcohol coming out of it see how little is left and that was from a gallon of liquid this is why you don't see a lot of our sou needs a ton of product to make it to be able to harvest it in any kind of quantity but that's it guys I am Harley grower I'm a mission County misfit architected tank and a bearded bud brother and I'm out of here", "ihiiyzwweJ0": "let's tear stuff apart and put it back together today I'm gonna show you how to tear apart and put back your get your CV dfx fake kit what's up guys at your boy big Jay coming back at you from vape Co TV where you watch the side and babe and like I said earlier if you got yourself one of these little CB d FX vape kits and maybe it's the one that you one for free if you want to know what I'm talking about check out my review video I'm not gonna spoil it from there I'm gonna show you what all the little pieces do how to put it together how to fill it and how to work it so let's do it so basically what your kid's gonna come with us about 4 pieces aren't real simple you're gonna have the battery you're gonna have the tank and you're gonna have to magnetic pieces and I'm gonna show you what they do and how they work so let's check it out so here you have the battery again very simple to operate one two three four five just turned it off okay as you can see the light is not lighting up turn it back on one two three four five and it's back on and that's just how easy it is to operate the battery pack now as far as the tanks go when you first get it there will be a little rubber piece protecting the threads go ahead and take that off and discard it to open it up basically you're just gonna pull the mouthpiece off you can set that to the side and then you got the little blue guy up top here okay it's gonna have a pointy end and a stubby in to fill go ahead and pull the little blue guy off do not lose him all right if you do you're not gonna have a way to plug your tank take some of your CVD alright I having to be using the 120 milligram go ahead and get yourself a little dropper full and as you can see there's a nice little hole up here on top grab your tank and start the dropper in like so squeeze boom done all right this is where you're gonna grab a little blue guy and again you have a stubby end he is a slippery little fellow you're gonna have a stubby end which is that side and I'll pointing it which is this side take the stubby end and insert that in the hole on the top all right don't get super caught up in trying to get this flush all right it does not go in flush it will sit out a little bit all right not a big deal take a cap push everything back good so you hear that little snap now if you drop your tanking now it's not gonna do anything all right see what I'm talking about you have to put one of these little magnets on because that is how it makes connection and actually fires the tank so you can screw on the low profile drop it in boom now you have connection alright and that's the profile you're gonna get where it's basically just the battery and the mouthpiece if you want a little higher profile unscrew of the small magnet and put the high profile or the high-rise on there drop it in and now you have that profile where a little bit of the tank sticks out either way you still have the window here on the side that you can see your level of CBD all right we're gonna leave the high profile on here and we're gonna vape it so again to turn it on even though it is on five clicks you'll know it's on because the little battery indicator light lights up other than that boom here we go guys let's take a vape press the button and puffs it's that simple I can't make it any easier than that so there you go that's it we're done check us out next up button vape code TV cuz it you play big J and we'll see you next time [Music]", "hbxHgCzSYhg": "hi my name is Sedona and I wanted to talk to you today about the dow CBD vape cartridges in pens I first got into CBD because I struggled with anxiety throughout my whole life and I've tried CBD in a lot of different forms and gummies and CBD bud which is like marijuana that they've taken the THC out of other CBD vape cartridges but nothing have worked quite as well as this one has now for those of you who don't already know CBD is a cannaboids found in marijuana but it isn't th see the can't avoid that makes people feel high CBD is used to reduce stress I'm paying these migraines help anxiety which is what I use it for so I decided to go with the path to clarity metal CBD tank and they have every single element or they base all their flavors off of elements which i think it's really really cool and I chose path to clarity metal after clarity because my anxiety tends to make me feel very scatterbrained spaced out and I wanted something that would kind of help ground to me so on the back it kind of gives you a little synopsis it says um feel time slow your senses elevate and the word near and far crystallized into focus when you enter clarity your focus is crystal clear and you can feel the correct path nice it also says back here it's non psychoactive now guys this is a full spectrum hemp oil so there is 0.3 percent THC in here it's not enough to make you feel high but since it's a full spectrum step boil there is a little bit in there no worries about that it's made with organically grown full-spectrum hemp oil non-gmo really really nice very easy to unpackage I've already taken the cartridge out as you can see and so one of these will run you about sixty bucks and like I said they come in there based off of every element and then here is the the actual bait pen battery cartridge it's quick charging safe preheating it comes with a universal USB charger really simple you can just plug it into the wall and let it charge super super easy and so we're gonna try this bad boy out so you Justin here's the cartridge here's what it looks like has the tiger on it which I like oh I meant to mention I really like the packaging I like the Tigers and it's shiny I'm a lady of simple simple tastes so you just screw this bad boy on here you don't have to push a button or anything simply inhale I like that it lights up on the bottom but cuz this isn't a electronic cigarette you're not gonna beginning huge clouds out of this um in fact you'd have to take a pretty long hit to even get smoke to come out like I just did a simple short hit don't really have much coming out so you want to hit it for a second but um it's really soothing it's not very harsh flavor okay the flavor is very stiff like metal which I suppose is appropriate it's very earthy and flowery um it's not a bad flavor at all but it's not as much about the flavor as what it does for me the first time I use this I just hit it for about five minutes in it a couple of times and stepped outside and whenever I looked I just felt like the world had more definition if that makes sense it really helps me feel more present definitely helps reduce my anxiety really really enjoy this product a lot so I would definitely recommend this to have eight pens for anybody who struggles with anxiety or mild pain anything like that so definitely definitely try it out guys twenty dollars for this guy about 60 for the cartridges definitely give it a shot thank you so much for watching I hope that I've helped you get an idea of what to expect from these things and [Music]", "LDiJGkI3Q-0":

sativa 0.5 then we're really looking forward to tearing this open so let's get down to and see what's inside all right here we are so we got the collab projects at Eva is 0.51 510 threaded cartridge coming in at eight hundred fifty milligrams THC and eight point five milligrams of CBD okay let's check this bad boy out we have it so got your standard 510 threaded big cartridge here nothing too fancy or you know standard thing you th see warning label on here this little mouthpiece condom ah well alright yeah it's a nice-looking cartridge against as far as cartridges go let's just stick it on the old standard 510 thread battery any one of these bad boys will do for it of course and let's give it a go shall we see I mean yeah it's good mmm I don't know what a bit of a peppery earthy flavor to it definitely nice very smooth on the first draw here so first impression is very nice on this let me check another one out it's a very nice flavor profile going on with this thing I got to admit it's great it doesn't really see what the strain is on it just says sativa but this is really wonderful okay so I'm gonna put this thing through its paces here the next little while and yeah come back and let y'all know what I think of it overall okay so final thoughts on the collab project vape pen here I really like it I've been ripping this thing all day long gives you a nice buzz nice long lasting buzz it's energetic focused sativa buzz great for daytime use great wake and bake extreme it's fantastic the effects are great you're gonna get just a Teva strong sativa buzz out of this thing it's gonna last a lot and we're ripping it all day you know this tank is gonna last you for a while and you're gonna feel good about this little tank and get up and go here for you good value on it like I said went to the store wasn't going to buy this I was going to buy a San Raphael 510 cartridge that was 0.3 grams at 0.5 that was 73 percent THC is 85 percent THC this is three dollars cheaper so value wise this is very easy to recommend effect wise is very easy to recommend flavor wise very easy to recommend it's good taste you got kind of a spicy peppery earthy taste can find a lot of information online about the collab project it's at Eve is 0.5 like I don't know what strain it is which is a little annoying but whatever it is it's really good I don't know if it's all natural cannabis terpene in here if there's a some kind of botanical terpenes added I know they do that with some vapes nowadays I'm not sure but try to find out a little information I tried to get some more from the review I couldn't find much but whatever it is it's really good it's really smooth it's not harsh it's got a good taste good amount of vapor production so overall this thing is really easy to recommend it's good value great taste great effects collab project sativa 0.5 good job guys it's a winner probably would purchase again what's it I want to hear what you say leave me a comment if you tried it I want to know what you think about it if you agree with me or not and yeah we'll see you again for another review thanks for watching keep smoking we'll talk to you soon",

first time that I heard about him they had a weird way of naming strange so I never really gave him a chance but now they're here I'm gonna go in there and check them out I know that they're strains are actual strains I did a little bit of digging last night but yeah I'm excited about it so I will get back to you guys on pretty much what we get and what products are available and in stock here cuz it's kind of busy but yeah I'll get back to you guys you're sure [Music] alright alright guys so we just got out of a pool it's grand opening hell yeah I got a bunch of swag bunch of sick stuff I'm just super excited guys this is sick we're getting variety we're actually getting some new dispensaries in town I'm really really stoked to get I want to show you guys these products we've got a lot of cool stuff they have actually 5 tiers of flour going up to 30% in there guys so yeah we're gonna check some stuff out and yeah I'm excited for it I will check you guys soon as I get home [Music] alright guys so we made it back to the house and we're gonna go through our products and show you guys what we got let's get started first things first is our free vaporizer better so you get a free vaporizer battery on your first visit and 25% off because it was a grand opening we got the free vaporizer battery free pre-rolls some free swag and we got 30% off and I think the 30% off goes for five days after the Grand Openings but yeah so we got the fluent just a little 5-10 battery not bad though I went with the black one anyways we got alright so this is gonna be our cartridge I went ahead and went with the Polaris and that is gonna be their granddaddy purple strain these are actually full spreads from co2 extracted so I didn't know that I was looking into their oil with and stuff and a lot of people had a lot of bad things to say on reddit but I also looked into some other things this was a while back and they said that they'd completely refined their process used to be a winterizing process with their carts but I guess now they're going with a co2 extract so it's not bad I paid 45 bucks for this but 30% off of course this is a three Milgram and the only reason I did that is because I didn't have enough to get the 500 milligram on my prescription left so we ended up having to just spin to what we had a hell I pick I have like 351 milligrams left so I'm with this one that one for the battery I'll take it out here and I'm gonna show you guys oh we got some glasses though oh yeah we've got a black pair and a yellow pair they flew in on pretty sick I'll also do

yeah that's awesome oh what's this oh no way they have pop sockets a fluid bob socket that's a trip guys that really is a trip oh we got a little stress ball that is where it's at I love these things a lot of people think you're supposed to play with them stuff these are stress box guys just squeezing make sure you switch because you might have a big ass arm if you like you're doing something else dude all right so I got the menu of all their products I'm gonna throw that bottom there we'll go over that later though oh these are pre rolls is our free pre roll let's see how good this smells so this one is gonna be the audre is coming in at 17.8% not too bad so Audra is gonna be oh gee cush oh man it smells good though I will bust this open for you guys that way you guys can see what it looks like I kind of want to go through the steps of checking it out too now what we know is not to him or anything crazy like that it doesn't look like trim though it looks like pretty good flower inside of here so hopefully that'll be a good thing last one but at least we went ahead and went with the tier 4 of gimmick door and that is gonna be Girl Scout cookies and blue tree mixed now when you're dealing with the Blue Dream and it goes to a hybrid cuz usually it's a sativa you get down to genotypes and phenotypes so the phenotype is pretty much summarized by the environment that it's grown in so the characteristics of the plant are gonna come out the way you grow so some might have long beautiful buds sativa II blue dream and you might get a batch the next time this thick like cushy lookin buds and it's a different phenotype so it's so it would be a hybrid as the other phenotype would be a sativa but anyways let's get this bad boy popped open and show you guys what it looks like we'll be right back alright guys so we're back and we're gonna check out this here fluent flower it's coming in at twenty three point eight six five percent THC zero point zero five three percent CBD and zero percent CB in I am excited about this guys let's see what this looks like oh wow so I guess they're already popped open it's not looking too bad not too bad I can dig it what you guys think looking okay oh man the smell guys oh the smell is something it's serious okay so this is gonna be their Tier four flower it's not that though very fluffy and dense at the same time beautiful trichomes all over see if you guys can get a little up close yes look at those beautiful frostiness oh man and I'll get you guys another bud view that way you can get a good up close alright and we're gonna move on to our cartridge yeah and the cartridge is coming in at 27% that's a little odd huh I've never seen a cartridge that low in THC it's got a good amount of CBD and a decent amount of CBN so this one might be a real good one for Payne guys I will definitely keep you updated and let you know but let's take a look at this liquid and see how that is rockin so this is a 300 wow it's a huge cartridge for 300 milligram that is insane look how big this thing is y'all holy crap the actual oil doesn't look too bad I kind of get a little scared when I don't see any kind of bubbles in it it kind of trips me out when it's filled to the rim like that yeah but um cuz usually they have time to soak up a little bit maybe it's brand new though I don't know but yeah they're not bad cartridges from what I see they look pretty good to me it's got a one milliliter lying on here I guess that's a halfway mark but yeah so it comes with a little plastic piece on the bottom to protect your threading and you got a little spot right here that way if you want to put it in your pocket you don't get any went in your mouthpiece so that's pretty cool but yeah we're gonna move on to the pre roll and busting that open does alright guys so we're gonna go ahead and get this pre roll busted open but before we do I wanted you guys to check out the label it's come in at seventeen point eight three three percent THC zero point zero six seven percent CBD and zero percent CBM so I figured I would just go ahead and nam instead of destroying it I'll just kind of unwrap you know never know when you might need that cone I'm gonna go ahead and get it all out I'm gonna put it in something else anyways so this right here guys is the Audra strain which is gonna be OG Kush all right I'm gonna get you guys a little bit of better of a close-up alright guys so this is gonna be the actual flower inside of the pre-rolls I went ahead and emptied the whole thing out get a little closer see the consistency it's actually um not too bad it's pretty sticky it doesn't have too much like I guess you could say grind it down to dust and trim how usual pre-rolls are so it's actually got some good butt in it thick I'm definitely excited to smoke this once again this is going to be the Audra OG Kush alright guys so after showing you guys all the products we're gonna go ahead and take us a big fat rip of this here OG - SHhhh cheers guys oh man Wow the flavor guys it's there Kyle it tastes like og cush dude holy [ __ ] I mean I know it is but Wow haven't had it in so long it's literally been like three years since I had orgy cush but yeah man this is great Aion I'm kind of upset that they didn't have the OG Kush one audre in the eights but that's alright okay we'll get it next time I'm kind of transitioning into a lot more of indicas lately it just helped me a lot with my pain and whatnot but man once again this strain right here guys that's Audra OG Kush [ __ ] is so potent go ahead and clear this out probably almost gone Cheers not bad at all guys oh my goodness thank you guys for watching thanks to all the new subscribers if you enjoyed the content hit that thumbs up

thumbs up until the next one [Music]", "LAFG_FJRsNc": "hello what's up guys both here and yes it has finally arrived my vape pen and my CBD oil cartridge that I am going to be doing a review on today alright so we'll start off with just the pen and all that get a raw supplies and all they're they're pretty nice company and all that they you know so like high graded you know oil pins and I specifically designed for these you know like this is CBD oil and THC oil stuff you know I mean they yeah they basically you know they make sure that you know the customers are satisfied and all that and here's the pin itself you know that's pretty it's pretty standard pretty nice pin and all up if you focus on right there oh [ __ ] my bad you see has a crown well that's pretty nice no it's pretty nice pen they're called royal supplies and they sell pins like these they even sell like you know cartridges for you know refilling them on your own and stuff like very nice pin a very nice oil pen and I I got this because if you guys remember from my last video I did had a another CBD oil cartridge but I figured out that they are not very they're not very good to be using on you know not very good to be used on mods because the mods can easily burnt the coil and that's what ended up happening I ended up burning the coil and I can't really you know did that won't anymore here's the charger for it you know I charge right here you would put you basically screw it in right here and then plug it until whatever words it's a USB and all that but yeah really really nice pin and all that and now we'll move on to the CBD or cartridge this time I got funky farms granddaddy purple oh and if you guys don't know granddaddy purple is a indica strain and I pacifically got this just for the cushy tastes and all and as you can see as 350 milligrams of CBD and all that so this actually has a lot more CBD than the last cart I reviewed and - this is actually a Graham cartridge so this is a lot more slightly better here you go here's the information in the back see indica full-spectrum distillate full terpene profile wickless ceramic coil and u.s. grown industrial hemp and even says lab tested alright so yeah and there's the 1 milliliter so actually this one cost me only 30 bucks for this one which is extremely cheap you know and if you guys are looking for you know cheap affordable CBD oil this is the way to go alright and when you open this it says enjoy I like that and you pull it out and there's the oil you know I'm kind of pull this out for you guys as you can see I chose white background you see it's a pretty nice clear oil and it is kind of a little bit runny because I did hit it a few times this morning when I got it just the seem for myself you know what but yeah it's a really really nice oil you know and like I said this is one milliliter and all that so basically like like I said you know this is a lot more than my half gram I still haven't fish my half gram either by the way guys and I might bring that up just to show you guys what it looks like on the pin and maybe ticket hit from it so yeah you got you know a 5-10 thread and all that C cell all right it's a very nice oil very nice oil I tried that a few times it taste is very earthy my extremely earthy now I'll show you guys here just kind of scroll into the battery up onto the pen and this one you actually don't have to just do it loose until it's tight all right good how's airflow in that and now how these work is you press this five times one two three four five say turns green and then you press one two three see now it's blue for I figured I forgot it's like thirty point five I did one two three four a 4.0 volts so one two three to go back to green and then one two three we're gonna hit it on a 3.5 is it seems like I get a pretty good hit so let me go ahead hit it for you guys and I like if you guys are 18 and over or whether in your you know state like this is a hemp product you know this is CBD and also you have to be 18 you know I if you guys are 18 over might be hanger you know CBD oil cartridges with me so here we go so it sorry about that I don't know why always coughing when I take a hit because this ain't like THC oil at all this is sort of different well yeah it gives me a pretty nice hit you know it's pretty smooth crease move on the throat you know it's not as harsh as the other one which is pretty nice I like it and of course I'll take my last hit and tell you guys a little bit of the effects of this one all right oh maybe I take too long of hits I think that's the problem and - I'm hanging at too much of a high voltage as well like I really don't know and this is CBD - so I even know how this make me call I'm probably hitting out too much of a high volts to me try at the green volts well I'll do it again 1 2 3 1 2 3 I got this green and go ahead hit this oh I probably should just wait until my throat feels slightly better and then I'll hit at that bolts and all that so as you can see it has pretty nice that's pretty nice vapor production and all it's very I must have hit out too much of a high holes because it kind of does give me a little bit of a throat hit it kind of burns my throw a little bit so that's probably what it is for me on the other hand but yeah it it taste is all right the best way I can describe it is that it's a piney and it's very earthy and all its it's alright taste but I would say it's not the best taste while that well I probably should get a water ball instead turning a juice honestly that's probably the best option is to actually you might give me a thing let me grab a water bottle because I don't think I should be okay I'm back oh yeah like like it says it's full spectrum and all in from what I read you know full spectrum is a little bit harsher on the throat and that's why you shouldn't take too long of a hit of a full spectrum and all because it does kind of that's why I can describe it it kind of does burn your throat a little bit because like I said it is full spectrum oh yeah I can I burn my throw a little bill now so effects of this one is is 350 milligrams of course you guys are probably right away like oh you must already feel the effects already and I do re feel the effects already you know I feel very relaxed and all that I feel calm a little bit tired and all a lot you know I have a I feel good that's the best way I can put it not like feel good like I'm high because of course CBD like you know doesn't get you high but if this was to get me high in a lot then I definitely know that I definitely know that they weren't really telling all the truth on the box but funky farms are a very respected uh you know distant a company they're pretty famous I just want to follow them on Instagram I know what theirs is their Instagram funky farms CBD and then you can go on their website WWE fans calm and all that so you guys can check them out in constant fan with royal supply farms it's wwl supply wholesale calm alright for them who I feel a little bit better now you know what but yeah like I said it's a very relaxing this is an indica so you do want to be using this for nighttime use you want to use this for nighttime you know when you're about to go to bed because I already feel a little drowsy from it all that so it's a very very nice oil and alright it's alright but I want to say it's like the best you know what that's the best way I can put it's not the best tasting oil but you know you're you arguing or CBD and that's what really matters the most is when you're getting your CBD CBD is what really matters about getting these don't want to be getting your medicines that's what really matters I don't want and I'll even show you guys the kind cart on the pen I don't just so that you guys kind of get a good idea and I can't line back up to it isn't it and then hey that's good though so I'm go ahead pull this out I might get in our kind cart I don't know yet but they are kind of expensive that's why I'm a little bit worried about actually getting another one of these because they're they're a little bit too expensive and I don't like that hey yeah that's pretty it's pretty nice on here and as you guys can see the oil is a little bit dark because you know I haven't been hitting it a whole lot okay good so I should be able to hit and this has a better taste too and my opinion they honestly does they just has a way more better taste you know okay so let me go ahead hit this real quick I got this up the lowest voltage so shouldn't getting a burnt taste to it this is what you want to use for these specific cartridges as well you want to be using these it's kind of a little dark but it still tastes good you still get your CBD from it so there we go it does have that perhaps at a still so kind of sucks I still does have that taste no it really does you know like it's a real bummer it really is I am sorry that this view is a little too long guys I just wanted to show you guys what that looked like on there nicely before I end this video I should take one more hit the granddaddy purple you know what I'll take one last hit of this I just say just for you guys just for my subs my and actually I need to thank you guys for getting me at 50 subs I keep offering and say that thank you guys so much I give me at 50 subs like I never ever thought of ever getting the 50 subs and I am very grateful all right there we go a little bit smoker that time but yeah the the taste isn't very great and a lot next time when I do get next time when I do get another one of these funky farms CBD oil cartridges I'm going to begin to gelato next time is the gelato is a lot more free tasting has a lot more bear tation - it's a hybrid so I'll definitely have to get that for you guys because it'll taste a little better than this cartridge of course what's kind of that's what really matters that's what matters - is like you getting something that it tastes good you know like you know I mean so that's a another thing that kind of matters as well as you're getting something that tastes good so that's also good to be it for this video you know I am sorry that this video was almost 20 minutes long I'm very sorry about that you know I was kind of all over the place I need to I need to do is write down scripts and all that because I'm not much of a person for scripts to be honest I am not much of a person for scripts and all that but I really do need start right now you know stuff you know what to

good youtube it's your boy cbd smoke doctor and i hope everybody enjoyed a weekend if you guys quote my live you will see i was turned up to a honey rather in fact a hundred thousand so i did enjoy this weekend and i got two products that also helped me enjoy this weekend guys you guys might want to check them out they're at another super store these i only shop at two superstores guys only deal with two superstars all right dr ganja and my other guy y'all guys already know who that is so dr ganja they have a bigger variety of the d8 cards right now guys right so i got two of them right now just to show you guys i and y'all guys know how i am about these d8s i'm still dealing with them until i find out that they're um really really not good for you or something happens to me so i'm like uh a guinea pig for you guys all right so um i hope you guys appreciate that too so this is coming in from dr ganja those are my guys over there i love dr ganja guys so when you get your package you will receive a card with all of their information it's a thank you for your purchase and ways to contact them also and yes you do get dope stickers they come in different colors so i don't know which one you guys gonna get in the pack when you get them and i got two cards guys i got the mango kush that's this one here all right and i think um the company that made this is um herbal farmer rx and um this mango kush has 92 percent delta eight thc this is a foreground and it says here [Music] it has a whole bunch of warning labels as far as don't take this operate heavy machinery you know the usual and um it also lets you know that this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease they have a barcode that can be scanned right there i haven't opened this one yet so let's open this up and i know this one is very very turkey deprived i mean derived as far as they put a lot of flavoring in it i guess because this one has a darker color than i'm used to with delta eight i usually have them nice and clear like the canon eight i'm going to show you guys that too and uh this one has flavor so i want to see what it tastes like we're going to hook this one up right now and then we'll go over the candy aid as well but i just want to let you guys know how this one is and this is the mango cush guys that i'm hooking up i get that later not a big deal but just let me hook this up real quick and only take 30 seconds all you got to do is get the rubbers over there now i'm gonna put it on to my battery okay and i like this battery a lot i have a few of them but this is actually my favorite battery guys so if you see it a lot that's because it's my favorite so check this out guys it's all hooked up to the battery and this is what the mango kush is looking like i'm going to turn this on low i always start off low let me tell you guys um i made a mistake with one of my delta 8 carts and i was using them on high and um at the end when it got low i noticed that i was getting um it was getting stuck basically and i had to pull real real hard to get it and i figured if i just turned down the voltage on my battery it would help and it did okay so i haven't had that problem anymore so it's not getting clogged up so i have it on the lowest setting as you guys can see that's me just heating it up a little now i'm gonna let you guys know what the flavors like [Music] definitely got some mango up in there definitely got some mango up in here yes so you guys could get it just like this that has that natural flavor okay [Music] this one is the white widow guys okay this white widow is a cross between the brazilian sativa land race and uh resin heavy south indian indica wow sounds good but what i do like about that one the canon eight is that it makes you talk alive i had a few friends over this weekend and i had them try that out and nobody could shut up so that right there is definitely a sativa uplifting blah blah blah blah blah thing right there i like it very good for company guys and this one right now i'm just enjoying the taste and i haven't got the effects yet this one is 92 percent delta 8 thc so [Music] there's a little less than this one here which is the canon eight and this one has 95 percent guys all right but there's no delta nine tac detected so all of this is coming from cannabinoids from cbd hemp so i don't know how they did it but the minute they make the flower have these effects oh man it's gonna be a beautiful day so it takes a little getting used to with that mango flavor me personally i am not big on flavor flavor when it comes to any card whether it's cbd whether it's uh even the regular cards any card i'm not big on the flavor i take that natural taste [Music] but for everybody that loves flavor this thing is packed this is packed let me grab the wrapper okay so like i said this delta eight mango kush thc is a good taste to it me i'm just not a fan of flavors in my [ __ ] that's okay um it's nothing but added chirps so it's not like it's a bad thing it's just that me personally i don't know if it's just that i'm a type dude but um this flavor is really good you know i just prefer natural guys naturally but i can't get with it so i do feel the effects right now and this one has more of a calming effect if you ask me the uh canon 8 we're going to hook that up right now let me just take this off put this to the side now the canon has that natural flavor natural terps is the white widow strand and let me hook this up real quick guys see i tell you it's definitely doing its job because i'm starting to feel nice warm and fuzzy guys nice warm and fuzzy and it's kind of chilly in um atlanta today guys also so all right so we already got it hooked up so this is the canon eight white widow right here delta eight and if y'all guys could see i just preheated a little bit before i take a pull that's just the way i do it [Music] now this tastes great this really does and it's also a little stronger so gotta be careful gotta be careful [Music] but i tell you guys i've been loving it and a lot of other people they hit me up they're also loving the delta eight so we haven't tried it yet the prices are good here on dr ganja's website so y'all guys go ahead check them out for real not only that they got flour they have accessories they have you name it they got it basically all right apparel so whatever you guys need you probably will be able to get from this so this is another superstore smoke dr shops at guys this candy it's delicious [Music] man this thing is great i love this one this one i like effect wise but i'm just not big on flavor so anybody that loves flavoring and you know that's definitely the way to go this mango kush has a ton of flavor in it guys all right so it says um i already told you guys this is a full grain directions for use hit vape cartridge until desired results are achieved and that's where we are now guys so i think we're going to wrap this one up for now but let me tell you i'm going to continue my quest to find the best d8 out their canon eight is good i really really like that one and i also like this one but not as much as the canon eight all right that's just my preference y'all guys go try them out for y'all so i will put a link below the video there is a small discount if you use my link so there you go guys all right so smoke doctor is signing out for now and i'll be back with another review soon guys all right peace [Music]", "TQqwOHQ1YYI": "[Music] alright guys what is going on it's your boy joseph the realist um this uh cbd card i got from plain jane uh let me see if i could show y'all without the glare all right so that i have to put it sideways because of the light otherwise they'll put like a big glare on it so it's 750 milligram i believe it's uh one gram of cbd oil um i've been waiting to try this out but here's the car right here as you can see the bubble let me see i can show y'all definitely right now i'm smoking the girl scout cookie i'm like probably like a little more than halfway done with it um the girl scout cookie has like i started to get these little crystals in it oh yeah i can see that there it is so that's the girl scout cookie has like some little crystal in it all right so i'm gonna try this out so this is the og kush dude like this so far like these cards have been really nice whatever like these these you haven't have a like like the the look of it has just reminded so much of the thc cart and how thick this uh cbd um concentrate is whatever whatever you want to call it the the oil that's in there it's definitely like it reminds me of as most of the cbd uh oil most of the cbd carbs that i've tried before whatever the real thin oil um either they rely on a lot of terps uh terpenes whatever um but this one it just has a [ __ ] they just remind me so much of a tac car whatever and the effects on that girl scout cookie were really nice i'm gonna hit a couple more times so i could get some effects from it i really like it when it comes to flavor and um the two things i'm always looking for what's thc cbd or whatever i'm smoking whatever i'm looking for two things i'm looking for quality which is like how it tastes looks and i'm also looking for effects i'm looking for um definitely some some type of effect because i'm not buying it just you know to smoke and not doing anything um if i if i'm buying something cbd thc whatever i want it to have good quality tastes good looks good then i also wanted to have good effects where it's like it's going to give you some type of relaxation or tasty you want to get high with cbd you want to get relaxed and relieving anxiety or whatever else you buying it whatever else you're buying cbd for um with the plain jane whatever they definitely have some really nice products these cards they definitely they picked out a good um they picked out this good quality whatever ceramic coil with it so it's definitely uh i would pick it up i recommend it but you guys i've been talking for way too long i appreciate everyone uh for if you watch this video thank you so much leave a thumbs up in the bottom comment down below uh if you have any suggestions subscribe if you're new guys and i'll see y'all next time peace [Music] you", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "KgMOFk-d1S8": "thank you for tuning in to the

companies actually have to go through this process to show that the consumer knows that this is the exact product that they know that they're getting it's always helpful let's see what their user guide says [Music] wow i was not expecting that so the user guide shows the different flavors that the that they actually do that that's available apple gelato delicious watermelon wedding cake sounds daisy bubblegum kush forbidden fruit nice we got the dymo g perfect let's see what it says the brand signature true fire pure og extract widely regulated or regarded by many as the most powerful og kush strand known to man enjoy responsibility i'll try peach kush is the next flavor jackfruit blueberry lemon haze and strawberry cobb are the different players that they offer fantastic let's see what else they see welcome fantastic that was a consideration okay now this is actually a good consideration for a lot of people that are going to be vaping although our hardwell will allow you for a 10 second hits is recommended to do a 5 no more than 5 second draw because if you drop more than that you're going to be creating a little more of a smoke and that's all great and all but you're wasting instead of enjoying it so it's always good to do in small intervals i always recommend three to five seconds but it's really up to you because with the little intervals that you do you create the smoke that you want and you create the high there you want instead of taking one big inhale which kind of wastes and with the dime cartridge here's the dime battery sold separate and this battery is at 650 milliwatt all right it's the packaging right there that looks nice right there very fancy gold white has a regular base of a regular phone charger a micro usb this little box has a little charger fantastic as you can see micro usb and it's always recommended for a lot of these cartridges not to be charged in the car obviously if you're on the road and you don't have anything that should be your last resort but not charging at your home that way you can use it be mindful with this cartridge since cartridge is not plastic this is glass so be careful with it when you you drop it or you might shatter so please make sure you have it in a nice secure place when smoking it now as you can see the tip on the inside is it's actually very big compared to your common tips now if it ever gets dirty just get a cotton swab and alcohol and just clean the inside of it because you do want to make sure it's clean because if there's debris when you inhale it you're going to handle the debris you'll be choking and there'll be all this big mess so please be mindful always clean the cartridge now these cartridges are recommended to be used by their dying batteries but i'll reading into their user that they suggest this battery or 410 milliamp battery so that always comes into consideration now a lot of people are requiring a party to ask how long is this cartridge going to last me well it really depends on your smoking style if you keep on smoking smoky smoke smoking is obviously going to go down if you just use it maybe throughout your day maybe a little here maybe a little there it's obviously going to last you a lot longer so also do it in short interval hits because if you don't you're going to be wasting a lot more of the oil than you should now it's connected and there's probably going to be a little troubleshoot for example if for example if you ever get to a point why is there's no smoke or why does the battery blink three times probably just not making the right connection or it's probably a little dirty in there so just clean it up with a little a little alcohol as you can see in here this little middle part this is the connection to this guy right here so we want to make sure these guys are clean when you make the clearance and always make sure you charge it don't leave this in your car or it will leak don't always leave it upside like this way you don't leave it like this obviously if you're in a store somewhere it depends on depends on some people i've tried with other cartridges that you can store like this and it won't happen but we're going to test this cartridge and see if we're able to do that but other than that instructors say leave it like this leave it in a cool place dark place cool yeah let's try this ladies and gentlemen now people when you're smoking a pen you have to treat the oil as it was flour do not inhale and automatically excel try to keep it in as long as you can obviously the choking and the coughing that's the common side effect of cannabis so don't be alarmed but take a little bit of intervals you'll get the smoke that you need so obviously you'll be able to judge it if you take the 10 second and inhale you won't be able to judge in your those massive clouds there's gonna be a big waste and you're like oh no come back so little intervals enjoy them and what's fancier about this cartridge and what i love about it see these little holes right here these are airflows a lot of cartridges don't really have that can when you connect it to the battery because usually for the standard battery it's just a battery with little holes and the cartridge covering so it gives a very little air hole this gives it double the air hole so not only does it have the big air holes to give you a smoother hit also has a little one so it doesn't overheat the cartridge nor the battery which is a good thing because you want this to last let's take one more and within the burst head i was able to feel something because i'm inhaling it i'm trying to enjoy it before i release it for my second head it's kicking it up a little more now people might be asking me is this a live race cartridge it is not it is a distilled cartridge excuse me if it was a live resin it would actually stay on the actual package that it is live resin now if it doesn't say anything on the package of this live resin it is the majority of time i distill it now your priority will ask you what's the thc count what's the cbd count well i'm gonna get to that right now let's find out at the little facts now total percent of the thc 79.16 now the thc content 79.16 the cbd doesn't state it but roughly it's around three point something percent because the total cannabinoids eighty three point twenty two percent i'm gonna do math right now because i'm not a mathematician but you get the idea now so far from my head from this cartridge it was phenomenal now it's not too much doesn't you don't take too many of the terms so it's actually just right now obviously i didn't get the flavored ones so i can't really tell you if it's going to taste like a fruit or anything but the daimuji itself is a very nice cartridge it is there is quite enjoyable the device doesn't overheat i am able to enjoy the cloud that i'm looking for especially for that smooth hit so if you ever see the dime cartridge as well as the battery i advise you go get it because it's fun i would like to thank everyone for tuning in with me showing while watching this product of mine now if you ever see it get it and i like to give big thanks to atrium for letting me try one of their products that they're sampling and i would like to make a big thanks to you because it wasn't for you with this well i want to be here right here because i wouldn't be able to show you the knowledge and i want to make sure you're knowledgeable in what you're looking for now if you have any questions make sure you comment on the bottom below my name is roman and i'll see you guys next time", "U_Ka0JKesCY": "[Music] what up y'all said [ __ ] Academy ha yeah big man [ __ ] today we're just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "C1ocH2KMqfY": "hey everyone this is concen and today we're going to talk about a question that we get quite a bit here at vaporizer review and that is how do I clean my pen vape and there's quite a few pen vaporizers out there but we're going to stick with the three general styles we have a dry herb we have a waxy concentrate and then we have an e juice style pen vaporizer here so we're going to go over how to best clean and maintain these vaporizers we're going to start off with the dry herb style I happen to have an at most Rx here I personally not a huge fan of drier pen style vaporizers they generally don't work too great often burn a lot so what we have here is a nameless rx with a glass screen down in there covering the herbs so we're gonna take a cleaning brush I find works best for the dry herb units and just kind of go down into the chamber and do the best that you can just simply take and clean the herb right back I they're just tapping it out onto a table into an ashtray whatever you have to just kind of get the herb out of the unit and with these pen units because they have the screep of the spring that pushes down on there it can be packed a little tight in there and when it all falls out if your pen unit happens to have one of the little glass screens in it I just take that and I put it into a little bit of isopropyl alcohol just a little bit of rubbing alcohol that I have here it's glass you can drop it in there and let it soak for a little while and while that's going on I like to just continue brushing any of the loose herb out of the drier chamber what you want to be weary of with these is there's a little coil right down inside if you accidentally snag and pull on that coil becomes loose in any way you're going to end up damaging the chamber and then this thing just ain't going to work right so you want to avoid pulling on the coil down in there just gently brush mostly aim for cleaning out the sides of the sir chamber there and when that's cleaned out some people like to take just a little bit of isopropyl and q-tip very small amount because you don't want to damage it holding it upside down take it and run it along the inside around the threading area this will keep it clean and maintain it without damaging the coil in any way and that's how we suggest cleaning up the dryer type of a pen style vaporizer very simple easy to maintain you know not the best it might end up burning but that's how we would handle the dryer now we're going to take a look at the wack style vaporizer and right here I have a micro vape nano unit very discreet very portable designed for use with waxy concentrates to go ahead and clean this one basically what we're aiming to clean here is the threading on it I like the pen style vaporizers for wax that are like a threaded connection and screw on as opposed to the ellipse style that pop off I think those atomizers they come free in your pocket easily I like when it's threaded on you know you have a secure connection to both the chamber and the battery will stay together well but one of the things you face when using that is you get some pretty gunked-up threading and when it comes to cleaning a wack style vaporizer you're not really looking to clean the coil you don't want to damage that because it's no longer going to heat up the whole idea what this really is to take in a q-tip with a little bit of the isopropyl alcohol and this is more about cleaning the threading on the wax tile vaporizer cleaning the threading is going to help keep it operating smoothly because you're going to be able to easily disconnect and then reconnect the top of the chamber to where the wax goes and with these style of cartridges where they thread off right where the wax goes it can be kind of a hassle if it's stuck together you're trying to open it so frequent cleaning of the threading on the wax tile vaporizers is really all you need that's kind of the whole goal you don't want to damage the coil in any way shape or form if you damage the coil it's just not going to heat up any more so when using your tool to load the wax onto there it's my suggest and all of our suggestions here at vaporizer review that you don't scrape it across there if you end up scraping it there's a very good chance you're going to damage it so that's something you're looking to avoid when it comes to loading just try and gently get it onto there do not be scraping across the coil and when it comes to cleaning all you're aiming for is the threading just want to get all the wax off the threading so you can unthread it and rethread it very easily we're going to take a look at now would be the less the pen style units we have here and this is the one mostly for like a juice I personally don't vape a lot of ejuice myself but I like a buck-naked style when it comes to these more often than not you're just going to change out the heating cartridge here the oil tank after a few uses if you're using different flavors it's not going to be that great but if you only have one tank handy and you do want to clean it out what I suggest doing is getting another one of the oil loaders and just fill it with some warm water the style I hear has a little bit of a wick so it's going to possibly retain some of the flavor but if you take a little bit of warm water and just kind of flush it through out there that's going to help clean it up a little bit and remove some of the flavor from it without having to buy a new tank every time you want to change the flavors that you're using in there a little warm water is all it takes you don't need to really soak it too much you want to avoid getting it down the hole in the middle as well as otherwise it might leak through there so avoid getting it down the hole in the middle otherwise there's might leak through on you and that's really all you need when it comes to the pen style close it up with that on there like this with a little bit of warm water in there keep it read and just give it a little bit of a shake this will help loosen up any of the e-juice that's in there and remove some of the flavor from it and that's all you really need to do when it comes to the EG style so that's our suggestions when it comes to cleaning pen style vaporizers if you have any further questions or just want to leave any comments go ahead and leave them down at the bottom of the video and we're here to assist you alright guys Cheers", "l1mPauHJ-CU": "[Music] yeah what's that well initial Boyd's you know Zilla back to once again with the VAP fellowship and yeah must admit has been a while obviously because we are going through this pandemic an you know everybody his eyes were furloughed or they're at work and I'm one of the ones that I work so you know been a key work all this time working on shop floors and stuff like that probably our customers and with their hand sanitizers on all them things but um yeah obviously things are still running as normal and I've been getting stuff in for reviews and stuff like that and obviously I'm behind and that but I thought I'd review this little thing here this no this is only the book the pen but the the cartridge here before I finish it really and and just completely you've just forget myself and forget completely over of how this is my fault yeah I might as well give you a little bit of a review of this now before I finish it so this was given to me by synergy extracts and I think they've just file just changed their name within this week so I think is hi kinds I think is cool but are I will I was all the with a linkage in the description below and yes so basically they're a UK company and they specialize in ICT products and stuff like that extracts it's not rather yeah they sent me the cartridge along with one of these inhaling draw pens and what it's called a plumb stick by a AAA VD and has is good it's basically go to settings at the bottom hired I love so the high is 3 point 6 volts and that low is 2 point 4 volts depending if you want a high child you want a low chug stick it on high and low I've had it on high for ages I had to stick it on low because if I keep on high when a bond is whole country and I want to do that yet yeah so yeah they set me the og cush here it is you see that I'm using into that and you can see already that the juice level is quite low they set this to me last week and yeah I've been one of this again nice little roasted box that the cartridge came in in the last DVD review that I did was for CVT vapeshot and I expressed how see me doesn't really affect me and it doesn't really affect me um I feel little bits here in there which is similar in this case but this hit a bit more so what I found immediately I found what I said about the CBD make sure you get the the time either high heavy eyelids happen with this and that was almost instantaneous it's like took a blast and then once I was in in the midst of having a second blast of DC I was just like world so eyes were just heavy here and you know yeah it doesn't give no psychoactive effects obviously because the CBD but it says full spectrum heme extract on the back they also sent like a breakdown of cannabinoid analysis right so this has got almost 50% CBD in it it also has bits of CBD 8 a little bit more CBG and like a little fraction of CBD V so percentage-wise of CBD within this little cartridge is 51.76 percent CBD yeah and no I like the taste of it I like the feel of it if you've recently stopped smoking Li and you want something to to do still these are decent decent I mean obviously we can't get our hands on the THC ones in this country which is doubt shame for the only way that you can is if you go through the black market and you really want to do that you don't know what they put in it at least these guys they get their stock tested yeah I thought it was a decent little car interesting they're decent here [Music] yeah I mean the terpene flavor on this is so is so you know earthy and you know in kind of reminds you like you are having a spliff but you know basically you know [Music] it's nice it just tastes like it it tastes like a clean a clean bit weed that's what it tastes like it just tastes like a clean Billy I'm simply because of the terpenes in it ends yeah it was it was nice and was a little bit citrusy at the same time as well I think that's been the problem that's been people that wanted to stop smoking completely and go into the vaping field I've tried a few things on the black market and stuff like that and those things really hit but you really like I said you don't really know what's in them you can't really trust it on a long-term scale stuff like this definitely I definitely recommend ugh this I thought it was really cool yeah they seemed nice people they seemed nice people at the synergy extracts a big ups to Laura thanks for sending me this and yeah I enjoyed it you know I recommend people to go check them out definitely the last time I looked at the website they had a quite a wide range of stuff that you could buy from you know CBD dabs to obviously all the other cartridges and stuff like that and loads of just CBD related stuff and I thought you know this business websites really cool thanks for tuning in that was the the synergy extracts og cush there on the plumb stick yes I'll bring a boy to you until it is debate fellowship but we've got safe keep safe out there wear your masks this pandemic ain't over just because they've lifted a few little restrictions don't mean this thing is over here so keep safe and oh yeah", "tN9D-zqZAbM": "this video is for educational and entertainment purposes only I do not promote or condone the use of cannabis too under the age of 18 if you're 18 exit this video now how are you doing I hope welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be doing a little review ok it is on a cartridge so if you're 18 and under this video I purchased this cart it's a half gram I'm already kind of smoking on it well been smoking on it like two days I got it last Wednesday and it's Monday so it's been a couple of few days out the oil check it out this is what it looks like this is the color very nice very golden amber color okay and this is from balloon farms and it says highlighter at the bottom and then the top is nighttime it is an indica and it has crafted blend all natural cannabis oil 500 milligrams which equals to 0.017 outsole in forums our mission is to help millions of people find relaxation relief creativity and fun all of our cannabis is California ground by responsible farmer who like us care about the community the environment the plant and you our products are lab tested and exceed state standards so those are all good things and then it even says that they don't eat a meal for every purchase that you make they either donate to an individual in need or a family needs 100% cannabis oil so that's what we want that's what we want around here and I am so sorry for looking so dead you guys I didn't have time to do my makeup and I didn't want to lose the good day lighting so here we are filming so that's that's what we're here for right okay so on the back my dumb ass like ripped that off but as you can see as I can see the THC percentage in here is 80% so how much that is and that equals to 400 milligrams the I scratched it off but I can tell you the milligrams as I can still see that that is two point zero five milligrams and then it has like the manufacture date it's in the batch number and all that so yeah let's get into the review I have smoked this a couple of times already 40s I would say and so far I do like it I mean I take a couple hits and I'm you know and these really get you like like they just do you don't realize it and then you're already way too lit and you're like alright I'm done so I'm taking for you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what it tastes like very smooth oh my god first hit of the day so it's a very smooth it has like a very on here it doesn't indicate a flavor or anything it just says indica so and literally that's what it tastes like it just tastes like a little bit of weed at the end but smooth it's not too much that you're just like it'll you know I can't get the taste out of my mouth it's a little it's like it's a little like tea flavored slash a little bit of weed but very mellow like it's not strong and it's not overpowering and it's smooth it's still like you know a vape ish even though these aren't weeps but I mean they kind of compare they're like the vapes of weed right I don't know so compared to but it's still really smooth for like the first I would say let me take a hit and count I probably was a good County makes me sweat you just know you're hitting something and then after you exhale that's when you get the taste the high last I would say from anywhere for me it takes like probably like 10-15 minutes for it to kick in and then I think it stays from like I have kind of like a high ish I'm not like high age but like a medium tolerant and I think it's really cool like this is what it looks like this is the tip you guys is the tip is like a cool black mild tip kind of feel and a hit super smooth like this I had another car and I wish I kept it but you know how most not most but usually the carts are Marv around to you a smaller hit but this since it has like a lighter opening I feel like I get a better hair and like a smaller cool but then I feel like I'm losing my product pretty fast I mean it already had it wasn't like all the way filled when I bought it either like it was like all the way till here with like a bubble and then ya know it's here so we'll see how long this lasts you know what I mean but it's really smooth you guys like with a little hit if you're not trying to do like hardcore long hits and you're just trying to chill and smoke which I usually do you go do so yeah that's it for this video you guys drop a like if you enjoyed it or comment your favorite card so you want me to try because honestly I want to hear what other people have tried and see what's good instead of just buying what they have so yeah you guys let me know drop a like drop a comment you know all about it and yeah I hope you guys are having a good day and I hope you're happy and I hope life only gets better for you so yeah goodbye till next time", "qPPSe6zEzEU": "let's go everybody Cuban chronic here another cannabis video / review here we got the bubbleman trinity pin by Marcus from bubbleman Richardson a big fan of his everything from his bubble bags to his dry sifting methods are definitely beyond any you can find anywhere else so you can always take bald man's word when it comes to concentrates in my opinion he came out with this fine bait pin unit see here oh this way it says bubbleman right on it nice silver always been my favorite tone was this nice metallic silver on the bait pin batteries he's got bubbleman B and bubbleman on his cart really slick little unit not gonna go through all that right now but this is mainly just to show how to fill a vape tank in this case of the bubbleman Trinity tank so in this case both man's got this really nice glass borosilicate glass or something like that outer and it's uh it's definitely it's able to take a lot of heat compared to most baked in so I go ahead and what I do take the cap off and you got this little opening here like most vape pens even the disposables look like this from brands like select other brands like that in recreational states I like to just heat the outside and you have these little glass syringes either come with select dabble bowls you get distillate and stuff from this from the dispensaries and outlets in little syringes like this also the blue river terpenes I believe come with a little syringe like this and you just mix your tips and your concentrates in the little glass syringe sometimes you gotta heat it I use my email and just kind of wipe the vial around on it just lightly heat it to get the oil to go where I need it to go and to use these that's all in my how to mix a sauce video you might want to check out but I'm gonna make this video as quick as I can here's the bubbleman Trinity tank I'm just gonna put my Enel coil around the edge and just heat this glass to a deist in temperature to where when the oil hits it's gonna run to the bottom I'm gonna show you guys how to load this without having the needle like they show in the bubble man Trinity videos this is for people that just don't have this is called a luer lock needle that would go here on the end and that's just for the dabbling hater and actually the terpenes come with the needle I have an eel but I'm gonna show you guys today how to load it with fountain one so you had this little tip here it's all glass these little dab of wool syringe containers for oil and I just heat this up on my email as well so I'm gonna heat both of them up and heat up the outside of the Trinity tank and I'm gonna heat up kind of the outside of my little syringe here full of turps and OG shatter his og chirps and Oregon Diesel OG shatter so so you can see when you have these syringes the oil starts coming out gonna suck them back so you don't lose any oil anyway I'm gonna show you the procedure around this little edge you see that hollow you just stick the dab locator end just right there against it and I just slowly press a nice bead around the edge of it and just keep it there against the seal and the edge of the container and since it's warm it's gonna just melt right into that space and I mean this is just for people that don't have the little luer lock needle that the Terps and things like that come with so you can see that oil is just dripping around there I'm just gonna heat it a little bit yeah I'll be really careful just little dabs of oil around the edge you really don't want to get ahead of yourself there we go hopefully show you guys a little view of this you can see the oils dripping down into the tank already it's looking pretty good so we're gonna go ahead add a little bit more around the edge here it's too crazy literally just wipe it off on there you know you learn to manipulate the oil a little bit doing this you'd see it's just draining down right into the right into it so let me see if I can get this a little bit closer for you see that oil is dripping down straight into the chamber see it slows down so you just kind of wipe it on the email again you can use a lighter on the outside and and just gently melt the oil down so anyway that's that's one way and some people be against it cuz you got to heat the oil a lot you can see it's just draining right down where it needs to go a little bit of oil left on the edge here and we just wipe into the pin here okay so well that's dreaming I'll show you guys one other method and that's with a luer lock needle and that's what these little dab locators have on the ends of them show you a sec this little needle off real quick so yeah you got these little luer lock tab locator your needles and so this this little lock that goes on the end of it so they just kind of slide on and off they twist on and off depending on where you get these from but that's what this locks into so these little needles come with my terpenes I ordered and usually get a little dab locator like this it really has to be heated to go through these needles and lock securely or all the oil kind of blow in between here but they work really well for Philly debate cartridges I'll show you now I'm gonna heat the oil good though and also heat the needle just a bit so that I know I'm gonna get a good run of oil through the end of it so I just heat the needle on the outside just a bit on my email lightly I don't want it too hot these are terpenes here and you can see it'll fit right in between that little space in the vial and as you've seen in probably other videos you can just just squeezes right in just see it there squeeze it all in there I fill the whole thing up use all the church sauce in there squeezed in there real nicely filled it up nice yes very nicely filled bubbleman Trinity pin and uh some little instructions in the Trinity says right here stand tank upright for 30 minutes to let after filling before use so anyway that's a little warning for you just kind of tells you what's gonna happen and if you're getting a boil around the edge like I said just heat it up a little bit make sure all your oil drains to the bottom I like to leave it open for a while with the cap off no matter what unit you're using if your units plastic definitely do not heat it it's not gonna work for you I recommend getting a glass one that's refillable admit to be refilled like bubbleman spins here I don't know if you buy those cheap ones I don't know if they're glass or not honestly people but bubble man's is definitely completely non-toxic materials all that stuff and I will say this is from a company that's called a w-9 tech or up tech and they are a great company any troubleshooting they're definitely there to help you they know a lot about their products so their customer service is on point and their shippings fast all that stuff man there's not a problem that I can understand why bubbleman chose that company and anyway there's the pin go ahead and just put the cap back on very nice I know I might as well just show you how to use the bubbleman pin click the button five times clicks on and now the greatest thing about the bubbleman pin is you can hold that button for up to 10 12 seconds but just take a rip and you hold it for 10 seconds don't even take her up and then hold it under 10 seconds and then start ripping and you'll get a huge rip but the the main process of using these from what they've told me is puff press and then pop so you let off the button afterward and clear the thing to suck more oil into the chamber to be burned for your next hit and it's a really good unit I've had it leak a little bit they sent me another cartridge and said hey man maybe it's a seal they just sent me another cartridge no questions asked they're great company so check them out a little demo for you so I'm going to puff press pump takes a minute to prime the oil but you want to let it just stand for 30 minutes so that it all that air bubbles and stuff come out but I like to heat the oil and it'll all just kind of exhaust the cap here and there and watch the bubbles come out of there and I mentally get all the air out and you can just hold that button literally watch it it's blue it'll turn off when it needs to do you get all that oil tar in it that's how you take a hotter DAP you see the size the hits you get me Trinity always cool it off afterward just by general inhale sorry about that coffin that's just how big it hits you get off this thing so anyway Cuban chronic this is the bubble man Trinity check it out at a w-9 tech or fresh head ease calm I gave it a 10 star review myself I mean I'm sure it'll be it'll be improved in the future who knows but it is definitely one of the best bait pens I've used as far as ripping first us stoners that's what we like nice good hits whatever hits we want light hits strong hits fill your own vapes there we go Cuban chronic dads ahoy everybody peace out", "SNlCrBLiPE0": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpy time right back with another awesome medical cannabis review and this one

good day to be alive all right guys back here for another freaking video you already know what it is and if you don't know my name my name is shakka zulu um thanks for freaking watching the video clicking on the video but um today is going to be another freaking review but today i'm going to review um a strain that the people from my freaking live stream wanted me to freaking try out and it is runs guys finally got me one of those rent carts because um a lot of people in my live stream said do the runs over the lemonade and then also like i bought this mainly because a lot of people um saw me do the geo pin and i showed that they had runs for geopin and they want me to do the runs for geopin but i don't want to use the geopin so i just got the 510 thread one so i got the oh obama runs guys let's go but before i get into it you know your boy has to take a rip smoking on the roach right now [Music] and if you haven't seen the video on this i made a video on this it's a disposable um cartridge it's called a roach if you want to check that out it's up there on the screen in the corner but um let's get into it guys so i decided to do runs and runs is actually powered by cookies guys there are um a couple brands that are powered by cookies maybe more but the three main brands are runs lemonade and mints if you guys are cookies fans you kind of know those are the main strains that are the main companies that are powered by cookies but um today we just got the runs and whoo and the runts is also let me sit down for a second let me let me walk over here and sit down so the runts is a lot it's a live sauce i'm pretty sure that's what you call it or it's just a sauce car period as you can see it's kind of golden it's not as dark as a live resin but it's pretty dark and that's because of the added terps if you guys don't know the difference between a disc jillet and a sauce cart it's not much of a difference but distillate when you make distillate usually all the original terpenes are taken out when you make that distillate so what they do to make a sauce cart is they add terpenes back into it to make it a sauce so it's distillate basically with terpenes in it let me get you guys a close-up real quick so you can see the golden goodness today i got the runts and i also have another lemonade but that'll be in another vlog i'll let you guys know when that drops soon before i go into that hit actually let me freaking tell you guys the content in it so it says thca 10 53 milligrams it says delta 9 thc 55 278 milligrams and then it says cbd two milligrams so we got delta tac and then taca they don't even have just you know usually they just have thc on it but they're actually telling you the type of thc that is in this pack so i'm gonna just take this first rib you know just to get the taste and everything and then i'll take a blinker head for you guys because you know i gotta take a blinker head every time i get a new car i gotta take a blinker head at least one on the new cart so let's go okay so off top this is definitely very terpe very sweet and if i didn't say so before it's obama runs it's actually not that bad guys [Music] [Music] so yeah guys man this [ __ ] is like definitely very terpy you can definitely taste the terps but it's also earthy at the same time so maybe it's actually freaking terps that are derived from the actual strain that they made the cart with but it's freaking fire guys oh my goodness this is way better than definitely way better than the last strain that i got i think it was called like metal in or something like that i'll put it on the screen the strain but fire shout out to runs i make some good ass [ __ ] powerball cookies but yeah guys it's just a chill day um today i'm just relaxing i just got off of work got back home you feel me i might live stream i don't know but if you guys want me to live stream like i said man i say this in every vlog comment live stream flood the freaking um comment section with live streams so i know you guys really want me to live stream shout out to the people that be in my live streams man yeah we'd be having some good ass time we'd be always vibing

[Music] [Music] Harrisburg and I'm sorry from camp recently our local country act came to the market and when you prepare to absolutely not it very much you learn elevated water Alex from the mosque is was a church to the chamber is very different from traditional cartridges and be a great innovation to the market this is Pat and this is three so do you know why we design a country that wastes from any death yes okay you know it's a bit quick do for the wait card industry also an innovation fall technology when you keep in China more pure and healthy way for clients so I'm trying various ways to achieve that for a long time so since the USA raised a new standard have Meadows we believe this all custom attitude we are definitely that to just them the PD tank X is completely for your time matters the whole you want to contact any metal parts inside so it's very healthy and keep okay happy to know that and not as your measure allows the technology innovation do you know it great okay the cartridges features the most advanced ceramic technology in our company is the four generation of the media sir McCoy ensures your quality product is delivered effectively in in fiction it's still different viscosity of Sidney Poitier see oil providing smooth and constant jobs okay thank you so much yes many of our trying they just complain about when they buy some regular gas cartridge on the market they're always that can it just happens but with our UNIX judgment in size and their dog without looking forward it is 100% more like change your eyes also won't touch any metal in size so when you use other cartridges the medical waste pollution oil so it is a quite a sex waking style when you use this countries and so the cream gas chamber here you can see the natural color of the oil you can see that it is where a chat is for customer to buy and last but honest without a faction of the heavy mantle or some regular mantis the taste will be extremely Paris especially when you add different flavors it is very a good starting point yeah okay great first up we designed a unique pattern core series it so when they connect together it looks Mohammad if you know Mom just to contact us okay see you next time bye-bye", "IVfQgHNRTQ4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm just about to open my marley it's a balance cartridge because um i'm still waiting the way my prescriptions are working it's really weird um i'm still trying to get my penelope and i can't get that cartridge yet um because i'm still waiting for my um thing to be renewed because last time when i was able to order they didn't have any in at that time so it's just this huge big huffle so i've been using the balanced um or harmonized cartridge by soleil um it's also by afria i did an unboxing about that um a little while ago but um so yeah i managed to do this somehow i woke up i didn't i don't remember dropping it i didn't use it in the night i don't know how i managed to get it like that but that is what i managed to do to this poor little cartridge um so and um chum is now out of the balance cartridges of soleil so um i'm going to try this in the meantime it's we'll see how it goes i don't know i'm going to open it and find out i just opened up the marley cartridge balanced it's the marley balanced cbd um cartridge i don't know if you can kind of read that but it just says cbd on it no marley is um a product or under ownership of canika uh cannabis this is a canica based product but it's owned by it's a marley product i guess so this is what it looks like so we're going to try this balance cartridge out and hopefully it gives me similar relief um to the sole balance cartridge i'll give it a shot marley natural red 510 thread cartridge this is what it looks like in my 510 battery pack that's what it looks like and this has just kind of been a we'll see what happens because i'm struggling with getting things on my prescriptions right now so i've mostly only been using the vape cartridges um just because we're at home and are it's it's just easier for me to use them i find them really accessible i find them less messy i can i can use them when i need them and carry them with me i don't have to carry around a grinder and all sorts of other things they're just more accessible and easier for me so basically i use these out of convenience a lot of the time and um i also find that they're a little bit better on my throat i don't find them as harsh or as burning which is why i use cartridges more than i have been using dried lately now the whole struggle with this um is because of my spectrum prescription um i didn't i was not able to get the penelope on it which was what i was hoping to get because it's new and i really wanted it but because my prescription kind of ends like in the middle of the month when it renewed and then when i was actually able to get it they no longer had any in stock so i've been trying to find cbd based or like half and half's to use um in the meantime while i'm waiting to be able to get stuff off my prescription that are actually available when i have a room on my prescription to get them hence the issues with the cartridge and trying to um get something that works now i did find one that really worked it was the solei cartridge uh the balanced or harmonized i did do an unboxing of it but i didn't do an actual review of it yet um but they are awesome i really really like them um they are also an afria product now marley is a canika so this is a canika branded marley natural product um now i haven't had a lot of um canika's products before because mostly it's been the afria products that i've been using um with the good supply and the just my aphro cartridges on my prescriptions but most of the cartridges i find if they're not by tweed or um they're produced by aphria whereas this is a canika product now i was um reading and it says that it's it says it's all natural um and so our marley uh red cbd rich vape cartridge is filled with five grams of natural cannabis oil a custom blend formulated with both cbd distillate and winterized co2 thc oils i'm not sure what a co2 thc oil is but apparently it delivers approximately a one-to-one ratio cbd to thc now i've never heard that before and i've never seen that in the product descriptions before so i'm kind of interested to know how that works so if you know how winterized co2 thc um works i'd be really fascinated to know i'm gonna actually have to uh read up on that because i don't know i do like it though it's been working really great um so far so good it has um i think if i had to pick between the balance cartridge by soleil and this one i probably picked the balance just because i find it gives just a little bit more pain relief than this one does this one does give pain relief um i do help it find find that this one helps with nausea whereas the balance because it doesn't i don't find it helps with nausea or with my appetite this one i do find does increase my appetite and it does but not as much pain relief as i would like so it's an okay one would i get it again and as for a cbd yeah i'll get this one again because i think this is pretty close to a um similar effects that i get from my um aspen cartridges um as far as as feeling goes that's kind of similar on a prescription based as far as a wreck-based um similarity i can kind of go on um as far as the cbd um not as high of pain relief but it still is working it helps i am enjoying it and it's um doing what it needs to do so i would recommend it again although i think i like the balanced bisolate better but still a good product and i'm really interested to know what co2 um winterized thc is so uh i might do a video on that in the future who knows if i can find someone that can tell me something more about it that'd be really interesting and if you really like this video you find it these informational or informative and they help you or you just like watching me make a fool of myself or give recommendations as far as what i'm finding helpful now what i find helpful may not be helpful for someone else but it may be so that's why i'm sharing this information and so if you like it click subscribe follow along and i'll bring you more informational things i also want to just um say one more quick thing about this i didn't put it in and it's i know it's at the end of the video it's absolutely terrible with me but one thing i did find with this one that i'm not super happy about is it does give you fairly dry mouth i want to add that in just because i normally don't find it too big in a too big of an issue but whereas this one i find i'm like constantly drinking stuff just to keep moist just something [Music] [Applause] else", "_zL_uHV6fQQ": "all right y'all today i'm gonna be making a video on the friendly farms cured resin cartridge this is some gmo so let's get straight into it all right y'all so this is the friendly farms and gmo cartridge this is going to be cure resin they have a live resin version and then they have a um cured resin version so there's going to be the cured version um i don't know what the difference is i never personally had live resin one but uh somebody tell me what's the difference between cured resin and live resin because i'm pretty curious to see or if actually i'll probably just look it up and put it up right now but this is this is what the packaging is going to be looking like man like i said gmo is going to be an indica it's going to be a black box with a yellow writing that's kind of what they're known for that their main color is a yellow so it's gonna have that up front fresh cure liquid you guys can pause that to read it it says uh farm friend all natural from plant to pan no additives distill it free and this is the bag looks pretty cool in the back i'll put a picture of it [Music] and the top is just the uh sticker of the dispensary that i got it from i got it from a firehouse in sherlock california um west west main street turn like california i forgot the address but it's called firehouse uh just look it up on we maps um so when you open so to open the package it's gonna so to open the package you're gonna have to rip the sticker right here and then you just open it like this and it's gonna come with the cart in there and it comes with this piece of paper uh i'm not sure if it's actually scanning or some [ __ ] to receive fifty percent off or something i don't know something or something like so my honest thoughts about this opinion so my honest opinion so my honest thoughts about this pen man i will not get this card again and i don't recommend that you guys get it um this card as you guys can see i'll give you guys a closer look right but the now on this is [ __ ] horrible man the taste of this reminds me of taking the hit from a dirty bomb like that's exactly what it tastes like dirty weed from a dirty ball or it tastes like good weed hitting it from a dirty ass bong you know what i'm saying uh you guys here with a bong if you guys have hit a bomb before like that you guys know exactly what i'm talking about but uh the guy told me this was his favorite one but i caught cap i think he was just saying that you know so i could get so he could like sell me like sell me this um this tastes like trash man i let all my friends hit it and they do not like the taste but i will say nah i'm gonna say this this is probably one of the worst pens i've had um this is better than the jeter cart for sure it gets you way higher than the jeter cart and the only way i'm able to enjoy this pen is by doing uh the the dab cap with the with the bong because it gets rid of the flavor and that way you're able to get a lot higher without the nasty flavor and one thing about this is i forgot where it said on the i think it was on the box or maybe it's on this paper that it says in hell for one second using a low voltage battery 2.0 through 2.7 volts recommended repeat this step after a couple of minutes if you like if you would like a stronger effect adjust your battery to under three volts and inhale for four three through six seconds let the cartridge cool for 30 to 60 seconds between hits to ensure that that you do not burn the oil so with that being said the maximum that i recommend you hit this car is like five seconds um i haven't hit a blinker of it yet just because i don't want to burn the oil and there's so much left but i'll probably take a blinker of it for you guys just for the video just so you guys can see and i'll let you guys know it tastes like burp and so that way you guys don't have to do it yourself but i'll recommend using at least the max 3 3.3 volts max i believe this one is vaping at 3.3 volts in the lowest setting which is green and then i have another honeydew battery which also smokes at 3.3 i don't have anything lower than that so that's all i was able to use but for me it's been working fine even though they did say to not use a battery above 3 volts so if you guys have that problem just 3.3 is max i would recommend so you guys have a 3.3 volt battery you guys are good don't need to worry about that um but the flavor man i had to give it like a three like a three out of like a three or four out of ten man horrible horrible flavor um the high i would have to give it like a five uh maybe like a five and a half um like i said it's one of the worst cards i've had but not the worst um i would recommend a lot of cards over this daisy kingpin select a lot of things i would recommend before this and i had a lot of friends telling me not to go not to get it but i have not made a video on it so i wanted to see for myself and it turns out they were right i have yet to try the live resident win so i'm not sure about that one but this one man the uh cured resin is a no go for me man i have not tried the editing labs yet though so i don't know how that would work but um sorry for my long hair too man i'm about to get a haircut on i haven't cut the top of my hair for over a year and a half and for or like about a year and a half and i'm gonna go get an undercut on the sides real quick so next time when when you guys i'm gonna upload a dispensary video if you guys didn't see the video i just uploaded before this one i'm gonna make it uh i'm gonna film the dispensary run today and i'm gonna have my hair cut in here so you guys can see how fresh i'm gonna look for the ladies watching if there even is any but um but yeah man like i said do not recommend this car just um if you tried a lot of carts already and like this is one of the only ones you haven't tried or this is all you could get it's not that bad to the point where it's like if you haven't had it um you know don't get it like go get it see if you like it it's worth getting it it's gonna get you high you won't i'm not saying you won't be disappointed but you won't regret that you bought it because i don't regret that i bought it just because i've never had it you feel what i'm saying but uh yeah man if you guys were just wondering this is a good card and it's not so get another one but if you want to try it i would recommend to try it because who knows you might like it um everybody you know likes different stuff so let's take a hit of this cart man and so you guys can see some cloud production i'll take a blinker right off the rip i've never done it like i said because i don't want to burn the oil but hopefully it doesn't burn the oil and if it does you guys don't have to burn your oil because i'm doing it for you so let's take a hit with my dirty ass rig if you guys haven't seen my dab cat video make sure to go watch it you just put any type of pants dizzy plug and play any type of pen circular anything you put it on there then you grab your rig put it just like like this into the hole and take a rip so i'm gonna take a bleeder for you guys ready cheers came up that's my first hit of the day too first time the day took a blinker like i said i've never took a blinker from this car and i've had it for like a week already so holy [ __ ] so like i said man it's not a bad car by any means but i would definitely i'm not gonna buy this car again for sure it was cool to try it though because i was really curious i've been debating on buying this for a couple couple months now so it's cool that i got it um so like i said man buy this at your own risk you guys really want to try it you guys might like it who knows but if you guys want to take my word and you guys [ __ ] my channel and [ __ ] like i like [ __ ] my channel but like if you guys want to take like if you guys believe my word i wouldn't get this man there's a lot of stuff that you could get um besides this oh

[Music]", "f0Smg5V8nKg": "hey y'all trevor here with ride of the leaf and today we're going to be diving into a 5 10 cart from the back 40 you guys this uh new er new newer lp on the alberta market has uh forbidden fruit for its cartridge i'm really curious to see how it's gonna do and uh how it's gonna taste you guys so let's get this intro in here and dive into this cartridge before we uh before we go into our friday sativa strain review i'll see you guys on the other side of the intro where we're diving into the forbidden fruit cartridge by back 40. cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we're going to be diving into forbidden fruit from back 40. i'm really curious to see how uh how these cartridges are going to do they aren't a company i heard very much about but the packaging is very interesting and unique to this company the cartridge feels like it's got kind of a unique shape um forbidden fruit and cushmits being um the end of oh i i almost forgot about the super lemon haze so the super lemon haze forbidden fruit and cushman's from uh back 40 seem like really interesting strains come out with really rich flavorful strains potentially and honestly it just seems like a fun company to dive into and see how it's gonna do and after we did the sativa last week we're gonna be diving into an indica this week so the only information that i was able to find quickly for this strain review is on the global news wire it's an article about the back 40 company and it just has a little bit of information for each of its cartridges so we're just going to quickly rattle off for all three leading off with the forbidden fruits the one we're going to dive into before we go into the actual information on this package and then into our full review you guys so forbidden fruit is an indica with citrus and earthy taste notes from the d limonene and maracinine botanical terpenes cushman's is their hybrid option with a refreshing burst of mint taste with menthol and d-lemonine botanical terpenes and super lemon haze is a sativa packed citrus and floral taste with botanical terpenes of d-limonene terpinaline maracinine and carefully so this one we're gonna be getting a uh citrusy earthy combination i'm really interested to see how that combination is gonna do you guys we uh have that package ripped open there we are going to get the urban scale intro in here right after we give the information off the package 80 thc 00 cbd and a package date of september 19th you guys it's time to get into the full-blown urban scale i'll see you on the other [Music] side [Music] get this open comes with a nice simple package on the outside and all in all the cartridge itself is nice simple design good really interesting red mouthpiece on it but i don't mind the overall design of the cartridge we can get this thc sticker off you guys so you know exactly what i'm oh this one doesn't want to come off easily okay look at that clear sticker off let's try the other side i don't think this one's going to come off quickly and easily guys okay let's just forget about that and we're going to dive right into the taste from a g pen you guys just because like i said in the last one the fireside battery died on us so we are stuck just with the g pen until we can get some more 510 batteries in stock at the shop for me to be able to grab one but the way we do our taste through the vape is we run it with the lowest temperature talk about it a little bit then the medium temperature talk about it for a bit and then we run it to the highest temperature and finally talk about it through a bit there i find each temperature has a little bit of a different experience a little bit of a different flavor and that's why we break down like that after we then go through the glass and do the exact same thing all three temperatures through each piece of glass to see each experience and overall development of flavor as you dive deeper into the cartridge you guys and after that we give it the score for the g pen the glass and a score out of 10 for the high we are going to be using the more updated score the scoring system where that one to two range is gonna be non-smokable that three to four is going to be on the harsher side but it can still have some enjoying points five to six is going to be the tolerable where the enjoyment is starting to outweigh the negatives that seven to eight is going to be the enjoyable and more optimal place for these to want to aim for and the 9 out of 10 is pristine and that's really going to be my personal preference the my upper echelons of the buds this was recommended by some viewers and it seems like everyone enjoyed it the last time when we dove into it with the concentrate so we're gonna do it with the cartridge this time you guys but we've got the bak 40 forbidden fruit indica dominant cartridge on here we uh we should dive into this you guys and see how it's gonna do i'm really curious haven't heard much about this company but i enjoyed this strain when i smoked it from quest in the bud form so now it's time to see how it'll do in the concentrate form from back for you guys cheers and i will see you on the other side when uh we've got the first taste of this forbidden fruit cart down and out cheers wow you guys so first experience on this you did kind of get that earthy almost even kind of leafy that urban herb kind of taste the green greens of a plant kind of taste and then it hits you with this really heavy um citric not necessarily um not necessarily like a sweet lemon but more like crystallized lemon or lemon juice like the really tart and almost cool lemon citric attack for the flavor and that really was what it was it was an attack on my taste buds and i enjoyed it quite a bit you guys but it was different for the experience i've got the second temperature loaded up on here let's dive in and see how this forbidden fruit crossover of that kind of earthy leafy taste with the lemon is on the second half you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side hey guys so i found it had a really similar experience at this level too it really does balance a little bit better at the medium level it wasn't so much of an attack of that lemon flavor but more of a rush like it was like taking a drink of a lemonade that has too much too many lemons squeezed into it not enough sugar was really what it was or um like the straight lime curse out that you get in the bottle but they let like an extra sour tart edition of it or just straight lime juice like that kind of flavor and honestly it's it's enjoyable to have that wave of citrus but i wish it had a little bit of a sweeter touch to it just honestly for my purple personal preference but it's been enjoyable so far we've got the highest temp now ready to go let's dive into it and see how it's going to uh taste and overall how this g pen is going to score you guys i'll see you on the other side of this last rip before we dive into the glass side of the review guys um okay wow that actually kind of developed or deteriorated depending on the person that's looking at it i personally really am enjoying it and it does have an overall quite enjoyable experience but it's leaning more to that asset licorice flavor for me at that highest temp which was not something i expected at all it was not something i could have expected from this cartridge especially when we were getting that really earthy flavor into that really tart lemon combo i i didn't think a kind of an anise licorice combo would will come out of that but it's not bad it's just all in all different so i'll give it us you know what i am going to give it a 7 out of 10 because it wasn't enjoyable it definitely was enjoyable with the 7 out of 10. it just at the last one it was a little bit kind of like what so i would i would definitely enjoy hauling out of this at the lower temperatures as more of a sipping cartridge not really a like the tropic girl scout cookies from last week that's a haul cartridge but for this week this one's a sipper now we're going to sip our way through the glass we've got six rips to dive into you guys i think i'm gonna cough a lot on this one but uh what what can we do about it let's uh dive into it and see how this cartridge does when you add a little bit of some water filtration on it first two rips we're just gonna press the button and haul the last one we will preheat before we press that button so that we are taking it at the highest level because why not experience it all this ain't pokemon but it's a good hell of a good stoner close-up don't try and catch them all let's try and smoke them all cheers y'all let's dive into it so we pre-heat that last one let's dive into it y'all cheers okay guys we're about halfway through this and i've got a theory i'm working on it we've got three more wheat three more weeks we've got three more rips that will really make the determination on uh whether my theory is right or not um i'll let you guys know at the end but uh hopefully i don't get too high and forget i don't think i will but i'll see you guys on the other side of the next three reps cheers well folks let's let's dive into it again cheers lowest highest i'll see you on the other side and we'll talk about my theory let's dive into it last time preheat it and dive into it cheers okay guys now should i give you the score or should i give you my theory first you know what i'll give you the score and then i'll work it into my theory afterwards i think that'll be the best way to do it so the score is going to be a 6 out of 10. so it's right on that top upper end of the tolerable side now that actually does feed quite well right into my theory so most of these 510 cartridges are going to be heating up to 0.15 of your oil in the chamber that actually has the wick and he is heated and vaporizing every time so with a review like this where i'm pounding out this many um this many rips between 20 to 30 minutes i'm breaking down the terpenes and not giving the cartridge enough time to cool down and really have everything balance out um to give it the optimal flavor between rips however i think this is going to be allowing me to review the the cartridge a little bit more honestly because if the flavor is just as good on the 12th with 12 13 14 15 rip of this review if we have the second battery 12 if we if we don't um if it just there's there's just disappointment when the the oil and everything starts to break down earlier and that's that's really why i think the way i'm smoking it is going to give you guys a more more honest review because that oil and the flavor should hold up and really the tropic girl scout cookies from last week that's going to be my card to compare because not only did it hold up on that review it's still holding up today it's a little bit softer on the flavor but not much definitely a lot less loss in flavor than i was originally expected so it's still doing incredibly well in a lot higher standard than i was originally expecting but it it did really well you guys and that's why this cartridge is going to get that 6 out of 10. now moving on into the high i'm going to give it a 6 out of 10 as well it was somewhat enjoyable until we got about the second rip into the glass you guys and then i started to get this creeping headache and every time i sipped that a card out afterwards it just built and built and built and now it's a really heavy kind of back of my head headache that creeps into my neck and it just kind of tension my shoulders and in my traps and it just it's not enjoyable you guys and i i'm not having that bit of a time however on the lower level this is a really nice card i am feeling that this card would do incredibly well as a complimentary or a balancing card where you're smoking it and there's something else that there's something else that you're smoking with it to get that heavier high and honestly it's it's enjoyable and it is something that i would consider trying again but it's not something i would consider buying again you guys um but the other two cartridges from back 40 definitely would be interesting to try out i've heard the cushions is quite minty quite menthol experience and i was a fan of the house too that was like that and i'm just a fan of that really cooling mint experience so we might have to go and check that one out as well but for the time being you guys we're going to wrap this one up tomorrow it is looking like we are going to be reviewing the uh mimosa strain from wink i'm really excited to try that one out it's been a while since i've smoked the most strain from a new lp or a new producer so let's see how it holds up because we've got citizen stash and best buds to compare it to so let's see if it does well you guys but for the time being we're going to wrap this one up when my end card slides in all you got to do is hover over my logo and click that subscribe button when you do click the bell notification beside it so you know anytime one of my videos goes live and i really do appreciate it that you can uh check it out six days a week worth of content what we're aiming for you guys and lately we've been getting damn close to hitting it every single week we're going to keep pushing for it every single week but bottom few videos when they slide in are going to be the most recently updated the most recommended for you please go and check out either those videos if not both of them and uh enjoy it guys but for the time being cheers y'all and i'll be back later with some more content you", "hTzY6fHWiH4": "hey everyone so for the last few months I've had the opportunity to try a lot of new CBD products but I haven't posted anything because I haven't really tried anything interesting until now when I finally found a CBD vape pen that I really love from joy organics which has been one of my favorite CBD companies for a while now I'll admit I have a lot less experience with vaping CBD than I do with other types of CBD products I've tried almost everything but for the last few years I've primarily stuck to CBD oils and pills for my daily CBD regimen now I have found CBD vapes that I liked before like the pens and cartridges from CB distillery that I've reviewed previously I just never really loved the vaping experience itself but a few weeks ago joy organics sent me one of their full-spectrum and also THC free CBD vape pens to try and I finally understand just how wonderful vape CBD can be when it's at its best so now that I've nearly finished the vape cartridges they sent me and I've had a while to test it out in a wide variety of situations I wanted to share my experiences with everyone because it's the first CBD vape pen that has actually helped me to manage my Munir symptoms and tinnitus in a meaningful way so before I go any further I want to just quickly explain what CBD is and also why and how I use it for tinnitus and Meniere's disease in case this is the first time that any of you are hearing of this so CBD is one of a hundred and thirteen different cannabinoids or active compounds found in the marijuana cannabis hemp plant and on its own it's non psychoactive which means you will not get high from consuming CBD products yet it's believed to be a lot of to be responsible for many of the medicinal effects of cannabis in marijuana and when I take CBD it doesn't directly reduce my tinnitus a quiet my tinnitus or reduce my other mini\u00e8re symptoms but it relieves my anxiety and lowers my stress levels more than any other supplement I've ever tried and because Meniere's disease and tinnitus is so severely worsened by stress and anxiety CBD ends up making a huge difference in my quality of life it also helps me to better cope in the middle of difficult moments by immediately calming me down but let's get back to the review so first things first let's talk about the packaging and design so I was impressed with the joy organics vape pen from the moment I opened the box so you can see the box it comes like this it's a small white box the packaging and design are are beautiful in a minimalist kind of way so it comes the package includes a white battery a prefilled cartridge with a white mouthpiece and a USB charger for the battery now assembling the pen couldn't be easier you simply remove the battery and the cartridge screw together and inhale there's no buttons or moving parts of any kind and it turns on when you inhale and it turns off when you stop and I think the sleek sort of minimalist design really adds to the charm of using this thing now the vaping experience in my opinion is what really sets this pen apart it's incredibly smooth almost every other CBD pen that I've tried has sort of like an unpleasant harshness to the vapor that makes me cough and sort of irritates my lungs a little bit but not the case with this pen coughing and lung irritation I should say are not a deal-breaker for me but it's just so much nicer when it feels smooth going in now the flavor is also excellent they joy organics cause the flavour light citrus breeze and I think that's a good description every hit has a sort of subtle citrus like couldn't pinpoint what citrus fruit exactly but citrus undertones that add to the experience without overpowering it it's it's a very subtle flavor but it's nice and I find it's that it really makes this pen and a delight to use and and and to hit there's no like harshness to it in any way the strength of the effect is the other way in which this vape pen really shines like all the other products that joy organics offers it's made with full spectrum hemp extract that is also THC free thanks to this some final step in the manufacturing process that removes a hundred percent of the th from the end product and I have nothing against the trace amounts of THC in in many full spectrum hemp products but I know that this is important to a lot of you so I wanted to mention it and the end results thanks to the fact that it's full spectrum is that it's a much more effective CBD product than other vapes that are made with CBD isolate which is what I've tried in the past which is purified CBD powder now vape CBD doesn't last as long as other means of ingestion but it's the fastest onset by far within a minute or two of of hitting this I feel a subtle calm and kind of warmth wash over me and my muscles relieving a lot of my anxiety and stress and it doesn't impair me at all either if anything the reduced anxiety in the moment helps me to focus because I'm not as stressed out or my minds not racing with other things and while it only lasts for about an hour or so when you vape CBD it's usually more than enough to help me deal with whatever difficulty I'm facing in any given moment so as you can probably tell I am obsessed with this vape pen and I can't recommend it enough truly especially if you have experience with other CBD products and you found them helpful for you since receiving it this pen has become a powerful part of my Meniere's and tinnitus coping toolkit and I find myself keeping it on me pretty much at all times like just to have it just in case I also plan to purchase additional cartridges once this one is finished the only real drawback here is the price it's definitely a premium product and they charged the current price right now is $99 for a package that includes a four hundred and fifty milligrams art regeni uh but it is a premium experience and it's and it's it's worked for me way better than any other vape pen I've tried so for me it's worth the price so I hope you guys give this a shot and if you try it be sure to let us know what you think in the comments or if you have any other vape pens that you've tried CBD vape pens we'd love to hear about those too thanks everyone have a great day", "gqY_DHAQzVY": "[Music] what up y'all step [ __ ] can of meat ha I got filling today man [ __ ] today we gonna be doing a review about [ __ ] outcomes here okay now before we get into of course you know I'm gonna ask you [ __ ] subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody I got I'm at like 61 subscribers right now so you could be the lucky number 62 so anyway seriously I really do appreciate everybody that supported me thus far make sure you hit that thang so you can get a notification anytime I post some yeah so let's get into this [ __ ] man so yeah man we got the alcohol right here this is a seal - sauce okay while co2 extracted sauce that they put into the cartridge this is like my third one I got I know my I didn't wait for you guys I'm like I didn't argue went through these [ __ ] I like them sheesh it's a bomb I really do dig these shits in my opinion they're kind of like what I do when I make my own I'm sure they probably do some other [ __ ] too but I think it's kind of like something - the same thing like when I make my own [ __ ] fake [ __ ] so you can check that out in the box of how to do that on your own if you want to make your own baby juice but sometime I still have to [ __ ] with other people's [ __ ] anyway so this one that supposedly has no additives they also grow their own [ __ ] and as a matter of fact if you're trying to get your own extract company going you might want to holler at them because they also help other people develop their own companies so let's get into it let's see right here I got the sherbert which is a hybrid and cuz someone was asking me if I only do sativa sees Samantha I'm getting closer to the indica side I'm [ __ ] in because every once in a while but I'd be able to [ __ ] to do so I don't like to be sleep that's how I usually stick with like a city where I ever and I'm just the uppity mob like I like them yep I like that you know me have some energy in my [ __ ] so is what the inside looks like when you take the insert out I ain't gonna front I feel some of these companies are getting out of hand with packaging I just think there's more and more [ __ ] that they add again which means that you paying more and more for packaging versus what you actually are trying to buy I've seen some very elaborate about packaging this one isn't too bad though but I've seen some packaging out there just my buddy you came into the extreme but this one's pretty cool this one's easy and I know there's also guidelines that you have to follow for child safety when it comes to packaging as well but some of that [ __ ] is just [ __ ] you really so anyway all right let's see this is a half grammar here now look how thick this is I love the thickness of it nothing I don't [ __ ] all over the place so I don't know how well you guys can see that I don't know this [ __ ] helped by putting my hand behind that [ __ ] for it to focus but it is very very very very thick so what I like to do when I use this one is I notice that it's better if I use my rolled battery oh you like this [ __ ] I've got this little thing hanging on it so boom like a rocket where am i okay that [ __ ] is gangster right so what I do on this one I like to use the rope because it has to preheat setting on it so I can do a little preheat so I could make the liquid just a little bit more viscous for you boy so I can blaze it a little better so we're just gonna what is it two clicks yeah so we're just gonna use that so that could do a little preheat and you might even see it start to get a little bit thinner I don't know if you can see that but is work and I see a little bit of vapor coming up so I'm gonna interrupt the pre because I'm impatient I just wanted to get a little bit preheated so anyway my really high waves thing about the Vegas I gotta interrupt the video I forgot about some side to come back later and add the scent I didn't even read to you my magazine like the facts of the goddamn package like okay so this [ __ ] is testing THC wise at 63% so Lissa has about 316 milligrams of THC in there okay CBD less than one per one milligram so it's not really anything strong however I do like that they did put their terpenes how much how many how much are the terpenes right here so you have 30 milligrams of terpenes so you always want to pay attention to terpene it doesn't say exactly with what terpene profile it is I don't think no it doesn't say it doesn't give you a terpene profile but always keep in mind that the terpene profile is really really important because that's where you get a lot of your effects of your high a lot of people think is the CAC is not just the TAC two TAC is only one kind of but only from the plant that's actually taking effect on but you always have to think about the terpenes terpenes think of it like lavender how the eye lavender it gets you in like a more calm and restful mood you got terpenes to do the same thing that it gets you either more energetic like first you got mercy now this a lot o I'm not going to go to terpenes I'll actually do a video about turkeys alright so anyway let's get back to the normal video bottoms up [ __ ] beautiful tasty cool I can't do [ __ ] money well seriously I really think if you could get your hands on this [ __ ] you would really like it but I hate when I call the lot cuz it make my eyes are watery and then I get hot anyway yes it does taste just like sherbert sauce that because I've had some sherbert sauce for my caramel phil was dying back darn bagger a Artur place I can't remember anyway I had a [ __ ] sherbert sauce that was [ __ ] fire and it tastes very sure Bertie this one right here I would say on a scale of 1 to 10 the sherbert II taste is probably like a like a 7 which is good for me I don't like my [ __ ] to be all the way up out of 10 because I don't I always say I don't like my babes tasting like [ __ ] pretty pebbles and [ __ ] I'm growing as mother [ __ ] man so I do like my [ __ ] to have some of whatever we taste but I'm okay if they throw a little bit of flavor in there depending on you know how strong it is as long as it's not overbearing those are right here this is a very very good throat hit it's not like harsh on the throat or anything like that if you take bigger hits obviously you coffee but if you take a smaller hit you ain't got to worry about that the box actually suggests if you do a three-second draw exhale and then wait 15 minutes but [ __ ] out anyway no goddamn 15 minutes mother I got it so we about to get another hit but I can already feel it right now like it's already feeling like I can feel myself going up I haven't smoked anything today so this is my first smoke of the day I honestly love these shits I think they're like I think 30 or 40 aground for a 1/2 gram but there was a deal going on at my job where it was like you buy one get one so course your boy jumped on that one and so uh yeah actually was pretty bummed so they're not yeah so I've gone through some of them but I've been digging them big-time now definitely what this one don't leave his mother by gammac are you a supposedly nutty old waves in the car but this one I'm telling you because it when you know it's thick so it kind of gels up kind of like the rolls used to be where it would like gel up cuz it was so thick so if you leave it in the car I left I left one in the car on accident players [ __ ] up I know man I [ __ ] up all the time and I left my [ __ ] in the car and when I came back a lot of it was going it was like [ __ ] just picked up and evaporated or something I don't know what the [ __ ] happened I was like somebody broke in my car and just smoked my vape and then left I look like that like it just evaporated it was weird it didn't happen with the yellow but it happened with I'm Adam leave over the car so I definitely suggest do not lead these [ __ ] in the car like I say that's a rule of thumb with all banks but that is a huge one with this [ __ ] with the sauce in it because it will just [ __ ] pick up and bounce on yo ass and you'll come back like where my shaco and Italy you and know like I'm out of this [ __ ] so make sure that you don't leave this [ __ ] in the car but anyway man [ __ ] I guess that's the end of this one he must just say it's just a [ __ ] fake what else could I say but oh you know what I will say I have been [ __ ] with something with plastic tips where the tip would get hot when you [ __ ] taking drugs on it the tips on this doesn't don't get hot these are that fake plastic so you don't have to worry about that [ __ ] happening so anyway out of here [ __ ] that's the end of this [ __ ] I we'll be bringing more [ __ ] I'm done with my move pretty much so now was just all unpacking and trying to you know decorate but I got me a nice little production production room here so I got [ __ ] laying everywhere man I [ __ ] DJ equipment sitting around I just got [ __ ] all over the [ __ ]

originally my strategy with videos was to basically make one video per brand essentially didn't even really get into multiple videos per strains um mostly just to show you that so you got a brand you searched it up on youtube or you saw it at the dyspo before you bought it search it up on youtube and just verify that they don't make some crap or they're not basically gonna scam you for some booty that you don't want um but i've been having a lot a lot of people say that they want more videos more often and i kind of want to make some more honestly more frequently than i do so i'm going to start making a video basically every time i get a cart or a concentrate if i can or as frequently as i can to that anyways so um i'm not doing the editing on this one i'm gonna re-download my editing software and stuff but for this one i don't feel like it needs it too much because there's not very much packaging to even go over let's start with the hush brand cartridge because i was really surprised with the last one that i got so i picked up another one so um i got this one at beaver bulls where are we at let's see if i can get it to focus there we go phone's actually focusing uh purple cali cush cannabis extract cartridge try that again um this is one gram container uh contains rather 77 points 77 percent thc there we go 77 point actually the 770 milligrams dhc excuse me i can't talk today um then the cbd is 22 milligrams total i believe that puts it at 0.22 percent i don't remember how to work that i'm not thinking clearly um you got all your production info on there and then compliance labels and stuff but other than that it doesn't come with much it's very bare bones for a cart um you got the price there before tax which this dyspo does a lot do before attacks some do after etc anyways and here's the cartridge itself you can see that's some really nice looking distillate which this looks hard to screw up but at the lower um lower price points you will find just like i assume it's made from trim that's even worse off so it just requires more starting material allowing more contaminants in total like chlorophyll and just well everything that's not desirable and you know with distillation i don't know that it matters maybe it's just they got better with their process don't know what the situation is all i know is in my opinion they got better here's the you got um got two silicone caps and then you got the compliance label which i always tear off or peel off whatever and this little weed sticker got these like everywhere all right let's see if i can get some better pictures of this i got a sun lamp right now which is doing nothing but making my eyes look gorgeous nothing for the weed though um let's do some different colors put it in front of super clean um super clear what got me into this was i actually got a cart a couple days ago and it was even better than this one i don't remember the strain i think it was like um maui papaya or something like that um all right well i'm throwing everything i can't speak or grab anything right now apparently um that's the one that i was talking about same same deal basically but yeah i tried them out and they were readily better than i remember them so i wanted to make a video plus i just want to get into making some anyways so let's see if i can't taste some terpenes on this the other one was very interesting terpene wise that's also something i was grateful for they normally have some basic ass servings but this last one they had um i definitely tasted some one of the more exotic terpenes i'll say i don't remember what it was though the consistency is really nice on this dude's gotten a little better i'm using a mirror behind my phone so that i can point it straight at me so bear with me as i look that way and i hit super nice these are up there now with like what i call gold standard distillate cards because like i said distill it's hard to [ __ ] up so once you get to a certain point it doesn't really get any better it's just like as good as it gets and that's really not hard to achieve either but somehow people occasionally mess it up but you got like buddies and select those cards are just distill it how it's supposed to be done hush is getting up there they're pretty dang close now other than the fact that buddies and select have better hardware i want to say it's very close for this one sadly the terpenes i'm only really getting some pretty heavy mirror scene it tastes like a lot of purple strains for sure which that might be something different yeah these cards are solid um i just wanted to get another video out because i want to start putting out more so i hope you enjoyed this like and subscribe and stay tuned and i'll put out more and ideally better ones soon thanks for watching", "zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "JYYGI7j-eRU": "[Music] alright YouTube man what's going on with that weather out there one day it's cold and another day I'm out there sweating [ __ ] right look warm out there man trun around I went

have the box somewhere oh yeah that's the same cart look at this look at the pretty beautifulness color beautiful blue cloudy in spots alright cloudy and spots but you know that that's probably just some sitting around and like rusting I hope oh it is a sauce cart is exactly the same look at you see right there it's like literally uh they took it took like wax and put in there I had a super dope

discovered a few months ago this is the second cartridge that I have bought the first one was a King Louie absolutely loved the flavor on it got every single last bit out of it there was no waste with this one it tasted so good this one that I recently purchased is the purple blue dream equally tasty equally tasty supposed to be a hybrid I kind of feel like it's more of a like an indica based hybrid I don't know if that's just me or if that's really the way it is but that's kind of I I like this for the afternoons for the evenings before bed anyways there the packaging is pretty interesting it's got a little bit of a mission statement on the inside a little bit of history the packaging is pretty cool I don't know you can't see much on the back because they put the THC info sticker on the back but it does give you the basic information it is manufactured by us CP which is also the manufacturer of the Oklahoma tonic which I absolutely adore this dust really good it's good for trying to relax it helps me relax it it actually affects you a little different than it edible does I don't know if it's because this is a liquid and the way your body processes that I don't know I just know it's good I have bought three of these now really good stuff but let's get back to the 1937 brand cartridges the cartridges are always completely full when I buy them there is no little gap like there is in some brands I've been smoking on this for a week and that is how much it's gone down I like the I'm sorry I like the packaging the mouthpiece is around only thing I don't like is there's never a mouthpiece guard I kind of want a garden like a little rubber thing that goes over the top of it but still a good a good a good design I guess this is magnetic this is the excess snap I really like it it fits in the palm of my hand it's kind of just straight if you ever you know just just discreet nobody can really see it except for maybe the mouthpiece and still yet it can be very discreet I love this thing because you can look in through there it protects I really like this because it protects but yet you can look through there and see exactly how much juice you know is left and there is nothing that makes me happier than looking in there and seeing it completely yellow I mean completely full one of the best feelings in the world so anyway skies it's about 4:20 in the afternoon so cheers cheers Cheers hmm he's taste really good they have a different taste to them something unique I'm not I'm not sure how to describe it other than it's a lovely flavor I have tried the helix brand I have tried the Arcadia brand and I have tried the Oklahoma pure brand so far 19:37 has them beat pretty good I mean the helix was good but they're not readily available in this area these are available they're affordable and I really like them the oil in them is clearly I mean it just it does not move and that's something I like I have seen them like the Arcadia brand and was I mean it was terrible it do this and it just instantly air bubbles and it was moving I don't like that I want it to be really thick it lets me know that it's not being cut of course you know the packaging kind of tells you a little bit about it it says the product is derived from THC distillate and cannabinoids or cannabis derived terpenes THC content is 85% terpene content is 5% it also says the product has been tested for can't a minute keep out of reach of children contains THC now say for kids or pet manufactured by us CP LLC and then on the back of course you've just got like I said the THC sticker that they put on everything here in Obama so yeah cheers guys so what's everybody doing for the 4th of July comment down below I love the fourth of July if you're still watching I

west coast weed tour review today we've got jazzasaurus here with me reviewing a special product today the amigo cannabis sativa vape cartridge the passion fruit strain we've got the custom amigo vape battery check this out you guys super dope beautiful packaging right nice and vibrant and then i'll show you guys this this amigo packaging here check that out super dope super dope so jazzy's going to read off some of the information about it i'm pretty sure it's disliked but not sure 3.19 milligrams cbd okay total of 467 milligrams thc oh wow um manufacturer day august 10th of this year what's that percentage on the tac 93.4 oh wow this is a high one this is a high one it says sativa on it so it's the it's the amigo cannabis sativa vape cartridge um amigo cannabis for those that don't know comes from the high note dispensary chain in los angeles so this is one of their brand businesses ecosystem of companies and brands that they have and i honestly love it we went and reviewed another product that came from amigo remember the fruit cart gummies i like those my first time ever having a product with tajin on it um super dope uh i'm excited are you ready we're gonna hit it once and talk about it hit it twice give you guys a 4 out of 10. honest review west coast spoon tuber i'm excited here we go love the battery this is cool batteries a nice beautiful vibrant teal color right soft and then we've got a i've never seen a yellow mouthpiece or orange mouthpiece or an orange vape card so this is super dope how they've done this i love it i love it i love it so do you think it's going to be charged i think so if it's not we're going to hope so give it a good twist they say that brands that pick the battery and that car they go well together and they perform better with the right connection so here we go well it rips that is for sure and it's smooth and there's a lot of flavor the flavor is definitely passion fruity you get a smooth tropical almost like one of those smoothies that you're like oh damn what flavor is this and the person's like oh yeah this one had this [ __ ] fruit this fruit and passion fruit you know what i'm saying i like it i think it tastes pretty good i would buy this it tastes like i bit into a fruit like my aftertaste right now like your mouth or you see that or i feel like i tasted drink it's like a dried fruit thinking about frescoes those drinks you know happy someone finally did passion the battery rips with their cart undeniably i mean i've done two big riffs it's working the price um i don't this is a half gram though so i would assume it's something around 35 critical mind incorporated um super dope amigo i love it what are you thinking i'm i want this you want it yeah i recommend it i usually don't like flavored vapes at all this one tastes really good yeah i like it i think for a flavored distillate vape uh i'm again i'm not sure on the price point but um i feel like i feel like in the vape category again this is just for distillate products and although this is probably botanically derived trip is to say on the side what it is anyway probably not so what does it say contains cannabis and terpenes specific yeah it contains cannabis and terpenes so it's specific enough to say that it's not cannabis terpenes it's very clear uh in regards to at least that and for me that you know no terpene profile it's not it's not real cannabis terps uh it doesn't say single source and so who knows where the dislike came from for this but i still think with all those questions considered this is the the best version of itself is a product like this so distillate with botanical terps beautiful packaging really cool vape cart the outro card is super cool it's gonna it's gonna stand out you're gonna see that card you're gonna be like damn that was that amigo one quality yeah i think from head to toe it's great i'm gonna give it with all things considered again no terps some of the information on the packaging um you know i'm going to give it a solid 8.5 i think that's about as high as you can really get for a distillate with botanical terpene product great branding would totally recommend it it's a half gram it's affordable if this if you are someone who's already vaping distillate if you're already vaping botanical fruity flavors this is one you've got a [ __ ] try you've got to it shits fire if you like steezy you gotta try this i think they come out with something with pineapple anything just pineapple yeah we definitely gotta try more strange so drop a comment let us know what you guys think i'm sitting at 8.5 where are you at uh 8.6 8.6 so she loves it i like it uh we're gonna try it we're gonna go visit and get some more so thank you high note appreciate y'all for the love make sure you guys like follow subscribe do what y'all gotta do give us some recommendations for products to try in the comments appreciate y'all i'll see you all down the road man we're supposed to be tour baby peace", "FSI-zShYMk0": "hey guys Breanna here bringing you your first how-to video from a PC so we have had a lot of inquiries from you guys on how to initially set up your vape pen for the first time so today I'm gonna demonstrate that for you so when you get your delivery it'll come in a prescription bag that looks something like this and inside you should have a battery that'll come in a package like this and a cannabis cartridge of some sort which will be like this when you remove your battery from the packaging you will find two parts one will be this top part which is actually how you charge your battery and this bottom skinny part is going to be your actual vape battery so you'll go ahead and unscrew these two and your battery comes already with a fourth of charge so that way you can enjoy it immediately upon getting it at this point you should be ready to open up your cannabis cartridge and you will find it to look something like this every cannabis cartridge is going to have security coverings on it for safety reasons at this point you should have removed the safety covering on the bottom as well as your charger from the top and now we're ready to connect these you will just screw it in and you're probably curious how do you turn it on so there's this power button right here and it's important to remember that you will always click it five times when you want to turn it on or when you want to turn it off so 1 2 3 4 5 and when you see it light up like that you know you're ready to officially start vaping so you will put it up to your mouth and you will hold this button down wow you inhale and there you have it that's how you set up your vape pen for the first time so after you've been using your vape pen for a while you're gonna have to charge it and that's where this piece comes in handy you will go ahead and screw it in and then you can charge it by plugging it in to your average computer or into a cell phone block you might have lying around as always with any of your cannabis related questions it's as easy as a PC", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now",

[ __ ] with 7/10 labs so I expect this to be a pretty good experience here's what it looks like with the battery that you have to buy separately because I don't know any other battery company that makes up pod for this this is [ __ ] weird I don't know any company that has a pod like this and I don't know any battery company that makes a battery like this so this is super unique I don't really think that's a good thing but let me try the pin out before I voice my opinion [Music] that's pretty smooth really doesn't have a crazy taste I hid it until it wouldn't let me hit it anymore it's on a full charge I don't think this battery changes heat settings but it does have like a light indicator here and when it's green it's above 50% then when it's 20 percent to 49 it'll go to blue and then it's at red when it's below 20 percent battery so that's kind of cool you can know where your battery life is actually at all right that hid a little better in swears usually the first date of a car or a pen usually the best one and then it just gets progressively worse but that second head was way nice done the first one I want to point out the definite difference in color between the box and the actual pen like this is a actually angry oily color and then on the box it looks like it's like bright yellow I've had the Z or Z before I thought it was called C Oz but the guidance offender told me it's called zoz so I've been going with it when I dad did it tasted a lot better than it does out of this pen but this is their cure for which is like their lower level actually believe it's the lowest here I think they just do it 1 2 3 or 4 so that might be one of the taste isn't that great it's not bad but like I've had some cards recently where I'm like damn this is so [ __ ] flavorful and there's light pressing cartridges this is a la Crescent cartridge and I'm really not getting a crazy flavor up [Music] definitely starting to feel the effects a little bit and then nice little head higher I do want to say it is very smooth this is a waste another hit that I really ever expected out of a cartridge this is definitely some new technology I really don't think I like it though like this battery shape I do really like actually it's pretty sleek but the charger and the USBC and like who has that I mean I actually like you so I guess I can't fish but I have one USBC charger in my house and I have like 50 normal USB chargers I don't think a lot of people have USB C charges just laying around like a couple people do but not like the vast majority which is I think what you should still hate or - I know 7/10 laughs is more of a higher-up company but it's just like they were like how could we make this as difficult as possible let's find a pallet battery that nobody has ever used before so people have to buy the battery now let's give them an annoying charger like I don't know I feel like they were just like trying to be annoying when they were making this battery but for all I know in two years this battery is going to be the standard and I'm probably gonna be eating my words and they were totally ahead of the game [Music] this really doesn't give you a long blinkers man the design on this pen is definitely cool it's pretty trippy I like how it kind of wraps around the side of the pen so each side you get a little bit of something like doesn't have that weird no sniffle either I just realized you know how sometimes when you smoke a cartridge you're like really tickles your nose this is not that at all the total THC is 80 point four one percent and the total CBD is 0.1 nine and eighty percent THC is pretty high for a pen actually a lot of especially on the black market a lot of pens though a 97 percent THC and a cartridge and it's like bro if your pen is 97 percent THC like it would not burn them those wicks that is not possible honestly anything above 80 is not gonna burn very easily in a normal cartridge so I've always been wearing when I've seen like 85 90 percent even in the PA market I've seen it before I've seen th see that's like 95 percent THC just to live like tested in a jar and it's like a [ __ ] Rock I just don't see how I could possibly get that in the cartridge damn that is actually Sunday pretty hard now yeah dude 710 labs get your [ __ ] baked sorry for the lack of content on my page recently you guys got some big things on the way I don't want to share them until it's officially out but I'm super excited to share with you what I have going on with popcorn in the near future and obviously when I was in Denver the last week of it we got my dog spayed so I was actually like kind of busy being attentive to her and then since I've been back I've been getting my house ready because my girlfriend's actually moving in with me her lease is up in September but she's just kind of over being in Colorado so she's gonna fly here with Piper next week so I've been getting my house prepared because I've lived here by myself the entire time which there's enough space for both of us but I've definitely spread out all my [ __ ] so I've been consolidating stuff and you know just getting everything prepared so when she moves back here she can just move right in I was thinking about doing another Q&A video too so if there's any questions you have you can leave a comment in the YouTube video I'm gonna try to pull as many off yours I can oh my god man I'm setting to get pretty [ __ ] big I'm not gonna lie oh my god feels good to be back you ever get like so big sometimes that you feel like you're like a different person so and you're like wow I like literally feel like I'm like an alter-ego all of a sudden like I am not the same person I was 20 seconds ago nothing really anything serious it's just like you were like in a bad mood and now all of a sudden you're just carefree like well it is like Jeff too has arrived it is a whole new version of me I remember the first time I took a gigantic dab it was like four weeks into that like I was thinking blobs but like I don't like a half gram that like it was ridiculous and I remember like I was so high but like I was almost tripping if you guys have seen the movie the masks where Jim Carrey has like this alter-ego were he like puts on a green mask and he's like a totally different like crazier person I felt like that was me oh whoa okay I am the man in the mask right now holy [ __ ] like I am lit but usually I'll just get super awkward what am i honestly I'm super awkward when I'm sober it's like a social anxiety I have I just I don't know I don't know what to say sometimes I don't know what to do like what I do with my hands work put like what the [ __ ] I'm just weird brah but please if you ever seen me in public and want to say I feel free to even though I'm a little after it I really don't mind I think it's going to meet you guys it kind of helps but I face the the people I'm making videos for and all I are super [ __ ] chill I don't know what it is but everyone haven't met it's been like nothing but kind of friendly Beckham I say what's up oh but I'm curious how long this is going to take the bat out still looks like there's a decent amount of oil in there two giant air bubbles on this side really doesn't have the best taste though like the highs nice it's okay when you actually think with just a glee about buying your own separate pen having to have this whole separate pot system it's just too much the flavor was alright at first but it's really really lawful flavor it's like resin it's not dis Calypso it should be a little bit better flavor you think but I am getting so high yeah I really honestly think I'd rather just buy gram of 7/10 left like Ross and the BIOS pen and battery I feel like at least at the cost of what it is now I feel like this is going to be more of a gimmicky thing or more for like the heady boys that just want to have it but really isn't for like that everyday smoked beer like this isn't really something you need to have oh I guess where these blinkers aren't too rough on you I'm trying something to spend in one sitting but I don't know if it's gonna happen guys this really shouldn't taste as bad as it does for the amount of oil that's still left in there there's gonna be a long day boys holy [ __ ] that one down what was i that [ __ ] hurt oh my god that was intense but double records how you do it boys oh my god [Music] oh yeah it tastes like [ __ ] that - we'll just burn through it right oh my god I'm getting so I I have to be getting pretty close to the end there's some giant air bubbles in there please and soon and drops in this video if you take one second just like like for me I would really appreciate it it goes a long way you'd be surprised what a like would do so if you're watching any of my videos and you like it please click like I'd really appreciate it this one's for everybody that clicks like triple oh my god hope you got oh that hurts a bad one I do that goddamn whoo it's weird how a pen high is so much different than like a weed high it's looking at joint we're so gonna pen like if I took this many hits of a joint I would be a totally different high it's not like I'm not high though it's just that like a joint just hits different and like weed dabs just hit different than pens I don't know what it is I feel like if I took it dab with the amount of stuff I just smoked chances are I'd be higher off the dad I don't know though maybe that's just me god be suck no no I to die one have so many levels of emotions on me so I'm like this is awesome it's like it's okay it's like all right that's pretty cool it's like this sucks like this isn't such an emotional roller coaster I really don't know how to feel about these when I had the live resident of the cr-z it was way tastier than this like I was actually like my blood how pasty it was I was like wait this is Rossum like that's how good I thought it was and then now I'm like hitting this pen only yeah this is trash I don't think I've ever had any string of seven ten laps that was Tier four so maybe once they hit Tier four it is really just like the bottom of the barrel but there's so many better things you can buy at the dispensary instead of this and RJ even from 7-10 labs like the amount of money it cost for a battery and the pot itself it's like just by a grandma live rosin it'll go a lot longer and be a lot more enjoyable like this this sucks no cold is this telling me I don't see it anywhere dude the amount of information Colorado gives you is nuts like versus Pennsylvania like this is the one thing that blows my mind this is the kind of information you get out of one of your most popular Colorado companies you know you get the THC CBD batch number yada yada in Pennsylvania they have the date of his package do they have like a code for the person who packaged it they have the THC the CBD the CBN the CBC all that [ __ ] there's so much more testing in Pennsylvania you really have a better idea what you're actually smoking when you get [ __ ] from PA it cost so much goddamn money though [Music] this thing's hitting hard however it tastes like [ __ ] dirt getting up triple I'm so so almost empty you can see my hand oh my god I decide to ever oh my god you guys I'm so [ __ ] high it's not getting any better but hits are a little less intense though so that's giving me hope that this pods almost done if there's one thing I can say it's that the pod is in full effect right now I still stand by my statement that taking it dab of this amount would give me higher though I actually asked my battery's about to die and I feel like I got close enough that's what I'm gonna call the video I'm not gonna smoke any more of this so click like if you enjoyed I really did not enjoy this pot but if you enjoyed the video make sure you click like subscribe for more video it's got a lot more on the way leave a comment let me know a Q&A question for a future video but thank you guys so much for watching my name is Jeff peace I'll hit you with a goodbye rip", "bYQ48pJqLuQ": "hello everybody welcome to another great episode of strange city um today sorry madam today we're gonna be smoking on a good little variety here of this concentrate and I just I like going over concentrate because it is a new thing and people really know about cannabis already they know about the flower they know about weed and what it all is but not a lot people know about concentrate and concentrate is just like if you're gonna take an olive and squishing squishing squish it and get olive oil out it's the same concept except we apply heat some solvents and sometimes it's solvent Liss so it just really depends on what you're getting what type it is and that's what I'm gonna go over this but people you know not in Colorado and not in a legal state that can get this kind of stuff or even knows what it is that they can be careful and that they can they can understand what this is and that it's not crack it's not heroin it's not anything like that and I kind of get the sense that people think that because sometimes you need a torch to smoke cousin just no concentrate and you don't really need that we've got our email set up which is an electronic mail a lot of people know what these are some people don't it's an electronic mail it has a titanium coil and it wraps around a titanium nail let's see if I can get these separated here so yes this is my email what it is is a type this is my titanium nail and what it does is this part is wrapped around a center see if we can get yeah you guys can see where that little hole is and right in that ring where there's not the hole is where I put my mic concentrate or you know my man I like to call it my medicine because I actually do smoke for medical purposes so one by one will slowly go over what these all are I have wax I have shatter my co2 so this is gonna be I'm not sure visit I would call this an oil so I've got an oil or shatter in a wax so without further ado this wax this is gonna be a wax now wax can be anywhere from clay light consistency to a buttery like you know play-doh like consistency you know from a hard clay to a really soft play-doh so this one right here specifically is platinum blueberries so the color and the name don't really correlate all the time but that kind of shows you guys kind of what wax is like it kind of has a see if I can get a good it's kind of it's kind of chunky I tried to break some rock but that's not gonna be able to see that too well so we've got a wax that's kind of buttery like and kind of play-doh like consistency alright and this is this is really good for like bait pins anything like that I enjoy it butter and stuff more in bait pens and stuff I don't really vape at all of them so this is gonna be another wax just to kind of show you guys this one's a little bit harder consistency and a little bit more grainy but you guys can probably get the gist of what I'm talking about a little explaining it correctly so those are waxes I'm gonna move to a shadow which has a more glass like consistency to it and a shinier and is more solid I guess in a form so this is shatter and this is very beautiful shatter at that this is another name is cuz my favorite critical mass that's what it is it's my favorite strain this is very good for pain this is a very high CBD count compared to other strains so I'm honestly gonna be taking a DAB to this first - tbh you guys but this stuff is really really beautiful I'll go ahead and give you another little there's through the song but I do enjoy all different types so chatter is more glass like and more and more hard I guess a more hard and harder my girl might be so mad right now and then harder and it's consistency and it's glassy that's the best I can put it is pretty much like glass or like plastic you're gonna snap it it's gonna break so this stuff it's in a syringe and a syringe dumping needles crack down on all that chronic crap so this right here is full of you can kind of see it's got a shim not shimmery but it's kind of an amber e color mmm this right here is a used one obviously but it only comes with a gram of concentrate in it and this is made with co2 so the difference this is an oil so if I if I do this with it it's gonna this little string of oil come out and that's in that soil so you've got oil which is really runny now we've got shatter which is glassy and hard and we've got wax which is play-doh light consistency is the best way to put it so that is a run around of all of not all of the types but a good mix of the types of concentrates the consistencies they don't really change like live resin can be shatter YX come you know oil it can be all of those so the the main ones are gonna be oil wax and shatter until you get into like the crystal lines and in the crystal it and that kind of stuff so that's a that's a crystal and I would still call that shatter at that so with that being said we'll take a DAB for you guys what do you need to mean you need a ver Cheers oh well guys I appreciate you watching enjoy",

weeks ago exactly like yeah I hope you guys got to fill me on this one I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about if you guys [ __ ] with select most of them they just taste the same like this one it tastes good I'll get it wrong you got some nice clean taste to it can't want to describe it but it's just like the profile that the terpene profile is not there I don't know man but don't get me wrong these are pretty good I really like them a lot so but I probably will not be getting so many more this probably gonna be the last gram I get in a while so so yeah I probably just stick to

you get the indica sativa so it's a pretty good it's a pretty good cartridge guys and I'm gonna have to shut again one more time before I cut the video short oh my god flip it over after ripping the [ __ ] out of it it's to hold its thickness there so it's pretty good quality but just the taste it has that strong hash to taste to it it tastes like some of the cartridges that were made when the cartridges were first [ __ ] you know came out like the oil like just straight hash you know with no [ __ ] terpenes in there but it's still clean and still good and I really like to select so I don't know guys it's probably like the last car I don't know yet let me know what you guys think in the comments section if you guys [ __ ] with select I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm

do W babes cartridges and batteries work well we have two different types of batteries so I'm gonna start with the direct inhale and what you do is you take our cartridge which actually have an indica hybrid or sativa marking on them so IH RS which is great because you don't want to confuse your sativas with your and indica is correct yeah you don't want to grab your sativa when you're trying to go to sleep so you know that was a big request that we got so we just added that and it really helps people be able to differentiate so you want to be sure you know remove this little silicone cap on the end and the direct inhale batteries they come to in a package and they have a handy little USB charger and they are there goes right into your computer correct any USB charger will do or your computer yeah any USB plug so the direct inhale you just take it and it's got a 5-10 universal thread on it so you just screw it right on and then you take a drag so and it just works right from inhaling it just works right from inhaling exactly so you don't have to do anything and so when you're done with it or the battery runs out you go over and since there's two you have this you have your backup charging you just take that one off then you put the other one on the charger and you're ready to go that's great and how long does it take to charge about 30 minutes okay that's not too long yeah and then we have the push button battery which some people tend to prefer because it's a little bit of a bigger stronger battery and you get a little bit of a bigger hit from it okay and so what you do is same thing you just screw it on and you'll want to hit the button five times some people they'll just take it and screw it on and forget to hit the button and they'll think it's not working yeah so you want to make sure you hit the button five times and it'll link three times to let you know it's on and then you take a drag and the other cool thing about our cartridge our cartridges is that we have a central pole that we designed in order to help heat up the oil because the cannabis oil is much thicker than you know regular oils that you know these cartridges were originally designed for so interesting and so it doesn't heat it more thoroughly as you guys eat it more thoroughly and quickly okay so you get a nice big hit you don't have to keep warming it up and so when you're done with the push-button version do you have to turn it off you do you have to push up five times again to turn it off because you don't want it rolling around in your pocket each time you hit the button it'll make the battery you know have a little bit less of a charge yeah and to is the is the charging time exactly the same for push-button model as the direct inhale they're both about thirty minutes yeah it's pretty quick that's great well all good information thanks so much you", "9AYvLly1isA": "how are you doing today I hope great and thank you for watching this video I also want to thank all the new YouTube subscribers and all the Twitter followers welcome to the family and let's get right to it on this video I'm gonna show you and tell you about the ultra black line 450 milligram cards raised from fluent I paid $60 for the cartridge and it came in at eighty nine point three for two percent THC the cartridge quality is top-notch great airflow and it didn't clog at any point plus the flavor never changed I'm extremely impressed with the cartridges they use I have tried plenty of OG Kush flour before and I must say the flavor on this cartridge is really dead on the flavor was a combination of wood and pine only thing missing compared to the flour was the light hints of lemon but overall it was a great flavor on the cartridge unto the effects the first effect - here was all my stress and anxiety issues melting into a flowing river of inner joy that had me smiling from ear-to-ear then came the euphoric need to enjoy myself and listen to the music and dance all the things I'd like to do the combination of that inner joy and do foria completely eliminated my mood swings for the duration of the effects another great effect is my chronic back pain was lower to the point where I only felt that when I got up from my chair or did short movements like that there was also a strong urge to eat all kinds of snacks which helped a great deal with my appetite loss problem not very long after the effects started I also felt my entire body feel relaxed - this eliminated some overworked shoulder pain that I had from the day before and I am very impressed with how well I can feel the effects of this black line cartridge I can definitely work on this strain it calms me down fills me with inner joy gives me the power to deal with anything my job throws at me and it lowers my pain through the workday so awesome I definitely recommend this Ozar black line carthoris for all day and night use hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna

okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "TFbb2238KMI": "today's review sees m1 pods made by church just came out today so just probably haven't seen these yet some of you may have but I want to go ahead and look at this one this is my favorite I like Strawberry Cough there are 0.75 in here they may even have the label on the coil in there that's pretty sick and take a look at the results and these are tested like a week ago then these are pretty cool so here in Michigan we just went through like a a band type thing I'll distill it all vapor products so you couldn't get any of these for like the last like three weeks you literally couldn't get any carts or anything so it's been a little hard and then these just dropped today so that's it's pretty dope there all seemed to be filled up pretty well I think there's like you see that babe this uh it's not like clear it's like uh I don't know how to say it but it's not instant I don't know I'll open it up and we'll see it might be a cover it kind of looks like it but I'm gonna go ahead and take this out oh so this is pretty cool so this battery is compatible with Joule pods also yeah so you can put your jewel on top of here and smoke it damn it's kinda heavy has some weight to it this little thing has some weight do church is always awesome winter product stretches on everything widget everything then you got your little jewel pod compatible thing right here just take this I'm pretty sure you just drop it right in here just like that yep then you just put your jewel pod on top of there that's [ __ ] sick all right I got a button down here Oh in that lights up green blue white Green I wanted on green that's what they said you use it on - there's really no instruction that came others on the back I'll show you guys this three settings the white 3.0 2.7 3.7 is green 4.1 is blue all of a sudden light on the bottom means that it's it's dead and it was red so it's pretty much dead so this thing actually needs to charge 410 miles it's pretty cool and surge protected so it's never gonna overheat let's go ahead and open the Strawberry Cough here so how I like to open them as you grab both sides like that just kind of wiggle it out they have a different way of doing it but we all have a different way of doing everything and you got this little box in here you can either take that out or you can just grab the pod and just grab it like so Dan this is dope so it does have like a cloudy plastic type on it it is not clear so that's that's pretty cool that's new it's different it's kind of thick too you can see that it's not it's not just a half gram it's a full 7.5 and you got your bubble somewhere up in there kind of see it right there show the back real quick this is the peanut collision the pods are 0.75 they're not a half gram through a point seven-five so you can take a hit off of this before it dies so we're just gonna go ahead and match the search up a church put it in there okay maybe it needs to be in the other side I guess they hit the head oh that tasted good first hit on the M on pod Strawberry Cough one percent is seventy two point three as a very high strawberry taste to it it's like strawberry lemonade type almost there's a very clean flavor though very clean that's good as [ __ ] that's good as [ __ ] go ahead and take one more ripoff of these girlfriend just hit this and how did you like it yeah actually is pretty good vapor production for how small it is alright I love how small it is you can just hold this in your hands no no if you could see in there but you create we created two bubbles hidden into these a couple times now these batteries range from like think it was in charge they wouldn't let me buy more than one but tomorrow they should be stocking batteries and these are $30 at $35 depending where you go and then you get these carts right here for forty to forty five dollars but this thing is pretty cool you just hold it in your hand and just no I don't even know we did go ahead and die so I'm going to end the video here just wanted to make this little clip right here about this new m1 pods you're gonna be doing reviews on some of these other pods I got I got a few more that I'm not showing here got another bag but yeah these things are pretty cool if you do see these I do recommend these but they are kind of expensive to maintain not maintained but keep up with they do have a dual attachment so that's pretty cool go on the top of there and you can smoke your jewel a nine out of ten flavor straight-up 10 out of 10 not even online I love this Strawberry Cough it's one of my favorite strains ever good ass quality pen right here it's not even a

and they say these effects are really like spot-on like you're gonna you really this and you know if you don't know about anything like cannabis but cannabis has just like any other plant it has a female and a male part to it so indica is the is the male and sativa is the female so the sativa has an effect of making you feel more alert more ready to do something probably the connect is probably gonna have some sativa in it cuz it says laughs or our friends get Internet the indica is gonna be more of a body relaxing type thing get you relaxed but the next one is create what it is the only festival favorite okay create is perfect to paint Jam cold or game okay so that was pretty cool and then this last one is called charge and they all start with a C so this one may be a sativa because

it i [ __ ] love it i'm not gonna lie so it doesn't say the strain but when i looked into the website this strawberry cough i [ __ ] love that strand it tastes so smooth so sweet so tasteful it's one of the smoothest delta i've ever tried to be honest with you and you could um personally i love sweet tasting uh cartridges either that or likes ones that taste like strict flour you know like a [ __ ] um what's a good brand that's a good strain [Music] anyways uh this tastes a lot like strawberry coffee if you tried it it doesn't taste exactly like strawberries but it'll give a nice sweet like you can still taste a little bit but i taste more just sweet overall sweet taste smooth like i said and it's only 600 milligrams of delta eight so i'll be assuming the rest would be terpenes so if you like terpene tasting cartridges you're going to love this cartridge because i'm telling you man it's smooth it's clean it's tasteful doesn't potency is delta so if you guys ever tried delta 8 then you know what i'm talking about if you don't don't be expecting to get high as a [ __ ] dispensary grade thc cartridge dabs weed bud nug anything anything at all like thc full thc spectrum even if it's from the street or from your homie even unless it's like a sketchy uh you know one of those sketchy sus cards then that's how i compare the height to this too not the high but like you know the experience so to say but hi it's uh i view this as like a [ __ ] i don't know overall delta eight i never get baked off i never get too stoned off it i just get a nice close a nice slight high not strong enough to last hours not strong enough to make you feel like couch potato kind of vibe but just like a mellow and it doesn't give you a fog like high you know when you're just like i'm telling you like slouched and like oh i don't want to [ __ ] kind of high nah it'll give you a nice buzz just for a little bit but the potency for this it's a pretty good just like every most delta eights i've tried oil quality good nice dense slight yellow color some are either light yellow slight yellow like the gold color like this or like straight water clear like color you know they're sometimes i don't know which ones are better i thought the water clear ones were good but i like this one a lot but you know what let me just hit you guys for you guys all right i got the yolk and armor the biggest down uh before i hit this i just want to say the biggest down i found about this cartridge is because i put it on the vessel battery that's always my go-to when i go to battery when i have a cartridge and it didn't hit that well you know i like that the the vessel that everything goes to four volts or four point two this still yo this is what you can do this still goes to four four point two but i don't know this one hit a lot better with the vessel battery it just hit life for me but anyways cheers give me a second this shit's [ __ ] it's another thing hold on because i don't know this thing it doesn't get clogged frequently but you'll have that problem now just hit set [ __ ] it it's nice smooth smooth smooth deltoid i've tried to be honest i'm telling you this right now and i've tried to shut down the deltoids i'm the one doing all these reviews too so i'm getting used to the taste but you know in general delta eight it will always always always be harsh if you take consistent or long hits it doesn't matter how much of a pothead you are it doesn't matter how many times you smoke cards a day trust me it's uh it gets you you'll he'll you'll definitely feel it in your throat if you take consistent and long hits but take short hits like this like don't be cheaping on it don't just like take smooth hits you won't be coughing that much with with hometown hero especially i like that that's what i love about this car and it's so tasteful man nice smooth slight sweet taste good terpene mixture i'm telling you if this is a gram this 600 milligram for delta there has got to be terpenes right because it just terpenes and they'll take this lit so this shit's good this is good i've seen the there i've seen other cards the one i'm about to review right now i forgot the name of it but i'm in the process of reading another delta a few other actually some of them are only like 200 or like 800 milligram delta so they have less terpenes in it but they're probably stronger well in general they'll take i don't really feel much strength right i see it as a good supplement or maybe you want to get off vaping or cbd something different other than that maybe you haven't smoked it all you just want to test it if you're like that take small hits please trust me you don't want to take big ass hits trust me trust me you're going to learn the hard way video but with this one if you're like that you want something smooth for and you're looking for something smooth they'll take highly recommend hometown hero and i'm telling you supporting the veterans bro the full gram cartridge does go for like 40 grand 40 grams 40 dollars for 30 40 i think some [ __ ] like that but honestly if you've tried i like the three shy a lot that one's really good i like the dimension a dash it was fire but this out i don't know they both are unique in their own way with the taste of their strings but this shit's good this is the only string they have right now hopefully they make more because i mean no man i would like the other ones see what else they would got i don't know but strawberry cough they'll say let me take one more here for you guys i mean other than that this shit's good yeah but that is hometown hero delta eight is that connection thank you thank you for watching guys peace", "N3tW_3x8fxE": "welcome back everybody to another

"tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "O-oShgS1Xy4": "hey what's going on guys welcome to deaf connection in this review I got the vessel batteries so the vessel battery is intended to use four cartridges only and primarily only four cartridges and honestly I love this battery beckham this is out of all the pens i've ever tried an experience this is honestly my favorite one this one is the smoothest the cleanest and um i can't find any con about it other than its price it is pricey compared to a lot of other batteries like cecil or like she saw Siler she saw palm and all that but and some of them even cost ten bucks but this one's really worth it you really do get what you're worth when you buy the vessel battery so there you let me tell you all the features this pen really is a is a really sleek pen and it really is that smooth and simple to use it's just three different modes um the lowest one being like being 2.8 volts right here and that's another thing too it's pretty cool do you need it's unique in the colors that it has I thought that was pretty nice but the last mode is a 3 point 6 volts I believe yeah pretty sure that's right at 3.6 so it's not as powerful as other pens as well but another thing is the batteries really efficient it lasted me a couple of days and it charges fairly fast charges it wasn't like one two three hours that will last me anywhere he's pursuing like I smoked consistently so I do it does last meeting between 2 to 2 to 4 maybe even 5 6 days so I think that was pretty awesome now with the battery with the battery itself like what I said honestly there really isn't a whole lot to it other than it's a sleekness how the feel of it this one this one's really nice actually I love this one will op up the only thing to the battery is um right here oh and there's another feature that I love about it it's the air flow this is what makes it amazing you see all this right here this thing you can actually take off but the purpose of that is for airflow is for to optimize and enhance their flow the taste and all that and it really does difference there are some carts so you could see in the post off if you read further below but there are actually some quests that don't even fit this but that's what the person is for so you could just take it off if the car is too why you're just too big to fit that's another cool thing you know something other this very has that you could take off is the bottom part but first I had no idea where to what to do with it but it was a little confused at first um but I didn't realize didn't tell you about more about it that the bottom part is actually for the purpose if you were to drop it because I've dropped my vessel battery a couple of times and it's actually I know what nothing came off no paint came off not really like major scratches anything at all but this pen can withstand like impact if you drop it or something like that so that's pretty cool it's this thing but this battery falls and like bends or something like that right here this will be the first of that just to take it off this is where you charge it really simply just connect it's a magnetic charge port but yeah that is a that's a that's pretty much all there is to it yep I forgot to mention so I what I said this is um this pen is really for carts only and um it fits any sort of 510 thread and another cool thing is these are actually meant for it it's enhanced Cecil cartridge it's so see so these Cecil cartridges are better cause supposedly for Cecil silo and Cecil palm battery but we personally believe it the vessel better hits a lot better than the Cecil batteries itself so that's another really cool feature and it looks just like if it's really smoothly guys it's like that thing too is pretty much as convenience and it's sleekness its discreteness and how it hits uh how it just enhances every hit it really you really get the taste of every single hit with the vessel battery I know I'm hated I'm gonna smoking right guys just see how you can see how its Cheers all right smoke isn't fairly thick it's kind of thin but it's still it's still kind of rip so doesn't rip as much as I'd like it to but it's pretty much it's pretty much all deficient semen so it does less like what I said it just lasts a long time in every hit you really do it it really just tastes a lot better like actually with this cartridge itself to some of the carts I tried it with my other batteries um I tried it with the G pen and stuff like that and it was the only actually really harsh this actually gives this really smooth hit so that's another really cool thing so that's the that is a vessel better you guys if um another thing is I forgot to tell you the price yet it is worth a hundred bucks so I mean it honestly like what I said you usually do get what you what you pay for this thing is really worth it if you've got smoke cartridges a lot and consistently if you're more of a wax kind of person or just like prefer smoking and smoking weed or anything like that then yet I wouldn't recommend this pen but I do recommend is battery for everyone who small carts on a consistent basis so that's the vessel battery um if you guys have any questions or comments and experience with it posted them post them down below and I'll see you guys soon peace out guys", "g6aWkXveSlA": "\u00e7b deva pol is the preferred method of consuming CBD oil according to purists and scientific studies alike vaping CBD increases the bioavailability substantially so you can absorb more of the CBD you take by inhaling it vs taking it orally when you ingest CBD you are ingesting cannabinoid terpenes as well which have amazing properties such as anti-inflammatory effects antiseptic antibacterial and many many more like most things you ingest a high percentage is removed by your liver first pass effect so when you inhale CBD you absorb a higher percentage of it therefore making it more cost-effective what is CBD let's talk science CBD is short for cannabidiol and is one of the 500 natural components found in the cannabis plant marijuana THC is the most popular of these components since it's the element that gets people high however CBD is the one that seems to offer the most medicinal benefits and it's often isolated for medical use CBD is also an integral part of the human body since we also produce our own cannabinoids in simple terms the CBD compounds attach themselves to the endocannabinoid system ECS which plays a key role in our homeostasis meaning the balance and equilibrium between the different things that are constantly happening inside of us like appetite pain sensation mood memory regulation of body temperature blood sugar level pH levels immune system nervous system in other words we need cannabinoids to stay alive the CPD produced by cannabis phyto cannabinoids mimics very well the CBD in human physiology which is why it works so well as medicine for us the endocannabinoid system was named after the plant back in the 60s the man named Raphael McCollum was able to identify an isolate THC for the first time shortly before CBD was also identified over time this led to the discovery of a physiological system of tremendous importance in humans the endocannabinoid system rightly named after the plant corporate greed around CBD CBD is so important for us that pharma companies manufacture synthetic marijuana drugs as an interesting note in these therapeutics the company behind syndra's a synthetic marijuana drug has actually been one of the biggest financial supporters of

you the differences the pros and cons of both and which is actually worth it one of the interesting things about pods is with the tax area you get pods that are licensed out to processors like abstract here in Washington but Stevie actually makes their pods under their own brand of Stevie but is working with local processors and flour I'm sure you guys want to figure out which one is best for you so let's just jump into it first up we have the steezy this brand started in LA but has started growing rapidly to other states I purchased a prefilled cartridge for $30 from a local dispensary and the battery was free with a pod purchase after you get through the one-page instruction booklet and the micro USB cable you get to the actual Stevie which is a little bit more difficult than it looks to get out with bigger fingers yeah the battery again is very basic no buttons no visible indents just their logo on the side and a place to plug in many people have issues with fakes TZ pods and batteries this can be extremely harmful to your health but as long as you purchase from a trusted retailer and not your plug on Instagram you should be fine but they pride themselves on labs tested premium quality concentrates unlike their packaging which is not so premium due to their childproof compliant packaging but if you're a rebel like me you can open it differently you can also spot fakes TV pods by they're slightly different packaging including black trays holding the pod I did have one incident where the gold pins on the bottom of this easy pod didn't allow it to connect to the battery overall the stevesie is a great option for taking your concentrates on the go it's a simple and discreet device that makes even seasoned divers think twice about pods now let's take a look at the PAX era my dispensary didn't have any deals on the battery so I paid the full $30 the packaging on this is great and really makes the product feel premium and hey the even has a cutout for a big ten people longer instructions for all the features they packed into it and a sticker to wrap the brand as I mentioned before I went with more of a premium concentrate with AD abstract cartridge local processor you sell pods for around 30 to $75 each this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality around you the packs has this useful feature on it that shows you the battery life and you can use to change settings on-the-fly the packs instantly became my everyday carry and is the one I would prefer having out of these two I really do enjoy the airflow and the strength of a hit from a cz but the smooth reliable hit from a packs and the customization of your experience along with a beautiful design and a feature-rich device the packs also connected via bluetooth to control temperature hit size and even play games if you want me to dive deeper into either one of these vape pens have a suggestion for another vape pen or just a question let me know down below if

Matt CEO today we're doing a product review every once in a while now I'm gonna be throwing in a product review and simply because I'm really I used to know what to get that's good where to get it from and what type brands all that kind of stuff that I feel is necessarily good so like I said I've got a lot of years experience I have licensed from the government's to sell or weed all kinds of things I would use my opinion is quite highly useful as well as I'm just just don't like everybody else I like to get good products to my people once again check out all my toons here I'd be on YouTube please subscribe and like to my channel here's we're doing an awesome thing here you know Facebook is always there at weeds for your weit Facebook you all had its updates need stuff rough things that are be reposted that I speak on here with places to go and all that kind of stuff so first of all I'll just tell you this here is a rift product THC is quite high in this product indica disposable pen so once removed from the packaging you just basically you can tell exactly what it is so basically I've got ready for across the south push that's a high-end across which is awesome this Rifkin comes highly recommended I got this dispensary and I say they come from South as you can see here I can see the THC seven hundred and forty two point six three milligrams per gram now that means absent tea in subtlety 275 per second at velocity C so as you can see it's quite a high potency unfortunately as when he turned over while not quite unfortunately because of it anyways I like a little bit more in my pens this one here as you can see as a 0.25 a gram pen so it's not quite a half round pen Bob it was a heavy it said I've had it out for a day [Music] we definitely recommend this for someone who's off war on the smokes a lot of Bud side and just kind of dabbled with you extracts and concentrates and stuff like that because it's definitely gonna give you a hard headstone yeah it's smooth as can be and like I said the pen heel you can see the window there that tells you where you sit with how much oil is left of your pen this one here is disposable you can see on the bottom disposable cannabis extract and that's exactly what you asked from if you wanna get this type of product as you say I won't be disposable vaporizer and they'll give you a couple of different choices TC riffs are pre average prices I've been to was about thirty dollars [Music] it's a good pen so yeah I'm gonna take a call here [Music] so yeah it definitely is a very very good definitely let's you know it's it's got a really nice sweet cannabis flavor to it you've kind of got a little bit of a sourness to it you can taste that but it doesn't bother your lungs at all when you smoke the pen it doesn't really cut out on you at all it's smooth the end of it goes up bright purple let's see if I can show you here [Music] so as you could see quite a nice product definitely good for you know the odd you know take five or six hits throughout the day like I said it's a point two-five for a heavy smoker or someone who takes a lot of concentrate or smoke shot or stuff like that you're gonna want to get definitely maybe a higher you know maybe a point five pen or even a one ground pen if you can find those you're gonna have to go higher maybe into your capsules but anyway I would definitely recommend this it's decently priced it's very discreet it's small fits right in the palm of your hand you know it I think it looks pretty sweet the way the ona mean yeah definitely worth the money at the type of percentage that it's at always check their percentage on there and if you can't do the calculation all you simply do is move the decimal point one point to the left now and when you're doing CBD it's the same thing now as you can see total CVD there is seven point zero seven milligrams per gram but the conversion for that is zero point seven milligrams per gram and we're looking at a potency because we're doing percentage right so at zero point seven percent and you're looking at the total THC value which is seventy five point seven percent and that's how you will figure out what your percentage is on your milligram per gram just always slide it one to the left and you'll always be able to see where you sit in relation to your THC value compared to your CBD value now it won't always be the same but just remember that these days CBD is probably gonna be in everything but like I said zero point seven is absolutely sweet [ __ ] all and yeah these ones are made for your rip heads donors and I like it so I'm having trouble with my phone today it won't quite turn around but anyways this is mr. matt CEO I want you guys to [ __ ] enjoy this take a look at this review and like I said I'll be popping up with decent reviews every once in a while I've been so busy as you can tell them I throw it's killing me I've been just going going going the appearances

more reviews and [ __ ] so that's what i'ma do damn [ __ ] filming but I will be with you this [ __ ] is weird as [ __ ] money cuz I don't like putting on camera my face and just more [ __ ] talking to nobody what the [ __ ] she does awareness for hey yeah I keep giving me these fuels and a [ __ ] keep doing these reviews you hear me yeah so check me out this [ __ ] right here I ain't got the box right I would have showed you the box and all that but as I say man I've done been smoking this [ __ ] for like a week now [ __ ] now and I were to [ __ ] that boxes oh but it's a seventy seven point something THC granddaddy purp GDP you feel all right so what imma do is usually my [ __ ] posters be 10 minutes [ __ ] you know I'm at work [ __ ] I'll make this picture of shot now [ __ ] don't

I ain't supposed to be smoking but that [ __ ] right there oh that [ __ ] tastes good you can't taste it when you're inhaling but you taste that [ __ ] when you exhale oh hey listen this [ __ ] on a scale of 1 to 10 I've been hitting this [ __ ] for a week now so I already know I ain't gonna front like I just tasted this [ __ ] I love it yeah I mean I don't know to give it a 9 or a 10 or whatnot

yeah two in one day and the first one was two reviews in one video i can't help myself what to do another review because i went shopping and i picked up some more cartridges so without further ado let's get straight to it huh all right so like i said i've been shopping picked up a couple more things i couldn't help myself uh like the one to one subscriber he was saying bro see if you can find the cart cushmance well guess what brother i got it and i am going to be doing a review on it right now all right i also picked up a quarter of uh what is this the [ __ ] grape gorilla glue all right holistic uh grape gorilla glue indica be uh looking out for that review and then i got the juice liquid live resin cartridges by cresco this couldn't help myself right so let's go ahead and take off the strain cartridge that i reviewed earlier today thing almost gave me a weed and put me in a weed nap for real for real now let's open up this cushman's cartridges but before we do that let's look at the numbers right i have not even looked at the numbers so you guys are seeing the numbers before i do i don't know what it looks like my camera is super dirty but it's not lit i just wiped it the [ __ ] off let me try again better [ __ ] name tag always remember to rip your name tags off guys if you're gonna do reviews like what i do all right there we go there's numbers you guys can see it all right i'm going to take andrew these numbers here real quick this isn't this little cartridge which i really don't care for but you know it is what it is homeboy swears by the strain here and uh the the concentrate was really good i'm not gonna lie all right let's get right into this cracking it might help take that off too oh my buddy is coming over tonight with the [ __ ] puffcoat so it'd be my first time puffing on the puffco which i cannot [ __ ] wait all right here we go guys what is this mint kush not cush mince like the other one is this mint kush all right let's get it let's go here we go please not big head space i know your [ __ ] whatever here we go here we go with that space oh yeah at least the headspace is about the same every [ __ ] time i guess huh all right all right not going to dilly dally in this one boys kind of tastes like christmas candy like uh peppermint kinda maybe that's the mint i don't know all right the lowest voltage which is at 3.3 one two three four five cheers here we go minty you can definitely taste the men in this one can't taste the kush like i said it reminds me of like a christmas peppermint is what this is reminding me of um it is a distillate cartridge i i thought i would be more excited about it but i'm not too excited about it bro i'm not i'm i don't know man i'm just not i don't know that meant that mint mint taste uh [Music] i don't know i just i'm not a big fan of it if if that's what you say it is good i'm not i'm not knocking it i just um i still have that taste in my mouth and i'm not a real fan of it i mean if you like mince i guess kind of like a peppermint i guess it it even kind of smells like a a mint uh i mean it's good [ __ ] it let's go in hot i'm gonna turn it all the way up it's going hot at 3.8 or what is it 4.4.8 and uh let's let's see what's up let's see what it tastes like on a hot hot hit cheers too hot now that just tastes like a burnt mint distillate and done going hot too hot let's try 4.3 and then i'm in this video nothing expands in lungs i don't know i'm just not really a disliked fan a dislike cart fan and this is what i think 50 bucks at maryland health and wellness center i would much rather pay the [ __ ] the extra 15 dollars get the liquid live resin cartridges but the [ __ ] up thing is like i said an earlier video homeboy down the street can get two of these for what the [ __ ] i pay for which it's sad it truly is it's sad all right let's go in at 4.3 about in between about the middle heat and let's see what happens let's see if i could taste the difference or anything and i am getting the buzz off of it don't don't get me wrong it is good medicine and the color that oil is [ __ ] always fire grass roots color their oil is always fire no matter what the oil always looks that that same color the same consistency cheers that's more like it not bad not bad i definitely like the concentrate better but uh yeah if you like mint stuff then go go try this mint kush from grassroots if you don't like mint stuff then uh stay away from it i got a little sweat off that is either that or miranda's hoodie is a little warm in my room here but uh anyway yeah smash that like share subscribe grassroots y'all this is [ __ ] like always cresco while you know y'all good y'all know the [ __ ] deal anyway i am buzzed so it's not a bad cartridge peace out boys

device simply take the mouthpiece off the device there is a rubber stopper at the top you want to remove that as well then you'll take your oil simply put that into and let this drip into the device it does have a window on the side of the cartridge or atomizer device to tell you the oil is going in once you have your oil filled into the cartridge you'll say to your rubber stopper replace it put your mouthpiece it just snaps right back in you'll take that and then you'll screw that into your battery and now you're ready to debate", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in this area otherwise if you're in Denver you can always get it at Verde if you're in Boulder you can get it at Verde nice that Verde carries the largest selection of dialogic products overall so deal deal I appreciate it man yeah there you go there you go thanks for bringing such thanks for bringing samples absolutely it is gorgeous this is absolutely growing always glad to be over there [Music] [Music] [Music]", "WQkvjLn1mlI": "YouTube what the [ __ ] is up cushy here and we got the new new we got the color so cartridge cheese rack LLR then we got the Afghan bud flower so big reviews coming later on tonight happy New Year to everybody I gotta wait to smoke cuz some people work so love you guys subscribe hit that like button you got smoking wrong", "pvWD7CcSSOI": "yo guys what is going on and ship boy Cam Cameron whatever the [ __ ] you want to call me we are back with another cartridge review and today's cartridge review you saw the last video you got a sneak peek on this one today this is gonna be the same old brand right item nice lab but this one's great so you know if he no cards green usually means what hybrid that's right we got a hybrid right here we got tranquil elephant Iser what kind of string is that I have no idea but I'm very excited I usually don't get hybrids on this channel if you guys have seen some of my videos I say eight out of ten of them are sativas are in because usually the other two tend to be hybrid sometimes but you know usually it Vic mixes up between sativas and indicas only for this one yes hybrid I can't talk I'm pretty stupid and it known as a hybrid when it bought it because I bought it online because like this coronavirus you had to do curbside pickup and pretty much every dispensary around the valley for me I'm sure it's the same with you guys so I just saw the name and I'm like wow shoot that sounds cool as hell let me get it and that's what it is like kind of low-key expected this one to be at the indica honestly because I don't put you to sleep or something I guess not this is the hybrid one I do want to try an item 9 labs sativa that is I'm sure that one's gonna smack hard also we're at 1100 subscribers so shadows so you guys you guys have been killing it even when I wasn't here the sub rate just kept going up and up so I appreciate that you guys are the reason I keep doing this y'all keep supporting me so I keep doing this for you keep spending my dirty money so yeah let's get right into this um so same packaging is the last one obviously come to this little dude to blame things on 30 popped open cute got my charger I charge it on the computer 18x I mean it's not full charge but it will be a job right now here's the blacks you guys trying to show you that it's pretty clear it's a good size bubble right there she's nice clear wax I'm trying to get sponsored by just anybody in the marijuana industry right now I've hit up a few local growing companies like copper State Farm stuff like that hit up a few dispensaries I go to on a local a local regular basis around here so we'll go ahead and we're gonna keep trying see if we get any sponsors anything like that I don't expect anything like nothing from zodiac doctor so yaks or anything like that that would be super sick uh shots - dr. zodiac if you're watching for some reason also if you guys know any companies that might do a little you know small content creator sponsors like partnership kind of things let me know in the comments or you know shoot em an email give my answers my youtube or whatever it is I would love to make something happen that'd be really cool even if it's like rolling paper company or whatever it might be that B's that'd be dope um excuse the messy hair you know can't can't be a video with me if it's not messy hey so let's go ahead and take the first hit of those guys um I will for what drink oh if a nice tranquilizes or tranquile something like that so choose good mister one um so right off the RIP the first hit it's a lot more fruity for sure it's definitely a lot more fruity than the indica one i just had Wow my drink ready it still got that earthy taste kind of tastes like a DAB almost um the last card I had a pink champagne that one every time I hit it I got the taste of it actually dad I guess solid dab and is actually pretty nice it was a good taste to have so that was a nice one in the car today's hydration free I can't even talk to his hydration drink of choice Capri Sun you already know the Flies you know we [ __ ] lost some Capri Suns yeah so again here's the cart I'll show you guys the legs not moving if any of you guys know at least they're from Arizona I don't know where these guys are at other than Arizona item 9 Labs has some high-quality packs and concentrates and stuff like that pretty sure they have flour as well and I'm pretty sure that some high testing flour as well let's do another go ahead I'm not even like slowing to anything I'm just stupid just uh let's go ahead and do another one guys here we go see we're taking somebody's on ones here that Bobo starting to move a little bit cuz the wax is a little warm this this pen has a tendency to get very high very fast rate around here so no no no reason it shouldn't be moving well definitely a little intake to another hydration break hopefully guys since you guys been killing with the subscribers I've hit the subscriber goal to monetize my videos the only thing I'm missing is watch time so I just I have to wait and just get a bunch more people to watch my videos and watch as much time on my videos as possible because I'm still missing some of the hours but once I Cathy map of hours are required I can monetize my video and I can start making a little bit more money or a little bit of money off youtube and then if I make money off youtube I can put that towards carts and flour and stuff like that to make more videos to make more content for you guys and then they get more money from that and then I just put more towards weed and then it just it's a vicious circle and you guys get more content I get more weed more videos come out every just it's a win win win so hopefully that that comes in pretty soon but yeah we're still a good amount of time away from that so hopefully by the end of the year that's the goal but hey you never know so I do like this one so far I think I like the pink champagne one better though if you guys are gonna pick one of the other I would say that one pink champagne but I still have one more hint to give before I get my final judgement because you already know 3 or Nothing no sometimes more never less though so guys well that's one see we take three solid hits we don't take policy heads you know actually guys you know I don't I don't hate this car hydration break some [ __ ] you know this car definitely gives a high high you know what I didn't tell you guys I think you're still here the potency only this comes coming in at 89 89 percent so if you guys stick to right stuck around then chesty it's another potency level so that's about it so if you guys are still hearing I appreciate it you guys are the true viewers the choice for your shoutouts to guys you're amazing other than I hope you guys are staying safe well excuse me hope you guys are staying safe staying healthy just staying indoors right now there's the best thing you can do I just smoked a lot of weed just chill out so one time you're allowed to do this so yeah I'll catch you guys on the flip thanks for watching I'll see you in the next one thisis", "UTv2bJBlAOE": "Smok class Bob Marley be so proud I'm burning up my brain cells welcome to baby vaporizers I'm your boy early today we doing another strain review last time you have seen me I did a strain review on flight packs I did it all in singles so I did a review for each strain which I should we just do them all in one review which is what I'm doing right now so crafted cannabis crafted cannabis is a company in California they have a website websites still down it hasn't you know they haven't fixed it and made it run to where it's running properly and you can go down order but on Jack's collective that's that's one of the places that I know for sure that there they have their products in Jack's collective so if you win out there in Cali and you buy up Jack's collective or you know order from them online hit him up but yeah shut off the mark and crafted cannabis right now this is co2 or your cartridge I'm doing the watermelon Jolly Rancher first now the process it's a co2 xfield co2 extraction process after the co2 extracted then they purify the oil meanwhile they filter it make it good then after that they add in the turk profile the terpene profile and then they add in like a fruit flavonoids that's where you get the watermelon Jolly Rancher because in my opinion I've never had weed itself that tasted like watermelon Jolly Rancher you know I mean so that's the whole part where the flavonoids coming that's when they put the fruit flavor noids in there so it could taste like it I'm not to put them in as you can see I've been hitting the [ __ ] out of these my tolerance is very high I smoke a lot I've ate a lot so if you're not like me you don't vape as much and you don't smoke as much maybe once a day maybe once every other day maybe on a week and you know a person that just doesn't really need to do it all the time you know what there's people out there they like the Medicaid but not as far fit maybe you know it's all different between everybody but this is what I'm trying to tell this is 50% THC it will get you high within the first couple pools me personally me and there are gonna be people that are out there like me if they're gonna need to hit this way more than four or five times before they feel anything okay um that's natural okay when you build up that tolerance for weed it's gonna take a little bit more weed to get you high whether you're smoking it vaping it it's always gonna be that way now about to hit this watermelon watermelon Jolly Rancher please like watermelon tastes like Jolly Ranchers [Applause] [Music] early waiting bait for anybody out there hope everybody had a great weekend and then today is Monday nobody likes Mondays but hey this is part of the week I mean tastes really good though wish I could hit this I mean if you taste the crap the cannabis is uh stuff already then you know what I'm talking about very very tasty imma hit it one more time and we moving on I got it at 3.3 volts at this value voltage from battery because the lower the votes the better is gonna taste you won't get as much clouds but as you can see I'm still getting clouds as long as you inhale longer for longer you'll get more clouds but the higher you go on boats the more the better chances you have a fry in the koi in here then they won't work at all but at the same time the higher the votes you go the more vapor is produced but at the same time the taste starts to drop and you get that permit instead burnt coil taste I'm sure you know what I mean yes [Music] I know y'all wondering like yo I got that crazy coochie sweater on our life I don't wear this that often really this is a special occasion sweater I mean there's a $300 worth it's the official original biggie Kuji sweater you can't even find this no more at all I know how long ago I bought this I bought this when he just was popping when [ __ ] is paying four or five hundred dollars for these shits I paid three but this is what I'm trying to tell you especially the unique sweater today was a unique day on a string who slided throw it home plus it's close to Christmas I got mad Christmas colors in there I mean plus they match the Hat you dig i I enough of that talk blueberries oh wait if I draw the blueberry the watermelon was hybrid that means there's a tumor and is in the green there I can't really tell you exactly what strain of weed they used in these because I spoke to the guy and told me they use more than one type of bug for each one so you can't really tell you can't really say okay well this one little berry hey is there some [ __ ] you know I mean it you just gotta take it to the fact that it is weed and it's gonna taste like blueberry that's all that matters Cheers as you can see I've been hitting the [ __ ] out of this is like barely anything in here [Music] this one got a kick this one has more of a kick than the watermelon but some reason this one has way more bite to it because when I in there the watermelon Jolly Reza there's no fight if anything does the watermelon Jolly Rancher was is the weakest one after at the moment I don't get that bite with the blueberry I get that bite in the back of my neck as you can see I'm still trying to recover not because the vapors hot because the vapor is not hot at all matter of fact you won't even feel these shits when you inhale you're not gonna feel anything if anything you know this is not working by the time you move your lips either you're growing out a big flower you're coughing because you didn't realize how full your lungs was but yeah this blueberries fish our God am i moving [Music] [Music] as you can see that she got fight early morning waking baked fairy buddy to more strange less so bear with me champagne drink champagne and lemon saw with diesel are both sativas let's go to the pink champagne for my ladies out there I like to drink champagne Moscato more wet and a bunch of others red champagnes out there I mean but this is pink champagne so sativa don't know what's in it it'll be anything but it's a diva so it's gonna be a real energetic high as you can see I've been hitting the [ __ ] out of all these ships and I got a test test test before I bring out a review you filming it's like champagne what champagne I don't know I've drunk [ __ ] I've drunk champagnes before but I can't even remember what they taste like because I'm not the champagne drinker you know last champagne I troubles my wet and I was whoo well I mean Moscato is the last champagne but you know hmm Stace this is that one more time see as you can see not really a bite unless you inhale because [ __ ] and inhale for a long time it's the only way [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] see us but only on first let me start with diesel this one besides the blueberry muffin is my favorite I love Sour Diesel I love this lemon taste the [ __ ] is official yum-yum-yum-yum-yum this one got the most kicker all and I would save because of the diesel like I said I'm not sure how many strains they used in each one but it was definitely more than one as you can see though you should definitely do get you there I'm not playing with you I'm already feeling something and you already know the trick when you call more coughing gives you high because you're cutting off the circulation to your brain not oxygen but on top of that coughing kind of tells you the weed is good I mean but this [ __ ] is official in my opinion I would go for the sour the lemon sour diesel first the blueberries second the watermelon third and then the pink champagne he has other ones that I haven't received yet but down the line I should be able to get those and bring our review to those to hit this [Music] as you can see that's how with these who got bite whoa come eyes got me crying out this [ __ ] yeah part of me who if you got eye if you go to Jack's collective you can order these from him right now the actual crafted candidates website is still down I still being worked on but bear with them and it'll be up and running shoutouts to mark shout out stage buddy watch this giving their thumbs up even the [ __ ] that give me good thumb down I'll still love you I saw gravy stay wavy yeah", "al6-nQkbQXk": "it may be the color of honey but the high you'll get from this cannabis concentrate will be anything but sweet if you over consume shatter can contain 80 to 90% THC but what is it and how is it made find out on this episode of Wheaties II by the growth up you might have heard of shatter a potent cannabis concentrate made from butane hash oil it's one of the many forms of butane hash oil or BHO in league with wax and cannabis oil used in vapes shatter is the solidified hardest form of BHO earning its nickname because it's transparent and can shatter like glass it's highly potent containing 80 to 90 percent THC according to Health Canada and its effects come on quickly and can last for several hours for that reason it takes far less shatter to get you high when compared to cannabis flour which generally contains up to 30% THC but how is shatter made and how do you consume it firstly shadow is made from the trichomes of the cannabis flower click the letter i' in the top right corner of your screen to watch our video on trichomes and learn just how critical they are to your high to make shatter the trichomes of cannabis buds are separated from the flower using butane and extremely flammable and dangerous gas once separated the trichomes are collected and heated to remove the butane the new substance is mixed to a creamier texture and then solidifies into shatter making shatter is very dangerous and it's not recommended to do it at home people have died or been seriously injured trying to create shatter and this is definitely not something you should do I this is because making shatter or any other BHO involves using butane gas in the process in the extraction process butane gas becomes a liquid and then evaporates when heat is used to remove it from the concentrate since butane is heavier than oxygen after it evaporates it can fall to the floor creating a very hazardous situation especially over a hot stove top this is not the only risk when it comes to BHO though any form of BHO weather shatter or otherwise is highly dangerous to consume orally there's the real risk of poisoning here so shatter and other be a chose shouldn't made into edibles that's because there's a possibility that not all the butane was removed when creating the BHO with all that said shatter can be a pleasantly potent concentrate if used correctly and with care shadow is consumed by heating it and then inhaling the smoke you can consume the shatter by adding a small piece of it to a pipe bomb hash pipe vaporizer or dabbing rig be cautious with dabbing rigs however because they can reach temperatures as high as 400 degrees Celsius and should be handled with care and keep in mind that while shatter can be baked it might be trickier to do so and you might prefer vaping another type of BHO very potent and not for the faint of heart shatter is one of many concentrates available from the cannabis plant and likely better

clear th clear is a little bit left it's been a pretty good this is a half gram cartridge as you can see and there's not much left but there's plenty enough to get a good good draw off of this here you can see th clear this is the King Louie alright so here goes I've been getting some decent clouds off of this who definitely gets you a if you get an extended draw get you a nice cloud so here guys let's see what happens [Music] labour definitely has a as aftertaste of a like a winter fresh wintergreen or evergreen type of a it's almost like taking like a breath mint it's not quite quite that strong but it does give you that kind of a little like extended duration of flavor that fresh clean taste in your mouth last a little while that's what we're all about all I got you might have noticed it does kind of this cartons kind of sticks a little bit when I first tried to hit it and it kind of was intermittently doing that as I was going to not to say that it obviously it still works but yeah it doesn't give up perfectly clean draw it kind of sticking in there so I'll show you more when I disassembled this thing when I'm finished and I break it apart we'll see what it looks like on the inside that's all I got thanks guys", "I3C5WsMIXmc": "oh how you doing guys war vision back for another review I'm gonna be talking a little bit louder in this video I noticed the audio of my videos has been a little bit hard to hear if you don't use headphones to watch the videos so just got done busting a dab of some of this cherry wine from extracts labs easily some of the tastiest CBD that I've had and I have a very tasty product to review for you tonight as well so I got this earlier today this is something I've been wanting to try for a while secret nature's vape cartridges now I did a video on secret nature's but back in the past so if you'd like to see that go ahead and check it out but this is secret nature's vape cartridges these are some of the most highly regarded cartridges that I've seen online everyone says they're top of the line and the reason why is because they're you they use cannabis drive terpenes so they use terpenes derived from actual but this particular cartridge i'm going to be reviewing is the gelato strain gelato if you don't know is one of the most popular top-shelf cannabis strains right now in legal states it's like 30 percent THC I think and it's a cross between well it was the gelato strain was created using the famous strain Girl Scout cookies or GSC so this is supposed to be a extremely popular top-shelf cannabis strain and I've never tried it so I decided to go with the gelato cartridge flavor it is a hybrid because the gelato cannabis strain is a hybrid so they extract the terpenes and they mix it with CBD distillate this particular distillate that they use is 51% CBD 0.2 three percent THC so you get that full spectrum entourage effect the only thing that this oil is lacking that I would have liked to see is CBG and CBC those are some other cannabinoids when you get high concentrations of all these cannabinoids you get what is called the entourage effect which means you get its more full spectrum and they work together to produce the effects that they would have it would have naturally caused or produced in like but if you're smoking bud so the more cannabinoid spectrum you have the more effects you are likely to feel so this is a 1/2 gram 500 milligram cartridges if it's 50% CBD there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this so the first thing I noticed when I open this package up is the packaging on secret nature this packaging is super professional-looking in just premium and it sits like a hard cardboard stock it almost reminds me of like when you buy a new phone the black cardboard box it comes in that's kind of what this is and I like that they use cardboard versus plastic the amount of plastic that we use as humans is getting out of control it's not good so any company that's using a paper or cardboard I applaud them for that so I'm gonna go ahead and show you this packaging it is beautiful it's black and it's got gold ink and it's even like indented and raised up in some parts so when you open it up it slides open which is cool and then the cartridge was sitting right in there so really cool packaging in the front says secret nature artisan cvd gelato hybrid vapor cartridge full spectrum CBD distillate 500 milligrams on the back that secret nature our goal is to help people enhance their chosen lifestyle through relaxation meditation relief in creativity this 100% organic extract is a true full-spectrum CBD distillate has been purified to concentrate beneficial compounds while removing unwanted plant materials full-spectrum oils contain a wide wide array of cannabinoids like I explained together these compounds synergize entourage effect to create the desired effects from the planet we use real cannabis flower terpenes THC free source from artisan cultivators in California to enhance our extracts and give a true plant experience this company is out of Rogue Valley Oregon without further ado so 10 out of 10 for the packaging let's get into it I'm going to show you the cartridge before I taste it so this oil is like really light in color it almost looks if you've ever poured a mountain Dew in a clear glass that's kind of what the color looks like and it's got this really nice metal mouthpiece I'm not sure what kind of cartridge this is it doesn't say C cell on it but it's definitely a ceramic coiled cartridge the oil is very thick as you can see the bubbles are not moving which is expected CBD oil is usually very thick because it crystallizes around 60% so these are supposed to be some of the tastiest cartridges available because they have real cannabis terpenes so we'll go ahead and try this gelato so the first thing I noticed when hitting this cartridge is it kind of has a a hard you have to kind of pull a little bit harder than you wouldn't normally then I've had to pull on cartridges in the past which doesn't bother me sometimes I like having to pull a little bit harder because you can almost feel how much smoke you're taking in a little bit easier and the mouthpiece has a really sturdy feel to it I don't know it feels good on the lips Wow so the flavor on this stuff is amazing you get all flavor and nothing else you don't get any weird taste you're just getting the terpene flavor so it kind of has like a woody fruity taste to it I know that sounds weird woody but that's literally what it I'm getting and it's an enjoyable taste yeah I don't know how to describe it a head it's like oh like a woody fruity taste like almost like if you I don't know I'm almost getting like some strawberries what I want to say but extremely tasty um if you want a cartridge that for the flavor check out secret nature because this is the best tasting cartridge I've probably ever tried this blows for the people's card Church out of the watermelon taste I mean I thought this tasted pretty good but I mean this is this is the real deal Wow amazing taste I'm I would actually really like to try all their flavors now too rather not like a sample pack because it's really that tasty so I got this from the chrome leaf if you watch my videos you know I've been getting a lot of cartridge from the Khalif website it's because the cone Lee's hat the chrome leaf has the cheapest cartridge prices that I've found online so the cone leaf is a reseller so they'll buy also from a company and then sell but they're pricing their pride it's very very cheap I went to the secret nature website and the cartridge on the secret nature website are even more expensive than what you'll find that the column leaves so if you're interested in cartridges check out the palm leaf and I would highly recommend secret nature I think this 1/2 gram cartridge runs at about 40 maybe like 44 dollars for a half gram so it is expensive but it's not uncommon for what we're seeing CBD cartridges being priced at right now and this is I'll tell you what a premium product I would choose this over for the people for sure just based on the taste and the looks of the oil but like I said the only thing lacking in this is the CBG and cbc that's okay it still is a full spectrum product I have to give this 10 out of 10 the effects on this stuff I did hit it a few times before I did this video just to try to give you guys good effects I'm not tired at all it is a hybrid so just with the terpenes you're not gonna get sedated or anything like that and especially it's got the lower CBD not lower CBD percentage but right around 50 so this would be a great daytime product to use I feel energetic but focused as well and I'm also used to CBD so if you're not used to seedy trying a cartridge like this may make you very tired you know it kind of just depends on your tolerance your body type what time of the day you're using it but overall good effects on this stuff I definitely feel it with any constancy be concentrate you will feel it if it's full-spectrum and I feel just a little bit lighter a little bit more uplifted a little bit happier more and more content with life that's my review on secret nature gelato cartridge I couldn't give this anything less than a 10 out of 10 to be honest with you well I've give it a 9 out of 10 because me personally I would like a little bit more full-spectrum maybe a little bit more THC like right cut off maybe even some thca to really bring out the full spectrum effects and hit yet but nonetheless this is a very uplifting cartridge and extremely flavorful that's all for this review I hope everyone's having a great day night whatever it is as always peace out", "f_5JRVPh5jk":

went straight with the cartridge let's just say this stuff can really give you a little pep in your step so I definitely definitely enjoyed all four cartridges use all four of them one thing I really really liked about this on here it's so awesome every single thing that they have in the cartridge actually shows what the ingredients are so for example relaxation the cartridge that's in there you know what you're smoking exactly 100% pure natural organic things the three ingredients that they have in here and that's all that's in there that's there's nothing else it's hops it's kava kava and it's valerian root I don't really know what those are I know hops this stuff that goes in beer I love beer but apparently has a bunch of other like you know healthy nutritional things and facts that are really good for you you can go on the internet you can look up kava kava and see what it is look it up it's actually pretty cool stuff for those of you out there who aren't drinkers though don't

diamond baron collab this pen is a HTE saucepan meaning high Terp extract the package says juice house and the diamond baron combines triple distilled cannabis oil with the cleanest live resin and from what I know the Terps sauce is one of the most potent and flavorful ways of consuming and extract the fact that they have put into a pen is great from the first pull on the pen my thought was this is so flavorful and tastes just like a dab the potency of this product passes any other card I have tried so far one nice pull will keep you going for a little while this is definitely the most flavorful and potent pen I've tried only downside is the product seems to go a little faster than I would have thought but that's probably due to the fact that they use no additives and is all straight Terp sauce", "aompvn8sClo": "YouTube what's up guys the puffs capella atomizer broke so we're gonna try to hit a cart with the dab cap through the puffs code and see how good it works it

you from Santa Cruz California I'm bringing you today my 13th weed review bringing it back again to vape cartridges but switching it out not raw garden no none of the brands I've done previously in my reviews this is a completely new one for me I've never tried them before haven't heard of them until I bought this cartridge so we're gonna do a full unpacking today because I think it's worthwhile they put a lot of effort into their packaging and I think it's worth taking some time to kind of delve a little deeper into it so here we go this is chemistry life in color I think that's the full name of the company chemistry life in color and the strain is 99 cookies it's coming in at seventy three point eight percent THC it is a half gram cartridge and yeah let me read the back here because I think like I mentioned I think they did a really good job at this packaging so ninety-nine cookies flavor and effect if Buddha was a baker he'd whip up a batch of 99 cookies this indica hybrids tightiy vapor illuminates a zen-like wave of bliss upon the exhale a cone to ponder under its embrace what is the taste of Nuneaton cookie so that's just a little blurb they put on the top of the back of the packaging there it says Sun grown by rebel grown which I guess is a company this is based out of Oakland so I'm assuming rebel Grune is a grower based in in Oakland California it's an indica hybrid oh no it was grown in humble I'm in the fall of 2018 harvest so a pretty old harvest but but it still says it's it's good till the end of 2020 so that's good but yeah so it was growing up in Humboldt County so that's way up in Northern California and it was grown by rebel groan tells you the amount of drawers that you can take hundred ten drawers that's where anyone really cares about that information but it's there yeah batch ID best buy day so that's cool it tells you all of the cannabinoids as well so one thing that I've learned that this chemistry Living Color or chemistry like in color apologies that they are big on is this idea of full spectrum full spectrum cartridges so the idea of full spectrum means a bunch of different cannabinoids interacting with each other that have a lot of different effects so just to show you the packaging here this is the list of cannabinoids some of you might know like th g th da CB sorry CB g CB n right different types cannabinoids that have different effects so they kind of boosts that as a as a brand is that that full spectrum that you're getting as well as the terpenes they have the list of terpenes here which is pretty extensive and I'll talk more about those terpenes a little later so let's continue with this unboxing here this 99 cookies cartridge by chemistry pull out the bottom there and I think they did a great job with the packaging stay true to the plant I like that so you take out this little thing it's got that rainbow coloring inside there rainbow packaging I think that's really cool yeah very cool there you go here's your cartridge in there you got to push these sides down and then just slide it out like so here's your cool don't do that there uh here we go there is your half gram cartridge by chemistry 99 cookies yeah it's got a nice amber kind of dark color to it again typical of cartridges has this two rubber ends on each side so you just want to pop those off before you start using it so I got this for thirty five dollars before tax and kind people's there's two locations as you know if you see my other reviews you're gonna need the battery as well to operate the cartridge this you can get a twenty dollars before tax and kind people's or your local smoke shop and yeah so let's go ahead and start using this yeah it's got a good vapor good hits knifes a nice flavor to it it's smooth decent amount of sinus relief as well that's that's really nice and something I personally enjoy about different cartridges and different strains so let's talk a little bit about what ninety nine cookies as a strain is so ninety nine cookies it's an indica hybrid it's a cross of two strains foreign cut cookies and Cinderella 99 so the effects for this strain are calm soothing a body high that kind of slowly increases and builds with with every hit pretty decently powered eforea and then strong relaxation it's it's known to be good for sleep and then a pita appetite stimulation and when I get more into the terpenes of this strain I'll talk about that appetite stimulation and and the opposite as well because there's something interesting there that I think is worth pointing out so yeah definitely an indica with that kind of calming relaxation but the hybrid I think hits you more in that mental kinda euphoria so as far as the flavors go I would say the pepper and spice kind of hits me the hardest but as I mentioned on the packaging there's that Thai tea definitely has a little bit of a tea flavor to it in a yeah I can see that a kind of overall tea sensation and flavoring there's a little bit of that citrus and pine and then very slight sweetness as well pretty strong pine actually stronger pine than I then I thought initially and the sweets definitely after types very slight very little bit of sweet even though it's cookies it's kind of missing the mark on that cookies flavor but I like the flavor a lot so let's excuse me let's get this to the terpenes now so there are one two three four five six terpenes in this ninety nine cookies carry a feeling which is your pepper and cinnamon flavoring known to have anti-inflammatory benefits your limonene which is your citrus to known for stress relief and anxiety relief Hume you mean who moving that's a new one it's earthy woody and spicy flavoring and like I mentioned before to talk about that I've appetite in the increase in appetite who Melina actually does the opposite it's known as suppress hunger so even though this this strain I'm noticing a feeling of increased appetite personally but who Molina's a terpene is known to decrease your appetite and suppress your hunger so I find that pretty interesting also it's going to have antibacterial anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor benefits also then you have your mere scene which is your earthy herbal most common terpene found in cannabis believed to have calming effects it's it's known for that couch lock feeling if you're familiar with in because if your regular user you know that indicas really kind of hit you hard couch lock refers to really not being able to get out feeling super that body high very relaxed very sleepy so your mere scene is is what's going to be responsible for that your pieing is that pine flavoring rosemary to is in there and then your little lool which is your lavender with slight spiciness and that has a kind of floral aroma and it's known for relaxation and calming effects much like the mere seen so pretty pretty pats terpene profile on this one and I like that they break all of that down on the actual packaging here I appreciate that I think that's that's something that's that's special and companies obviously have to go out of their way to make that happen so yeah one thing I also wanted to mention is something that I I just learned recently is there's different types of these terpenes so there's alpha and beta and they break that down here I'm not sure if you can see but you'll see they have like the a versus B a pining be pining it is an example they have in this 99 cookies cartridge so the Alpha versus beta means that these servings have the same chemical formula but they have different atomic connectivity due to the placement of the alkene which is the carbon-carbon double bond so if you look up what I'm talking about the Alpha versus beta to Europeans you'll see a diagram it's just that alkene you'll see in in the alpha versus the beta is the one difference it's just a very slight chemical difference so or I guess atomic connection difference so I found that interesting not sure if you'll find that interesting too but yeah so I I actually am pleasantly surprised with this I'm a huge raw garden guy I really know what cartridges I like generally speaking and what brands and companies I like but this this is this is very good it's definitely not as hard-hitting as the raw gardens or some other brands that I prefer but I still like it I would say it's it's maybe better for a newer user someone who's looking for something that's a little less intense they could work your way up to something like a raw garden or heavy hitters or something but uh but it's very good so in summary it's got you know pepper and spice flavors with with some pretty strong hints of pine and citrus and then that slight sweet aftertaste but a dense terpene profile as you can see on on the packaging which is really cool and definitely adds a lot to kind of what you expect to get from the flavoring and and it's definitely there even though it says there's kind of a cookie flavor I don't necessarily notice that maybe in the aftertaste very very little bit but the pine and that citrus and that tea kind of pepper spice herbal flavor is is great I have no complaints about that I I really enjoy it and I think the majority of users would as well so as far as the effects go it's it's definitely very calm and soothing again for me I'm used to the higher testing one some not it's not hitting me as hard but I could definitely feel that it's slow building with every hit you're gonna get more that intensified euphoria intensified sleepiness relaxation effect added on top so just look out for that but it is really nice I I definitely enjoy it so yeah this is once again chemistry life in color full spectrum cannabis oil cartridge 99 cookies half gram 73.8% THC you can get one at kind people's in Santa Cruz for $35 and the battery kind people's for $20 I'm giving this cartridge a 7.5 out of ten I I really like the packaging I really like I really like the flavor and I think the effects are really good so I think seven point five out of ten is a more than fair score and yeah thank you everyone for watching for following for subscribing and sharing I

right right right right what's up friends this time i'm coming at you with the gather from soleil this is the old 510 or vape cartridge there from the cool dudes over at afria this is a thc cbd it's a 701 thc it's a cbd reading the old ingredients on the back here it says thc distillate cbd distillate and flavors so this one has got all natural berry and watermelon flavors it says so should be tasty i'm guessing i picked this one up for i think it was 39.99 at the store kind of looking forward to a bit of a cbd one in there anyway because they're kind of good for bringing the old mellow out i was out working in the yard yesterday and my back is sore as [ __ ] today so i'm kind of looking forward to this one reading on the side here says 100 plant-based ingredient soleil the sun the sun weed it doesn't taste like watermelons and berries yet this uh so they gather this is derived from their jack herrera so this is a sativa based one if that means anything to you guys what do you guys think does the indica sativa do [ __ ] all of you i don't really know to be totally honest with you and these desolate cartridges let's smoke it i don't know what there's left to do other than later up let's [ __ ] bring her over and take some pics of it [Music] what you guys can't probably smell through the camera is this thing smells really really really good like watermelon berries something like that i smell it all if you are in a situation where you can't be smoking stuff that smells really [ __ ] dank this is definitely a very good i would say this is definitely a very good option for you this one definitely the cbd is helping us out here you can probably hit this one a few times you won't be hiding under the [ __ ] bed i've never seen a cartridge that looked this fancy before hey you guys saw that one it's all shiny and gold and chromed out it's cool looking man i like it i don't know why they made it so fancy but i dig it looks cool probably not the most important thing but they sure made it look freaking sweet packaging is cool things super cool i'd like to see the smaller package instead of the big box but that's just me whatever it's cool just make sure you recycle it i'm probably gonna head out and do a little bit more yard work today so uh we'll see i'll give the old cbd if i can go okay for a rating what would i give this one this is a solid one i give it seven and a half strawberries out of ten yep definitely seven and a half strawberries out of ten seven and a half uh yard leaf rake bags out of 10 because that's what i'm gonna [ __ ] end up raking today probably i need the gyms to open back up my shoulder's [ __ ] killing me it's tough though when you only have one arm that moves you should see your rake in a [ __ ] yard with one arm they're known or i'm so sore i need this i don't know i'm feeling energized i feel like getting in here right now i think for a snack on this one today i'd have like maybe a bowl of oatmeal and maybe a piece of fruit because i'm gonna work today i'm doing it this is a good one i'm feeling inspired i'm not [ __ ] saying like and subscribe okay guys that's pretty much all i got for you on this one if you're down for the cbd you got the soreness going on you're working hard you're sitting around and quarantine doing push-ups in your house all day long on yard work time too you're out there pumping leaves around pulling down branches [Music] whatever right cbd's got you if you guys want me to check out anything that is like weed related let me know in the first vid there guys my mic was kind of [ __ ] up like i said i only got one [ __ ] hand that works here so i was [ __ ] messing with the wires today audio should be back now so sorry about that dudes say what say what hi guys it's me again the hooter yeah the hooter i blasted this through this was the remedy and it's made by the same guy who makes my little chatter hooter pulsar it's a pretty groovy little guy man fits in your pocket real easy i like that one it's got a preheat on it okay now i'm out i'm out peace", "mtS5jJtRyNg": "welcome to community cannabis reviews will be doing a very quick impromptu review because I made a mission to myself that every brand that I do try I will review just so that if any other people try it they know just a little bit about it so I want to get this done because I honestly just want to take some dads and show out not really gonna make a video today and this is not a brand I really highly recommend anyways this is gonna be the exhale brand cartridges exhale I'm 99% sure I'll check once I open it it's made by the same company as hush and Mojave I think it's a nm Inc yeah okay it is manufactured by A&M Inc moved in front facing camera so it might be hard to see and that's really like that producer of like I saw like all the bottom shelf concentrates at least at the disco I go to so they got hutch brand ones which are like 75% DHT distillates those go out up the door at sixteen dollars and then they have two other brands which are exhale which is like a higher quality distillate cart and then Mojave which is there live resin cards honestly not that markedly different from the hush it's only two dollars or more for a little bit more THC you're really not getting too much different you're basically getting a slightly better hush kart so i would with super Sour Diesel as you can see maybe five percent THC almost three percent CBD or whatever two percent a fair amount of cannabinoids you probably average out about like Kanab kinda NAB nodes and terpenes comes out to about like seventy five to eighty percent in the hush cartridges these total the total cannabinoids on this one is ninety three percent total terpenes is ninety or is three point six five so it's like ninety six point five percent total cannabinoids and turkeys together so slightly better than I would say bottom shelf hush you're looking at like not gonna lightly I probably even hype them up too much in my video honestly they're like two to three out of ten but I mean for a solid cart for sixteen bucks this one's probably gonna be like a four or five out of ten that's because it's just slightly better than my opinion they also sealed this really really difficult so I might have to go grab something or just for scary open here it's not probably it's not too much as far as packaging even with the some don't really worried about the video anyways once you see why I do it's to show packaging and whatnot you just get the tube basically from the rubber caps and some decent looking distillate with cannabis drive terpenes but hush also uses cannabis drive terpenes now so I swear like I really don't know what the point of even paying extra I guess for slightly more THC but I'll try it out on camera let you know anyways so actually I'm not even a lie I'm I've had Sour Diesel from hush this tastes a lot better I swear all the hush cartridges they have like twelve different strains and I swear they all taste identical you really can't tell the difference because they probably just he's like the same mixture of terpenes on all of them are seven whatever cheap ones they have or this one they probably just go slightly more in depth on the terpenes to get a more accurate strain profile and maybe you slightly higher quality distill it that being said it's still bottom shelf it's you know it's markedly cheaper than everything else the the effects still hit but uh but I would say buy something better if you want good quality you know but I mean if you're really just trying to get high exhales are great for that and same with hush but I mean if you're just really looking to get high with the least amount of money you might as well just be buying hush brand one so that's my opinion on it I'm gonna rate this one four point five to five out of five the hush ones generally get like a three out of ten these slightly better but still ad best five out of ten so wanted to get this up so that I could just enjoy it and not have to make a video so thank you for watching and I hope this helps somebody", "WTfuKDWp6Vk": "hey bud d9403 channel is an 18 and over channel for adults interested in watching how i am battling chronic pain i am a registered cardholder so everything you see here is legal for me now let's get medicated if under 18 please get the hell out of here now there i'm supposed to do that for every show now as you can see right here medical marijuana from columbia care uh disposable vape it is theraseed high tc uh four milligrams thc low cbd point two milligrams per three second inhalation it's a 25 mils and possibly 50 doses what i've been doing is keeping track of i've had this for a while now i've been keeping track of how many hits puffs i take off it and i think i'm around 40 right now so it's gotta be pretty accurate but i've liked this so far nice little thing comes in this child proof thing like can you i ain't gonna show the kids how to do it oh no kids are watching that's right take the lid off go like this there's no bonza push there's nothing like that the only recommendations i got for you is uh store it this way because if you store it like this your oil is gonna be you know flat on the bottom not all the way around you want it all the way around but it's as simple as the battery's already in it you ain't gonna do nothing it comes fully ready to go you can see the holes right there here we go pretty good for just a little quick inhale i wouldn't go much more than that you'll be coughing unless you get better lungs to me i am elderly all right cheers everybody let's go take another puff that was pretty good i have no idea what the strain is or anything like that i'm sure it's or they're normal stuff they have just checking to make sure it doesn't say anything but nope all right let's do a known these things are nice like i said i mean i've been testing it out it is getting low on oil you can see it's less than essay a little on this side that's because it's probably stored like this a little bit but it is what it is the other option i got yeah let's do another i do like those they are nice put them right back in here it's all labeled with my what i got to show everybody and everything else when i get in trouble or whatever you want to call it but i do have my credentials covered up there well that's that then we go on to medical marijuana from columbia care premium reserve concentrated cannabis oil let's see high thc low cbd four milligrams thc zero milligrams of cbd per five milligram dose of extract 200 doses per syringe here's the fancy syringe for you to look at as you can see it's about empty right now because i already filled my uh pot up and uh this is like a one mil i believe and this has got like 1.2 million or something like that so you you pretty much can fill one of these pods up of the smoke novo vaporizers i do like these but i'm starting to wonder if it's not powerful enough to push this thick oil let's see what happens and this is the automatic too i didn't buy this from the dispenser this is bond online all anywhere let me put it in there better i don't think we're getting anything out of it let me do a quick clean here and see what happens it was working just the other day now we got a blanket sometimes why the battery's dead with this i've been trying this a few times over the last week i guess maybe we can have and i'll puff on it like three times and i don't get much out of it i don't know if because the oil is too thick and doesn't heat it enough or what the deal is but i get more off the disposable one but i'm gonna keep trying it smoke noble vaporizer a little harsher than a disposable vape but i guess it works but like i said i haven't really been getting that medicated on it but does coming up fancy little you know nothing to it they just throw this in there that way it's all in the original packaging less trouble and then it comes in this box which is i can't really show the front because my credentials are there but you see it's from columbia care and [ __ ] it's just nice to get new products all the time in i'm trying them out i'll put the ones online that i like a lot but um i'll probably do a separate review for this this is another thing i got is a sativa blend it says for vaporizers only but let me know that goes i'll put it in my [ __ ] bong and do it i don't care but anyway it's 3.5 grams and they claim 140 doses 25 milligrams a dose let's see 2 milligrams of thc 3 milligrams of cbd per dose premium reserve cannabis ground flour medical marijuana let's see i gotta cover my information over this side sativa it's supposed to make more uplifting instead of indica which is in the college meaning oh man i just want to watch a movie and go to bed now this stuff is more uplifting so far i like it i mean i like ground flowers to begin with i mean i like it it's okay like i said if i want to be really medicated i'll get the indica which is coming up probably the next time i order from the dispensary but i hope you all are doing well out there i'm doing fine i just been trying out this new medicine for everybody so everybody knows what to expect when they go to buy it but i should put this in another vaporizer to try but i really don't wanna because it's already in there i saw a white out for a minute that's okay and i'm sure i still got the adapter from the hemper box where i could put this in my bun i'm not doing that today not sure if it really fit in or not right off hand i can't remember for sure but either way this ain't too bad i mean to me this would be something if i want to get medicated in the morning but not too high where i can't go do stuff and this to me is a little stronger possibly i'm not sure but like i said i'm gonna probably dab some of this [ __ ] i'm gonna take it out of this vaporizer i think here sometime and tried dabbing it for y'all i did it i did it when i first got this i don't know maybe a week ago and it worked great i was totally sober when i did it and i was great afterwards i was very medicated had quite a head high but man i was medicated i really didn't have any more pain or anything it just kind of felt better yeah i wrote cc in here so i know it's columbia curry that way i'm not because i got known just like this too and it's cbd so i mean cds does help my pain but this makes me forget about my pain and helps with the pain all right everybody i think i rambled enough for you i will try doing another video but you know how it is i say stuff and then don't do it um all right everybody stay positive out there if you need help get yourself some columbia care products i recommend just bought everything there i mean they're the experts ask them about it let's see what this worked for me i heard it worked for d9403 he's a patient of yours if they say nope we got something different or yep whatever i'd go with them they're the experts we're at the 10 minute mark oh man everybody all right one more and i'm gonna go you all stay safe out there columbia care thank you all right everybody out there thank you for watching the show if you like it subscribe if you don't just laugh it'll be fun alright see ya", "Hy9-NrmlBvs": "you guys know your uncle Rick is just super in the flour that's kind of like my thing is what I do I'm not really into the vape I'm scared of it to be honest I think it's like a step away from a terminator or like a Robocop situation all right uncle Rick trying new things see Deb it takes hella think I mean it's a super day there's like I got vocal gold dankness uncle's across the board you were to say hey uncle what's your favorite kind of buddy Acapulco gold I smoked it once in

concluded I just wanted to say uncle Rick approves yeah I got I smoked a lot of this thanks for coming out tonight drive over drive home it definitely tastes dank I don't know if I mentioned that earlier but dank tastes for sure certified dankness", "wB9vpJulP_4": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] mainly good quality bugs box elated you're gonna want to pre-heat your oven to 290 degrees and you're gonna want to decarboxylate you know all your bud used you know shape or trim I mean you can add Keith into the mixture doesn't matter Ruth is looking on as much trichomes as possible you know good quality trichomes so you want to pre-heat the oven up to 90 and we're gonna put this in for one hour and if you do it on lower heat if you do that like 282 75 you can cook it on lower heat you're gonna have to add more time so I can so I can do that for like an hour and a half but I've always done on 290 and the person has showed me how to do it and I've always had really good medicine come out of it so this is de LOI and if I keep doing it but you can mess with your times and all that stuff if you want but I'm just showing you the way I do it so I'm gonna put this in for an hour and I will be back alright after you've let your uh we the decarboxylase and turn your oven and stuff off look you're charged with alcohol I recommend doing this with a Everclear if you can get it it's about 20 bucks for a good sized bottle like around like 23 I know some place it's not a legal so you can use ISO isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol but make sure you use ninety one percent or higher and if you use less than ninety one percent like if you get like the 74 percent or whatever the other one like this day sell like a couple of was a fifty percent you're gonna have to put it in the freezer and then though you know to get those water to separate from it to get the outcomes they're just bested by the ninety one percent or really the bug like the food grade alcohol it's available in your area and after I put the alcohol in here when I close them up I like to shake the [ __ ] out of them is it just to get the stuff mix it on I'm gonna put this in the freezer for 24 hours and you know every few hours or so I'll pull the jars up shake them up put them back in there and when this stuff comes out alcohol it should be like like really really dark brown almost like a black looking color when we're done before we cook it off and that'll be the next stage so that's right now oh yeah by the way make sure that you change out your jars or let these jars cool down you know think you don't want to be throwing hot glass in the freezer shattered see you guys filter your extraction I use the coffee filters the natural brown don't use the white ones because they have a bleach on and you don't want to introduce any of these chemicals into your medicine so you just let it kind of sit in there for all the jars we had when the cloth that we have the actual plant material tied up down below squeeze it up that big bowl over there and 1/4 than everyone utilized as you don't utilize every drop of it that you can to get the most yield and most out of your medicine as possible so I'll come back after we get this process done when we get to the final stage of actually cooking off the alcohol and show it's plain aptio and we'll get into that that's an example of how the extracted alcohol should look a dark really dark brown after it's all filtered and stuff it should be a really dark brown color the darker it is the more yield you're gonna get out of that extraction so that's what you're looking for we're looking for that dark color like that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] first off the seams are gonna be probably sick and second of all you know wants to use building up because then it's a huge explosion hazard so be very very careful [Applause] honestly if I had my own counsel and I probably in my backyard clicking this off upside back way that's honestly the best would be and the rear an apartment it's about a second best thing I'll be back when we get down near the bubbles little tiny bubbles that's the last process early you just wait to see that no more of its boiling off and stop seeing the bubbles and although that's don't be like a nice smooth clear surface which I'll show you when it's finally said look how low that temperatures see I'm saying and by the time it's done he'll be just like barely on from that low part you just keep lowering of temperature man as you go I'm looking for the bubbles all right to keep coming to boil it off but you're slowing it down keep the lower temperature when it's done and tastes it all you're gonna taste rate hash a straight love the straight hash matters all you're gonna taste you taste the alcohol it means you boil it off how much to go directly [Music] this right here I knew with this row all this makes me t oh that's how they all make the hatchling here remember all that oil we have left in that pot right there today you know later I went ahead and took some of this uh like yeah Maharajah chai boba boba dong and Samurai sorry mate long tea or some stuff we've got a team on some fancy expensive tea but it's booked involved this [ __ ] [ __ ] smells so [ __ ] me like straight up like I'm like cinnamon and [ __ ] masa and spices awesome let me put some a couple of cinnamon sticks in there this is the first pass you could get the most oil in it but this is all cannabis oil infused medicated teeth and there's the second pass which is can tell by the colors and Cortis down being strong but this would be good for relax and have some good this one you know get cuff of that one there we'll definitely set you up medicate you just like if you took a glob of the actual oil say that's what I do do I don't waste any of the concentrated oil I make I made tea boil it awful done you know the last amount that's left in the pan utilized everything you know that's how the world comes over doing just a shiny that's I don't make a will", "x_VA34skETs": "hello everyone I'm Miki from Shenzhen China we are CBD tank manufacturers he is our son of our products today I would like to introduce our su Korean TV did Hank and packages to you we offer one green and half grand 7010 the superinten and this is our new acrylic packaging there are different flavor a choice see very nice to color white red and this Cyprian tank also have a different colors silver and the code here I'd also like to tell you this is our new presentation magnetic tank tank floating pot", "5D2j_YcHwZU": "happening people hey Ron here green 42 today I went to Arizona natural selections of Scottsdale and they had a new little thing going everybody's had one not everybody but a lot of people have had the fate you know regular vape pens that you put on a battery like this a lot of places have that and they're pretty good I like them but they got this new thing where you get to customize what you get you get to pick if you want to end it cut hybrid or sativa you can get whatever terpene you want they got it says one through six but there is no number two so I'm not sure what's going on there um it's fairly new so I guess it's just a misprint on these this batch you can get a double shot as far as I know they don't do multiple types of terpenes per thing but you can get a double shot of whatever you do want as far as I know so far they can get the flavors here which I didn't get and a shot of CBD 25 milligrams for five dollars I added that to mine I got the indica with a double shot of mere scene and then no flavoring um the CBD total was 58 and change which not a bad deal considering as a hundred twenty milligram cartridge they're decent size cartridge most of the ones that are 250 milligrams I think are about 40 bucks so 58 for this and it's totally customized to what you want is pretty good deal and works good tastes pretty damn good - I like Tamir seen whatever the taste is I'm sure that's someone that's oil in the CBD but do the double shot of mere scene with indica and the CBD I'm not gonna guarantee you're gonna have a good night's sleep but you up your chances by quite a [ __ ] bit I had to take a nap yesterday after hitting this a few times actually several times but and I'm not a nap during the day type of person so this [ __ ] works either typesafe guy they've got lemon een carry a filing mirror seeing Lenovo and pining I don't know if I pronounced all it was right but that's the ones they've got the one I've got is supposed to have the aroma of hops like the earthy aroma and supposed to be a sleep aid muscle relaxant which it seemed to work that way so anywho pretty damn good deal for for 20 milligrams plus you know your terpenes that you choose and your flavor that you choose if we're not too if you want and your CBD if you want or not I would say it's a pretty good deal right now I would go check it out I don't know if they're gonna raise the price at some point but that's a pretty good price or with the and they mix it right in front a - which is pretty cool so I like it so far I'll have to try the other terpenes but I give them props for trying some new stuff it's green 42 hey Ron I'm out", "ySpyC6mDLAg": "yo what's good everybody jay ping here checking in live respect my region.com here today with a west coast we tour review featuring the kurvana earth og indica high potency distillate baked car cannabis derived terpenes i'm very excited about this carvana one of the best uh vape companies in california one of the most most respected uh our overall always good flavor always consistent so whether or not you like distillate this is a quality product on the back they have the carvana scope here you guys can see some of the uh the the the testing results there and then they also have some of the terpenes over here so we are looking at beta cariophylline beta mercing and humaline uh should be earthy kind of piney and a little bit woody so we'll kind of see if those flavors uh pan out here when we hit it um total cannabinoids 91.77 917.7 milligrams this is potent total thc 86.34 so there's gotta be somewhere around like two to five percent terpenes in this um pesticide residue pass microbiological past residual solvents past vitamin e acetate pass heavy metals past foreign matter pass myosotoxins past so super cool instructions open your package press button slide out the tray for a single dose inhale for three seconds excuse me wait 15 minutes before dosing again all right so learn more at carvana.com at karvana underscore official on instagram so the earth og you guys i'm excited i cannot wait here we go button and slide there we go all right all right look at that check this out you guys beautiful distillate in here we're just gonna pull out the little thing and when we talk about what are we looking at there we go nice beautiful color gold gold gold you can see the brown branded little band right there no mouthpiece plug just on the bottom i kind of interesting we will be using the uh carvana battery today i've honestly given up on using the kirvana's little uh the the cover i personally like seeing the branded nature of either the cartridges that i'm using or even just being able to see the bottom it would cover it up pretty good amount so one two three four five to turn it on all right here we go three seconds it says to hit it so let's go not that much vapor on that particular rip we will do another first hit to give it a better experience and chance a little bit more so right there i did turn the temperature on this from the bottom power to the second uh second lowest um delicious first hit definitely sweet and woody almost like a cinnamon flavor if i'm being 100 honest um not exactly a a cannabis flavor i've tried before earth og it's almost like a fireball cinnamon like a sweet cinnamon piney woody weed flavor it says what does it say on the box here earthy herbal spicy baking spices kiss with a tinge of soil and an ogee rich undertone finished with a full body relaxation so what to check and see about the full full relaxation uh full body relaxation aspect of the high read the full review on respectmyregion.com i'll let you all know about the results for that but when it comes to baking spices definitely got this woody cinnamon uh spices there's this definitely this like earthy soil flavor let me see if i get here real quick yeah and then you get like an earthy earthy oh genius so i guess that's pretty accurate um nice work carvana definitely high potency is burning the nostrils 91.77 percent total cannabinoids their ascend line from cravana is very good y'all i reviewed the dutch tree very piney very sweet uh potent and this is right up there as well earthy sweet rich cinnamon kind of uh what they describe with baking spices wonderful when i think of a when i think of a score out of 10 um the only thing that's really missing for me is maybe the genetics uh otherwise it's got a perfect score on the terpenes and the more information on the back um packaging is cool the brown for the earth og makes a lot of sense it's very potent you know anything that's higher than 85 on the thc for a distillate is considered high potency generally speaking um especially with the total cannabinoids up there in that 91 to 92 range that's a high potency product you know i'm gonna give this a nine point um 9.5 for me that the baking cinnamon spiciness tastes a little bit fake i don't know if that's a true cannabis like from a true cannabis strain it just doesn't taste like it is but you know if it is i'm still up there uh very high score i think um 9.5 9.75 for me i mean it is a really good distillate product there is no yeah there's no inconsistencies on this very very very solid um i'll let you all know how the high is we'll let the high as it kind of gradually hits here uh

"hrBjEi61ctY": "farm name is pharmacy factory and I'm mark Greene in angry right now we produce many strains couple of them are we have chem sickle which is a Jamaican lambsbread by a chem four cross which is super frosty chunky has a real creamy chem four smell to it it's super nice with plus as that landrace the lambsbread in it and then we also do what's called delete we call to Leona and it's a lambsbread also by a gorilla glue for by an OG actually and they're both super distinguished terpenes the Leona especially has a terpene profile that I've never come across mastic ly different from each other and even though the book yeah and then we also do a Orange Phoenix which is a heavy orange cream flavor and smell it's one of the most distinguished terpenes that I've ever smelled the real orange not necessarily like a putrid e tangerine it's more like a grapefruit hanging Tami's as working and we and you get in the concentrate also of those things I would say I guess one is passion me and my brother both have a ton of passion for like I would say almost anything we do whether it's cannabis or the process of going about setting up the way we go our cannabis or the way we manicure plants or the attention to detail we give everything we really like to think about things a lot and thinking about processes and think about from the start to the finish of the whole process in and what we do throughout that process and so we put a lot of energy into what we do and then try to get that to come out in the quality of product and and that goes from not only growing it but I would say the process is that mechanical means to how we go about dissecting everything we do with the cannabis plant and how we go about going in and kind of methodical about a lot of process yeah we we try to do more traditional techniques of like soil grown cannabis we use guano's natural natural elements that the earth is put forth to actually make the cannabis so we feel we get the most clear terpene profile possible and also the cleanest flavor and then we also use a full-spectrum type of setup to where we do lights in the Sun spectrum so we we feel we can get the power intensity of light we need at any time but also balance it out with the the light of the natural Sun has to offer we feel it's a better way yeah it gives you a bit of doping profile gives you a broader range on your plant a better high I guess we're excited just to be a part of the cannabis industry and and be not the platform that we're at the beginning of it I'm seeing the industry grow and and coming from a background of always loving cannabis and it being such an underground world for us since we were little kids and coming up to finally be able to move that market forward in in the legal manner that were allowed to and be at the base platform in the cannabis industry we're lucky that we are a cannabis company that is doing all it can to survive in the marketplace it's it's a tricky tricky thing out there for everybody so we're just happy to still be you know rocking away and doing what we love the orange Phoenix is definitely a very trademark strain of us um it the terpene profile that we got off of this seed it is really unique and it carries through so well in different aspects not only in the flower but it carries through in the concentrates that we offer of that and it's it's a different profile than you see on some of the orange your tangerine flavored canvas out there it's a real distinct that's why it's almost a little more tangy and it carries through and if you look at the testing results of the profile it is really really broad and it has a lot of little hits of a lot of different things in it and so we love that because it's a it's very distinctive I mean we can smoke whether it's the flower or the concentrate you smoke that in a room with a ton of other smoke going on and it stands out and you'll notice it and you'll smell it across the room over everything else and so um it's you know it's just it's a fun plant to work with and see what we can turn it into and what different extracts and and things that we can make out of that plant that we really are able to carry through those organic terpenes that are coming from that plant I'm excited in the future to have that headband coming down the line because I had bandits a Sour Diesel headband it's it's it's we used to always call us our diesel but it's a it's a true headband weave my buddy ad not so a dog on Instagram he he the old family friend gave us the cut back in 2007 ish and it was our staple cut and it really got us through the whole dark market of this industry for a long time and it would go to event in the world yeah it is it's one of the best super chunky skunky Colombian cross that is a very sativa and it has incredible citrus but it's more of a sour terpene profile like the chem dog skunk colombian cross and it's a true true amazing producer most people would know it a Sour Diesel that's what we kind of branded it as from back in the day but it's a it's a headband if I could change one thing in the industry it would be take less stress off the farmers back and put a little bit more stress on all the investment money coming in this industry right now as a farmer we have to basically front our product all the way out through every different process until the retail sells it and it's very difficult for a farm to do that we have to front it to get it batch tests that we have to front it to get it to the distributor the distributor then has to get it to retail and then the retail has to sell it and then once the retail sells it then usually we get paid in most instances now natural cannabis is a totally different situation because you guys are pretty much the best company we've ever worked with so far and you're consistent and you're on it and you're timely and everything is always like it says it should be I think you guys understand the farms and so you understand this situation so you guys are actively participating in that because of you guys are just good people would have never existed and we would have never made it this far you can tell working with you guys that that you guys have appreciate the fun I mean you guys are out here at our ranch busy being trying to understand what we do and understand your relationship with us is with the plan and with what you guys are selling and that's a that's a big difference though there's no one else feels like they have the love for the farm or the plant like you guys are displaying much less enthused about it and and you know all the co inspires on a farm visit like this or understanding the plan of what the processes are or why anything is what it is and I think that heart for the for the industry you know I think that's it's it's gonna get more and more diluted over time and so I think put the consumers out there they should go to natural cannabis to buy the product because the product coming out of natural cannabis has more heart and love in it then what other places doing and so on your guys's half that's what you're doing it sure that you have high-end product in your stores and that that carries through to the customer coming in your stores I guess it would be more food you know I hope more people in our area in the Emerald triangle begin to succeed yeah survive and survive through all this and succeed it's a it's a it's a monumental task to ask of guys that have been hiding out in the woods forever that socially under their farm of all I mean and vanilla farmers yeah do nothing but stay away from people stay away from law enforcement stay away from the system you got these two entities one is going this plant and then this other is this corporate entity and this corporate entity doesn't mix well with this but somehow these two have to mix together it's it's a very difficult tall task you're asking of a certain type of individual that was successful to then move forward and become successful you", "x8y2bya3AsY": "[Music] so we're out here at the park got this cannabis infused in the conveyed cartridge from California dab company this brand I've seen at a lot of Long Beach clinics but I don't really see them out in the streets to be honest with you I go to a lot of events I've seen love from a lot of different brands and it's not necessary that I'm looking for love I'm just curious on what they're about doing a little digital research I got that they care about clean lab tested products but not necessarily the substance behind why I should care for California definitely where are they from what kind of flower do they use what are their principles behind what they do you know they have the merch though I saw a strong branded presence but not a lot of personality the personality doesn't make a good bait a good hit mix a good baby so let's check it out it's a really unique look check that out best that's not a see cell that might be a an e so why am i so corny it's not the traditional C cell but hopefully own getting old heavy metals nothing so I got to take off my raw garden part shout-out to dr. never divert mister

running a while yeah yeah they're fairly slow yeah yeah because they're so detailed yeah they're just so many to clear at you be back quite a few of my friends I receive I ok damage and this is a I think this one's a pecky language may not have to 2 pi n numbers and yeah being washed washed it out the ending ezio so you've been seeing very big God took apart Falls come through but we're just we're not doing a whole lot of juvie during the potency that I'm going to see Rizzuto some super currently carrying just get him I who cares what it smells like yeah down the optimum and so we can get a basic of a percentage sandwich so anyway guys we've got our test results here in our ethanol i'm going to show you we've got five thousand parts per million and that was coming out of the weed which so with those parts per million we can lock them down to zero you can either do that through many methods but through a Gitano oscillation agitation and just moving that material around to to allow that ethanol to escape from the resin so however you do that either through massaging the oil or just whipping it just aerating it and exposes the ethanol to the environment if you do use a lot of temperature you're just going to lose a lot of the your important two teams as well so that's why people use those property column purchase anyway there we have it and and THC count which I think they said the THC count was 78.1 that's for the total but yeah so we've got some big CB G's which is at 3.2 and CBD we have a four-pointer so and the THC was 69 anyway there you have it so we're going to wait for the counts for the terpenes and then we'll get back to this okay", "XdYLIhKwD00": "hey everyone jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com i'm here with a west coast we tour review today featuring the carvana one gram dutch treat vape cartridge when i first moved to california uh almost two years ago kirvana was arguably the only vape cartridge that actually tasted good got me high and featured cannabis drive terpenes which is huge when it comes to a real strain specific experience so dutch treat is a classic strain that i personally have smoked hundreds and hundreds of times i vape it every time that i see it at a store i try to pick it up it's my all-time favorite strain those of you that know me know dutch tree and jp and go hand in hand so we're going to check this out it does say on the package ascend carvana dutch treat indica pine sweet and citrus sweet pine following a citrusy aftertaste results in quick cerebral effects for relaxing the mind one milliliter 33 fluid ounces there is a carvana terpine profile here it's called cravanoscope on the back screen summary was pesticide residue pass microbiological pass residue residual solvents pass vitamin e acetate pass heavy metals passed foreign matter passed mycotoxins passed so they pass all the things pretty dope there primary terpenes trapinoline mercin and osamine that means we're going to get a sweet sour pine a sweet sour pine and some oranginess and some citrusiness so that's pretty exciting ingredients cannabis oil and cannabis derived terpenes total cannabinoids 88.81 percent and so pretty potent not in the 90s but you'll be able to tell when it's a true true 90 percent dissolute manufactured on june 23rd packaged on june 26th so the instructions say to open the package press button down and slide out the tray for a single dose inhale for three seconds wait 15 minutes before dosing again learn more visit us at carvana.com at karvana underscore official on instagram so plenty of information on the package again terpene information the absolute standard shout out to carvana love that this is why they were one of my favorite brands this is full spectrum high potency it says here on the front right there little icon carvana you guys are killing it all right let's go let's go all right child proof box so you push this right here right there we go it pops and then you get this beautiful cartridge presentation right there so we'll pull it out right that way look it pulls out the cart the more you pull that out there we go and per use with distillate a nice golden color we've got branded kirvana on the actual piece right there the hardware and then it says d-u-t-c on this side which is cool for dutch treats so can't really smell too much in the actual box but we are going to hit it once i'm going to talk about the taste and a little bit about the experience then i'm going to hit it again and i'll give you guys a score out of 10. so this is our west coast we tour official review they are in it to win it so shout out to gravana i've got a vessel battery here you guys can check this out beautiful wooden handle sleek here five different heat settings one two three four five to turn it on there we go oops i turned it off it was already ready all right here we go very smooth there is that terpenoline so on the inhale i got mainly this pine citrusiness and then as i blew it out and even now in the nostrils i'm getting this sweet sour terpenoline and that's what they're going for they want to be hitting those three flavors those three terpene profiles and there they have it folks right on the way on the first rip i counted to six bam um absolutely incredible could kind of feel my tears coming on my my dutch street terp tears a little bit of burn in the nose and my body is now uh a energizes what i'm trying to say wow second hit coming score out of 10. just as good as the first one mainly citrusiness on this time and then the exhale i got that sweet sour uh terpeno the terpenoline for sure the pine is important the citrusyness of the osamine very important the mercene is that sweet sour glue that that gorilla glueiness absolutely love it so um but i'm thinking score out of 10 you know you got to consider all the different categories we have for the west coast we tour presentation appeal color taste smell overall experience potency what i recommend was there more information available a lot of those things are crossed off the board you know they get 10 out of 10 in my opinion for their unique way of doing the packaging there's plenty of information on here from the terpene profile to the ingredients uh the the screen summary of the past what they test for i think all that just makes the person buying it feel more comfortable contact information super cool it's just a good way to provide and then even still like more information again it's just good to provide more information it makes the consumer feel like they're getting what they pay for now when it comes to the potency and the effects and how that goes i think they knocked it out of the park when it comes to the flavors the single source of uh well i don't know if it's single source but ideally single source nature uh it tastes like tastes like it's good distillate and the cannabis derived terpenes for the dutch treat are absolutely incredible so i don't know if it is single source doesn't necessarily matter to me if it is as long as the distillate is quality clean um got good color i do know what other you know bad looking distillate looks like um etc so definitely a wonderful experience for me i think this is coming out in the distally category for us i think this is going to be a 9.75 for me the only thing that i'm missing on this is genetics information on dutch tree i think they did a perfect job on every single other category when it comes to the taste the potency all of these things are pretty much immaculate the one thing i'd like to see is that 0.25 genetics information for the strains um we went and did so much for so many of these other things but i'd really like to see just what makes up every trend even if dutch street is or or whatever strain it is is that original one like that that is the one that went and created all the other things just put you know some little markers as to that uh you know this is the original one of the original strains or whatever it is so um great job carvana 9.75 arguably a perfect west coast week tour product they're distillate cannabis derived terpenes 88.8 one percent thc trapinoli merci nanosamine on the terps wow one of my favorite strains west coast week two review baby i'll see you guys down the road man west coast weed tour i will uh

for viewers ages 18 and over I do not user promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws of Prop 64 now sit back and enjoy the video what's good YouTube it's your boy savvy ji back at it with another fire video for you so first of all I'd like to thank all this recent supporters I've been getting lately man if you're new here man go ahead and smash that subscribe button right now man what are you doing that we produce some of the most fired content out right now and nothing less man nothing less so getting straight into it man getting straight into you know we don't like wasting no time out here man so for today's video man I got some of the craziest cartridges I've ever seen bro some of the craziest cartridge like the most eye appealing cartridges that you guys have ever seen I have ever seen anybody has ever seen man these cartridges are honestly like just by the eye appeal like I hope I hope I hope they're freaking good man I hope they're freaking good so for today's video guys we are going to be reviewing the hollow tips cartridges man this company is based out of California you guys can see right there man look look at this what did I tell you guys man this cartridge is crazy just look at the I appeal to it man like you doesn't don't tell me that doesn't make you want to smoke it right away man it looks like a bullet the distillate is super super clear and man look at it alright so right here we got the point 38 special which is a hybrid of full gram and right here we got the ak-47 hybrid all right so aside from the cartridges though I also have the matching batteries if you guys don't remember I did do I do do a review on one of these countries a long time ago so I have this old battery that they used to they used to sell but this is their new and improved battery I'm not sure if it's any different from this but it looks kind of the same but different packaging so let's go ahead and test these two out for you guys and I kind of want to show you guys the batteries just in case you guys do want to go in and cop one of these cartridges and you end up getting the battery so once you open it up you're gonna see open here right here I believe this is going to be the charger and the little magnetic pin connector and then nothing nothing too much in there and then right here itself is the nice-ass battery itself man it's all gold got the holotapes logo right there in the back and it got the hollow tips name right there engraved in the front man I'm telling you bro like if people see you oh and they got their their logo right there on top I don't even see them and I don't think this one has this one yeah you see this one does not have the logo right there on the top so that's that's something new that they added so and but yeah for the most part they do look like they're similar so like I said man these cartridges if someone sees you out in public your men are here with your homie smoking about yo what is that man like this thing is so I appealing man it catches your attention right away man so I'm gonna go ahead and smack both of these cartridges on there and I'll cut you guys in a little second but right here we got the point 38 special men and this right here you guys can see this little cap right here this is a collectible magnet that yes kink like you know I know there's a lot of people out there that buy cartridges of the same company and they're you know it's always cool collecting something it's always cool connecting something so like I said man the little metal connector you are gonna connect it right here at the bottom and show you guys just that twist on and I'll tell you do this thing but I just want to hit it bro I just want to hit it I just want to hit it because this thing is just like catching my eye man I can't stop looking at it so full gram politest point 38 special we're gonna do both of them in one video and then we're probably not to take some [ __ ] double hits for you guys man so Cheers if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 you are any other deal holy [ __ ] whoa dude yo that was [ __ ] tasty holy dude like you're literally as soon as the first hit man that first hit that first initial hit you get all of the terpenes event all of the terms and then you know that super super leichter penis that you get from plants that are super [ __ ] fire hey guys so after that first hit man this thing had me coughing and honestly like all right initial thoughts initial thoughts I haven't had I didn't really remember what the taste was like but this thing is so flavorful man I'm talking about as soon as you take the first hit that exhale you taste all the Terps all the freakin cannabis like literally everything there's no fruity flavors no artificial [ __ ] this tastes honestly like some pretty freakin clean distally like I'm not even gonna lie that first hit got me already to like you could feel it instantly the head change happen instantly man it might be just cuz I haven't smoked today but honestly you guys know me I'm a heavy hitter so for it to be hitting that hard it has to say something so this is the point 38 special let me go ahead and take another hit of this and tell you guys what the flavor notes are of it on the inhale you get like the really really it's not fruity but it's kind of like on the sweeter side of the terpenes it's not like very very OD ish but on the exhale on this thing has me coughing guys on the exhale it tastes a very very smooth like if you're kind of like if you're hitting um a joint and you guys know when you hit a joint but you can at the at the exhale at the end you can kind of taste like your little small notes of the weed that's kind of what this is providing with you guys so when you and the inhale you get the terpenes and on the exhale you get those those notes of the freaking strain man I've never I'm never myself had the point 38 special and I kind of want to try that in but form because if it tastes it as good as this man we're in for a treat goes so moving on to number two right here we got the ak-47 this one right here is the one that I kind of wanted to try man because like ak-47 like that doesn't that kind of scare you a little bit man like what kind of they they have some pretty unique names man shoutout to hollow tips so like I said man right here we got another magnetic tip just throw that to the side if you want to collect it and then right here same thing you're gonna have to add the adapter luckily for you guys you know hollow tips to make sure it's a pride you guys with too because I know there's a lot of battery companies out there that only ever provide you with one ring so if you ever lose like oh I see you guys these things right here I cannot tell you how many I freaking lost already I've lost literally almost every single one that I've ever had to battery so for them to be able to provide to with you is kind of that a little come up man a little come up so like I said go ahead and screw this sucker on and as you guys know you guys a little design on this man because this is honestly one of the sickest cartridges I've ever seen so as you guys can see right there I this kinda reminds me of like a little Fendi logo I don't know if you guys can see that but inside of the cartridge next to the distillate it looks kind of like a Fanny logo by notes they're hollow tips logo and as you can see right here on the bottom they have hollow tips engrave they got the California weed sticker make sure they're compliant with everything y'all ready though lab clean tested all that good stuff man so let's go ahead and some this on the battery and take some rips man cheers guys oh I didn't even think I was getting ahead I didn't see the light or not fool my gosh one second oh my gosh that was gonna make me cough horrendously if I didn't catch myself well quick written because like literally oh my gosh about oh my gosh that hit that three second hit literally was so much freaking vapor and I it would it just filled up my lie my lungs right away man you felt the lung expansion you felt the turps you felt every single aspect of this penny just filled your freaking lungs up or at least my lungs up you know I'm over here talking for both of us but yeah man I think if I'm not mistaken their cartridges have like a special special element right here in the tip that's supposed to create a larger air flow and create milkier hits pretty much so that could be why we got some pretty good hits me where we've been getting some pretty good hits office all right like I said this is the ak-47 let me see if I can get some more hint to that because our see for me it was just more like kind of like a just straight up OG if Ike if I can tell you guys the truth yes sir damn like literally every single hit that I've taken meant is straight lung expansion guys and I'm not even joking like dramatically like after those four hits that I just took I am blown right now I am pretty freakin faded i feel the major head change already and i'm just chillin at this point i'm just chillin at this point right because these are the craziest card shoes I've ever tried man hold on I'm a hit on both that you guys see if we get some point 3d and ak-47 special man so I don't know what kind of bullets does an ak-47 take just a point thirty there is pazatto point 38 special like a like a bullet or is it a gun I don't know but let's go ahead and hit both of you guys some of the craziest cartridges that I have ever smoked in a while now I can't remember the last time that I've been so attracted to a cartridge like this so right here guys I'm gonna take two different hits man choose guys I apologize for that son and stop I know I'm probably gonna have to cut that out here's me brother what the heck it was so what happened after he caught me cuz I coughed I died literally I it took me literally two or three minutes right now to recuperate myself and get get back into the video I'm not gonna lie I am baked as balls right now these pens those two hits I just took right now to where the icing on top of the cake works this thing tastes so phenomenal like I'm talking about so phenomenal I have not had some cartridges this good in a minute man and it's good to see you know a fellow California company just coming up like this and man like I said man I'm gonna be putting all their information down in the description below if you guys want to check them out man if you're over the age of 18 and 21 you guys have to be legal you already know we don't promote that stuff out here so overall thoughts on me on these pens man I love them I love I'm like I say I love them sorry sorry strong choice of words guys I like them I like them honestly I have no complaint about it I have as of now I have no complaint like the initial thoughts I have no complaints about it I appreciate the aesthetic look that they give you I appreciate like the full grams the really the taste man that taste the taste is phenomenal the taste is phenomenal I'm not even a cat like I haven't tasted something like this I think the last time I tasted something like this was like me the first time I ever tried raw garden maybe the first time I ever tried our garden this [ __ ] blew me away in our sea for someone to be doing this with dissolute it's kind of mind-boggling man it's crazy how good distal is getting I know a lot of people aren't fans of distillate now that's 2020 you know there's so many other sauce and diamonds and blah blah blah but remember distillate it's it has its own purpose it has its own category for a reason man and they lived like hollow tips you guys are dominating the [ __ ] man I appreciate you guys um producing this very very well high quality product man so we're gonna take another hit though want to take another hit for that one time for the one time for you guys I am baked as heck though and I'm gonna end it out here man like I said the flavor for this it's not to overpower with like fake terpenes or it doesn't even taste fake at all it tastes very very artificial very real very tasty man like oh jeez like at least the at least the point 38 special was a very very og and then that a k47 also was a little bit more like it's a weird combination between like an OG like a I don't know what I want to say like an OG and kind of like a just some more earthy flavor you feel me so man I'm big like I said guys overall high quality product 10 out of 10 man let's go ahead and take this rip for you guys the crazies cartridges that I've ever tried Cheers aren't you just get me every single time oh those double hits are finito you take a double hit you're out man so just like I'm gonna be out right now so I'm adding out the video here if you guys enjoyed the damn video go ahead and leave a like comment and subscribe it I won't check you guys on the next work", "rxDSYh2bzuw": "welcome back to my channel today we're be talking about vaporizers specifically the Pat pen there's all different brands that you can get this is a pretty expensive one it was like 40 and then basically there's all different brands that you can get their range from about $6 up to I think I paid 40 for this one so this is just an instruction video I couldn't find one online of how to use a vaporizer or Pat pen with a button on it so basically you have your your battery here and there's a button and if you hold the button down that's when you should inhale when it gets to a certain point where the coils are heated it'll actually blink three times there we go so that means that the coil is ready to go that your draws basically done and you're ready to have another draw if you need one so basically that was a three buttons if this if you press this five times well maybe it's not doing it now there you go so it's two two presses and it'll blink like this and that's going to pre-heat your coil okay so after it's so now after it's pre heated you can go ahead and take a draw off of it and you get a much stronger hit when you do that of your oil all right well I hope this taught everybody something or help them out I'll see you on my next video", "dtOPCNMHt48": "hello youtube [ __ ] boyfriend Lenny back at it again here to tell you about my CBD experience with the oils or the last video I was talking about with the tincture I should say I was gonna make a review ten minutes later how I felt about that but I was like you know what I don't think I'm gonna feel it so I took another job and haha I took a four-hour nap and it was fantastic the way I feel about the CBD is that the pier so I've ever had no does it work yes now there's a lot better CBD products out there but for the price that you get this for in the middle grams that it is it is quite quite perfect I am a frugal guy I like to save my money the best way as I possibly can and with this product that was easy to do I could see myself breaking it down seeing what affects me how much would I take prior to the gym how much would I take if I was going to bed or if I need help sleeping and yeah it is a really good product for 40 bucks I highly suggest it it is a wonderful step into the CBD world now maybe you want to go down for lower milligrams if this is your first time [ __ ] around CBD if not I mean just go for it if your experience with smoking weed or you know somewhat in the field of those products then yeah try it forty bucks it's not too much

later I mean it's a little dork but it'll still smoke and still take beats in a dump and burn up this one was a little more runnier than the ones I usually make I was in a hurry and didn't measure everything right but yeah you can see it's starting a little black but like I said you go this is what I use the dark wax with this works better if you use clear wax and but still work still good and you guys have a wonderful [ __ ] day subscribe like", "SDXcp2mxufU": "hey guys welcome back to our Channel I've had a couple of things planned so yesterday I went to a couple different uh uh dispensaries I went to the clear choice for cannabis some like that and and then later on after work I wouldn't got a pre-roll ad to the stash box so I'm gonna give you my review on both of what I got um before I do that let me get into something a little more festive let's do it okay so what I'm gonna talk about real quick first and I'm gonna use this little hi session smoking all these to get into my next segue that I have some news on my tell you guys this the first cartridge the cartridge I got yesterday it's called helluva needed um it's a marijuana extract this guy right here it looks like and isn't this the coolest it blueberry dream is the name of the cartridge flavor and elevated it comes to one ground this is what the market looks like it's very cool this is that oh that's not great this is it right here this is um what my austin wreck looks like it's Jerry and a little quasar and it just popped in here I've got the extender and this is the highest setting right now and it's 88 percent of total cannabinoids with an eighty percent THC now the blueberry tastes a little artificial I gotta say that it makes my nose burn just a little bit but the clapping at a minimum sometimes it's amazing but that's when it gets like no I feel like my that itchy nose thing I get is only with artificial stuff so I think the artificial is probably and the flavor is it's blueberry drew you might have heard of that so it tastes really good there mango flavor is tasty as well it doesn't taste artificial and they're watermelon flavor does not taste either so I guess it might have just been blueberry but elevated is a really good cartridge to put inside of a rig like this battery like this one of cartridges it could be hit or miss so when you find one that you like especially if you have the pleasure to go into dispensary and it's always being there pick it up um so clear choice cannabis a good dispensary it's it's a coma I think I think so yes is it - coming out it's right next to a Hollywood hustler which is awesome and they've got a bunch of THC sex related things so that's interesting as well and right next to that if you're great good in stone definitely vein clear choice cannabis it's a good will so go in there and find some good stuff I actually recently was in the gut that good well and I found a book that was about a soldier in during World War two that had the unique ability to predict German attacks based on his erections this is a true book I found in that good well this is real based on his erections protects German attacks damn like I don't know I've never had an erection but I don't know if any man that could maybe write a book on his dick soldiers I don't know but it's a really good place to find some unique stuff that good well next to you clear choice canvas so next I'm gonna get into this prequel that I got it's called pudding now this pre roll I've been reading this book the Goldfinch and I'm actually putting a lot of I'm putting all those readings here on this channel as well it's gonna be called the reading rainstorm and it's just me like 30 or 40 minutes honestly of reading so if you're not down for like a good

reading this book letting is a sativa hybrid and it's got um 24% a total Kanab in a way that's harvested last month and it's got like 1% CBD I've actually been liking the things that have a little bit of CBD in it because I think that's what makes it also like hybrid all right let's remove this one I'm just going to show you how French this guy is beautiful when we take it out it's kind of half smoked it I've been reading the step dang gas book but it's made with an L the elements papers I'm sure because it's got the elements what's it called filter so it's kind of been roughed in tough

buy my uncomfortable enough to read from this dream journal you guys ever maybe wanted to hear something like that we could do a read-through of my dream book um but it it gave me some interesting stuff and I'm not sure where it came from but then I thought about it oh my god I read like 40 pages of a really good book last night when I think when you dream like it's you just doing something all that you've got stored up in your mind from your day and if you don't do anything in your day or do something to store then you don't have anything to dream about it's just my opinion on drink some

really like heavy feeling on my eyes and I loved that it was really awesome so on flavourings gonna be ten on hi it's gonna be two ten and there's no smell so can't smell that but if the smell of the car was it'd be a ten out of ten would try again eh also let me know what video editing apps are really good for YouTube videos I need some stuff to make my videos a little bit more professional and I

raining really bad we couldn't hike we took the bikes up - we couldn't mountain bike whatever so we went to this place and then we ordered and there was that flat place called the flame burgers we did our order and all that and the power went out so like we ate in a complete darkness but ten out of ten would try again because that place was so far even eating in complete darkness was awesome and I

420 I've been watching that dude since I was like freaking in middle school it was insane um even but I love that dude you're a huge inspiration bro peace let's take a rip thanks Kenny", "tMC6AHZv5hk": "you can tell them one of these cartridges has a ton of filler in it the other one is pure just watch the bubbles as I flip them over yep so the nice clear one that's bubble is taking a long time as the pure stuff where the other one is pretty much just filler", "MVT2XgW-iec": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka and i'm back here for another video boys what's good how y'all doing i hope everyone's having a good ass week so far man uh i just got off of work you feel me had a change into the x shirt had to go pack a little bowl real quick but today today is not about weed guys today isn't about flour i mean it's not about wheat today is about weed but today it's not about flour guys today is about carts and i haven't tried a new cart in a long time guys something new and today i picked up a cart that i hope is good it's called legion of bloom i'm gonna take a bong rip before i get into it but your boy he has to find a good spot to chill at smoke at get a nice little view you feel me give y'all a view and show you guys if this legend or legion of bloom is actually pretty good so let me sit down for a second yo so we're here so like i said before guys [Music] you guys know i like taking bong ribs we back to that bong grip in the beginning of every video if you guys have been um long subscribers with me you guys know that i used to take a bong rip like before every freaking video so cheers guys [Music] whoo damn it's just some good i got some good outdoor with me right now my outdoor is actually not that harsh the taste isn't that bad i mean it does taste like that outdoor it's not that bad it's not that harsh on my lungs guys but um we're not here about flour guys we're here about balloon [Music] so off jump guys man it says the monarch premium vape cartridge it's a hundred percent derived terpenes it's a distillate cart guys but it's cannabis derived terpenes and these terpenes also are sullivan less terpenes so they're not made with butane or whatnot and then also on the back it says on the ingredients it says triple refined cannabis oil i'm not sure what that means if anyone knows what that means please comment down below i would love to know what that means i'm wondering if it's like alcohol when you distill alcohol over and over so it gets less you know less strong and less like more burn on your throat and like it's more distilled kind of you know more premium so the strain that i got i got one grammar it's mendo breath and i'm gonna be real guys they are good with their packaging i like their packaging it's a nice package you just slide it up and then it also comes with this little card let me give you guys a close-up real quick here we go all right guys so it comes with this card and it says that they won the emerald cups first place in 2019 for their distillate cartridge and then in 2019 they also won third place award for their dislike cartridge so i guess they won two awards during the emerald cup one with the first place and one was a third place so their stuffs are pretty pretty good you should be able to scan them and look it up online maybe i'll do that later i'm not sure but yeah guys the oil looks freaking magnificent it looks closer to like a um to a raw garden the heck yeah guys bro i ain't gonna lie so far this legion of bloom it looks fire as hell i can't even front it looks like it's gonna be a good cartridge for me [Music] comes in a little too and also guys these cartridges are good because they have ceramic coils so it's you're getting less of that metal when you're smoking and you're getting that metal near your lungs from all those other coils that are made out of metal and whatnot these are actually made out of ceramic um made with ceramic coils and um a good brand for ceramic um coils i'm pretty sure is an avd cart but i looked on the bottom of this uh the bottom of this already and i didn't see any brand name but they do say that it's a ceramic coil inside so boom [ __ ] looking nice and gold so let's put it on a cart let's see what it tastes like man let's see what it tastes like but let me look at that see this is the raw garden it's a little bit darker than the raw garden but it's down there similar let me take a hit of the raw gardens real quick nothing beats a raw garden man that beats rawguard we're gonna take the rock garden off we're gonna put the bloom on and they actually have a logo on on the cartridge it's actually pretty nice they put a lot of thought and effort into their cartridge so we're gonna see if they put the same thought and effort into the actual oil to see if it's actually good guys all right all right so usually guys i don't like distillate i don't like distillate cards the only distillate cards that i really like are like sauce carts and stizzy carts those are the only distillate type of carts that i do like and sauce carts they're a little bit different because they add different type of terpenes to it and what not to make it a sauce cart but off a jump this actually reminds me of raw garden this i don't know man this and raw garden are pretty dang similar guys let me hit this one more [Music] time yeah i can definitely taste it tastes like a raw garden earth like you know you got that raw garden that's sweet you know the fruity fruity raw garden but this this one tastes like that earthy that earthy raw garden it's actually pretty damn good i can see why they won the emerald cup now this is actually pretty damn good it's surprising that not a lot of people actually i don't not a lot of people made videos about this i've been looking up seeing if people made videos about it not a lot of people made um videos about legion of bloom shout out to legion of [Music] bloomberg [Music] but yeah guys man i definitely recommend this it's actually a pretty damn good cart i'm actually gonna keep this one on the battery for a little bit you know what i'm saying yo i hope everyone enjoyed this freaking video don't forget to like comment subscribe man it was just a little car review i just had to throw you guys a little car review because your boy picked up and whenever i pick up guys i just want to give you guys a car review show you guys the new things that i that i purchased because you know i like taking risks and i like trying new things you feel me and like um i don't know i'm usually a normally a live resin guy but today we're going to try we got the the distillate legend of bloom and i'm also thinking about trying the new stizzy they have a noose dizzy strain i have to try that um so we're probably gonna get a stizzy soon i'm

tubers back then used to do and you know now it's a little bit different there's a lot more reviews and you know challenges and things like that but i love that you know that aspect of just sitting

"b-N1jAkhjmE": "timmers here and you're watching Timbers reviews if you find these videos to be the least bit interesting useful helpful you just like my storytelling please subscribe like and share with family friends and absolute strangers today before I get to the review I want to talk about something and that is the artwork on the wall behind me the pumpkin with a ghost the silhouette of my daughter the polka dots my daughter made all that and I'm very proud to have that behind me instead of product endorsement because that's meaningful to me and I told my daughter I want her to make me new art so I can change it up from time to time and she's ecstatic like oh my daddy wants my artwork in his youtube videos the whole world gets to see it I'm proud she's happy so look for more you know don't just look at me look at the artwork from time to time that's real that's you know like i said it meaningful to means from my heart additionally i am buying some new equipment to record i'm buying a better computer so i can do a little bit of editing but have no fear the this is what I do okay this is hit record talk hit stop post it that's not changing we're not going to have like this ad decat style of chopped-up video that's all erratic and weird right that's not going to change what I do want to do is have the ability to put text on my videos I'd also like to be able to do coil builds and things like that and go back and forth between different cameras and keep it seamless and that kind of thing the storytelling is not going away the beginning to end all one take things not going away anyway today I want to talk about a vape shop and their house liquid Himalaya vape and temperance michigan there at 7350 jackman road in temperance and that would be by pizza primo on the corner of stern jackman and they're a really cool shop before I forget you can find them online at WWF a textbook com /a Malaya vape if you don't have facebook i understand i sometimes wonder why i still use it but anyway they don't seem to have an actual web page of their own yet but hopefully they get one together i'll include the link to their Facebook page underneath the review in the description over there by the subscribe and like buttons and all that stuff I already bagged about what I like about this shop is the atmosphere it's really simple they don't have a million things going on they have their tanks their mods wire coils liquid they have a couch they have a TV it's just relaxing they're the people that work there are awesome to talk to and I feel welcome when I go there and the prices are fair competitive with other shops in the area but some shops i go into and you know there's either a conversation going on or they're building coils something's going on and i feel like i'm getting in the way and all i want to do is spend some money maybe talk for a few minutes especially the amount of money I spend on e-liquid you know I don't want to feel rushed you know and not every shops like that there's one or two that occasionally I feel like you know come in I'm like I'm sorry can I spend my money and then I'll leave but not this place this place is chill you can go in there and talk to them shoot the breeze to the fat whatever himalaya vape shop i'm vaping lion milk which is their house himalaya is their house brand of juice lion milk is one of their billion flavors they have I mean they have a lot of flavors and what's cool about it it's steeped already they don't mix it right there and you have to wait a month to vape it it's ready to go and this flavor is complicated there's a lot going on okay and I've spent 25 to 30 bucks for a 15 milliliter bottle that's not as complex and interesting as this liquid 1299 for 30 milliliters the good price all their liquids are one 12 99 for 30 I think they also have 15 milliliter bottles I would blow through that in a day or two so I'm getting marshmallow okay I'm getting cheesecake I'm getting vanilla custard and it's all being bound together with some peanut butter just a smidge of peanut butter you guys already know I love peanut butter babes love them this one is not a peanut butter babe it's all the other stuff and then the peanut butter is kind of the glue keeps any one flavor from jumping out you know that said I said this is a complicated and interesting complex faith every hit something else want to jump to the foreground be at the marshmallow or the cheesecake or the custard but the peanut butter kind of pulls it back it reminds me of a pie so in grand rivers Kentucky there's a restaurant called Patty's 1880 settlement and they have all these little shops you can walk around they have Christmas lights up all the time around Christmastime the place is flippin amazing and they have a I mean that the decorating is amazing they have two inch pork chop okay is that thick pork chops like that big around it's a friggin hammer or pork it's the best damn porkchop in the country baked potato that must weigh two pounds the service is off standing the wait staff know every single menu item in the description of the item including the desert they have twenty-something pies they have meringue pie that that tall they have the best pecan pie in the world but anyway the wait staff they'll recite this whole thing to you from memory the service is amazing and the commitment that the staff must have to memorize that a you know all these different pies and what's in them what they are and what it tastes like it reminds me of chess pie this liquid which is I think something kind of southern kind of like pecan pies sort of a southern thing but that's awesome because you know I live in Michigan I can't really get the grand rivers Kentucky to get my chest pie get my 2-inch pork chop unfortunately I've never run into a pork chop liquid but that'd probably be a little funky this liquid takes me back to eating that Patty's get that chest Pam I'm already full I can't eat another thing I'm sweating I'm so full but dang and I got to get a piece of pie she's kicked marshmallow vanilla custard peanut butter pie no less when this stuff goes great with coffee I got black coffee I usually put cream and sugar in there but this this juice is sweet enough that uh I take a vape I take a drink of coffee and it goes together awesome no one flavor jumps out at me though I mean it's like they try but the peanut butter says not and but the peanut butter itself is very very subtle the vanilla is not overpowering either I've had some vanilla custard flavored vapes and it's very strong vanilla this is very subtle vanilla the marshmallow doesn't jump out and punch in the nose either it's it's subtle the cheesecakes subtle the combination of all four flavors is anything but subtle though it is very very flavorful but like I said no one of them jumps right out at the liquid itself you know it's you can see it's got a lot of flavoring in there it's not the thickest okay it's not you know like fog dog or something like that where it's so thick you can hardly get it in your tank but for what it is the vapor production is good that said I've been hitting this stuff so much over the last hour got a haze going in the house I'm going to need to open up the windows and turn on the attic fan to clear it out a little bit so go online to facebook.com forward slash Himalaya vape click the link provided below check out Himalaya vape if you're in the area by all means lion milk is a fantastic flavor for 1299 and I will buy more of this they've got a ton of flavor that they make in house they also carry on independent vapor company Charlie's chalk dust killer juice and a lot of premium juices but if this represents their whole flavor line their own juice is good enough for me himalaya vate", "MlCqh8BXOg4": "okay this doctor saw here a 420 Wolverhampton I'm just doing a short video today to show you what happens if you use shoddy materials and today I'm doing the full extract cannot be saw except it's not full extract I'm going to be doing it with leaf just to show you that you will not get the amount of trichrome breakdown into the resin from the resinous glands because obviously they're from THC and a high proportion of leaf is gonna produce a smaller amount of resinous glands right I'm gonna be doing this method the exactly the same is by doing other methods for the full extract but you'll see the difference right cause I've used a lot of leaf material and which I usually use for more CPUs because they contain CBDs and CBN's but as i say i'm just gonna show you what happens when you use the leaf instead of the bud as you can see i've set it to the right temperature and the fans working fine I've got the wings open as usual gonna go for exact same method he's warming up to wonder and by the missile sangria for Chi Chi hoons rave party people okay guys it seems to stop dripping now well Nene f so this is just to remind you again to use trim put instead of one trim boat or bottom boats and trim leaf because obviously your THC levels won't be the same and it won't be safe for patients you'll have a higher proportion the seaweed and in CPD's in there and when you're trying to treat cancer you need the highest proportion of CB of T I see that you can do so a please view a coaster even though we're not illegally industry we still have rules okay guys what I'm left now with is if you can see it's a very small proportion running liquid as I said this is not the way you should be doing your cannabis oils because these instead of being sticky it's really and very school for a little with Anna's plans if any in here so what I'm going to is nothing that I use a soil I'm gonna clean my whole machine out and start again good point and why good old distilled around nephews okay guys so I say again if I can say clearly enough this isn't the way you make the full extracts if you make it relieves you end up with as you can see I'm going to took it away the leaves can be used as extracted in different ways not least way this extracts the trial calls and makes the full extract oil and beans is little turn-on you get a runny nasty nasty tasting liquid yeah no not at all so that's a waste of a couple days ball not a waste in a way because least you guys know not what what not to do and I had to do it because there's a lot of product out there that is remade this method and as I've kept on saying for five years now after a lot of us did the research and I did my research on a lot of people's that keep on mentioning they haven't done their research for no reason ok guys so I'll leave it there and I'll leave it with you but don't use this method", "cXs7R9nGf4c": "all right guys

today i got another review for you today's going to be the crystal creek organics it's a cbd cartridge uh i got two of them i got maui wowie and forbidden fruit forbidden fruit is on indica and maui is a sativa so i wanted to note on the packaging the packaging is beautiful great display i love their logo crystal creek on the back and then you can also see in the bottom here it tells you the label of the name and the uh strain profile um so one thing i wanted to know about this company they have an amazing lab uh analysis on their cannabinoids so it's actually the most diverse cannabinoid profile i've ever seen it's got delta eight uh thca delta nine uh cbn cbd cbg it's got the whole range of of cannabinoids in there um so it really is a full spectrum um it's beautiful let me show you the uh the cartridge that way you guys can see it um give me one second i'm gonna take it out for you guys this is the forbidden fruit amazing effects from the forbidden fruit honestly i get very uh relaxed pain relief migraine relief um you know after my workouts like to use it before bed like to use it it helps me a lot with focusing you know just chilling out it's an amazing product the oil quality is amazing um it does crystallize slightly as you can see um that is normal because there are a lot of high percentages of cannabinoids in there um and you know the bubble hardly moves um honestly just a wonderful product the cartridge is beautiful look at the little sun display there on the top very unique just amazing i would give this a solid 9.5 because it is one of the most um you know just diverse cannabinoid profiles on the market that i have seen to date because i haven't seen many companies coming out with like you know thca delta eight in their products and this definitely has it um so it does set them apart from all the other companies and effects wise it's amazing terpenes are nice as well i'm not sure if they're using cannabis ripe terpenes or botanical but uh definitely it's up there guys it's definitely a 9.5 in my book um let me show you guys the maui wowie give me one second put this in here so this is the maui wowie so for some reason the maui wowie for me the oil doesn't crystallize i don't know why the other one does i don't know if it's because of the terpenes that they put in there or what but you'll see the difference now you don't see any crystal crystallization in that distillate it could be from the terpenes or who knows maui the effects that i get from it um very heady i get very concentrated i feel uplifted i feel energized i feel like doing things sometimes studying reading a book it depends it really gets your creativity juices flowing it's an amazing you know cartridge the uh the flavor is amazing i love it with the maui you get almost like a pina colada taste very uh tropical vibe um and with the forbidden fruit you get more of a fruity ish kind of taste it's hard to describe you got to try it for yourself but definitely go check them out guys this is an amazing company they have amazing products i believe they have topicals uh tinctures gummies they got the whole list of everything that you guys could want from a cannabis website so definitely go check them out and that's my review from them if you have any questions or comments leave them down below make sure to subscribe but that's it guys i hope you guys

I'm saying what I'll be using should I say so here's the car another connected cannabis company bro these [ __ ] carts are the [ __ ] I don't know I like the [ __ ] out of the way I'm in their pants down way better than dainty H hands down we're better than off White's are hands down better than roll these are better than all those companies that well all those carts companies this company right here I know that people are going to combat on the bottom saying well cannabis or connected is not they don't make carts or you know there's this it's just so much controversy God like people just worry about the wrong like the dumbest [ __ ] or like just so worried about knowledge about oh I know there's something I know that I know this who gives a [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] I know these cars are smackers man and I know that these cars are black market carts so not you know not saying nothing but hands them I'll give this not I say it 8 out of 10 wrong you know I'm saying because you know you got dispensary cars that are real deal like their robes I mean like the gardens you know saying or something like that they got those raw gutters they got those what the big Chiefs and all that [ __ ] they'd be selling out Spencer II like stairs those and all that [ __ ] I give you a hands-on to pass out this [ __ ] right here bro or not even you're immediately gonna feel a head change bro so enough with the [ __ ] guys here's another review connected cannabis company carts bro yeah we've got marinade for y'all boys and I never had this flavor guys you know but why not I it's a kinetic car bro it's got to be fire you know I'm saying so let's go ahead and take this sell it that's the only problem with these soils - it's hard to get out of here see if I have better luck this

I've had right here we have the same number and so does this melon eight so guys look at this all this [ __ ] it's like super badass you dig what I'm saying and you got the clear ring on the bottom two guys so I mean I don't know if that means anything anymore but yeah let me go ahead and snap the middle the metal ring on the bottom of this cart you did what I'm saying so here we go guys I'm gonna do a dry hit before I'll do a hard hit as always because at the flavor is dead then you got a real deal Carter for my opinion and my personal opinion you know I'm saying so here he goes guys oh yeah you know for sure you taste that lip melon for sure you taste that so gonna put that up just go ahead and hard hit this on the El battery does my third-best battery I would say because I gave the wolf brand or wolf it was a batter made by wolf and it was like it was a you can hit carts out of it and you can hear wax of it so I gave that away well actually I sold it so I mean that [ __ ] was a badass [ __ ] bro so let's go ahead and get this some other [ __ ] hard here guys and I gotta say it drop it in comment box let me know which I think about these videos I'll be dropping oh yeah Oh

not really reviewing anything cartridge wise I just wanted to open this on camera unbox it I stopped by and just got a select cartridge I want to try and get some white label extract cartridges tomorrow so I can review them and put them up here it's not I'm just gonna select Very Berry haze and just hold me over until tomorrow I usually I have this channel the whole idea behind this is if there's a bad cartridge out there then I try it hopefully you look up the video before you buy it you see that needle buy it simple as that so I usually only make one video per brand unless there's something dramatically different or a new version of a cart from a brand like buddy's distillate versus their libraries and stuff like that so I bought it select elite today and when I bought it they had just got a visit from their vendor who I guess that's how it works they're the vendors drop off all the products to the dispensary and she said they gave them some black and some white batteries to give out to people for free buying select carts so I don't know I think it might be a gravity battery I've never heard of that before okay so it looks like you'll see that is something that appears on packages in California I haven't seen that little symbol I believe that means full spectrum or that's like how they show its full spectrum I haven't seen that out here anyways it's a cool little thing I just wanted to open it just see if it's a decent battery if it's charged at the very least just show you wow that's pretty cool okay try and cover that up because it might actually want to scam that and I mean that's a pretty fancy plastic battery pretty sharp lookin - I imagine it's not charged but see if I got a empty cart around here alright so I get to at least open up one of these cuz I had a lot of trouble with this last time I guess this video is gonna be more entertaining than these are childproof containers I tried to I mean I mentioned it for a moment on the last one but sadly didn't record the original opening because only my original cartridge of the three that I bought so far had had one of these had one of these and now I got it again so supposedly yeah there you go I guess the last one I got was broke well I lied not that interesting then thank goodness so I was hoping I didn't have to [ __ ] and hammer that one open - alright so this one looks like it's gonna be draw activated okay charge and it's got a light on the bottom that's really cool it's not bad the light I think is where the charger goes into it looks like it's threaded card itself [ __ ] I'll review it very berry Haze sativa coming at 86 percent THC 0.08 percent CBD 93.6% total cannabinoids not too much I can say about these unfortunately because they don't tell you anything about the terpene profile I don't know if they even test for it I don't get much of a taste I don't know if that's aI don't know if that's from the battery or if it's from not using my vessel may go grab one real quick the last to select delete' cars I really enjoyed but this one I'm not really getting anything Barry from that at all it's like I'd say cargo filling I imagine because it tastes kind of peppery to me like dry that's about it but like not a good cart if you're looking for a berry cart I should say it's a great card otherwise it doesn't taste that bad and it hits and snacks I'm kidding I guess like the faintest berry taste but not really it's hard to get berry tasting weed so I'm not surprised but it does taste like haze I will give that which that's a more evil taste for cannabis so I guess this did turn into a little bit more of a review I expected it just to be the pin but that's what this is all about berry berry haze I'm gonna go ahead and not recommend that good card overall but I imagine if you're buying something called Very Berry haze you want something berry like so go first go for something else yeah I've had good experiences with blueberry and blueberry muffin both from buddies both those had a lot of transform the scene which has like an apple to berry taste so look for that terpene and anything if it tests for terpenes or look for a straight hind those so yeah that's all I'm gonna be reviewing today and that being way longer than I thought thanks for sticking around that's kind of as a community cannabis review we'll go take a DAB", "88ebh6XKLNo": "I just got done smoking some of um this really nice Skywalker really really stinky [ __ ] my point is of this [ __ ] I really love it like a break oh just trying look around it's so

really really nice stuff and everything showing my time just you know yes back in South Florida", "i-43_r_zi5o": "all right it's all right for another diver of you anti we are smoking on don't [ __ ] say anything about my pronunciation but I think it's [ __ ] Oh Mikoto not sure I can't really pronounce it but that is what the card is looking like here's the back I'm gonna try to get y'all wish I can yeah oh let's get to it and it's all you know if they're got a voice we got the Highness we got the taste and we got the harshness off the hit so without a further ado and wasting time let's get this [ __ ] started and for you guys that I'm wondering while my carts are half ways because I do someone calls them down before make a video because I procrastinate and I'm slacking and I don't do my part as a regular or not a regular but a real oh it was called reviewers it should be a first-time sir you know I mean I just I get so into it I want to smoke and I'm so late all right here first time spoken all today mm-hmm getting pretty low in these carts so we have at first what I was going to do is stop smoking sir every time I finish a cart like I'd stop for like weeks but no I can't do that like I don't want to do that I can handle it but I don't want to I've done it before plenty of times you just because I didn't have we to stop smoking so what I've changed it to is that I'm only gonna smoke once so that's so much how to cut back instead of actually stopping at one point even though I would get me baked but do it alright today we're going to start with taste if anybody or anyone's ever had green apple of this it tastes more like green apple then green apple does it's very sweet smooth warning do not exhale through your nose where that [ __ ] does burn very bad we're gonna see green apple taste and I kind of like the taste of green apple so one through five we're gonna give it a 4.3 it just wasn't good enough to be four and a half now we're gonna go with harshness I know change right here in a second but right now it's just this little buzzy so harsh it's let's go I wasn't really painful it was more like it was [ __ ] with my head like it was just twirling I'm bringing around and making me do your spin really really fast and now it's just like I'm lightheaded but it's like a high light head is like like that that time actually took a better second but yeah it's not really a hard [ __ ] like yeah it's making me cry yeah tear up and [ __ ] but um-hmm a 1:15 and I don't know if it's a 1:13 with your folks I went to Temple um coughing it's it's pretty bad but like usually I feel like shaking up and [ __ ] and don't feel so nice but that was nice it felt good I even thought again now is that bad but yeah that was pretty good I like that so - we're gonna give it about it - I should week but it feels good like I like it no a [ __ ] sitter so you don't wanna be if you just want to feel good take nice it's smooth it's night Rhett definitely recommend this you only a bait I'm just talking out of the wazoo mmm Highness I feel like my moods changed it's not so tense because usually I'm very light and loose but today I've been all tense Oh since yesterday later last night I've been - I lost my wallet I just got me bones or not my bones but I got me I just I just haven't been in a good mood since lost my wallet oh my there wasn't a money or anything in it was just my tea it was like [ __ ] that [ __ ] that [ __ ] some more get another ID gay not some good dudes make some nude feel better so I'm a loser I'll probably go play something

region.com here today with a west coast weed tour review today's product the napalm cannabis live resin diamonds vape card this is a napalm og strain this is one of their staple streams exhibits company with ted major partnership going on here in california the napomoji 510 cartridge one gram live resin diamonds take a look at the packaging this right here is what a perfect score for packaging looks like absolutely beautiful the only thing that i can possibly find that i would take away is i need that terpene profile and some genetics listed on the packaging on the presentation but when it comes to looking like absolutely incredible so uh the actual product uh again one gram napalm og live resin diamonds vape cart thc 73.94 percent um cbd 0.55 total cannabinoid 76.82 manufactured by goodwill llc manufactured july 23rd packaged july 23rd twist the cartridge onto a compatible 510 thread battery and draw from the mouthpiece to start vapor flow repeat until desired effect is achieved you guys ready i'm gonna hit it once talk about it hit it twice give it a score out of ten look at that man absolutely incredible and then you can just pull it out using this little cardboard piece here oh there we go i guess that's what it's for huh all right i'll set that right there check this out you guys [Music] napalm branded look at that little emoji right there the little flame that's super dope i love it i love it and then it's got the orange rubber pieces this cartridge is just beautiful the black tip look at that nice colored live resin inside of there check this out you guys get you guys some of that good color right there man all right so we've got a vessel battery we're going to use this here today a vessel five different heat settings this wood grip here beautiful stainless steel or metal i'm not sure how it is it's pretty simple though you just set this in there doesn't fit with the napalm cartridge cool thing about that is you can twist off the little accessory there we go and get it to fit this way simple twist on you don't want to over tighten it so as soon as it's secure done twisting push the button five two three four five and it turns on it blinks and then all you're gonna do is rip it you guys ready oh yeah okay here we go i'm gonna hit it right this time i wasn't sure if it was working so i really enjoy how heavy the cartridge is i think part of the part of what makes napalm different is their commitment to a truly premium luxury cannabis experience um you know the gentlemen that are running the show there are putting the time and energy into making sure that all the you know the eyes are dotted the t's are crossed in every single way the color on this live resin is just perfect and then you look at the actual little flame emoji here the flame branding combined with the packaging that's right here it's incredible i love the orange the sleek black look the uh the terpenes on this are fire this is why i wanted to be able to know what kind of terps i'm tasting in this when you talk about live resin you know you're going to get terp so i'm going to hit it twice give you guys a score on 10. while the flavor the flavor on this is incredible definitely not distill it you know with live resin and sauce pens on the market in california you never know if you're gonna get a true live resin product or something that's been blended with distillate or even just the sauce from all of that um what's what's cool is at the lower temperature i'm getting no burnt popcorn taste i'm getting nothing but earthy pine this sweet berry uh and i think what's cool about that is an og should be sweet and piney and earthy and there should be a pungentness to it and this is definitely roasting the nostrils not because it's hot i'm hitting it on the lowest setting here on this battery five heat settings i'm sure it's around two or two and a half volts or something along those lines but it's absolutely incredible when i think about the battery experience combined with the cartridge although i although it couldn't fit with this one i do feel that the luxuriousness of this cartridge of the the hardware definitely will overcome the fact that it may not fit on all the different devices and just looks sexy and sleek you know this is working even though i had to twist off this little section it's still working and so i think that's wonderful um score out of 10 presentation appeal taste color smell potency um what i recommend hell [ __ ] yeah um experience you know this this for me you know price point depending on the at the at the store this to me is probably a 9.5 out of 10. uh what gets me is going to be 0.25 on the genetics and 0.25 on the terpene testing again we want to know if it's 100 cannabis terpenes we want to know what the terpene profile is at least the you know two or three of the main flavors that we're getting and then the genetics is always helpful to understand the lineage and some more information overall i think this product is immaculate i think napalm cannabis company whether it's the grenade or these items or some other ones that are coming down the line they do a really spectacular drop of the branding so shout out to ted in exhibit putting this together 9.5 out of 10. absolutely incredible from the flavor to the taste to the experience and the high you name it go

dad connection we're taking a look at the steam cloud Evod battery and first thing I gotta say is the battery lasts a really long time so the battery this thing is really great I've been hitting it for quite a while stopping that to charge it and I think it's a 900-mile that's probably why so it really just has more battery the power staying power then then a lot of other ones as far as the battery itself it's pretty standard I mean it's a pretty much a standard Evod battery I like the button the button is better than I've seen on some styles of this batteries it fits the standard 510 that way and I guess it can also fit those ego 510 the ones that have both threading but that really doesn't happen on feed cartridges as far as a cartridge battery it's pretty good I would say it's not it's not the best battery it's not the worst battery but if you want something reliable that will last a long time it'll definitely work for that the airflow is pretty good and it hits pretty decent so you get some hits out of it yeah it does it good it's got of the voltage right down there on the bottom which is kind of cool I do like that twist that's not bad so yeah I mean overall you know I give it two thumbs up it does the job and it hits decent and the battery lasts long yeah some of you might not like how long it is and it's nothing you know particularly super special but it does the job it hit decent and the battery lasts a long time so that's the review of the Evod steam cloud battery thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "o4m-Ad5-fq4": "so sup everyone it's

honored to introduce to you the launch of our new CBD product line that is available online for sale called W W CBD Gold Line comm we're gonna make sure to put the description the link into the description below and Gold Line CBD is our new CBD line that is a comprehensive and full line now I just want to make today's video a real quick introduction about our CBD Gold Line I'm sure you guys have seen it in several of our vaporizer tests and demos as we've been putting the line together and getting the website ready for commerce and now it is finally live and ready so let me just go through the different categories and what we have and I'm sure we're gonna do more videos of in-depth product tutorials about the products its uses and all the different facts that we can talk about and again if I forget something or there's something that you guys want to see in our CBD product line make sure to drop it down into the comments below you'll see me interacting there with you guys so let's jump right into it first part of our CBD Gold Line is our CBD liquids so these are really flavorful they use a really high quality CBD isolate and we have them in four different flavors for you guys here to start and that's we have a natural we have which is very natural just meant to taste like the CBDs extracts very very pure earthy not really has much of the no real infused flavor just the way they would taste off of a natural extract that's our natural taste we also have our strawberry which the the flavor is pretty self descriptive we have a tropical which is kind of a tropical blend of flavors kind of like you would have like a like a tropical punch and then you have which is probably in our office the most popular you have the mango flavor now all of these flavors are infused in there to have a really nice flavorful experience but not to become overbearing so we have that liquid broken down into three different strengths which you can tell by the color of the label and here I have it from low to high so you have your low medium and high your low contains a hundred milligrams of CBD per bottle and each bottle is sized at a thirty milliliters size so our low-end you have the hundred milligram which is a very light infused bottle you have your red label which is 300 milligrams in the 30 mil bottle of CBD and then at the very top which is our high strength you have the 500 milligram infused bottle we wanted to color-coordinated to make it really easy for you guys to differentiate what the strength levels are and also within this line you're gonna have four flavors as you see if we split here on our display now this liquid can be used as a sublingual tinted tincture so it can be ingested and it is also actually vey pible now so if you want to vape the item you can do so what is the cream of the crop kit that we recommend for vaping these liquids and truly feeling the flavors well I don't think anything tops right now what we have available is our subohm sport especially if you pair it with the bubbler now you guys can see in depth reviews on this product and all of our other oil products if you want something more concealable for your CBD oil vaping to fill your tincture you can always roll with one of our rippers we've just posted the in-depth product review for that as you can see that's our concealable sub-ohm vaporizer if you want something smaller then you can always pick up one of our cloud tanks and pair it with one of our lovely batteries so for vaporizers if you want to vape it you know on vape honey stay calm we got lots of really cool vaporizers for vaping these CBD oils we're also gonna throw some of these vaporizers onto the the CBD goldline website now let's keep rolling with that liquid so those are liquid tinctures that you have however if you want to do liquids and try it and not really go the bottle or tincture route we sell a really high end prefilled cartridge which comes in boxes like this which will indicate the flavor which you can see you have natural these are prefilled one milliliter cartridges that contained within this cartridge contain a hundred milligrams of CBD this is again available in the four flavors natural tropical strawberry as well as mango each one is filled into our cloud tank which you can buy empty on our website really high quality premium tank we also do an in-depth review on this alone here on the channel let's jump into it that's the bottom cap that I just pushed off there it's a 5-10 thread so it'll screw right into your batteries it has adjustable air flow control so you could really dial in on your hit this thing has really good seals so it's not gonna go leaking on you and be a really good reliable tank that you can actually refill when you're done vaping it here so you can refill this a lot of people can get 8 to 10 uses off of it easily if you're looking for a good battery to pair this with we have our B master battery that's the multi color we're gonna be posting the video for that one real shortly it will probably be on the web on the YouTube channel by the time this video airs or you have our Gold Line variable voltage battery which is our oil vape pen all design button made by honey sticks so you know that it's got that high quality high power like Ronix these batteries are both available they work fantastic with these cloud tanks so check those out those are available again in the four flavors that we talked about if you just want to get into trying CBD and you possibly don't know if you want to go the rich article route we also have CBD disposables also available in the four flavors as you can see those are the four flavors for the disposable pens and each one's disposable pens already comes prefilled it makes it really simple you just open this package up and you can start inhaling what we used for the power plant here is our honey stick disposable flavor Maxx oil pen so it is a little disposable all-in-one oil pen as you can see we did a separate review on this on the channel as well it is also available on the website separately for sale this is a good little vape pen it's disposable it comes prefilled it has a ceramic heater so it's gonna give you fantastic flavor notes real easy to carry around very small light unit you just simply draw on it the LED light will come on and your vape II and then when it runs out then this batteries ready to go and you can pick up another one or you can step into buying tinctures or going the prefilled cartridge and rechargeable route but these are really easy convenient if you're on the go if you're traveling or you're going out for the evening you don't want to worry about your big box of a pen you can pick one of these up it's a really easy way to get started so that pretty much covers our standard liquid vaping if you want to really go for the purist kind of experience then we would recommend to go into the crumble which is the dabs and we've done several of those as those reviews as well on our channel to where we've tested and used the gold line CBD crumble now just one last thing about these disposables this is a half mil capacity and it comes with a hundred milligrams of CBD infused in there so out of the liquids this is probably the strongest concentration per milliliter that you can get so it's a small tank with half a mil but there's a hundred milligrams of CBD in each one of these cartridges which one serving is the full cartridge so it's a hundred milligrams within the whole cartridge okay that doesn't mean you have to vape it all at once but that just means that's what the CBD content is so we have the crumble which is a solid which is a very pure full-spectrum CBD which we get from one of our partner farmers in Colorado it does not have THC in it that is within the legal confines for shipping we made sure that we have lab reports on our website for all of our things none of our CBD liquids have any THC in them so they are legal for us to sell and to ship you can check the lab reports so these will be done like a wax and dab and we have these available here in a 250 as you can see which is our lower strength and then right here we have our higher strength which is indicated in the black with the black which is a 500 milligram concentration crumble now these are little grab-and-go packs which is mainly for travelers and people on the go or people who just want to try it you can jump on you get one of these packs whether you want a lower or a higher strength now both these strengths I would consider as high in full spectrum relative to a lot of other forms of CBD in terms of vapor bowls they have a very pure CBD taste very similar to other crumbles that you might have sampled these are paired with a disposable rippen ditch which is a sampler very inexpensive but very good wax pen you can check out the full review for that on the channel and if you try one of these things and you're like hey I want to start using this crumble more regularly we sell just strictly the crumble by itself in both the 250 milligrams concentration and the 500 milligrams then you could start buying those and get into possibly a more permanent pen like our plasma wax pen which is just an amazing flavorful pen that we have a full review on or even our stinger which is our ceramic doughnut rechargeable kit or you want to jump into a hybrid tank and usable or mod there is not a shortage of amazing wax and dab pens that you can use so anyways now that we covered basically our vapor bowls let's go into the last category of our CBD Gold Line which is our edibles so we have two different forms of edibles here we have a full spectrum Gold Line honey stick which which has 20 milligrams of CBD per honey stick now when you pick one of these up comes with instructions benefits and uses right here you just open up you get five of these honey sticks each one of these honey sticks compared to a lot of the honey sticks on the market these aren't isolated and use these are a full-spectrum honey stick CBD oil infused so they are more powerful better activation you get 20 milligrams of CBD per stick these are meant to be orally ingested you can use it as you would use any other honey a lot of people put it in their tea put it on their toes whatever you want sore throats things like that people say it does the same job of honey with the added benefit of CBD how do you use it just simply either cut the top or bite the top or start pushing and just like a regular honey straw you would then ingest this honey straw and get all the useful benefits of a CBD these come in five packs are available 20 milligrams per stick check those out then for people if you think honey sticks aren't for you but you're more of a chewables person we have our CBD gummies which are 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy we have that available actually in two sizes a large and a small bottle we have an 8 ounce jar and a 12 ounce Schorr the quantities on these the large albeit these get filled by weight and by size of the jar so you will have a variance of one or two gummies but in general so you have a good idea you get about 60 or so gummies in the small 8 ounce bottle and you get just about close to a hundred and the Big Daddy 12 ounce jar here of these delicious little CBD gummies they are 25 milligrams per gummy so they are relatively strong strong potency in terms of CBD so that covers your edibles on that side so that in a very quick and brief way is our CBD Gold Line which like I said you can find at CBD gold line.com and Gold Line CBD calm it goes to the same place or team here at honey stick kind of take the best CBDs to pair we made and provided all the equipment we've worked a lot of our customers and contacts that we make vaporizers for to make a perfect CBD line which we're making available to you guys now now I'm a vape designer and a

Gupta and all of these people who talk about the benefits and necessities of CBD for people whether you're sick or not and you can do a quick search and make your own determinations but I think the

Mary and I'm gonna do a review on the DAO vape pen I was drawn to these we sell them at thrive yoga in Chattanooga Tennessee where I work and I was drawn to these because of the name and the packaging I loved the dow I've studied the dow for years I'm an energy healer and and do a lot of Earth Medicine and I like to live in alignment with the Dow I've studied the Dow for years and so I was drawn to the name at first and then the more I looked at the company and realized that they do all this medicine and the CBD oils in alignment with the Dow and the names of the oils or the elements so I chose fire but they have wood metal earth water and they're all made out of the highest quality well known strains that are that are available so that drew me to it and the more I've learned about the company and the more I've used this I really do feel that energetic connection with the Dow this is how the pen is packaged when you open it it comes with a pen and the battery and this is about $20 and the pen would say in the same spirit as the box has the beautiful scenery nature singing and I think it's beautiful and elegant and to plug it in the battery screws on like this and it goes in a USB port I charged it for about five hours before I use it the first time and I keep it on the charger when I'm not using that helps me keep up with it too and the oils are packaged like this and you screen the tank on the same way that you screw the battery on and it's ready to go I do find that I have to hit it a few times when I first start using it after charging to kind of heat the tank up but this is a lower heat tank or battery because they did it to the perfect temperature that keeps the medicine and the integrity of the oil so and it's also in this cobalt blue tank which is used also with essential oil and other tinctures to protect the medicine from the UV ray and the fire has a very nice it's made from super Lemon Haze strain so it has kind of that lemony flavor but it also has a pungent earthy flavor that I find very pleasing and I like the taste of it even after I've used it so I'm still taking a CBD tincture in the morning I use it for my a DD and I'm using this as a booster when I sit down and take a break to kind of refocus the next part of my my mope work or what I'm doing that day and I will just sit with this and be very present with it and I find that after I use it for about five minutes and go back about my day I have a boost of my energy my concentration and focus and clarity are definitely enhanced and my energy is enhanced I find it better to hold it up and down when you're using it rather than like a cigarette because it seems to pull the oil better and I kind of draw on it like I would have straw and the one other thing I wanted to mention is that I like the the quotes that they put on the box they have a different one for every element of the CBD oils and the fire one is the path to renewal and it says life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes do not resist them when I let go of what I am I become what I might be so I'd like to come and be present with that and while I'm using it be still and I find the results very pleasing the other thing this book says is connect deeply to all that is around you let the old fall away when you enter renewal your cells tingle with the life forces transferred and your path becomes you so that's my review on the dow baked pen and the fire CBD oil thank you for taking the time to watch my review hope you have a great day", "2QdVuaHzI4E": "hey everybody my name is Justin also known as nasty stranger from the 18th Street gang stay right here in Los Angeles my Glendale just wanted to do this THC cartridge review because I googled this company called ignite cannabis and so far nobody has done a review on this company so I was very interested in this company because I love potent THC oil that's my latest thing and it's hard to find very good potent oil up there these days you know I gotta have a least 89 percent THC to get me good and I only like indicas or indica dominant hybrids I'm not interested Evo's you know I like getting couch locked you know I got a high tolerance you know my favorite company is select oil because they're very potent for a good price and carvanha a sinned but I was looking to find a company that's just as good for a good price and I found you they're called a night cannabis company started in 2017 California company I found a half a gram first for $45 at Green Wolf but I was like oh that's too expensive because select is only 35 for half a gram well I'm like if this stuff's 45 is gotta be fired so finally I found it for 30 yet for alpha gram at la cush on Alvarado and I laid so I went and picked it up today half a gram for 30 bucks oh gee cush cush indica straight fire 80 percent THC you know as well you know packaging looks like Hotel proof on it you got to push down on it and you open it up that's what it looks like take it out you know look at the oil look at the oil straight golden see-through so thick the bubble does not move straight potent I recommend it to anybody that wants a potent card for a good price try ignite og at Los Angeles cush I guarantee you try it once you'll be back for a second two thumbs up great job ignite", "k9_z857qA48": "hiya Mandarin Regas here from chronically baked goods we're a small at-home medical marijuana company we make concentrates wax shatters butters cooking oils all kinds of things we believe in eat to treat but we also smoke and we vape it's a lot easier to vape in public and we use pens smokeable pens in order to do this we have to outsource to a company called connoisseur concentrates they make terpenes of all types of flavors this is one of their pens this one is disposable they have rechargeable 5-10 pens with tanks and we use our product and their Turpin's and we make a total line of to go flavours right now for ourselves but we're trying to expand a little this one here is bubblegum [Music] it's quick just like smoking it's faster than waiting for an edible to kick in or a daily capsule to kick in it's really nice around the go it doesn't stink up your car the terpenes come in little vials like this this flavors skittles honestly it's the first time we've had it I can't wait to try it my favorite flavor is strawberry that's because I love strawberry everything I think it's better than the grape sometimes I think grape is too sweet the bubblegum is fun it's really sweet but when you use these concentrates which are or these terpenes I'm sorry when you use these terpenes super simple super simple you use their terpenes you put a little bit of your concentrate in there shatter crumble butter and you dissolve it in there with a little bit of heat you shake it up make sure it's all mixed up and then you get the eyedropper and you just put it in the pen it's super simple now they have little tanks I use a lot I upgrade it I twisted me some coils put it on my mod with my tank and it's super simple on the go I can use it anywhere it's discreet it tastes great and it's it works I love it [Music] it looks like you're vaping and it's really helpful for a society that is teeter-tottering with the acceptance of medical marijuana and recreational marijuana so as a small business owner you can't do everything yourself sometimes you have to outsource and we like to outsource this is counter-story concentrates otherwise known as the solution I suggest you check it out they have all kinds of flavors strawberry bubblegum grape tangerine banana pineapple then they also have some of your favorites tray flavors cheese gorilla glue I think it's called grills for some of that fruity pebbles skittles so if vaping is something you enjoy if medical in your state or recreational and you enjoy we strongly suggest the countess water concentrates terpenes try strawberry", "V9oJsegDYAE": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

I screw this on to there like so if it fits and it should fit no problem and boom ready to go that looks weird as [ __ ] but we are ready to go get high as a [ __ ] cool where's that", "uOEo9CAoUog": "hi this is Catherine certified nutrition consultant with Boots I heal you and food to kill you CBD and today I'm going to talk about how did they CBD hemp oil and I'm going to cover a lot of questions then I'm receiving through Facebook and through email to help you decide what method might be best for you answer questions like how long do I inhale how often do I do the vaping what strengths do I need is it safe do I inhale into my mouth or my life and try to cover a lot of these questions in this one video and not make it ridiculously long okay so they don't bore you alright so let's start with the two type two different types of vaping systems we'll start with that okay so I have here the vape shot the vein shot and it comes in a starter kit if you check out my website which by the way I'll have a link below this video to my website and the Facebook page but basically this is a kit so you get the battery and it's partially disposable because you get a battery and you get a little charger USB charger so you got your battery charger when you receive it in the mail let me look which end when you receive in the mail you're going to charge it up 30 to 45 minutes initially and then you'll have your cartridge will come in a little package there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this little one milliliter so it's very potent and surprisingly it lasts quite a long time but this is disposable so you vape until you've run out of liquid you throw this away and then you get a new one and you put it on here so you put them what you you twist it on here you've a bit until it's gone throw this away now one of the nice things about the disposable cartridge is that if today I want the mint flavor and tomorrow with the citrus all I have to do is switch this out for a different flavor that's kind of handy you can't do that with the refillable the other things that not is it's nice is you don't have a messy tank here that you're trying to refill and you don't want it to leak leak I found with the refillables they leak now not all there's I have found a good pen according to customers anyway a good pen that doesn't link but anyway so the difference here is that this cartridge doesn't come apart you don't refill it you cannot refill it you just throw it away buy a new one get citrus cush or mint and okay it's real simple now this is a newer system that we have now it's a C cell battery which is a higher quality battery and the vaping is wickless so it's a higher quality vaping it's a really nice vape okay I'm going to go ahead and switch over now to the refillable and then I'll go through how to do this how much you need and all those details okay so the second type I have here is refillable and I have a video on this it's pretty old video but you get the liquid and this this is what we have on our website is we have mint push or citrus this is the liquid again just like with the vape shot our liquids have no propylene glycol no THC no artificial flavorings everything is natural and safe and actually healthy okay it's going to reduce inflammation it's not going to contribute to your inflammation or whatever you might have going on ok so what you do with this liquid is you get a pen I usually reckon this is a refillable pen and I'll just explain this in a second but I recommend that you get one from a local shop like down the street or something because if you have troubles with it which I've had problems with this one you can take it back and they can fix it or replace it real easily but you want to make sure first of all that you get a pen that vapes CBD not nicotine if you try to put CBD liquid in a nicotine pen you will likely clog the pen so you want to CBD pen that's the first thing now with a with this type of system you're going to have a battery and then you're going to have a tank that you refill so you take this tank apart you don't throw it away like with the cartridge in the vape shot you keep it you're gonna twist this off here and it can get kind of this particular system not crazy about this kangertech isn't like I said I've had trouble would you take this out you refill it you put this back in you know you charge the battery as needed I usually have to charge batteries about once a week put it back together and you're ready to vape ok so that's how the refill the works now some people love this if you think it a good pen this is really a nice system to put this vape liquid in I have a link if you go to my website I have a link to a pen that some customers have recommended that I recommend for people because they've had really good luck with it this is what our Facebook community page is all about sharing what works for people what doesn't work whatever and it's called a candy pen Ruby are you bi so if you go to my facebook page I'm sorry my website which will be below this video go to my website go to the page where you see the vape liquids and I have a link that says buy vape pen it'll take you to their website if you don't want to get something at a local shop or you don't have a local shop that's another option you can try their pens right there they look really nice actually they have got a little pod you refill it you put it in it looks a lot simpler than this okay so that's the second type is the refillable now which one's best for you well it depends on I depends really preference okay cuz it's both the same THC free PG free vape liquid same flavors the vape shot is going to be five to seven times it's either 5 or 7 times stronger I think it's 5 times stronger then the refill liquid so there is you can see you can get different strikes now this could be confusing because you're like well this is just a teeny amount of liquid how could it possibly be stronger if it's like 250 milligrams and then refilled was 500 well look at the amount of liquid here that 500 is diluted a lot in here the 250 is not diluted much in here at all so you don't need much of this so if you're a person who just wants to relax and vape often throughout the day but you don't need a high content of CBD then the refillable is great because you can just vape a lot of it because you have you know there's more liquid to go through alright hope I'm not confusing people I'm try to make this easier and more clear I like the vape shot because easy you can just throw away the cartridge get new cartridge but I definitely know that there are some people who really like the refillable that's why I wanted to cover that with you alright so let's move on to how do you do this alright so you're gonna inhale we count to like two or three and then exhale you don't have to hold it in your mouth you can either up hold you can either when you inhale keep in your mouth or your lungs so you can inhale it into your mouth or your lungs but you don't have to hold it to get the effect and you don't have to end into your lungs to get the effects you will get a higher absorption rate in if you inhale in your lungs but you don't have to I've been vaping for two years and I do not inhale into my lungs and I get great results so it will absorb through the capillaries in your mouth you don't have to inhale in your lungs either way that's perfectly safe in your if you inhale in your lungs or keeping your mouth that's perfectly safe either way so you can basically count to two or three and then exhale it right away and I'm gonna demonstrate here right now now I like with this new vaping system you get a lot more vape if you notice I don't know if you have the old vaping system I didn't get as much vape out of the old vaping system this new vaping system like I said has a better higher-quality battery higher quality of hardware the liquid in it is the same that you've always had but the hardware is a better quality so I counted to about three inhale and then I blew it right out how often you do ok so you can vape like three times in a row succession the reason you don't want to do more than three times right in a row is because this coil here can't get hot and you don't want to burn out your coil that's the reason that you're doing three inhales in a row and then set it down for a couple minutes let it cool off if you don't notice any effects that you are the effects you're looking for in five to ten minutes you should notice something in like five minutes if you don't get the results you're looking for or you notice a little bit especially people having panic attacks you might need to repeat okay so after five minutes if you still have some anxiety for example go ahead and do it three more times so you're gonna do this based on need everybody is different I literally have a gal who can only do one inhale and that's all she needs if she did more than that they would it then it would be too much so you don't want to waste your money you know you if you only need one puff or three puffs a day then that's all you need but I will say that the effects are quick fast-acting on set with the vaping high efficacy which means a high percentage of the CBD gets into your system but it's not a long-lasting effect so if I vape right now it might last two or three hours and I might need to do it again and then you do it again so as you can see there's a huge experimentation that you need to do to find out what's gonna be best for you how much you need how often and the easiest way to determine that is try it give it three puffs or if you're if you're very sensitive to things give it one puff see how you feel after five minutes if you feel calmer then you're good to go if you need three puffs and you're calmer five to ten minutes later you're good to go and then wait until you notice that your symptoms come up again and then go ahead and vape again now I would say on average like maybe three times a day that's just to give you a ballpark okay and then the average length of time that this liquid here will last for people people ask how long is cartridge left it's gonna give you about 250 to 300 puffs and the average is about 4 weeks that's the average some people get eight weeks out of it some people get two weeks out of it but the average is gonna be about four weeks maybe longer I know for me it lasts at least four weeks cause like I said a little goes a long way so let's see I cover it a nail in your mouth or your lungs how often you do it this strength now people get really confused about the strength because you can get for example a lot of refillables or even the cartridges different strengths you have to keep in mind a how much liquid will always look in the ingredients always always always make sure there's no propylene glycol in there because I have people contact me who are having allergic reactions to the propylene glycol that stuff is not healthy I know a few years ago when I first started the liquid I tried had propylene glycol and I would get a scratchy throat so that is not you know any allergies or sensitivities and it bothered me so be careful make sure there's no propylene glycol make sure there's no artificial flavorings our vape liquids this one and in the vape shot we use plant terpenes for the flavoring so it's a plant you're getting the flavoring from the plant and so it's totally safe totally pure THC free so make sure that when you're getting a liquid you the ingredients are private priority over the strength of then you can look at is it 100 milligram 300 500 whatever hours are 500 which is quite high for refillable vape liquid cuz we used to carry 50 milligram 100 milligram 300 but we just went ahead we have 500 milligram available now because the lesser milligrams they're just they're more for the person who just wants to do the vaping recreational like 50 milligrams might be more recreational you're not gonna get a lot of therapeutic I should say I get I guess I could say therapeutic effect or benefit from it whereas with 500 milligram or your 250 milligrams a shot you're going to get a more therapeutic benefit or result from it so I guess with the strengths it's really going to be again experimental I can tell you that with the 253 puffs usually does it for people with the 500 you're gonna need to do more vaping because it is a lower concentration so don't be fooled it's hard to compare it can get really tricky when you're looking at you're gonna look on the website me like well 250 500 500 stronger that's just not the case you have to look at the amount of liquid okay I hope that I made that kind of clear if you have more questions jump on our Facebook page I'll have a link below this video or email me at Katherine at foods that he'll you calm I hope I covered everything he needed I know this videos kind of long I hope I didn't bore you that's a nice thing about video you can fast forward if you don't want here at all alright so I'll see you in the next video thank you thank you guys for watching", "rmaVrXf_kFU": "I had - welcome to another episode of because liberties radical weed reviews we are going to be checking out this stay from harmony farm now just regular guerilla glue
