{"S60oH1FXuRc": "so look at it it's a huge mess we have a wax warmer in our bathroom and our daughter decided to switch it out yesterday and so she took the green wax I was in here and decided the best place for it's down the drain so we are going to attempt to remove this mess somehow one way I rigged with using a blow dry heated back and absorbance we're gonna try that first [Music] all right so now we're under the sink so the first thing I do is I'm normative this trap here hopefully all the wax is just in there we can see if it's really clogged or what's happening so I put a bowl underneath it because chances are we're gonna get some leaking so I'm gonna do is unscrew these two this should be hand tighten gonna be a big deal it's usually pretty gross what you find in there wax oh it said price and it looks like wax is going all by the other way - I think she decided to flush it everywhere okay let's see if the water drain here I would turn the why not up top see if anything comes out barely so next back behind this pipe is another screw and it holds the little flapper for the sink there's a ball inside there I'm gonna do this and see we get there let's see if it's covered in wax cuz that would be an easy fix to die off and Celia well we can do it now since we've undone that part is we can take the stopper from the sink out so he'll get some glass pretty nasty glass here you take this guy out and see what it looks like no there was some wax in here okay see a lot of wax down the drain maybe ones let's put down the drain yeah how are you get that out let me get my flashlight I'm sure you have a do you kinda see it's much better with just a flashlight but the whole thing's blocked in there so you have to figure how to get that out okay I'm not sure what other way so I'm taking a skewer that I have I'm trying to see if I break some stuff off oh yes coming you think having the water behind it helped a lot there we go it's all falling into the bowl in the bottom the sink there we go no it's not it's really good seeing you I think it's never dull with kids ever you think you finally caught up I know the kids get crafty I think that's in okay we have both I'm gonna save her lungs so since this parts really nasty too I'm just going to go ahead and take it in the kitchen a second with some bleach and see we get on I just wash it out a little bit it's not wax it's just good old fashioned gunk nice never to put our stick back together so does everything that came out of sync no wonder wasn't working time to put it back together so this is hands height and smoke ready to try and tighten everything down [Music] so far all good anything really free yeah all right", "8Ond0QmqcSk": "so from this to this stay listen we'll show you how we can do that in just a few minutes hey guys welcome back to on a spot like three of you thank you guys for watching subscribing to the channel in today's video guys we will show you how to make your kitchen sink look like brand new again let us show you guys what it looks like now and how we're going to make that thing like a brand new looking thing okay you can see how nasty it is we have some staining here we have our border spots and all that will be cleaned and we'll show you guys what we use for something that looks terribly bad like that so the first thing is that we really like to use is the lime away but you always have to use gloves okay you have good ventilation windows open because that one has a little bit of a strong smell but it does wonders guys it works really really good so let us show what we will do here forming forming spray nozzle on the phone so it works really good what I'm going to do I'm going to solve the scene for a couple minutes and I'm going to apply everywhere on the sink we will do it magic okay we'll do this side as well because it's not as good and we'll show you how we're going to clean and polish it after that so what we'll do now okay we'll just let it soak for a few minutes guys okay just like that so let us show you now guys we get a sponge okay and if you have the one with the soft okay soft one on one side the cleaning pad it works really good so what I do I just going clean the whole area and you can see this white water wipe and everything comes out guys okay you can see it looks kind of like orange because of the out what are the deposits but we're going to turn that into brand new looking sink so what we are going to do now okay we'll do that for the whole area okay we're going to be slow a little bit and see if we need to really one more time after that make sure you do the tequila creases edges anything like that because those are the spots I usually tend to skip so this one is ready okay let's go ahead do the other side now and you can see how easy it moves the car water spots but you have not been clean for a long long time so we're going to do the same thing to this side and we'll show you what else we need to use okay topology that thing and make it look like new again we'll use actually two more chemicals so make sure you stand till the end of this so we can cover everything that you need you can even use that to pin your faucet here because it doesn't lead so clean as well so we're going to apply everywhere okay we're going to rinse it and see what it looks like so let us show you now guys okay we're almost done and I want to show you the stuff that will come out of the sponge okay you can see this is okay definitely guys nasty water okay my camera assistant needs will be here up today because we're planning to show you guys all the action yeah ok this is it out of a sink yes you can see how nasty it is what I'll do now I'll turn the water on okay we're going to do everything smell way down the chemical I do a little bit cooler water at first we can't even be cold all the way and then I just switch it on call the guys but if you stop you will be the fuse of first rinse it off so I'll go ahead okay do the whole area really quick we rinse it and also is how we're going to polish it okay let's decide now and we'll see ready you can see how much better that thing looks so far I'm impressed so we're going to go ahead guys okay get a towel now we'll get a towel and we want to dry everything to be completely because we need to polish that sink and I'll show you okay the chemical that we'll be using and it actually will prevent our water sports from building up because you're going to shine up that metal and things will not stick to it so easy so make sure you stay to the end so we'll just go ahead and dry everything now next we're going to use that stainless steel sink cleaner and polish so you need to shake it really good before we use it because okay it may be watery on top and really thick on the bottom so shake it good apply on a microfiber towel cleaning towel you can even do paper towels guys okay what I do okay we start applying it on the scene okay and you start grabbing in it and when you do that okay it's going to remove the rest of the car water spots is going to clean and polish that material guys make it super smooth so next time okay this will not stick as easy so if you keep doing that let's say every week your sink will loop okay way better check out how much it's polishing okay it just looks amazing okay how much material it removes okay and it give you will give it a deep shine in a little bit so we're going to do the same thing on this side we actually did the whole thing the whole thing and we'll come back okay and we'll show you guys the end result after about five minutes of polishing not sink so let us show you now yes okay that's what it looks like now you can get another towel or we can just get a paper towel okay and start polishing it okay to remove that excessive amount of wax that we have okay and check it out it's going to clean everything okay really really good you just need to make sure that you get everything flip the towel on the other side if you have some excessive amount okay clean it really good you can see how good-looking it starts looking okay and I'll show you okay what it looks like when we'll be done in just a few minutes so what we'll be using this guy's dynasty wipes okay those wipes will actually remove everything that we have left okay because I can even probably polish it a little bit better but with the help of these wipes okay everything clean super nice they're very inexpensive they work really good on sins stainless steel fridge microwave if anything stainless steel guys okay they clean amazing so what I'm going to do how to do that to to the scene then we'll get a paper towel or microfiber towel okay you're going to just wipe it okay to polish it one more time in we will be practically then and I'll show you guys okay what it's going to look like when we're done and you will be amazed that you won't believe that this is actually the same thing that we had before so this is it guys this is the end result I know it's hard to believe we cannot even believe that it is exactly the same thing that we had before we can even see the faucet how look how good it looks now so let's have you guys can make your kitchen sink look like venule yeah okay if you have some spots that didn't clean you probably need to redo it soon as well because depending on how thick the deposit was it may take a little bit more escaping but we found out that using the lime away observe water check out that all the supplies that we use towels paper towels and the cleaning wipes and you can see how much stuff we got out of that thing and everything looks like when you again hopefully the video will be helpful thank you for watching and see you guys next time", "7VX7Nfm53Yo": "welcome to savvy Serena welcome back it's that you're coming back welcome if you've never been here before I am doing a video today in my bathroom and it's dealing with car wax and it's not for your car and it's not for your bathtub I got another use for so stay tuned so I have many uses for coral axed and if you would like a video on that let me know in the comments below and don't forget to give this video a thumbs up but this is going to be an inci truck what I'm going to show you today let's go to my bathroom sink with everybody cleaning and disinfecting so much hair lately I have a tip for another use for wax just any old car wax whatever you have in your bathroom but I told you in my video about how to clean and disinfect with them according to the CDC and was using bleach on this it's going to eventually ruin it so I want to protect this faucet and this right here is going to help you do it so what you're gonna do take a little bit of car paste and you're gonna wipe it right on that chrome finish everywhere because right now the way we are cleaning these faucets it could eventually ruin them and that's not what I want to do I don't want to ruin this by any means whatsoever [Music] life is a winding road no telling where it goes as you can see it sun-dried to a haze and now I'm gonna wipe it off and I kicked y'all sorry and now I'm gonna drop it soon dry to a haze and i'ma wipe it off one thing I wanted to say also before I did this I cleaned and I disinfected the faucet before I did this so that way I knew it was clean and disinfected before I even did it and then you want to just take a terry cloth like you would your car and you want to wipe all that dry wax off of it you can you can do this on your any faucet any metal that you have in your home you can do it that means your stainless steel your sink your refrigerator you can do this to any metal that you have but I'm concentrating on the faucet because we're using so much bleach that I wanted some kind of coating on this to kind of protect it to keep it from to keep out bleach from corroding it and this is the only way I know how to do it and it shines your sink up to or your faucet up to it makes it shiny I see some wax and the crevices to get those out just use an old toothbrush where that swivels and I notice it's in here it's anywhere where you see wax where it's not coming out and the little crevices just use that toothbrush and it should come right out for you and then you can take a rag and wipe it off now I've got it to a really good shine bring you up a little bit closer you you can see the reflection and it how much cleaner it is and now you've got a coat of protection on it so the next time you clean with bleach it won't corrode it if you liked this video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe and y'all come back now you're here", "kPLP8T-5e0w": "[Music] [Applause] today i'm in my kitchen and i'm going to do a special experiment and uh today what i'm going to do is i'm going to use this maguire's hybrid ceramic wax to apply on my kitchen sink on this portion the left side of my kitchen sink and see whether it works in achieving some water beading and water sheeting results so this usually definitely you apply on your car uh it says to wash your car and then after you spray on while the car is wet and then you dry off the car for maintenance you just need to spray on after you wash your car and then rinse it off with a pressure washer but today i'm gonna do something different and i'm gonna see whether this works on the kitchen sink as well and achieved some water beading and water sheeting to start off i'm going to rinse the kitchen sink thereafter i'll be applying mcguire's all-purpose cleaner diluted five to one onto the kitchen sink and i'll use a white magic sponge to clear the kitchen sink of any contaminants and thereafter i'll have a clean and smooth surface to apply the maguire's hybrid ceramic wax so i guess you can see after the washing of the thing with the overpass cleaner you can see that there is literally not much no water building at all and now water shifting is also very slow you can see the water sticking to the surface of the sink okay so what i'm going to do after this is dry the sink with my microfiber cloth and then take the half of the sink to separate the left and right side and then wet the whole thing again apply the maguire's hybrid ceramic wax on the left side of the sink and then wipe it off and then we will test the water behavior after the application [Music] [Music] so the left side of the sink now has been coated with the maguire's hybrid ceramic wax and the right side which is the control section has not has been uh got nothing done to it so we'll compare now the water behavior between the left side and the right side sea see whether there's any improvements in the water feeding and water sheeting on the kitchen sink now it's time to review the results and before i do that don't forget to click the like button if you like this video and don't forget to subscribe to the channel we're going to start off by just flooding the sink and then we'll see how it reacts with the water [Music] so you saw how fast the water shifts out from the side that has the coating and the side that has a coating is completely dry while the right side without the coating is too completely wet so guys what do you think about this application of these mcguires hybrid ceramic wax on the kitchen sink well definitely it produces some water beading and definitely water sheeting you can see uh earlier in the video where the left side was water sheeting like crazy with the water on the right side the control section uh the water was very slow in moving off and uh the left the left side is definitely very dry after the application and after the water sheeting so i mean why not give it a try if you really want to protect even your kitchen sink with this hybrid ceramic wax go ahead and try it for yourself okay thank you for watching don't forget to like and subscribe to the channel thank you bye", "MZtgFmoglQY": "how to unclog a kitchen sink guarantee that's what we're gonna talk about in this video we're gonna talk about it right now I'm Roger Wakefield bleed AP the expert plumber I've been plumbing over 38 years and I have every master endorsement in the state of Texas and this channel I'm teaching you how to fix your plumbing fast and pretty if you haven't been here before please subscribe so you don't miss anything how to unclog the kitchen sink guarantee guys kitchen sinks clogged up it's part of what happens now in a minute we're going to move back here to the studio but what we're gonna talk about is number one how to keep from making a mess number two where the clog might be and what you can do to unstop it now having a clogged kitchen sink is horrible and a lot of times we'll get these calls on the holidays you got a lot of people over a lot of people cook in a lot of people throwing stuff down the drain they should be throwing down are you sure about that so having a stopped-up kitchen sink it's not a good thing and if you've got a clogged sink and you've got people over there eating and dishes need to be done that it's not something you want to do and one thing to remember when that dishwasher runs it normally drains over into the garbage disposal and if your stoppage is behind that that can make your kitchen sink so often over for two so follow us now over here so guys if your sink is full first thing I'm going to tell you is you may want to get a wet back or even a pot anything you can do to scoop out as much water as you can now don't scoop it out on one side and pour it in the other unless you've only got one side that's clogged up now this is the typical topping for a dull kitchen sink so if you've got a dual sink with both sides they're normally popped something similar to this now this one has a disposal and the reason that I pop them this way this may have food particles so I want this to go straight down I don't want to have to go horizontal because I want to make sure that I don't give those particles a place to set and build up so when I pop one this is the way I pop it now first of all like I said get as much water out as you and then you're gonna want to get a bucket and the reason being is if these are full of water chances are your p-trap may be full of water now in just one side is full say that this side is full on this side is not what that tells you is that your clog is probably gonna be right here because as long as you can run water in this side and it drain out but this sides not draining that lets you know that the stoppage is right here so what you would want to do at that point is put the bucket under it so what am I do let me get my channel locks off because what I would want to do at that point if this is full of water even if it's over to here what I want to do just put this bucket under here and loosen that up and I just want to loosen it up enough that the water starts coming out what I'm trying to do is get all this water out of the pot so when I take it apart I won't make a mess under the kitchen cabinet so we're gonna assume now that the waters leaked out now if the water tries to spray up for anything like this if you listen it too much just tighten it back down a little bit and that'll slow it down you don't want to get in a big hurry here if you try to get in a hurry you can literally cause a mess and it could literally get expensive because if you get this wood too wet it's gonna start buckling and then you're gonna have a problem so we're going to assume now that we've got all the water out and what we're gonna do then is loosen it up on this side [Music] so that we can take this part of the continuous waste apart so we loosen it up here you've got it loose here and we know that there's no water in it to this point because it's quit dripping now you may want to put a rag around here or you may want to loosen this up pull it apart and turn it over before you loosen this one completely just to make sure you get all this water out look in here see if you have a clog here look down the drain I have literally pulled straws coffee grounds eggshells cabbage rice things like that out of these drains and the horizontal drains to just stuff like that and get thinner it builds up and it creates a clock say that both your dreams were full but now we've got it drained out to here so we've still got most of the water apart but if both of them are full chances are I'm not gonna take it apart right if the drain is in here now you're gonna want to put the bucket over under your p-trap now this is a hot dollar use the bucket and call me directly we can work out a deal I'll tell you these if you want them to be honest carry a little plastic bowl with you carry a pipe old use Potter pan something like that anything that you can slide under here to catch the water and remember when you loosen that nut if it starts to get full you can always tighten that nut back up pull your bucket out and then go dump it outside don't just pour it back in the same as you can see my bucket is too tall so when I slide it I've got to tilt it so I want to make sure that I don't fill it up about halfway because that way when I tilt that I don't spill it so once you get your bucket under here you're gonna do the same thing you did over here you're gonna loosen up your p-trap on both nuts and one thing I like to do is actually do the back nut first the reason being is it's lower so if I look from the back knife and I realized no water is coming out of it that tells me if the stoppage is probably in my pea trap or in this tea on the continuous waste so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go ahead and loosen this up I drain everything out and then I pull my pea trap out now like I said if I didn't have any water coming out of the backside I know that the stoppage is here so I want to keep that bucket up under there to catch any water to make sure that I don't have any problem then I want to look in my pea trap if my p-traps clear then I want to take apart my tea here because that's where the stoppage could be once you get this apart guys make sure you look in every line as you can see inside the continuous waste here it's got a baffle to the fur the water coming in the side and the water going down a lot of times this is where your stoppage will be this is actually what comes out from the disposal and as you can see that little baffle right there it creates a flat blockage and that could cause a problem so this is normally where you'll find most of your stopping so career stoppage is not up here say when you undid the nut in the back water came out you filled up your bucket slots however much water you got out that tells you that where this goes back into the wall whereas the trap arm is or whatever is there that's all full of water or was full of water so now that you've got it out where you unscrew this part back at the wall some of you may not have it screwed in this may be a piece of copper or Chrome or brass and it may be soldered in so what you're gonna want to do is either go to the box store and buy they make a small attachment that you can put like on a cordless drill or on a drill and what it is it's a small handheld sewer machine a lot of plumbers use these if you're a plumber you may want to move up to the bigger ones you know different companies make them but there are some really good handheld sewer machines top sink machines that you can use in a situation like that if you're not having problems anywhere else in your house where this goes back into the wall and turn and then goes down into the drain chances are your lake could be right here now where you pulled this out if that doesn't handle it that a small one then you may want to go to the box store and rent a larger sewer machine to actually clean out that arm but this is something that you can do just be careful sir machines can be very dangerous it can be very messy make sure that you protect your cabinet and make sure you wear the right gloves so I'm gonna show you how I would go about putting this back together it goes together just about as easy as it came apart slide everything back up into position snug up the nuts now you may not have to but you may want to lay a level on here and make sure this house fall this is supposed to drain back towards this tea that way this doesn't hold water and when water does come in here it helps wash out any food particles that may have gone down the drain at this point I go ahead and put the piece back here that goes back into the wall and I line it up and just make sure that I've got it the right distance in that way whenever I tighten it up it's right where it goes if you're thinking all this apart go ahead and pick up some extra rains I like these new ones that is your rubber so they actually sell better they used to be just a hard plastic but they worked really well remember to put your nut on the first put your washer on slide it up just a little bit and this piece here is going to be already in right where you want it you're gonna slide it up and then tighten up these nuts too now that you've got all your nuts back on everything snugged up remember to take your channel locks and just kind of go through and make sure everything's nut you don't want to tighten this plastic nuts down too tight they will crack and break and it really it doesn't take a lot of pressure to get it snug enough that it won't leak on you guys really that's all there is unstoppable remember check here at first see if you got one side of the other full it's just the side would have been full and not this side that would let me know and if I could pour water down here and run water that would let me know that the stoppage is right here again you're gonna take it apart drain it down you'll be real careful taking it apart there and then stop it now remember you get food particles you get eggshells you get right you get cabbage lettuce anything like that that you run down the disposal will clog this up and especially if they get over on this side it'll get really clogged up in this horizontal arm and down here in front of a battle learning how to unclog a kitchen sink they're going on a lot to it now the things to remember are make sure that you get the water out of the sink before you start taking things apart underneath I have done it myself try to drain the whole thing into a little bitty pan underneath and you're spending a lot of trips going back and forth find a bucket find something drain that sink out get as much water out of it as you can it's gonna keep you from having problems down underneath now another thing too is look outside if this sink is on an external wall there may be a wall plane out there if you take that clean out apart the little handheld sir wishing that I told you about you might be able to run it down through there there could be something right there literally we have run lines through the vent through the wall clean out and through the sink drain itself to get these problems solved but one thing I didn't tell you about make sure that when you're done put your tools on put your clothes up and clean up the mess and that's a lot of things that people tell me all the time hey you skip that part let me tell you what when we go out on the job we'll make sure that it's cleaner when we leave it is when we get there if this video helps you unstop your sink please leave a comment down below and let us look let us know what part about it helped and where your lake was so if it helps we'd really like to find out I'm Roger Wakefield elite ap the expert plumber and I'll see you on the next video if you don't get flushed", "96eoD1CATHU": "so this is mom

I'm gonna teach you how to unclog your kitchen sink using household items and simple and easy steps let's get the show rolling so hey guys I'm pan and on today's show a DIY step-by-step of how to unclog your drain I've had a discussion with my plumber recently and he told me that it's not always necessary to have a plumber over to unclog your drain you can actually go ahead and do so yourselves with simple household items that you probably already have two ingredients are needed you need a baking soda and you need white vinegar many of you might be tempted to unclog your drain using a plunger well that can partially unclog it however don't forget that your drain is normally coated with a bunch of gunk and grease and all the stuff that goes down there overtime so to loosen that up you need a chemical reaction some sort of a foaming chemical reaction and that's why we have vinegar and baking soda so you'll see how easy these steps are you're gonna be done in a matter of minutes hey by the way if you guys like my videos don't forget to take a second and subscribe to my channel to be able to have access to more awesome content if you guys use my simple DIY to unclog your drain and it works let me know in the comment section down below so step number one is going to be to pour one pot of boiling water down the drain step number two is going to be to pour one cup of baking soda also directly down the drain and you're going to want to let that sit for roughly 5 to 10 minutes [Music] step number three you're going to add one cup of white vinegar and you're going to pour that down the drain as well there will be a chemical reaction between the baking soda and the vinegar but no worries that's needed if there's going to be a lot of foaming action going on kind of like when you were young and doing those science experiments in a volcano remember that baking soda white vinegar boom so you're gonna let that mixture do its thing for another five to ten minutes step number four you're gonna add another pot of boiling water down the drain so last and final step step number five you're going to run hot tap water for five minutes just to make sure that everything in the drain is properly flushed away so that's it guys you saw how easy that was in a couple of minutes you guys will have unclog drains and you'll thank me for it if you enjoy my videos

all along so you may be tempted to go out and buy some sulfuric acid or muriatic acid like this to brighten your tile floors clean the excess mortar from bricks and get rid of the haze on your tile it works really great you can dilute that 50/50 put it in a spray bottle wipe it around and you get rid of all that nasty haze you can't get off with any type of detergent on your freshly remodeled tile but and here is the big caveat if you're not careful with your freshly washed tile with muriatic acid in your freshly remodeled kitchen that you have freshly purchased stainless steel appliances this acid will rust your appliances just the splatter so when you're washing the floor here and you happen to splatter a little bit on the fridge and you don't notice the stove the dishwasher and the sink that you put the acid bottle into that discolored your brand-new appliances you may freak out like I did but be aware there is a fix there's always a fix for everything I had to dig deep into my automotive roots to fix it using McGuire's 105 cut ultra cut compound a wool pad on an electric automotive buffer and a little Windex so follow along and see how I got myself out of this this big mess all right so we're working in the kitchen today and you may ask what am I doing with an automotive buffer buffing compound in a dishwasher that's stainless steel hmm well we have tile floors and you see that or not and I just gave them a good coating to get the haze off after sealing the grout and fixing some grout air is with some muriatic acid which is good for cleaning concrete and etching concrete but it's not so good for your stainless steel appliances if you don't realize that you splash some on there you can see there's some rust forming in some spots see those dark spots there like right right through there maybe it's hard to see all of the camera pick it up but as I did the work on the floor I accidentally splashed my dishwasher brand new never been used and it really bothers me that I got rust stain on my stainless steel appliance I actually had some on this the lower part of the stove there which I've already buffed off so I know that it works that the fridge has got some to see in the very bottom there so we're gonna get that off I'm gonna use a automotive buffer and some McGuire's ultra cut compound and see if we can clean up our appliances okay so I took some McGuire's there and I prepped our wool pad this is also a McGuire's wool pad with a little compound and we're gonna go to work on our dishwasher all right so you can see how much black dirt and rust and stuff came off of my dishwasher and I'm using our towel here and see on my towels I polish it what a difference that makes click all the little rust off there the acid etch from the rust kind of polished up a little bit I've got some more to do right right there see I got to polish that edge I think I'm gonna polish this whole edge if you can't get the haze off with just a dry towel you can use a little Windex this also works for acid stains in your stainless steel Basin think let's see if we can get those out see these here right there right there [Music] all right so that worked pretty good you can still see I missed this little acid edge mark but all this acid etching out of the stainless steel sink has come out and I think I've got one more spot on this side now pay attention to your wool buffer Co it's becoming really black like that get a new pad or clean this one otherwise you're going to end up just grinding this dirt or film right back into what you're trying to polish [Music] okay there we go it's looking pretty good wipe this down there's no spots left still see there's a little spot right there it's much better and much shinier this Basin is completely done it

"[Music] hi I'm Christy with Blanco and we're here in the Frank Webb home showroom in Piscataway New Jersey where designers and homeowners can shop for high-quality well-designed kitchen and bath fixtures and other products for the home today we're talking color trends and we have with us internationally known color expert author and artist of a meal XCOM and color 9-1-1 blog and app ami wax nice to meet you thank you for joining us today Amy we're so excited to be here and we're ready to talk about color in the home what color is everything color is everything is not a room that you don't start with color or that's the I think is color the backbone is designed so that's what I think is the most important that's what I bring to the table and that's what every design I believe should start with great so what about color in the kitchen you know the kitchen is the heart of the home so what are the color trends right now that you're seeing in kitchens kitchens are an interesting place right now because as transitional is the most important and it's getting a lot of play people are also using contemporary styles using farmhouse styles more than anything else they're making it their personal space and I think that's where people can think outside the box add new colors new textures new materials and the world is their oyster in terms of kitchen design now more than ever before so in all of the trend research that we do we're seeing that white is still a big coloring kitchens for cabinets countertops and also gray which we'll talk about a little bit more later but why do you think those two colors are still so popular in kitchens I think people like white because white has an appealing of cleanliness cleanliness in the kitchen is so important at the same time I think white is a little bit of a challenge because when you go from the rest of your house if the rest of your home isn't all white going into an all-white kitchen can be a bit of a process right and I think adding softer colors into the kitchen can ease that all white kitchen into the space and make it feel like it's appropriate so I think it's popular because it's easy to decorate easy to use I think we can do more I think people are starting to incorporate other materials and those other materials are bringing in colors like grays and another classic choices so when we add color to a space as a homeowner can that affect the mood and the emotion in the space and do you think there's a science behind that absolutely I think by adding colors that are a little softer and it makes it easier to be in the space it's not as stark if you're looking at countertops that are very contrasting it can be tiring on your eyes so all these things are things we should consider and and we tend to labor over every cabinet color and countertop and write and everything and we really should think of it as a whole project and how all the colors work together so I think not everything should be white we should incorporate grays and blacks and charcoals and even some color in there so that everything flows throughout the space right that's a good point and it's you know you want to have colors that make you feel good in the kitchen and you also want to spend time in the kitchen you want to really be able to be there for the long you know it's not a room that you're passing through you spend a lot of time there so the colors should be comfortable and cozy and and should feel like it's homey and not just a place where there's a task that's being performed so to choose colors that you're comfortable with choose colors that feel more like they might belong in a living room but you're going to bring them into the kitchen and so I think that really helps the design succeed there are so many different kinds of sink materials out there today and we know stainless steel is still really popular it's a great neutral but there's lots of colored sinks out there too and so we have a product called silgranit it's our patented material that we make and that comes in nine colors so what would you say is an advantage of adding a colored sink like this to your kitchen the sink is one of the places that you're spending a lot of time oh yeah looking at so if you're looking at the sink you don't want to be harsh you don't want to be too reflective you want to wear well and you don't want to have to worry about using it right but also when you have lots of dishes of different colors and everything it should be easy on the eyes and this is what's very very comfortable to you so I think this is going to be very easy for people to use and I think once someone uses it and really looks at it and experiences that they're gonna love using this product so this actually is a new color for us for Blanco it's called concrete gray and our designers really tried to come up with the perfect shade of grey and so it's got both cool and warm tones in it which means it matches all different kinds of popular countertops and cabinet styles and it's the ninth color in our sill granite color palette of smart neutrals so we make those smart neutrals to match all different kinds of kitchen styles and designs really the sky is the limit so what's interesting is when you look at the popular colors and kitchens there if you're looking at transitional or contemporary or farmhouse or as you work down what's the most popular to least popular this is really going to be seen in all of those styles and because it does isn't too fussy and it's a simple clean design it's going to appeal to anyone who's doing a new kitchen who wants it that's gonna have a long lasting you know positive effect in the design of the kitchen and especially a farmhouse sink like this they're super hot right now you're gonna see the front of this sink for a long time so I love that you're saying it's it's something great that's gonna kind of incorporate with the rest of the kitchen absolutely and be easy to use because you're gonna see it for a long time so you want it to look great you also can put almost any countertop with this and what's interesting is people and they're designing a kitchen tend to think of individual elements they want to know this color countertop this color cabinets but it really has to be seen as one fluid space mm-hm so by this having the top that I mean the color that goes along with the top it'll flow from up from here to the rest of the kitchen I think that makes it even more user friendly so on that note let's talk about the other elements in the kitchen like the new outer tops the cabinets the wall color the floor there's really long-lasting elements that we're going to see for a long time do you have any ideas on what would be the best colors for those types of elements well it's interesting because people are using a variety of metals now they're not necessarily only using nickel or only using brass vining and i think that combination gives them gives us the opportunity to give our kitchen a more personal style as long as there's some element that ties it all together it can be scale it could be color it could be you know proportion as long as there's some element that that they all have that bring it all together I think it gives us the ability to really play a little bit to try new colors try new you know different textures and things it'll give the the kitchen a lot more interest and it also gives you a place to make your personal style and I think also when you're personalizing a space now more than ever you're you can think outside the box you don't have to go with West traditional you don't have to go with stainless steel because that may not be the best choice for you something like this or a countertop that's a unique color or texture is certainly welcome and can be you know tied in with all of the other elements in the room there are any tips or tools or tricks that you can tell us about when you walk into the kitchen the first thing you see is the color of the room the first thing you see is the countertops but really the cabinet's because they're what is eye level to you right so start with that as your anchor and choose a color palette that you like and make sure when you're planning your kitchen you're planning not just the cabinets but the cabinet's the backsplash the wall color the sink the hardware plan everything out and once you have that color plan laid out it all falls into place easily now are there any tools or apps that a homeowner can use to kind of do like a self DIY type of help to choose colors well absolutely there is a color 9-1-1 app you can choose colors that blend well together and use that as your guide you can use design a color palette on your own keep it in your library in the phone very cool or you could also send those colors to your designer and say this is what I want to use this is a direction I want to go in it's a great tool for communicating color it's called color 9-1-1 okay and Blanco also has an app we have our silgranit color app which is which allows you to match our still grant it's ink colors with different countertops and also you can customize your library of countertops if you like and then you can match the sink and countertop and make it super easy to choose the right sink for your kitchen so that's gonna be it for us today I had so much fun talking with Amy about color trends and thank you so much my pleasure for joining us today I love sharing it because it inspires people and that's everything yeah absolutely thank you so much my pleasure um I also want to say thank you to Frank Webb home for having us today and if you'd like to learn more about blanco products visit us on

I am the sales director at Wells Sinkware Corporation. Here at Wells, we manufacture and distribute high-quality stainless steel sinks with two distinctive textures. Our signature Wells series has a uniform DuraSatin finish that is unique in the industry.\nMore of a European style finish. Our Wentworth series has a traditional brushed\nmatte finish, that is practical, yet stylish, with a mirror-highlighted rim. Today, I\u2019m going to show you how to properly maintain sinks with both textures. First of all, never use steel wool, wire brushes, or other cleaning tools with metallic components to clean your sink, as they may embed iron particles that can create rust stains. There a couple of things you can do to prevent the formation of stains. First, don\u2019t let acidic foods, such as pickles\nor mayonnaise, sit in the sink for long periods of time. Their acidity may cause the stainless\nsteel to corrode. Second, we don\u2019t recommend using a rubber\nmat as a sink-bottom protector as it may hold food and water residues and leave marks that are hard to remove. To protect the bottom of your sink, we suggest investing in a stainless steel grid instead. For day to day cleaning, first wet the surface of the sink. Then, using the soft side of a sponge and some dish soap, wipe the surface clean. When you\u2019re finished, rinse thoroughly with water. To remove dried food residues, you may need to use a buffing technique appropriate for the texture of your sink. Before buffing, soak the stain in water to help it soften and dissolve. If your sink has a satin finish with no grain, use a nylon mesh sponge. Choose a non-abrasive cleaning powder, such as Comet, Bar Keeper\u2019s Friend, or baking soda. Wear gloves to protect your skin from the\ncleaning agent. Sprinkle the cleaning powder unto the sponge. Buff the sink\u2019s surface in a circular motion, using as much force as needed to remove the residue. When you\u2019re finished, rinse thoroughly. If your sink has a brushed matte finish, use a scrubbing sponge with a rough texture. We recommend the Scotch-Brite heavy-duty sponge. Sprinkle cleaning powder unto the scrubbing side of the sponge. Buff the area of the stain with firm pressure parallel to the direction of the grain. Make sure to avoid scrubbing\nagainst the grain of your sink, as this will create scratches that are visible against the background texture of the stainless steel. By buffing in the direction of the grain,\nyou will not damage the sink\u2019s finish, but instead give it a clean, polished look. Rinse the sink thoroughly after you\u2019re finished buffing. Over time, your sink may start to look dull after accumulating scratches due to normal wear and tear. You may also find hard-to-remove stains formed by coffee,  acidic foods, or mineral deposits. To restore your sink\u2019s luster, apply the same technique you would use to remove dried food residues. For sinks with brushed finishes, simply use the rough side of a heavy-duty scrubbing sponge and some cleaning powder to buff the entire surface of the sink along the direction of the grain. Do not be afraid to apply firm\npressure in the process. For sinks with satin finishes, use the Scotch-Brite non-scratch sponge and cleaning powder to buff the entire surface of the sink in a circular motion. Make sure to apply firm, even pressure in the process, as this will help to conceal obvious scratches and restore uniformity to the satin finish. Do not buff the sink in a parallel motion, because this will create additional scratches on top of existing marks. After you\u2019re finished buffing, rinse thoroughly. Stainless steel sinks are low-maintenance, durable, and elegant. Follow these simple care instructions, and your sink will stay in great shape for years to come.", "JeurinbyqhQ": "hello the steel and this is a clogged sink pretty clogged actually on this side this garbage disposal on this side is the regular drain and I've tried a couple of things just initially to try to get it on clogged first of all I just grabbed this is kind of an automatic you put the stopper down and then guards pull the works so I just kind of stuck it in here that's rain but it all just builds up into that side and then comes back here so that's the first thing I learned that the plumbing go down to the bottom the sink here here's the garbage disposal here's the pipe linking the drain the two sinks together and so the blockage is not in this middle middle pipe it's actually from here on out now most of the time not all the time but most of the time blockages happen at joints and very often it happens at P traps this P trap leading out and so I've already tried a few things I try to fish it I could kind of tell that there's a blockage right after the bend in this P trap so I've gone down I've turned and the blockage I anything is right about here is kind of a constriction point and based on my fishing it just doesn't seem to want to pass that and so I think if I take this P trap out I'll get the blockage out so I'm going to I'm going to work on that next so one of the things I know is I am dealing with a lot of water I've tried to wait for it to drain it's not really draining that quickly I've tried some plundering again I've tried putting some back pressure on it using the garbage disposal nothing seems get rid of this water so the only hope is to open up the drain and drain it into a bucket so that's what I'm going to do so I'm just going to grab a wrench here connect onto this and just loosen this cap you want to open it up really slowly because if water will come out and you can see the water starting so there could be a little bit of pressure so I don't want it to spit up on me so hold it with your hand there you go now I'm just going to drain this water slowly this is the first step figuring out where the water is coming from so I know it's not in this first joint or I wouldn't be getting water there you go I've drained all the water it's pretty much empty and the sinks empty so I did make sure that I had a big enough bucket to accommodate all the water unfortunately I can't take this bucket out until I unloosen this part which I'll do next I'm just removing the p-trap right here going to one hand of course there we go and now inside is block it ok remove the water dump it put this pan underneath it for residual leakage and after I examine the p-trap it's still a little grody but this wasn't the cause of the blockage actually you can just feel with finger that the blockage extends farther in and it's actually this is kind of a compacted water material there so I'm hoping that it'll end at this next joint which I'm going to unscrew next okay so I did find the blockage it was in this trap and you could see the blockage there the pipe that extends beyond is grody but essentially free of blockage but in this process I've learned that this old pipe I was trying to loosen this off and actually I couldn't get this this cap off in fact I just pulled this straight out and so the compression washer that's in there is totally shot I'm not sure exactly what's keeping this in here if it's rust or if somebody Epoque feed something to keep this still but I'm going to try to get this cap off and see kind of where I lie I'll probably have to break this cap so that's next and I wasn't able to get it loosened and actually spins out and it is feel is shot and so I'm going to have to get new little compression joint for that so I can go ahead and seal this up all up but I did find the blockage and I just have to fix the mess and this is quite common especially in old houses where you're trying to find blockage and you've come across a whole bunch of extra mess and in fact probably the cause of this originally original plug is because this joint was shot and so hopefully I can do a better job and get this back to normal right so fortunately I did find another compression washer and a new cap so I'm just going to put this over the old one this is still very rusted so the seals not going to be great but for right now I'm just hoping that will work so I'm going to stick this back in here clean this off is the best I can I'm going to loosely fit it for now what's going on for at least now I'm just loosely okay I'm just gonna loosely put this component on you want to loosely connect all these pieces initially the P the P trap and all these pipes because they will you kind of have to adjust all the joints so there they work so just make sure that everything is properly in here Matt sure this fitting is good and then this terrible hopefully this will seal if not I'm going to have to get a new pipe add okay it's taut that's taut and this one started so hopefully it should work and now tie time to fill it up and see what happens clean all that out my main interest here is making sure that all the seals all the joints are sealed [Music] okay this is a final test I filled up the water a little bit just to get a little bit of pressure bringing in the grain and okay the waters not going through that all right and then I just check see I don't see any leaks so I think I solved the problem I think I'm going to have continuous problems with this particular joint since this is rusty I may in the future need to do more elaborate work on this joint but for now it does solve the problem so just this is how you unclog a line and sometimes you do get into trouble like I had a replace of one joint but I hope this helped yeah see you next time bye-bye", "x0pA6dxzbs4": "It is a fact. At least once in your life, your sink will\nclog. Be it the bathroom sink or the kitchen sink,\nit happens. When it happens in the kitchen, it's usually\nbecause of food, oil, and other residues that end up in the sink. In the bathroom, the sink clogs mostly because\nof hair and other products that get stuck in the drain. Most people opt for chemical solutions, but\nsince we prefer natural things, we will show you 5 homemade solutions to safely unclog\nyour sink: 1. Baking soda\nPut 1 to 4 tablespoons of baking soda in the drain. The amount of baking soda varies according\nto how clogged it is. Let it act for 1 minute, and pour 1 cup of\nwhite vinegar over the baking soda. Let it sit for half an hour, until a bad-smelling\nfoam comes out of your drain. Pour hot water over the sink to clean it. 2. Dish detergent\nDid you know that many times, the kitchen sink clogs because of fat inside the plumbing? If that's your case, you can solve it using\nonly detergent and hot water. First of all, drain all water that might be\naccumulated in your sink. After that, boil 169oz. of water and mix it\nwith some detergent. Pour the hot water over the drain and wait\nuntil your sink naturally unclogs. Are you liking this video? Give it a thumbs up to help our channel! And don't forget to share these tricks with\nyour friends! 3. Coca-Cola\nIt may not be the most natural of all solutions, but most people have it at home. Did you know that Coke and other cola-based\nsodas can help you unclog your sink? Cola-sodas have phosphoric acid, which can\neasily dissolve the fat in plumbing. There are many stories of people who successfully\nunclogged sinks and toilets using just soda. Do you want to know how to do it? Little by little, pour a 67oz bottle of Coke\nover your drain. Wait and watch your sink gradually unclogging. 4. Salt\nYou certainly have this product at home, and it can help you unclog your sink. Just put 1 cup of salt in your drain and pour\nboiling water over it. While the water drains, close the drain with\na cloth, applying some pressure. Remember to use gloves to not burn your hands. 5. Clean the siphon\nDid you know that cleaning can prevent this problem? Sometimes, the sink clogs because of all the\ndirt accumulated in the siphon. If that's your case, put a bucket under the\nsiphon to catch all the water and dirt that may fall as you unscrew the siphon. Clean it with a sponge and neutral detergent. Easy, isn't it? But, better than knowing how to unclog your\nsinks and drains, is preventing it from happening. See some tips to prevent it: Avoid combing your hair during your bath or\nover the bathroom sink; Remove all grease from cooking utensils with\na napkin before washing them; Never pour oil directly on the sink;\nIf you have pets, remove all their hair from clothes before washing them; Last, but not least, always check beforehand\nif the draining is alright. If you catch a problem right in the beginning,\nit will be easier to solve. Do you have another trick to teach us?

So, Juan, can we go ahead\nand show that to 'em, please? - We're ready. - So before we start, I'm\ngonna show you exactly what we put into this line,\nwhich is paper products, roots, and sludge. - [Dave] Right, which are the\nmost common causes of backups. Alright, Juan, let's go\nahead and put it into action. (snake whirring) The end of the cable\nright now is currently, it's gone through the paper products, and it's bounded up into the actual roots that are in the line. - [Jim] What's really cool\nis that cable's slamming, breaking up that paper product in there, or actually right here. Now the cable's headed\nright to the sludge. As you can see, the water\nkind of helps pushing and cleaning the drain\nall at the same time. - [Dave] Has it come\nto the sludge area yet? - Yeah, it's pretty tough, but it's actually fine here on the roots. Well there you have it. So now what happened is\nthe actual stoppages, which is the roots and the sludge, have hit a fitting, so the stoppage now is gonna take a little bit more effort to go through that actual fitting. - That's right. Alright, well, now that\nthe cable's gone through the entire length of the pipe, we're gonna go ahead and\nextract the cable out, and let's see what the\ncable actually retrieved. (cable scratching) Well there you have it, it actually pulled out\nmore of the paper product than anything else. Obviously if there's\nmassive roots in that line that are coming in from a break, the cable method's not\ngoing to be as effective, but as you can see it\ndoes a pretty good job with removing that soft stoppage. So now that we've retrieved\nthe cable from the drain pipe, we're gonna go ahead and\ntake a really good look and see if the cable left\nanything inside the line. Let's go ahead and look at that, Jim. - [Jim] Yep, right here, Dave. - Yeah, as you can see right here, in fact let me get a light, as you can see right here,\nit did a pretty good job breaking it down, but it did\nleave a lot of the debris left inside the pipe, especially\nhere at the fitting area. So let's go ahead and see\nwhat hydro jetting does compared to what the cable method did. - Okay, we're gonna go\nahead and demonstrate the hydro jetting process,\nbut before we do that, I wanted to go over with Juan, our hydro jetting technician here, what hydro jetting is. - Well it's a way to clean the pipe with high pressurized\nwater at about 4,000 PSI. This particular one shoots\n12 gallons a minute. This is called a laser penetrating tip, and it goes down the pipe. We will start whenever you guys are ready. - So Juan, before we start though, as the tip's going down the pipe, is the water blasting in\nreverse or blasting forward? - There's one going forward. - Okay. - And there's multiple coming back. - Okay. - Which propels it down the pipe and through the blockage. - Okay, perfect. - For this demonstration, we went ahead and installed some regular toilet paper, as well as roots, and downstream, just like we did the cabling,\nwe added the sludge as well, so we just wanted to\ncompare apples to apples, so you can see the difference\nin the two different methods. Go ahead, Juan, let's go\nahead and fire that up. - Okay. (water rushing) - Wow. Let' go slow, what I wanna show. So the stoppage is completely\ncleared now, bring it back. And you can see here's\nthe end of it right here with the stoppage completely removed. Yeah, I think you got it, Juan. So as we're removing\nthe hydro jetting hose, let's go ahead and see what the hydro jetting method left behind. It's spotless. - [Jim] Yeah, it's spotless. - Well, there you have it. So the difference between\ncabling and hydro jetting is, what do you think, Jim? - One opens the line. - And the hydro jetting actually\nopens and cleans the line. Well, there you have it.", "13cNNHdj4Tg": "foreign [Music] um [Applause] foreign [Music] centimeters", "-ajcPJwMuQg": "good morning my name is Cheri welcomed up beaten clean today I am going to be showing you how to get the metal marks the little black marks and grey marks that you get in your sink I'm going to be showing you how to get rid of those we have a white porcelain sink and so it's always getting marks at it from the silverware or from pans or whatever and I have found a really easy way to get rid of those so I did not clean my sink I'm going to do that while I show you how I do this but see these marks here we end up getting these all the time no matter what I do you can see in the bottom there so the first thing that I usually do is I just clean my sink as I normally would and then after I do that I'm going to show you how to get any marks up that haven't come up from cleaning so what I use to clean my sink is just a mixture of baking soda and Don just soap it really does a nice job and I just mix it up in a little Bowl I might just make a paste out of it I'm just going to use a spoon here to kind of break up the clumps and mix it up now you may use Arm and Hammer or cleaner or there's you know bar keeper's friend or Ajax or whatever so just clean sink however you normally would see there's my paste there it's dishwasher okay so now I'm just going to this is spice you can see a little better now I have these euro scrubby's I use these for everything washing the dishes and for cleaning and I just wash them and they're cleaning reuse them but I just take a little bit of that you I'm just gonna rinse it out I'll show you what we have left okay so here's the sink now and everything I mean this is it's really clean however I still have if I can focus in a little better here I still have these marks here that don't want to come out and I have one down there on the bottom this I came pretty clean there's a couple little marks there but I'm going to show you now how I get rid of those okay I just take a pumice stone just a regular old pumice stone yeah get it wet and then I'm just going to lightly rub over these marks now I don't do it silly fires just make me rub over them it's going to kind of look a little muddy for a minute just go over them a little bit this one here I'm gonna do that one-handed it's wet again I'm going to go for this one I'm going to get this big one down here rinse them off and see if I need to anymore or not see the strict one that was down at the bottom here before it's a lot lighter I missed a couple little spots here now you can see how much better this looks along here now and this one right here gone this one down here is gone and the sink looks great so that's it that's my tip you", "DJVuTQOt7-A": "hey guys this is Shannon with nearly organic noshing and today I am going to show you how I'm gonna clean my sink this may seem like the most ridiculous thing in the world but I have had this sink for at least six years I'm gonna say and it's a granite composite sink and it makes me crazy it really does because I do the fly lady and I scrub the sink every day so this sink gets wiped down and scrubbed down and when it's wet it looks beautiful and as soon as it dries it gets all of these white streaks can you see all the the white and stuff in there now we have really hard well water so I figured it was just the well water and to a point yes that is true but it's also this kind of sink last night I was griping about it and Chris said why don't you just google it I bet if you put oil on it it would fix it and I never thought about putting oil in my sink you know you aren't supposed to have oil in your sink and so I googled it and I have used a lot of things on it something like this the lime calcium rust like CLR Lysol thieves I've even tried some of my glass top cleaner on it nothing nothing worked you're not supposed to use bleach on it and you're not supposed to use a really harsh abrasive I have used pure vinegar it helped but the white streaks came back so when I googled it and read some different forums a lot of people have the same issues and the common items that people seem to put on their sink was scrub it with vinegar and baking soda and I know this bottle is horrible this is my animal bottle that I keep out with chickens and animals and this is mineral oil and it's just good thing to have around around the house and it also is food grade safe and it will not who rants a lot of people I read about put olive oil or vegetable oil or Crisco or something like that on their sink to seal it and that's just not a good idea for your sink you don't want that much oil in your sink it can go rancid and also can go down the drain and clog your pipes and this is a very very very old house and we have an itty-bitty tiny septic tank so we don't need oil and stuff to go down our pipes and clog it so I am going to clean the sink really well with the vinegar and baking soda dry it and seal it with a mineral oil and let's just see how it turns out I'm thinking it's got to be better than this even the plastic stuff which this just came out of the dishwasher I take the little silverware thing out all the time and run it through the dishwasher and with it being black it immediately gets streaky again so I'm going to go ahead and set the camera up and scrub this down and see how it works [Music] alright so the sink is clean I am just going to thoroughly dry it now you you now I'll take a soft cloth and you okay it's not perfect but it's definitely better and if it stays this way for a couple of days then I will be thrilled don't we have to do this every couple of days but we'll see I'll come back later tonight and then again tomorrow to see how it's holding up okay guys it has been about two days since I did my sink and I have dishes going on here but it seems to be doing really well I'm seeing a little bit of white just like right here and right there which there was a little bit of white over that way previously but I'm thinking the reason why I'm getting a little bit of white right here when it's nowhere else is the soap the soap dispenser that's where you get soap every time and I'm thinking maybe the soap just drips right there whenever you're squirting it in and it's taking the oil off there faster than anywhere else but for two days this still looks pretty darn good and the sink has been used a lot i defrosted a turkey in it we've washed it a couple loads of dishes and you know and of course after defrosting the turkey we had to squirt it down with cleaner and scrub it all out so it has had a lot of soap and cleaner on it and multiple loads of dishes run through it in the last couple of days so it seems to be holding up pretty well I'm just careful not to use too much cleaner when I'm wiping it all down I'm using mainly just soap and water or maybe a little bit of thieves or something through it if it's just a basic daily wipe down and we'll see how long this mineral oil lasts I'm hoping that maybe I just have to do it once a week and it will stay looking nice alright guys I hope this has been a very useful tip and it helps somebody out there I hope you're having a great day", "L1wczWFeVss": "Whenever you\u2019re washing dishes and start\nnoticing that water in the sink is backing up, that means that the drain is probably\nclogged. This problem will most likely end up happening\nto someone who isn\u2019t careful and doesn\u2019t take the most basic precautions. Most of the time, the back up happens due\nto a build up of fat in the pipes. When we rinse fat down the drain it\u2019s normally\nliquid, but ends up congealing and blocking pipes. Pieces of food and vegetable or fruit peel\ncan also pile up where the pipes curve and keep the water from flowing. So what do you do when this happens? Do you call a plumber? Do you buy a chemical product to unclog your\nsink? Most people probably don\u2019t know that these\nproduct contain harmful substances that can cause skin irritations and breathing problems. In today\u2019s video we\u2019re going to show you\na cheap, natural alternative to unclog your kitchen sink. All you\u2019ll need is hot water and salt. Pour half a cup of salt in your sink drain\nand wait for it to go down. Then boil two liters of water and turn off\nthe stove as soon as the water starts bubbling. Pour the water down the drain slowly. The hot water will melt the fat built up in\nthe pipes. After the water you boiled has all gone down\nthe drain, run some more hot water from the faucet just to make sure. The salt\u2019s scratchy texture will help move\nany leftover fat. You can also substitute the salt for dish\ndetergent. In this case, boil the water as you did before\nand mix in a few spoonfuls of detergent. Pour the soapy water down the drain just as\nbefore. The detergent will help dissolve any fat melted\nby the water, and your pipes will be as good as new. If the buildup is being caused by pieces of\nfood, then your best option is to unclog it manually. Try that after pouring boiled water down the\nsink to remove any stray pieces of food. Do you have any other tips for unclogging\nsink drains?

but as you all know let me turn my flashlight on phone flashlight yeah okay as you all know gets that white haze white haze all over the sink I know when I first bought my sink I loved it I loved it but then it started to get that white haze and I'm like what the heck do I do with it let me show you how to clean it coconut oil you could use olive oil I use coconut oil let me show you what happens when you use coconut oil on a granite sink you guys can all see the the white haze the white haze so all I do is take a couple napkins coconut oil I have coconut oil here and I just take a hunk out two hunks out whatever you need and just start rubbing this coconut oil around because granite is porous and you need to treat porous surfaces so I learned after googling what the heck do I do with my safe because I loved this sink but I was getting I was so disappointed in the fact that it was so you know all that white was coming the white haze on the sink so this is what I do you just rub it all over besides just it it everywhere here coconut oil is good for your skin too so you know you're killing two birds with one stone here just up on the edges I go up on the edges with it you can belt your coconut oil too if you want to if you don't want to use it like I did I've used it melted like in the summer when it was hot done that normally I let this sit on here for a little while you know I rub it in really good now let it sit on here for 15 to 20 minutes maybe more if I forget about it it sits on here longer it doesn't hurt it well oh yeah I looked everywhere I mean I googled everywhere and I looked at Lowe's and Home Depot and all the stores looking for product clean this right now I'm doing the top edge I also I love this big sink I absolutely love this big sink I've always had a split sink and I thought you know this one I want to try a big one I can wash like pizza pans in here big panting they do like it so I'll leave this sit on your for a little bit and we'll be back alright so it's been sitting on here for know 20 minutes or so so now you're Matt use paper towels but of course I'm not paper towels so I've got some napkins here and I just RUP all the cut off you know if you can't get it all off sometimes I turn the hot water on and you know I'll read some of it down there sake but you'll see I've got quite a bit of coconut oil on here alright let's turn some water on here get hot or you could just leave it sit if you want just leave it on here it's not gonna hurt anything you can see how it beads up other waters on the sides starting to beat up it's like a coat of wax on your seat this is all I did and then once you think it's good enough for you just try it out if you want to you don't even have to try it out you can leave it like this but let's try it out just for the sake of things here not gonna get very far with this huh let me get my kitchen out I don't know if you could see let me turn my light back on cause I'm trying it I'm kind of buffing it at the same time and the white haze is gone I have to do this maybe once or twice a month but remember it's just my husband and I here if you have a bigger family you might have to do it more the more you said the sink but there that's all I do so that's all I do so there you go the white haze is gone and your sink is blacked again it really works it really works so just plain coconut oil does the trick olive oil coconut oil [Music]", "81oqk7TuU70": "hi this is Cameron with one Tom plumber and today I'm gonna teach you how to clean your kitchen sinks line with just boiling water and Dawn dish soap start by boiling five gallons of water if you don't have a five gallon pot you'll need to use multiple you will want to pour all of the dawn' down the sink this will let it start working on the line breaking down all of the grease before you put your boiling water in to totally flush the line so now that the water is boiling I'm going to turn on the garbage disposal and pour it down the sink [Music] the boiling water has loosened everything up turn the sink on hot and let it run for about 5 minutes after 5 minutes turn the water off and bam you're done your kitchen sink line has way less grease in it and is much cleaner than it was before hope you guys liked the video and just an important thing to keep in mind is that this tip will only work if your mind is about 50 percent open or more if your line is completely clogged you'll have to check out our YouTube channel and find our other videos on how to clear your drain [Music]", "zVXVzlEj4gw": "okay so here we have a copper sink the patina is coming in so it's a little bit on the dark side and we are going to use citric acid this one's milliard or milliard citric acid so we're just gonna heat it up in some water and then apply it to the sink so this is a before and after there you can see there's some stains there from just leaving dishes in the sink there's uh some clear spots from probably uh mayo on utensils and okay so let's see how it shines up here we have the citric acid we heated up the water and the citric acid sorry you don't have footage of that but the citric acid evaporated mixed into the hot water and now we are going to apply it to the sink here's the before once again and this is sink modification level one okay so all we've done is use this microfiber rag which you can just use anything it's just this was around and yeah and we've just wiped it i'm not even using elbow grease i'm just sort of just wiping and that's what it looks like right now and it's only been maybe uh maybe two minutes three minutes of just rubbing the this rag around and then after i'm going to use one of the these green sponges and pop maybe rub some citric acid right on the sponge or on the sink and then rub it around okay so here's the after see it's super shiny like a penny now the sponge i was using was actually an old sponge so i would have been able to get a better shine on the front part of the sink than i did i mean it's not too bad but i definitely could have gotten a better shine the inside um sorry the lighting is bad but the inside is nice and shiny so big difference between the before the before and after on this and yeah i mean if you have a copper sink and you want to clean it i was very generous with the citric acid so yeah just use a new sponge or like a coarse sponge a good rough sponge and uh yeah citric acid", "OiinPp4RokE": "good morning YouTube this is ghost pose one today's September eighteenth and it's a perfect time to start thinking about undercoating your vehicles or anything for that matter that you want to try to keep rust away from I've come up with a few ideas now I'll be spraying most of this today but what I really like to do is to brush whatever I can on because I find that brushing any of these mixtures brushing it works a lot better because you can get in you can work the material in to the pitted metal is much better than if you just sprayed it on so I like to use the fluid film and this is a gallon can and I just have an old disposable brush and I'll show you where I use this at some point but basically if you can get at certain areas I always find that brushing always works better just for me because like I said you can work it in a lot easier than the spray which kind of sits on the surface now something I'm adding this year which I've added it before I shouldn't say just adding it this year but I'm spraying it this year in the past I have used these toilet ball rings these are like the stickiest wax ever okay and I buddy of mine gave me an old crock pot and what I do is put it in a metal container and I'm melting it currently and you can see it's still a work in progress it takes a little bit of it some time to get these are a couple of wax rings in here but the the beauty of this stuff is that whereas the oil will work into the cracks and crevices the wax kind of seals everything in and if you get a warm summer day the wax will actually start to melt a little bit and again it'll start to creep which is kind of what you want you want to have a kind of a coating on here which would seal all the salt and brine out so that it can't corrode the metal obviously and it's the the wax is sort of very similar to what the they used to use back in the 70s on the good Ziebart the Z Barton that you would spray on there and you couldn't penetrate that because it had a waxy material in it that would prevent anything from breaking through now the reason why I'm saying September 15th is a good time is because if you wait much longer the overnight low is right now or about 50 degrees and then in that area if you try to spray or brush but I think it's more of a Vienna 50 brush it onto a frame that is been sitting overnight in a 50 degree 40 degree temperature area then as soon as you put the wax on there it's going to solidify and you won't be able to work in it at all you'll have to use a hairdryer or a heat gun or something but so if you spray it when it's warmer out it'll still say it's still st. liquid and it'll be able to creep and then it will slowly solidify but if you put it on a cold metal which I did this years ago I brushed on a compound that I had wax in it and as soon as I hit the frame it turned into a wax candle I mean it went on but you had to keep continually going back to the crock-pot to heat up the ball so that's why I'm saying it's a good time of year now to do it because if you wait in especially if the extreme northern parts of the country if you wait too long it's gonna be pain to work with the wax the oils you won't run into a problem necessarily but you still like to have that ability for the oil to creep into the pores of the metal and if it's if everything is warm out the frame included they'll be able to creep better than if it was a coal at a cold day so that's why I say that specifically I like to use oil these are very inexpensive oils I bought off of Amazon everything that you see today was purchased at Amazon I don't have links but I think if you just type in the the titles you can find them easy enough they're pretty basic things this is just a regular 10w30 oil I think it was $15 this is I use the conventional oil really more for sort of a color because some of the other items I used are more of a pink color specifically the next one which is automatic transmission fluid automatic transmission fluid has the ability to creep real well creep meaning a little over time it'll work its way into little cracks and crevices and that makes it one of the best lubricants you can use for under coating if you use nothing else other than automatic transmission fluid I think you'd be in really good shape the third thing I use is bar and chain oil now the barn chain oil is extremely sticky I don't think it really matters whether you buy a summer blend or a winter blend I think the summer blend tends to be a little more sticky but I've used both and they sort of I don't see much of a difference now you may say it's a bit of overkill to use all these I think between the three of these it may have cost $45 okay the idea is that we're gonna measure out and I say measure out roughly measure out a third of each of these actually a fourth if you had to wax and so you know if you don't have to buy all three of these if I was to pick one believe it or not I think I would actually pick the bar and chain oil because I find the bar and chain oil sticks to everything if and that's kind of what you want you don't want it to wash away these are all penetrate but I find that the barn chain will actually stay it over time it'll the dust will stick to it a little bit better and so that's kind of my thinking is as far as if you had to choose one of them I would go with the bar and chain but because I like the properties of each one of them I like the creeping ability like sort of the color the that this provides which you know it's going to be amber these are both amber you don't even really need to use the motor-oil but I just like I'm gonna try it that way I've used these two together and with pretty well pretty good success and then of course you're gonna add the wax so that's the thinking they're also rubber gloves are a must just by touching these things I've got oil on my hand from prior use so any kind of rubber glove you can put on that would help big-time and also I have a fan here that's just running it's good to have a fan sort of blowing under the car at the time you just want to be downwind of it obviously but it's a good way to get the any of the molecules that are in the air out of your out of your face and away from you you can wear a respirator - I tend not to but obviously if you have an allergic reaction a in the stuff for it would be a great idea in addition I'm going to use this is just a typical undercoating gun I think I paid $15 on Amazon these are readily available you don't want it you don't need to get anything expensive because all it's doing is it's just providing a some air pressure to to propel your liquid onto your frame this was an I believe this is also on Amazon this is the container that everything will get mixed into this was I believe this is under the brand of Eastwood and it screws onto the gun and the idea here is again we're going to measure out roughly 1/4 of each of those compounds into this one container also I'm going to be using this plastic wand the screws into the end of the of the undercoating gun it's made by 3m also on eBay or Amazon I think I blow it on Amazon it's it's a little bit pricey it's good for getting into the tight areas it's got an adjustable sort of a floating head on it where you can spray different angles that's good for it frame rails etc that'll be perfectly honest this is the vehicle that I'm going to be demonstrating on this is 1997 Chevy Astro 1997 was pretty old and I've only only did it I did it a couple of months ago I just sprayed some oil and stuff under there but I had only did that wax part in the back and let me show you that now this frames a little bit scaly and what they basically tell you to do is to scrape a loose stuff off the oil and wax will absorb into the rust and I don't know if you can see this but it's very sticky it's a combination of the bar and chain oil and the wax and so that's on there you know and it hasn't really been cold enough for it to to solidify but if you if you rub your fingers over you can definitely feel the wax in there that's where I and there's a good coating on there sure my mechanic will be pissed off but this frame has seen a lot of Northeast winters and you know I think it's time might be numbered but figure to try to get it a little bit more time because it runs really good it's only got a hundred five thousand miles on it also what you want to do is you want to get the you want to pop these rubber plugs off and that was you can see there's quite a few of them and this is right around the rocker panel this van never had it done this is like the first time I'm doing them in fact what you see right here is a is the running board I gotta take that off and do some repairs on the body but for demonstration purposes I just wanted to show you you can see how it's all oily but it's very scaling the frame and I've had it repaired a couple of times already so like I said it's time might be numbered but or it said these may be numbered but [Music] you know you just trying to do the best you can you know they don't make vehicles like this anymore maybe that's a good thing but this all-wheel drive van is like a tank so so do you pop those off and you would stick the hose in there and you would spray either way you know try to get as much coating in there as possible and that would sit on the rocker panel and prevent any further rust and you could see there's a couple up here just one up there in fact you can't really see it with this limited lighting but there is one here and further down the line this ad was my father's he bought it it was the last van he bought he was recover from a family contractors and you were able to get four by eight sheets of plywood in the back of the van which was at that time not very common so it's kind of a tribute to him to keep this van Gogh now this is the 97 RAM that I had done over I'll probably use some kind of a third-year review on this I think it was three years now since I painted it still no problems with it I wanted to show you underneath it now I rust proof Thunder here last year with just basically bar and chain oil and maybe a little bit of engine oil but not much more than that and you can see that it's still it's in good shape it's got some surface rust the problem with just using the straight oil is that you're guaranteed that you're going to have to you're going to have to hit it again every year basically because any water or splashing is going to is going to wash it all off and that's where the wax comes in if you can get a good coating of wax you could probably only have to do it you know every couple three years maybe but this is really not bad again it's just surface rust but I just wanted to show you how it does make a difference this is a 97 as well and this is lived its life in the Northeast so by and large it's in really good shape but yeah so let's give you a quick demonstration on the van it's been my experience that you want to turn your compressor down to about sixty pounds per square inch at the at the output any higher than that it just it really just atomizes everything and makes a mess so I turned it down to 60 okay so I've already put the bar and chain in to the container now I'm just going to pour you know a random amount because I know I'm going to end up using it so it doesn't really matter I want you to put in there and try to put equal amount of automatic transmission fluid and tricky part is going to be getting the wax out but let me put this in I'll be right back okay now we'll put the wax in just be careful handling this especially if you're doing it the way I I did it with a crock pot very very hot especially in a metal pan as you can tell I took the cover off it was smoking that's how hot it was but it's all liquefied now as you can tell okay so then we'll give it give it a quick stir now I was going to do it under the van but the van seems like it's got a lot of more issues than just rust so that's going to be a project of mine now I'm going to go under the truck and and give you a quick demonstration how this stuff comes on okay I'll be right back okay so wonder here now this is a messy job so I'll just be prepared at all now you can see how it runs down but it kind of coagulates because of the wax that's in it and the pinkness is of the is the transmission fluid obviously so see if I can see if you can see any more it is see it comes real out really liquidy and covers really good I'm just kind of doing it it's tough to hold this thing and she was at the same time but you know you really want to be afraid you know I wouldn't get it on the rubber stuff obviously they tie it up because of it might dissolve the rubber or so let me just finish this up and I'll come right back okay well I did I did probably a good third of the truck with that one bottle and you can see it's I got it you got it on everything you know and that stuff will just run and is it it'll penetrate into the metal the bumpers are always just a spot where you want to get it in there - you can't proceed in over this lighting arm but you can see where I got so I got mad a third of the truck done with just that one bottle now you got to expect a little bit of runoff and I'll put it in an area where you're not going to you don't want to kill your grass but maybe put cardboard under your vehicle and stuff and let it drip for a while but and don't get out of your exhaust but I think you'll have a lot of success with this is really not drip and I'm sitting right underneath it and usually I get dripped on but I think the wax is kind of keeping everything together give it a try I'm gonna get to lose right so I'll talk to you soon thanks very much [Music]", "ForF4R8nKwU": "hello again its kami from the vlog Tibbets here now if the kitchen is the heart of the home then I would say the kitchen sink is the hub of the home I don't know about you but with a family of six our sink stays busy between Mills snacks food prep washing dishes and even foot baths our sink can take a hit I'd like to share how I keep this big beautiful large single basin sink looking good and staying scratch and stain free [Music] in all our previous homes we've had a white ceramic sink now if I'm being honest I struggled to keep them clean the only thing that I found that would whiten and brighten the sink was bleach like my mama did and I hate bleach I can almost guarantee a migraine after using it even just a tiny bit but the thing is I love the look of a white sink especially this lovely fireclay sink from Blanco but I wanted to find products and solutions for keeping it clean without bleach and have to report these five successful solutions that have kept our sink looking brand-new while dealing with the needs of a busy home and even after having harsh stains in it due to the iron in our water when we first moved in like I mentioned our sink is fired clay material but I imagine these solutions would be great for ceramic sinks as well so the first thing you need to consider if you want a stain and scratch-free sink is prevention and the best way to deal with the problem is to prevent it in the first place I am frequently hand washing metal pots and heavy cast iron pans in here and these would no doubt do a number on the surface if I had allowed them to sit at the bottom of the sink or if my kids were to try to hand wash them themselves in there I can recall growing up and my mom frequently saying don't scratch the sink which was near impossible not to do in order to scrub a metal pan getting a metal rack that sits at the bottom of the sink is a game changer for our Blanco a fireplace sink it is an accessory that came with it and it's made to fit the sink perfectly but I know you can a variety of sizes of sink protectors that will probably work with your kitchen sink I'd begin my search on Amazon or visit a kitchen supply store or contact your sink manufacturer now let's talk about cleaning the sink after Mills this is a quick and easy step that makes a huge difference after each mill I will find food scraps floating around the sink left from food prep and waste being dumped inside or rinsed off from the plates now I found that leaving them to sit for hours on the sink will increase my chances that they will actually stain the bottom this large single basin is especially prone to this since there is such a large surface for the food to spread out and find a resting place this fact being perhaps the only downside that I could think of for this large sink but if you saw there my reasons for why I love this sink in my previous post this is something I'll happily put up with now even if you do all the dishes right away after each meal taking a few seconds to just spray it down and rinse over any leftover food or gunk that might be sitting there well keep it looking nice all day long and do wonders for preventing stains in the first place okay another simple daily thing that you can do to keep your sink looking good next to my nightly ritual and having a soothing cup of herbal tea I make it a point to remove the middle rack that's inside the sink and give it a quick scrub down with a rag maybe a bit of dish soap and that I'm sure to just do a quick scrub on the sides and on the front and rinse that soapy water down then I replace the rack you can even train your kids and spouse to do this if they are on dish duty again it only takes a few minutes but it can make a huge difference for preventing stains that will sit and soak into where they will need more drastic measures now speaking of more drastic measures sometimes you need something stronger this be water to get your sink clean I find this to be the case about every week or two weeks I have found two cleaners that have allowed me to kick bleach to the curb once and for all if you've been around tidbits long enough you know that I love natural solutions for our homes mostly because I am so sensitive to chemicals if you haven't caught on to that already now my friend Chloe from boxwood Avenue recommended this non-toxic cleaning pace on her Instagram one day and I Amelie bought it so that I could give it a try to see if it would work on the sink it's this pace that comes in this little tub it's called a Bennigan's queen and you can read more about it on Amazon but it has no bleaches solvents it's very degradable and it cleans a multitude of services like grout countertops cookware and more it has no smell and you just use a rag to wipe it on your surface buff it around and then rinse it off it works amazingly well and I'm excited to have this friendlier option for when the sink needs a bit more help this next product is when for nothing else works and no it's not bleach when we dug art well we discovered high iron content water and it reached havoc on our shower and sinks and basically anywhere where water was allowed to sit everything turned yellow and not a single natural cleaning solution I could cook up would even touch it we did get a whole house water filter to solve the initial problem but I was left with stubborn yellow stains and nice new home and I did what every gal does when they're faced with a problem I asked my friends on histogram many lovely women recommended this bar keeper's friend now I knew it wasn't all natural but I was desperate and miracles happened these stains lifted without hardly any scrubbing and I didn't get a migraine I'm not sure what is in it and you have to read the label to make sure you don't use it on services it's not intended to be used on but it has no smell no bleach and it works like a charm however I did wear gloves to be safe and just used a non-abrasive scrubber to help with the job I now keep this stuff stashed on the top shelf in my cleaning locker and pull it out when my sink or shower and need a little extra help which is about every month or so ok there are 5 tips to help you keep your sink looking brand new every day and for many years I know there has to be some other great ideas and products out there so feel free to share what works for you in the comments below now I've been sharing a lot of content centered around

into another 90 into the drain there's no vent underneath the sink so they put it in air admittance valve which is fine but I would plumbing in a little bit differently they have this fancy little wire you're holding the whole thing up as well so let's start with just cutting this whole thing out and showing you how I would actually plumb this in for a better drainage and done properly before getting started I recommend placing an old towel and a bucket under the p-trap this will catch any water that is held within the trap loosen off all the threaded connections to remove the drainage I'll be cutting the drain line where it enters the base of the cabinet making sure to leave enough piping sticking out of the cabinet to reconnect the drainage I'm removing and replacing the basket strainers as well as you can see once remove the threads are severely damaged before installing the new basket strainers clean the flange at the base of the sink install the rubber washer on the flange of the strainer and Center within the drain under the sink secure the assembly by installing the pressure cup and tightening down the lock knob connect the tailpiece by first installing the plastic washer into the tailpiece with the wider side up facing the bottom of the sink do not over tighten as you can easily damage the plastic washer the first step I take in starting the drainage is connecting the two basins start by installing one and a half inch trap adapters onto the tail pieces it is important when adding the fittings to the trap adapters that the tail piece doesn't extend into the bottom of the fitting this will restrict the drainage and cause backups cutting the ABS or PVC can be done with a plastic handsaw hacksaw or plastic tubing cutters is important that the cut is straight so that the tubing has a maximum amount of contact with the fitting using a tubing cutter as shown will ensure an accurate straight cut with no mess using the correct cement is very important this is ABS tubing so ABS cement should be used PVC and PVC - ABS connections have different cements apply a thin even coating to any part of the fitting and tubing which make contact with each other push together and turn slightly to ensure complete coverage the cure time will depend on the cement temperature and humidity holding the fittings together for two to three seconds should be sufficient wipe away any excess cement in this case it makes the most sense to run my drainage to the left as this where my drain connection is this means I'll be connecting my right basin within ninety and my left with a tee why making them roughly the same height we will gain the correct quarter inch per foot slope by raising the right trap adapter or lowering the left one next is connecting the dishwasher why make sure that the dishwasher fitting is flowing towards the drain and facing upwards if you do not have a dishwasher connect the T Y in the 90 together using a straight piece of tubing the correct slope for inch and 1/2 drainage is quarter inch per foot to read this on the level it is roughly when the bubble just touches one of the middle lines since the drainage is flowing to the left the bubble should just be touching the right middle line on the level now that we have both basins connected it's time to start the vent and final drainage since there are multiple scenarios you can run into at this step I'll demonstrate a few the most common scenario you will find in climates that don't experience freezing temperatures is just a single drainage pipe coming from the back of the cabin in this case the vent is already connected within the wall and to finish the drainage the p-trap can be connected from the bottom of the TU I and directly into the drain at the back of the cabinet the most common scenario that you'll find in climates that do experience freezing temperatures is the drain coming from the base of the cabinet and the vent coming from the back in this case the second T Y will be needed to connect the vent to the drainage this vent is called flat venting and a CLE note is required on the N part of the horizontal then the clean-out at the base of the drainage isn't required but recommended for easier servicing here's an example of the importance of a properly vented drainage system venting is just as important as the drain as it costs low drainage and drains that are more prone to blockages as a service plumber I always install a clean-out at the base of the drainage this will make servicing the drainage easier in the case of a blockage use a union p-trap and a TOI to connect the basins to the drain don't feel bad if you have to drive fit any of the connections first to line everything up to remember once is glued it's extremely difficult to come apart note that the TOI is the direction of flow and should be directed towards the drain the piece that connects the p-trap to the vent in drain is called the trapper this sections length is to be a minimum of two pipe diameters this being inch and half pipe it has to be three inches minimum this is to prevent siphoning out the water that makes up the trap seal this device is called an air admittance valve or in the trades a cheater ven it allows air into the drainage system but not out it is designed for drainage we're installing a vent isn't practical such as Renaud's that have finished walls or ceilings and island sinks in my scenario I have to use one because for whatever reason the roughened plumber 20 years ago didn't install a bed they also roughed in the drain coming into the cabinet crooked as you can see but sometimes you have to adapt to what you are given though the cheater vent can be installed as shown here it works best higher up in the cabinet I use two 45s to offset the vent past the basin and higher up the final step in completing the drainage is reconnecting the dishwasher drain with a gear clamp or spring clamp depending on your dishwasher model the finishing touches can be installing some split ring chrome cover plates there are a few different models but I prefer the plastic ones as they don't rust and are easy to cut once complete always check for leaks at all the connections well guys thanks for watching the video and hopefully it cleared up some questions on kitchen sink drainage if this video was helpful please feel free to like and comment as it's always greatly appreciated thanks again until next time", "fqnm4mwV33o": "hey everybody Jeff here and welcome back to the channel where we give you all sorts of world-class tips and advice on remodeling your homes your kitchens your bathrooms we cover all sorts of engineering disasters tool reviews and shop with Me's and today we're doing a slight engineering disaster here this is the age-old problem that you see in kitchen sinks where all of a sudden your kitchen sink will clog up on you and it won't drain so here where the homeowner is operating the garbage disposal here and they're draining the water guess what it bubbles back up into the other sink here that just backs up and then sometimes they're smelling the sewer gases as well too so we're going to help you in today's video repair this and it all starts right now what we are doing now is we're going to fill up both sides here because the problem that was manifesting itself into before was that when this side was filled with water and you're trying to empty it the water had nowhere to go because the waste line system down to the sewer was clogged so it would back up into this sink here so the plan here is to fill these both up with water as the stress test here and just empty both at once and see how it does do one first and pull the other one out here let's see how it does okay so right here on the outside of the kitchen wall you can see we're looking at and you can see right here this is what we call the clean-out and what's really nice about having a clean-out here and by the way it's required by code and many places now but what this does is this clean-out here is a this is a port into that drainage pipe there that comes off the kitchen sink that leads straight through this wall this way and down into the slab below and then down into it runs up near the front of the street and empties into the sewer system okay so the way this works is you take your channel locks here and you start to loosen it you want to unscrew this cap here again it be careful when you're doing it because if there's water blocked up in there and there's a clog and that's backed up its gonna come shooting out so you want to make sure you're wearing gloves you're making make sure you're wearing eye protection because you don't want any of that water coming up into your eyes so right when you're about to unscrew it here you go real gentle just make sure there's no water in there okay so the way this works is this gives you access into that drain system that's in there right okay now a lot of people here a lot of di wires and homeowners will use one of these little pistol grip drum augers here it's got a snake and the way it works is we stick the snake in here and you start just forcing it down the line there and it'll keep going problem is is you have a limited length on these these are usually about ten feet or so and so you'll only be able to get so far down the line there before it hits sometimes what I think is an illegal 90 degree we know that there is a 90 degree turn and the pipe down there and that's got to be illegal because all the 90 degree turn does is invite particles and stuff to collect up in the corner and build up and that's where you run them run to a problem okay so another trick that you can try that we've done a few times for people this will take a garden hose and stick it in here and just force it down that way down towards the sewer system and not really back up towards the towards the sink but if you can get it little ways down in there then you just go and gush the water for a second or two from the spigot there it might clear it and sometimes you might get it partially cleared and then you could turn on the water full blast and the hose is now gushing water all the way down the pipe and clearing it out that may help you as well but keep in mind you might still have all sorts of chicken fat and stuff that's collaborated in there and collected up in other solids and stuff so you just want to make sure that that all of that gets cleaned out so you may eventually have to snake it out like this here so now let's show you what the plumbers do to make this fix the k60 here and so what this will do is it will agitate and rotate the snake and force it in place all the way down the line there [Applause] [Music] [Music] all you do is as it rotates it you just keep feeding it through put on the sink we're letting the water go at the same time that will continue to push it down the line there just to make sure we can get some water flowing now not all of the water is going to go down the line some of it will come out the clean-out here but the idea is to be able to continue pushing the snake all the way down into the system okay so now we add a third length of snake onto it here lifting it in so far we've gone further than the homeowners DIY snake so here you can see it going crazy back there that whole length of snake right here is going to be fed right into the wall and when we pull out the very tip of it it looks like cereal was caught in there don't want to touch that yummy that's a milk okay now you just screw the cap back in here after you get it in sufficiently far by hand you then want to go back to your channel locks here now we can proceed to tighten it with the tool and you just want to go around as many times as you can till it's nice and snug you don't want to try to overdo it so you can see how having this clean out on here just really makes life a lot easier for you I feel sorry for people who have the older houses that don't have any of these all right so that is now tightened in there enough to prevent water from leaking out and you just want to monitor that over the couple of days and make sure that there's no water leaking out of there what we are doing now is we're going to fill up both sides here drain we'll start with the right side first and you can hear the water going down pretty good and now we'll do the left side as well of course they're both fighting right now there we go they got caught up and balanced you can see how fast and empty both of them really good and we hope you enjoyed this video and if you did please give us a thumbs up below that tells us that you like us and don't forget to hit that subscribe button down below and click on the bell

to go ahead and give you some insight on how to snake or clear your kitchen drain out there's a couple different ways and we all know we can use snaking we can use a water hose we can use a hydrojet in this particular situation what we determine is this kitchen line first of all is backing up and it's backing up into the little bar area here they've got a refrigerator there used to be an old laundry line and water came up through there and flooded the floor and stuff so that's one aspect of it the other one is we did find a clean-out on the back side of this sink right here which is very very helpful in all right folks so the first off that those two kitchen sinks were backing up instead of it going on the outside that fell the least resistant path and came out over here this drain pipe right this used to be an old washing machine line but look at see here my moisture meter we're getting wet here in these walls so show me what we're going to do with that a little bit later but let's go outside in the clean-out and I'll show you why it's important to have a kitchen clean-out or wall clean-out to prevent any sewage from damaging inside of your home so here we are just outside that bay window or outside we found that two-inch clean-out we're going to go ahead and run our camera just to see what type of stoppage that we're dealing with get water why the customers get water out here in the very beginning is because someone have tightened this down onto the pipe you don't want this to be tight on the pipe just allow this thing to be on loose like that so that way when it builds up pressure this will automatically pop off like that you want the sewage to go on the outside now because there's a ton of grease that's in this line we've attempted to use a cable that's not really the best way to remove grease we're going to bring out our hydro jitter and actually descale all of that grease out of the line so that way you won't have a continuous backup all right well here's our jitter this is the best way to clean kitchen drains when you've got major major grease compassion this has got over 300 feet of hose on it so we're going to take this all the way around the back yard there and get this to the clean-out fire this up and see what we pull out you you you can see the amount of grease that is compacting that drain there alright now that we've hydrojet it and clean the kitchen line I'm going to grab a couple scoops of our bio clean fill it up with some water dump it down the drain want to do this for about five days in a row then after that treat it at least once every three weeks once a month what this is going to do is it's going to break down the organic matter that builds up inside the pipes and you'll have less backups you know best time to do this is after dinner so you can let this sit overnight alright folks so in order to dry this out properly and typically when there is a category three with sewage water technically should be ripping everything out but the customer was very adamant on not removing or disposing any type of cabinetry or drywall here so what we're going to do is we're going to inject heat inside", "YQMhaFs5cy4":

[Music] hey everyone thank you so much for tuning in i'm so excited for today's video because today we're going to talk about sinks and faucets but not just your normal sinks and faucets i mean we're going to show you guys some next level stuff you won't see at your normal big box store so real quick before we dive into all this cool stuff don't forget to subscribe to my channel guys we talk about kitchen remodeling and everything you need to know to design and remodel your own kitchen so make sure you hit the little bell so you'll get notified for all the new videos we release my name is kirsten copp kitchen designer with king's kitchen and i am here today with my dear friend ashley from keller supply in tacoma and i'm so excited that we get to be here this is tacoma's finest when it comes to making your plumbing selections and we're going to dive right into um one of the main questions i get asked but before we do that actually let's talk really quick about counter supply actually okay so keller supply was founded in 1948. okay largest independently owned plumbing distributor in the u.s so small family business still but we have 90 plus branches now and over 42 showrooms throughout washington state west coast up in alaska so definitely can find a showroom near you to check out yeah because i know i have customers all from olympia all were working on the project in some amish right now then obviously i work with people online too but we're always you know i check with you guys hey where's my next sherman that i can send somebody to to get like really really good help to make these selections so okay let's let's start there's a couple cool topics you want to talk about and um and things we want to show you guys and when i design kitchens with you guys my number one question that i get when it comes to your plumbing selections is really you know i kind of make that question you know have you thought about your kitchen sink what were you thinking for a kitchen sink what kind of material were you thinking of using and the question i give back is like well i mean stainless steel what is there else to do right and i'm like oh my god no no no no there is so much you can do nowadays and i think ashley is going to show us what we can do definitely let's go so we're going to loop around this way keeping our business oh yeah [Music] that are on the market uh fireplace is a great one so this is the original material and it's been made for thousands and thousands of years right kind of the same way it's a clay that they bake for multiple days at over 2000 degrees okay so they kind of suck all of the moisture out so it's actually very non-porous okay definitely a more handmade look to it you do have color options now instead of your traditional white all right so you can do grays and blues and all sorts of fun things on those matte finishes are also available so when people talk about doing you know your traditional kitchen with a farmhouse sink is this what would go really into that look yes okay generally like apricot everyone thinks fire clay you do apron front there are definitely under around options of it but that is how your traditional apron front seats are made it's just like this okay um they're reversible so a lot of times they'll have patterns or designs on the back side so you can kind of choose right which side you want to use so quite a few of them on the market okay cool so next to this material what else do we have so we would have cast iron right so very similar high gloss beautiful lots of different finish options it is a thicker material so it's actually cast iron so cast iron solid heavy and then they do a really thick enamel on it lifetime finish on the enamels uh warranty on the animals nice so if i was in the market for you know i'm looking for a more traditional kitchen and i would love to do like a farmhouse thing you know kind of traditional white why would i choose cast iron over fire clay or the other way around yeah a lot of times it can be priced so i will say cast iron because it's made in a factory it is about half the price of doing a fireplace fireplace all made overseas in usually places like italy or france okay so nice and high-end mm-hmm okay fire um cast iron is actually made in wisconsin okay and you have a lot more finish options on that if you're not doing traditional land okay now the number one thing you know when it comes to things people go like well you know price is one thing to kind of choose right but um what are like the pros and cons and when it comes to these like fireplace people come and they they say well does it chip a lot so i have been selling fireplace inks for over 15 years now i have had one situation with really yes one in 15 years okay um and it was not necessarily it's not even a branch that's out there anymore right um and it was because they put a garbage disposal on it so the downfall to fireplace we do not i do not personally recommend adding garbage disposals to them okay because the vibrations can actually cause a defect in the bottom that was one instance it's so interesting guys so keep that i know it all comes down to what you have in your kitchen every kitchen is unique and your selections are unique on how you're building this place to work for you and your family so that's very very interesting if i was to choose that but i'm really set on having a garbage disposal maybe have a second pressing right that would be an option for it or let's talk about another different material we could use instead right what is it we got composites i like composites so composites are great super durable and i mean extremely durable you can use anything have been making them for many many years yeah so it is a acrylic resin mixed with actual like ground up granite so very much so like your countertops right um quartz products so lots of manufacturers make them now they're all very good okay everything that's out there on the market if you're under a francaise polar offers some great ones okay they have great color selections and great different designs so you can get them in pops of color right or you can get them in your whites um and then kind of your neutral colors right and a color that i really really like is black we do a lot of black colors with the composites or are really really dark gray looks super sleek yeah that's very good all those fun colors to work with again that's like use that in your design right if you want to feel very contemporary just that don't go with white you know i mean there's so many cool colors with your counter top there's yeah yeah i mean dark bright counter tops and then like a light grey thing look on the other way yeah it's so pretty oh my gosh okay so we've got fireplace we've got cast iron we've talked about we've got composite things that we've talked about now what else so we have copper okay we do copper options be definitely on the higher price point for a good res like good quality copper you can get a lot of copper out there you do want to make sure that it is recycled copper and a good quality manufacturing process on them right very high maintenance okay keep that in mind okay yep they are better if you love the natural beauty of things as they patina and they you know wear then the copper is a great option but it will change okay will change and it you know it will get that kind of green color and you can take it all the way back you can clean it out and take it all the way back to its original finish generally but people buy copper because they like that living yes finish right but it is definitely your higher maintenance material when it comes to kitchen seats okay and then tell us about that one material that everybody thinks it's like the only material you can do stainless steel right yeah so definitely lots of different options on stainless steel okay um good quality stainless steel isn't gonna be super tinny a lot of people don't like being you know they say oh it's just beans and it scratches good quality stainless steel is actually manufactured properly and you're not gonna get that really clinky noise that you get on a lot of them some cool factors you want to pay attention to how they're made because stainless steel all starts the gauge when you hear that is before it is actually stretched into a sink so once they actually stretch the material you really don't know what you're getting so you want to make sure it's a reputable stainless steel manufacturer this one for instance right here is a franke sink it has just really contemporary designs this is a chef station so all different sorts of accessories with it um has little shelves and things that you can really make it work for you and have everything right here in your sink so that's a great one yeah and you know accessories is something well manufacturers and accessories are something i want to touch base on too like what are your kind of go-to manufacturers for these different materials but also what are some cool accessories that people can look for okay so cutting boards that actually fit so this thing down here we're keeping the distance this is actually the kohler prolific so this seat comes with all of those accessories and you can really make it your own it has little rinsing bowls it has racks you can have the cutting board that's insect in it um it's been a huge hit since it came off you have your little fruit rinsing basket and it's all right there in your sink and then it stacks all the way to one side it's super cool yes so this is kohler this is kohler um shonke has some great accessories with their different ones so insect cutting petting boards are very popular you do want to be cautious and make sure you have that accessory on hand when your countertops are being templated yes because we did that and the accessories were not outside and we had to come back and adjust the cutouts [Music] yeah unfortunately things were back ordered and we had to try to make it work but um we came back so yes so we have cool accessories like this we've got a strainer or is this what you call a strainer this is like a little rinsing black root rinsing bowl and we've got a what do you call this in english that is a dry oh that is so nice i love that and then you don't have to have it on your counter you know and it just looks so nice this is the wrong way all right guys well this is cool first things now everything needs a faucet so ashley why don't we go over to the faucets and check them out and talk about them okay let's go [Music] [Music] do so um i'm already seeing this funny thing here what's that it looks like really interesting i want to play with it it's fun it's a roller mat so it kind of rolls up into a nice little thing you can tuck away okay we use them frequently just across seams you can use them as trivets for hot items they're solid stainless steel okay throw it in your dishwasher but i have been heard so many creative things with these people are just loving them it's like just have one in your life and you'll be happy seriously all right yeah all right okay cool so i love this wall because ashley just told me this is a working  station not really i want to turn everything off so please walk me through all these cool faucets and what they do who they are or your favorite different ones yeah so we're going to start on the far end person and that is growing and they have this cool technology where if you take we just want to tap that top button on it so it's not necessarily hands-free it's all mechanical though so for you you know people out there who are concerned about not wanting smart technology in their home this is actually mechanical so no batteries no hard wiring anything like that it's a great kind of simple for the most part hands-free i mean embossing myself having dirty hands yeah and then just going like this that's pretty cool i like that i really like that and it's true because sometimes i feel it if it doesn't have too much technology maybe you don't have to repair things or some people are just scared of too much technology exactly okay so that's very cool so then we're gonna skip over to the polar artifacts yes so polar just added their electronic technology and expanded the lines like this is one of my favorite faucets i know you're like ready to go yes go stick your hand just kind of underneath this is a completely hands-free oh my god 100 it works like clockwork every single time i have i love it kohler is like it's strong like you can tell it's like no joke yeah always a real deal rigor yeah just get right on also coolers really really done well with their spray function so this is the standard spray almonds they also have something that is a berry spray so it's a really light aerated soft spray for when you're washing those blueberries and raspberries and you don't want them all smashed up oh this here yeah it's like a soft super soft aerated spray for cleaning those things that's super cool and then it has a sweet spray which is great for spraying out your paint yep yeah it's strong yes so a couple different spray options that they have there very cool i like that that's strong like always we're going to get a little buddy get the hammering black today so the next one over is the color sensate that we're going to discuss yep so reason how to bring this up this was their original smart faucet it comes in many many finishes and as you see it comes from this beautiful ombre rose gold to titanium like no joke this is like the prettiest faucet finish i've ever seen in my entire life it's rose gold on bring it down to titanic that's just amazing that's super pretty i would build a whole kitchen just around this fall i just i need this in my life so now how do i turn this off so the same thing is another cooler one before just yeah just super never have issues i love super pretty them you change the spray on this too yes so if you click behind oh okay button and you can change the difference can i pull this out these are all pull ups something i love about holders they have a wonderful just straight down the ball joint so it really is strong yeah and it's oh my gosh i'm saying yeah the ball like you can really get all those different creases and that is like really nice like when you get a like a more like inexpensive faucet that's what's missing yeah yeah okay this is solid like i wouldn't be scared of hurting this guy that's a solid very solid box i like that person per second forgot how to tune great option there um colors one other one i kind of want to cover not very technology you know not a lot of technology here but workforce okay this is a company called waterstone very designer um oriented right they have about six well there's all the finishes right there on the wall oh they have about 30 to 40 finishes available they were made by a naval engineer so if you want to fill these these are super hefty faucets um they have a plp system so you always clicks back in and you will never have a faucet that does this and they'll go back in yeah and it's just engineering wise this is a great option for you moving on though something that is now available from multiple manufacturers including polar and friso okay is voice technology so now really yeah okay yeah so alexa go home you can literally say a polar faucet fill my dopple or give me eight ounces of water and it will do that without having to touch any of this stuff wow are you serious yeah so obviously with this joyful coved and everything going on you don't necessarily want to be touching everything that's where i feel hygiene yeah comes into place like you know that's really funny i cook for my dogs because i'm like obsessed with them and i get all messy i put their food in the dark bowls i have two big boys and then my hands are so dirty i hate the enough to go to the faucet right i gotta wash it first with soap and i gotta clean my hands and then i gotta take my measuring cup and go back and i could just say like alexa or something like alexa oh my goodness yeah okay life should be so yeah my son used it as mom if you have the voice technology faucet i don't have the dirty measuring cups oh when i'm cooking because it's easier for them too because of kids like cooking you know they can do measurements give me a cup and right so that's a very nice feature that's right it just ties right in right so that's really cool so here's another thing i think that covers a lot of cool faucets it covers a lot of cool things guys and obviously i'm going to list all of these manufacturers below all the model numbers below so you guys can check it out and if you have any questions to some of these fun faucets or things please drop your comments below let me know what was your favorite i want to know what was your favorite what are you thinking um what are your questions now before we end this video there's one thing that that kind of happens a lot with homeowners that are because obviously how many times are you shopping for plumbing fixtures right maybe once twice like three times a year yeah like every 10 years right so i'll i'll send my customers maybe to a cool place like keller and they'll find something they really like and then they'll come back and say oh maybe i could get the same model though at a big box store for a little bit less how does that happen and why does that happen and what do i tell my customers when this happens so that is where big box stores actually go to manufacturers and they say hey we want to buy containers for this amount of this product but we need it at this price point so they're going to manufacturers are going to reverse engineer but everything you see might look the same but the innards are going to be not solid grass you know they're going to use plastic innards i see what you're saying okay for instance i had a customer uh 10 years ago he went into a box store and he bought two faucets through me first and then he shorted himself one and he went into a box store bought what he thought was the exact same model okay took it home had his plumber install it and within six months one of them was leaking really yeah which one do you think it was the big box one yeah so you literally uninstalled them himself that one and one of the ones that you bought from us and brought them into me to show me the difference and it actually was a weight difference um i mean it was a significant weight difference you could feel the difference okay um and just the quality so they're right they're doing something to cut corners to make it that face point so it basically looks the same on the outside but the guts inside are wow less expensive less expensive you know what yeah lesser expensive version of that same faucet right so but what i'm thinking is when i do my kitchen and i get all this stuff in i'd be terrified if six months after i have to change something out because it's leaking i think that would be something where i would put an investment towards and say i'm gonna get the right one with the right interiors because if i am getting something with a lot of technology i i don't want it to break and say exactly did you actually know person that your kitchen faucet is the most used appliance in your entire home um don't see it as an appliance and it is it is the most used item in your home why not invest a little bit and get right material right so what do you think somebody should budget for like a quality thing and let's not go like top of the line fire clay or something if they wanted like the cool kohler sink stainless steel with all the fun accessories um how much should they budget for a sink like that and they then maybe for a decent exposure i would say about two thousand dollars for you know there's a wide range it's a very very huge range so i would say 2000 and you should be able to get something pretty awesome like some some real stuff that you can connect with alexa you can do like high technology cool stuff measuring for you basically take over your life you're just going to lay back on your couch and look at everything right okay so for instance i have the color sensation installed in my home that one right of course you can get that one yes of course you do it it's amazing and so they have to come to your house they just serve wine too i don't have one of and that is about a thousand dollars wow for that one and with that being said um we're going to end this video for today and i want to thank ashley again for having us here i want to thank keller supply for having us this was so

kitchen is dirty please excuse yesterday my water heater would not work because it was storming or not storming but raining so bad that for some reason it seemed to affect it so I finally got it working today and now my sink is not draining so I bought these these pipe brush cleaning kit thing and I am going to try to unclog that and later or probably I've got boy I'm not talking well this morning I shut my valve on my grey tank to let it build up somewhat - fresh out my my black tank when I drain it today I have a couple dogs to bathe and I have to take a shower so I'll do that and then I'll open the gray tank to let it flush it out but I've got to figure out this problem so I'm gonna open up this brush cleaning kit it's for pipes for smoking pipes - this might be gross you might not want to see this gross there's one gunk down there so how could you recommend buying these it just cleaning down there once in a while anyhow because stuff builds up along the sides of these drains and I also hurt there we go I got it there I can hear it now yay already good it's gross though isn't it okay so rather than rinse that thing off and send it right back down the drain just put my sink stopper in there was a lot of gunk in there I might do the other side cable even though I don't use the other side and then I have that one needs cleaned there we go I have these little sink filter things I'm gonna quickly take that out boy I got a Pat Clark didn't I put that in so I can grab all that job", "Q_zCYa--Zds": "[Music] hey what's up everybody I think you're gonna get a real kick out of this video we recently made the mistake of putting these jars with wax and these little vases that we had filled with candles inside our dishwasher there was hiding wax in there that we didn't realize and after a full cycle it completely decimated the dishwasher check this out it basically vaporized the wax and left a wax cake everywhere so this video we're gonna show you what to do first things first go down to the hot water heater and you're gonna crank this bad boy on the maximum temperature possible obviously be careful high temperatures can cause burns but the idea here is that you have water that is really hot to work with that can basically try to melt that wax as quickly and efficiently as possible so what we're gonna do is take apart the filtering system obviously your dishwasher will have maybe a different setup obviously a different model but we're going to take out these handle and these filter pieces you're gonna want to check the instruction manual for your specific dishwasher on how to remove and clean the filter but look at this filter that is wax ladies and gentlemen that is disgusting vaporized formed wax that was caught in the filter so obviously this dishwasher was not working after it's full cycle it was completely clogged and reading an error message so that had to be cleaned up obviously we've got wax everywhere with it you can see in the middle there that filter is removed and so how do you get rid of all this wax buildup and floating these these large pieces and also the water so we're gonna put all the filter in the screen stuff aside and we're gonna wash those later but basically we're gonna take paper towels or sponges and get rid of all that stuff now be careful you don't want any of those large chunks to go down into the circulation system so I used a shop vac to basically get up all those large chunks as much as possible and you can saw you saw paper towels there and basically it's a matter of wiping everything down and vacuuming everything up and even getting into where the water goes down drains out of the drain pump itself again be really careful you get all those large pieces up now the output for the water the water shoots up this little hole we're gonna kind of chisels and there's there's wax buildup there as well and then use the shop vac and bang some of those large pieces out the goal is to get all the large pieces out we're not super worried about this residue at this point I'll go with the paper towel in that really hot water you can scrub as much of that off as possible we've got a little residue remaining here after we have cleaned the all surfaces now you obviously want to take out not only the filters and clean them and again this hot water really really just melts this wax away check out this after the cleaning job that we did on this this is this is great and the little arms we're gonna take out the arms and the trees and everything run them through that really really hot water and just push all that wax buildup through look at that so that got everything taken care of their little time-saving tip for you don't clean don't spend time cleaning the accessories until you know that the drain pump and the filter is actually working in other words make sure your dishwasher can run and then you can worry about cleaning those other pieces up later and of course put everything back together again as per the instruction manual so with that done let's take a listen we have a fully operational dishwasher once again and we saved hundreds of dollars not having to have called the repairman super clean on the inside again turn that temperature all the way up on your house water heater and don't forget to turn it back down when everything when the job is done so

to 10 views so I figured I'd go ahead and make another one and you know I always talk about like if you click on certain links Amazon associated links that I'll get a few pennies well check it out I was able after several months of saving up to get a new product for the copper sink episode and so we're gonna try it out it's just basically carnuba wax but it says it can remove oxidation and clean and protect in one step so let's check it out and we're going to try it not on a car but on a copper sink so stay with me let's see what we can do okay it says finished should be dry clean and cool and I have already had the kids washing their hands in here today so let's go ahead and dry it out one thing about copper sinks is after you've washed or after you've wiped them for a while you get that oxidation off it's kind of a green color just kind of neat I'm a science geek so that's probably why I think it's neat okay it is nice and dry next step is working in two to three square foot sections while we only have a one square foot section the Czar's project on to the finish with a damp microfiber or terry cloth or paper towel in our case and now allow it to dry so that's what we're going to do alright let's take it open here so we're just gonna get a little bit up here whoo it's really hard that's kind of a weird texture actually you guys have probably used carnuba wax before I haven't played these whatever I was just use polish on my cars so it's kind of like a waxy appropriately-named stuff here I'm gonna kind of zoom in on this so I can show you I don't know remember for the last time on the last video we had something that turned black so we're gonna hope that doesn't happen with this I'll put a link in the description or maybe you'd like a one of the cards you can click on from the last video yeah look it's turning green but we're gonna keep going because it might just be taken off the oxidation it may not be oxidizing anything it might just be removing what's already on there yeah that's interesting that last stuff that we used that definitely was oxidizing they're doing something I made the whole thing black so this is gonna take probably quite a few paper towels so I probably won't bore you with the details of doing the whole thing so I'll go ahead and press pause and we'll be right back with you cuz it's gonna take a little while but you can see what I'm doing just making a haze on here see in just a second alright guys it's only been a few seconds here but what do you have watch as I rub this this one little spot I can see it's starting to kind of shine up I feel like it's really removing that oxidation well look how black it is so let's just keep doing this one little spot it might take some time and if you had a power tool that might be more yeah it's taking hot stuff off so yeah it's gonna take some time I'm gonna go ahead and press the pause for you again because you're probably bored on your mind by now but we'll be right back with you I'm gonna I'm gonna clean it up and I'll let you know how much time it takes all right guys it's been about five minutes of solid scrubbing and it's actually working pretty well so the left side has been polished and the right side I haven't done anything with so take a look it's pretty nice I used about six of those half paper towels oh can you hear the wife she's calling she's she's got more video stuff for us let's go see what she wants yeah we'll wait anyway guys that is about it I want to go see what she wants and we'll be right back alright guys we are back so anyway I would say this is a success this this stuff which you guys bought for me by just supporting this channel by clicking on links my affiliate links and helping me out I was able to amass $12 or so over the period of the last six months for this copper thing to try something new so yeah looks pretty cool did a really good job and I'll be doing the other side which you can see is pretty dull you can see the line right there that's the line that's not shadow that's actually the line of what I treated and what it didn't treat so that is all there's a little sneak peek of me as I'm filming so thank you

been getting the same question a lot lately for example Carla Carla says I hate my granite composite sink it was a dark brown color when I bought at seven years ago now and for maybe three or four years it is a very ashy and white looking is very dull and an eyesore I can't wait until I'm able to replace it with stainless steel or believe me who says how do you clean the haze from composite granite or thank you I've been looking into composite sinks they are beautiful for a second there I thought you were going to apprise me one or or give me a discount good luck on your remodel and Kim fields who says you didn't say anything about the maintenance of the composite sinks are they easier to keep clean than the stainless I believe the look of a clean stainless steel sink but unless you take the time in trouble to wipe it dry after every use you don't get to see that look very often also that copper sink looked like hammered metal does that make water drops harder to see well we're going to dive into all of that right now [Music] welcome back Ramada Lites to another episode of quick tip Tuesday I'm Dave with remodel media since 2005 I have helped people put together kitchens bass outdoor kitchens and various other home renovation projects my mission here is to help people eliminate regret and I do that by bringing the latest tips tricks and products to you here every week so if you haven't done so already make sure you hit like and subscribe and share with all your friends and ring the bell so you never miss an episode so this one goes out to all the folks asking how do I clean my composite granite sink now if it is a true composite granite something like a blanco silgranit or a Franchi granite or an lke granite then chances are very very good that all you really need to do is clean it with soapy water or now and again now in various parts of the country for example here in California we have extremely hard water we're at the very end of the water supply so we get the coffeepot sludge that's left over lots of minerals and a lot less water than somebody further up the pipeline and as such we definitely need to clean our sinks no matter what they are more frequently more often than we would if we were somewhere else somewhere that had more pure clean water less minerals now that being said there are some things that you can do you can use cleaners the cleaner that I prefer is a cleaner called bar keeper's friend you can find it at the grocery store it looks like comment but it's just less chemically abrasive however if bar keeper's friend is just not harsh enough for you you need something with a little more umph I actually am a big fan of using vinegar specifically 50/50 vinegar and water one of the things that you can do is to plug your sink pour some vinegar over the bottom of it add a little bit of water and let it sit overnight see if that helps clean up the water spots but remember just like any other material it does need to be kept clean it does need to mean it's just that you can go longer between cleanings without it showing and it's very difficult to scratch and it's it looks the nicest the longest with the least amount of effort now Kim you asked a very specific question about copper sink hammered metal does it make the water drops easier to see or harder to see the short answer is anything with a darker finish is going to have a higher likelihood of seeing water spots specifically calcium and magnesium and things like that in the water supply so I want you to keep that in mind when we're looking at copper sinks the other thing about copper sinks is they will turn green around the drain and they will have high spots and dark spots just like a copper pen if you go into your pocket or in your person you find a copper penny that is from you know 1960 you can see that that copper penny has aged and it has become a dark brown versus a copper copper coin or copper penny that was minted in 2020 is still brand new and shiny the reason for that is copper oxidizes as it's touched with you know skin oils and all these kinds of things you know so people need to understand what that material is and what it's going to do and if I were to leave copper sitting in water it would turn green as for um our what kind of sink do you want I'll see if I can get it for you no promises but I'll give it a shot you're looking for a single bowl a double bowl you're looking for under mount or drop-in I'll reach out to my reps and see what I can do and that's all we've got for you today for today's quick tip

but I hate when I expel exam I'm always putting on different services like I even spoke on from the screen of my phone and recently I spilled it on the kitchen counter so if you want to know how you could remove your stool don't go anywhere just eat see for the video this is the wax that I actually spills very good wax and this is a section where I spilt it to get excess off I scraped it off with that chopper but I still needed to get off the actual stuff that was sticking there so I took this piece of sheet and well yeah piece of a sheet because I cut it out and then I heated the frame pan very hot rubbed it on the sheet to get it warm and then I you know tried rubbing it off it was still a bit thick there so I actually had to put some more heat on the frying pan and put it back again I left it longer and then it's it actually started coming off so I constantly did that in this section I just lady she told a bit more flat it was thinner so the heat to penetrate it better and it started like coming off like butter like literally so this method definitely can work for you if you ever happen to spill facial wax on your countertop thanks for watching my video I know please

show you how to clean a stainless steel sink when we moved into this house there was a really small double sink and my ever so wonderful husband put in a new one for me because it would not even hold a pan and I was so frustrated using that sink I couldn't reach the faucets at the back and we had to move the sink forward because it hurt my back to reach and so it was a project but we did get a brand new sink in and I love it and I like the look of porcelain better than stainless steel as far as decorating goes but the stainless still is actually a lot easier to take care of I think you don't have the problem with the scratches from the pans and all that and with seven people the sink is pretty much never empty and so I really just like the ease and work as far as the stainless steel goes I'm going to give you two methods today of how to clean your sink I use just regular comment and it doesn't scratch your sink if you use a paste of water on it um I really like it because it disinfects also because it has a little bit bleach in it the other method is baking soda and vinegar now this is a really good alternative if you don't like the comet the only thing I don't like about it is the vinegar does not disinfect as well as bleach despite all the rumors going around on the internet it really doesn't we have an article on our website that you can click through and read on that but I called the health department and it really does not clean as well it only cleans about 80 percent of the germs and the bleach clears kills 99 percent so that's where I prefer you know it's just a matter of your own preference so if you like the natural method better then go for it so I'm going to clean one half with comment and I'm going to clean the other half with the baking soda and vinegar and show you the results of both to start with I use the wash rag that I clean my dishes with to clean my sink because I'm getting ready to throw it in the laundry um by the way a wash rag is a lot more sanitary than using a sponge so we get a fresh worse rag every single day and this way I don't have to worry about spreading germs all the time that kind of thing the first way I start cleaning is I take my soap bottle and see all this soap that's been dripping down that just drives me crazy so what I do is I take my rag and I rub it around and I get my soap bottle all clean get out the soap off and this way I get it put on my rag and then I take my rag and I wipe down my sink oops I left my complaining things there and I just wipe down and get it all good and wet get all the food off let it soak for just a little bit I don't scrub real hard I let the water and the soap do the work for me and one of the ways to do that is to get it all soaked down so that it's soaking and always use hot water so then I go down and after it's soaked for a minute or so and I start wiping down all the big pieces of food and get them down into the drain now this you should do after you wash your dishes after every single meal you should wipe down your sink and this helps keep it clean on a regular basis instead of having to do a big cleaning every week or so so on the left half I'm going to use the comment and I just sprinkle a little bit you don't need a lot of cleaner that's plenty I mean that's maybe a half a teaspoon teaspoon and my sink is already pretty wet and my rag is already pretty wet so I'm not adding any additional water make sure you scrub up and around and be sure you really get back here because this is where a lot of stuff really collects in the back well don't think to wipe down back there I like the comet also because it gets rid of little rust spots and that kind of thing and that really helps to get out some of those stains my sink is starting to get a little stained and I can't get everything out but I can get a lot of it then I rinse my comment off and you can just spray it down if you want and use your sprayer although I like to rinse it with the rag because then I give it an extra scrubbing but you don't have to just kind of whatever you prefer and then if there's any little spots left get that then be sure to wipe down your counter then after you're done cleaning you need to take and dry your counter and the sink this is what helps it keep it shiny and clean and get all party now you can see right here on my faucet where it's scratched a little bit what happened was one of my kids was we're cleaning and they used one of these scratchy pads do not use this to clean your sink it will scratch it and so that's what happened here and you can see unfortunately but that's just life with kids so now I'm going to go and do the baking soda and the vinegar and you can already see just the clean from the non clean how much of a difference it makes so if you're going to do baking soda get your sink a little wet again sprinkle your baking soda on just a little bit I use a little bit more baking soda I do the comment and then just scrub again make sure you get all around here all that gross get down all your edges and on the back again around your faucets just get every crevice and this time I'm going to do my faucet here also then you can take a little bit of vinegar and pour it around I just do a little bit and it will foam with the baking soda and that's funneling which by the way baking soda and vinegar makes a great drain unclogged err and we have that recipe on our website also that you can I'll put the link in the description below and then the vinegar helps get all of the water spots and that type of thing off all the hard water and then just rinse it also and I just rub it down again you can spray it out if you want but I just do it so that I can get an extra scrubbing in and then take your towel and dry the whole thing again then you have a nice sparkly sink that you can sit back and enjoy for about 30 seconds until the next person puts a bowl in so if you want to add an extra polish to your sink you can also take baby oil and wipe it down with baby oil and that'll give it a really nice shine but I don't really go to that extra step since my sink has only been this clean probably twice in the last year that's what we're doing videos because usually it's full of dishes with all the people we have that's how you go about cleaning a stainless steel sink let me know your preferred way to clean it or if you have any other suggestions um if you have a good way I've tried everything to get rid of some of these stains on my sink and I can't so if you have any good ideas on how to get rid of them please let me know in the comments I'd be happy to try them maybe I'll even try it on camera and see if it works um but yeah this is how you clean a stainless steel sink see the flowers my wonderful husband got me I had a really bad cold last week that actually put me in bed and he brought those for me isn't he sweet so one morning my son came up and put this sign above the disposal and the light on the kitchen sink on the left it says see everything and on the right it says wake everyone up I thought that was pretty good this bedroom is right under the kitchen so he was always getting woke up with the disposal going off because the rest of the family doesn't sleep till noon every day not dad he's 17 you like this video be sure to subscribe like share and comment below",

kitchen sink this method is not designed for sinks that are just dirty and require cleaning are ones that have a protective coating from factory this process requires a general kitchen cleaner paper towel and a scrub pad 1,000 and 2,000 grit drier wet sandpaper and a stainless steel polish the first step is to give the sink a really good cleaning with a general purpose kitchen cleaner and scrub path as you can see the sink has some pretty deep scratches in staining possibly from a cleaning product at some point next is taking a piece of the 1,000 grit sandpaper and buffing out the scratches keep the sandpaper wet throughout the process and start at the dream if your sink has a grain to the stainless steel sand in the direction of the gradient this thing you might have had a green at one point but is so badly scratched it's hard to tell if no grain in the metal is visible sand in a tight circular motion maintaining the same direction in rotation once you feel that most of the deeper scratches are buffed out use a paper towel to clean up any residue and repeat the process with the 2000 grit sandpaper remember to use very little force to avoid having to repeat the process you may experience black swirl marks during the sanding but don't worry as this is just some of the residue from the stainless and sandpaper and will clean up in the next step once you feel happy with the look scrub and wash away the stainless and sandpaper residue then completely dry the finishing touch is applying some stainless steel polish to give it back that shine remember this process is not going to be for everyone but more is an option to renew a tarnished heavily scratch kitchen sink and not having to replace it thanks for watching and until next time", "r25zMpTPotA": "do you want to learn how to unclog your kitchen sink maybe your kitchen sink is backed up and it's driving you nuts so today I'm going to show you how to do that in five minutes or less and we've got an awesome tool for you that you should be aware of especially if you're a new homeowner and you've never done this before oh and like with a lot of my videos you got to watch it till the end because guess what we've got an awesome surprise for you and I don't want you to miss out on that so let's get to it here's the dual kitchen sink right here we've got a left side and a right side they're both clogged so both sides are clogged what does that mean well you have to take a look underneath the sink to find out well as you can see here we've got our two drains underneath the sink the left side and the right side then you have your p-trap and most likely the clog is right here in the p-trap and there are only two nuts holding the p-trap in place so there's not number one and nut number two what you'd want to do is unscrew these counterclockwise and what that'll do is lower the p-trap now when you do that all the water that is up in the sinks is going to drain down so you need a five-gallon bucket or a three and two gallon bucket however much water is up there because you don't want to mess underneath the sink here so that's what we're going to do we're going to slowly turn this nut because chances are water may come out of it I don't really know we're going to turn this nut here as well so there as you can see water's coming out now here's the deal because water isn't rushing out that means of the clogs the clog is probably right here so we're going to take take apart this pipe as you can see water is slowly dripping out guys you want to take your time because a lot of water is going to come rushing out of these pipes so let this drip now look at this there's a clog right here this is our culprit I don't even know what that is it looks like a marshmallow or something it's probably grease right there you go probably sure they got the five gallon bucket it's a good idea to put some towels or some rags underneath the p-trap so that when you open up the drain the water if any of it misses the bucket will go down on to those towels or rags what do you do if the clog isn't in the p-trap where is the clog I mean if all the water is draining but it gets to the wall and it's stopping there that means that your clog is in the wall how do you reach that well you need to get a hand auger and the one brand that I totally recommend for you is the rigid anything rigid brands is awesome because they they warranty their products they work and a lot of plumbers tend to use them tend to use the rigid products so I like the rigid power spin so this is it right here and it basically is an auger a hand auger that you spin so when you spin it when you hold the trigger here so what you'll do is you'll hold the trigger you'll push pull the trigger in and when you spin it by hand this little tip comes out and on the end of this is a very sharp piece of metal and that will catch any kind of clog that is in so whether it's hair grease crime whatever the clog is this will catch it so you can press the trigger like so spin the drum and it'll go down into your drain once you hit the clog you can spin it without pressing the trigger and that will additionally try to clear out the clog so when you're done and you think you got most of the clog whether if it's likely hair some sort of grease buildup press the trigger again and turn the drum counterclockwise that will pull this out of the drain along with the clog now if you want to you can attach a drill to the end of this simply press the tabs in and pull this off and it reveals a little stud that comes out of it that's what I call it anyway and then you can attach this to your drill and you can power the drill along with this hand auger down into the drain but often times you may not need to do that you don't need that much power think about it you only really need to get the clog on the end of the auger itself and to pull it out of the drain but it's a really nice option to have so let me show you quickly how you would use this in the wall and the wall pipe that's going into your wall and down into your basement or into the main sewage stack it's really easy to use you don't even necessarily have to take the gooseneck out of the wall you can if you want but you don't have to so what we're going to do is press down on the trigger so press down on the trigger and feed this into the wall plate and spin the drum clockwise once you hit the clog you can simply turn this counterclockwise and cool we auger out so again what you could do you can use a drill to actually power this is slide the auger onto the drill and tighten it down you want to feed the auger up into the pipe just like you did by hand press down on this and turn it so that it's spinning to the right see how much more we get out by using the drill it's a lot it's a lot more efficient so you want to reverse your drill and reverse the auger until it comes out there you go so we're going to tighten down all these pipes by hand we're going to put it back together just hand tighten them they don't need to be super ultra tight or anything I did want to show you one thing guys these washers these concave washers there's a certain way that they go down into the p-trap to create a watertight seal and concave side goes down into the pipe so make sure it looks that way not like this because it will not create a seal you'll know right away so the first thing that you do is put the slip nut up onto the pipe and then slide your washer onto the pipe as well you want the drain to go down into the p-trap as much as possible to slide that p-trap up then you want this section to be nice and flush right here if it's not it will definitely leave so again hand-tighten make sure that that washer is down in and the p-trap can tighten the nut again that's why these cabs are on here to help you hand tighten it and wipe everything off make it look nice and clean the last step is the test and make sure you don't have any drips or leaks underneath the sink and the way that you do that is run the water on both sides of your sink for probably about a minute or two on both sides I'm hoping there are no leaks if you do have a leak it's probably one of those washers that's miss misaligned so you'll have to fix as I shut off the water you'll have to fix that washer and the slip net so that's probably the culprit for any leak that's underneath the kitchen sink and I almost forgot one additional tip is this make sure there isn't any kind of dirt or buildup or hair that's on the washer or slip nut because that will prevent a watertight seal so it's a good idea to clean those slip nuts and washers well that's it that's how you unclog your kitchen sink in five minutes flat and I truly think pairing the Ridgid powers bin with a drill where a power tool is an awesome combination and it'll make this job go by super quickly again here are the tips you know tackle the clog first at the p-trap if that isn't helping out with the problem then you want to go and try to clear out the clog in the drain that's in your wall using the Richard power spin and a drill alright so here's the surprise I'm going to be giving away

completely clean you also have to clean the blades in your disposal and you can do this by closing some ice in the disposal and running it and that will clean the blades are normally when I eat lemons

fits your needs then use scissors to cut along the paper template for your desired reveal type begin step 1 by locating the cutout template check that the cutout template is properly sized by aligning it against the actual sink to ensure a proper sized cutout next place the cutout template in the desired location on the countertop please make sure there is clearance that is suitable for backsplash faucet and plumbing for the sink before proceeding trace the previously placed template on the countertop using a pencil ensure that all corners and sections of the template are properly traced remove the template and if you are installing a faucet a soap dispenser air gap or accessory hole mark the location for the holes as required the minimum distance from the edge of the sink cutout to center

cover a few safety basics for your sinks with no disposal first things first always follow the guidelines of the manufacturer to protect your skin from harmful splashes avoid using plumbing tools after using chemicals now we're ready to plunge in [Music] here's what you'll need if you have a dishwasher the first thing you'll want to do is tighten a clamp over the flexible part of the drain line this way you can prevent dirty water from flowing where it shouldn't go place the cup of the plunger over the drain opening if there isn't standing water run the sink until the plunger is covered give it a few firm pumps making sure the seal stays tight you'll know the clog is loosened if the plunger gets easier to pump if water drains you're good to go if not try cleaning the p-trap and trap arm for this process you may need the following items first things first put on your rubber gloves and place a bucket or bowl and a few towels directly underneath the p-trap unscrew the slip nut between a p-trap and trap arm then unscrew the nut at the bottom of the waist teeth this should be easy enough to do with your hands but if not carefully try using slip joint pliers or a similar tool once the p-trap is off check their for blockages and remove them if there aren't any visible clogs you'll want to try cleaning the trap arm remove it by loosening the slip nut and sliding the trap arms in the drain line then run a screwdriver around the inside of the drain and pull out any debris that may have collected in the opening inspect both the p-trap and the trap arm for cracks or worn down walls if you still haven't found the clog try unclogging the drain with a snake here's what you'll need [Music] with your p-trap and trap arm disassembled and your gloves still on loosen the setscrew at the tip of the snake pull it out six to ten inches and then tighten it back into place now spin the drain snake into the drain if you feel a little pressure and it's not the source of the clog it's probably just rounding the corner just push through it when you do hit the club turn the crank counterclockwise and pull out the cable repeat the process until you no longer feel the

you're thinking dave why are you filming in your car and why is it full of stuff well this and much more will be answered right now [Music] welcome back remodelites to another episode of quick tip tuesday where i dive into your questions comments and concerns i'm dave with remodel media for the last 16 years i've helped people put together kitchens baths outdoor kitchens and various other home renovation projects it is my mission in life to eliminate regret and i do that by bringing you the latest tips tricks and products for your home remodel so if you're new here consider subscribing ring the bell for notifications so you never miss an episode ruth this is an excellent question so first you have to understand that for a 30 inch sink base you have to duct about three quarters of an inch from each side for the plywood construction which what most cabinets are made of leaving you with around 28 and a half inches so the largest sink that i would recommend in a 30 inch sink base is probably around 28.5 inches can you put a 30 inch sink in a 30 inch sink base yes technically i have seen it done it involves cutting into the sides of the cabinet a little bit and you so you have to be okay with that and have to have somebody who knows how to do it in my research i was not able to find an adequate stainless steel sink that fit those needs however i found two sinks from kohler that absolutely do first is the kohler riverbeat which is a porcelain enameled cast iron sink backed by kohler's cast iron warranty available in a multitude of colors so go ahead and check that out in the description below the cola riverbee is also pretty interesting because it comes with a bunch of different accessories which typically you have to pay extra or purchase those separately the second is the kohler cairn which is actually kohler's composite granite or composite stone material similar to blanco's sill granite which i put in my own kitchen this particular sink is also a 28 and a half inch sink made for a 30 inch sink base so both of these sinks would be good options to have and are available in multiple colors now i mentioned before that stainless steel sinks were not a super viable option mainly because stainless steel sinks in this category tend to be around 24 inches overall which once you deduct for the lip you're left with like a 22 and a half or 23 inch sink at best and i feel like that's just not enough for a main kitchen sink even 27 inches is pushing it and so i did a little digging now i did find in the back of our warehouse a sink that is made by kwc kwc no longer manufactures sinks they strictly manufacture faucets however kwc is definitely a high-end manufacturer this particular sink retails for around 1600 however we can let this one go for 600 plus shipping so if you're interested in this one and you want a high-end stainless steel sink we can make this one happen for you let me know now i will say with 2020 being how it is we've seen a lot of products go on back order and that is very unfortunate so purchase with caution and understand that it could be several weeks to even a month or two before you see your sink because why it's 20 20 that's why if i had a nickel for every time i've had this conversation with somebody this year well i could afford to quit my job and move cross country which reminds me i'm quitting my job and i'm moving cross country you heard that right folks friday december 11th will be my final day in the showroom in california i'll be spending the holidays packing my stuff up and i'll be moving to virginia you can follow along with me on any of my social media just look for me at remodel media i will be posting mostly on tiktopic and instagram daily little updates and things if you want to follow if you care about what's going on with my family and i for those of you wondering and wanting a recap here's where we are so far my wife found a property in virginia originally they were asking about thirteen thousand dollars which already was quite a steal and we watched it for a while the price dropped to eleven thousand we contacted a local realtor who said you should put in an offer for eight and i said okay we put in the offer for eight the offer for eight got rejected and the realtor said well you should up your offer to nine then and so we put in an offer for nine it was set to go to auction the next day i honestly did not expect they would accept our offer but they did they accepted our offer for nine thousand dollars and and so last july we became the proud owners of a property in stonega virginia which is in appalachia it's near the corner it's on the western corner of the state near the kentucky tennessee virginia border we took a road trip out there this summer and let me tell you the place was not in great condition i knew right away there was a foundation issue i called out a foundation company and they said in all honesty i would probably have to bring out a structural engineer and a contractor that specializes in turn-of-the-century homes which obviously i do not have the financial wherewithal to do that so plan b is to build two adu units on the property and then tear the house down and start over for those of you who don't know adu stands for accessory dwelling unit think of it like a guest house except with the intention of turning turning it into a rental this is some of the last stuff i have to go through in my storage i've been cleaning out my storage the last several weeks it's interesting going through a lifetime of things that you

And the choices are endless. There's stainless steel and Corian And styles like this above the counter basin to apron front sinks. Gorgeous showrooms aside, you need a sink that can handle daily wear and tear. That's where Consumer Reports comes in. Testers put 18 kitchen sinks through some tough tests They stain sinks soaking cotton balls with foods like KoolAid, pasta sauce, and coffee. They scrubbed with scouring pads And they dropped hard objects, up to 5 pounds from different heights. They even checked how well the sinks could handle \n a hot pot of 400 degree oil. All of the materials had a weakness, some worse than others. Our acrylic sinks actually melted in our heat-resistance tests Our fire-glazed sinks cracked during our impact tests. And while nearly all of the stainless-steel sinks scratched they \n proved to be the most durable type of sink. And, among the least expensive. But avoid high-polished stainless steel. The brushed and the matte finish will hide stains, \n scratches a lot better than your high-polished surface You'll also want to get a stainless steel sink \n with sound absorbing pans on the under side. They're quieter than ones with a spray-on coating. So while a sink isn't the most glamorous purchase, choosing \n the right one can make kitchen jobs easier.", "3rHhB_9mmhU": "Hi, i'm Dave with Remodel Media and for\nthe last 13 years I've helped people put together kitchens baths outdoor kitchens\nand various other home renovation projects. Today I want to talk to you\nabout the most common question I get in the kitchen and that is: \"Hey Dave I want\nthe best kitchen sink.\" \"The best is a relative term what do you want to do\nwith it?\" \"I want to put my dishes in it.\" \"True but\nwhat else are you going to do with it? How are you going to take care of it\" There are three basic types of materials.\nWe've got your metals we've got your porcelains and we've got\nyour composite stone materials. Your metals are materials like stainless\nsteel or copper, porcelains could be a porcelain-enameled cast-iron sink or it\ncould be a fire clay sink. Fire clay is an interesting material because it's the\nsame material all the way through and then of course we have a newer type of\nmaterial that other companies are starting to get into here\nso there's some interesting designs out there in the world and that is like\nmaterial called composite stone or composite granite composite quartz and\nI'll go through each of the three materials. Now the reason people started\nusing stainless steel as a kitchen sink is for a couple of reasons mainly\nbecause they want a sink that is reminiscent of a commercial kitchen they\nwant to have it look professional. Now the reason commercial kitchens use\nstainless steel is because stainless steel will never crack it will never\nchip it will never fade it will never rust at least if it's a good quality\nstainless something like an 18 or a 16 gauge 304 stainless. Basically something\nwith a high nickel content something that is going to have a little bit of a luster.\nThe thing about stainless steel though is it will scratch it will water spot so\nthe question I always have is sure you want stainless, who's going to keep it\nlooking nice? Or do you care about it looking nice? I've had some people tell\nme \"I don't care\" which is fine I've had some people say \"that's the maids problem\"\nthat's fine I've had some people say \"that's my\nwife's problem\" to which I say let me know how that works out for you.\nSo the bottom line is stainless steel is a beautiful material but you've got to know\nthat something that beautiful needs maintenance. The other type of metal\nmaterial is copper. Now a copper sink is going to start out looking like a shiny\ncopper penny and then they take chemicals and they age it giving it this\ndark brown or bronze kind of a look. The thing about copper is it will turn\ngreen around the drain and it will probably water spot. What you can do with\ncopper is you can shine it up like a bright new copper penny and let it age\nnaturally all over again, so it's an interesting\nfeature but again something with maintenance or care built into it if you\nwant it to look the way you bought it for a longer period of time. There's waxes you can use things like that to keep that finish from turning green and\nwhatnot. The next type of material are your porcelains. So I mentioned fireclay.\nFirelay is a material that looks like your porcelain enameled cast iron\nbut the biggest difference is porcelain enameled cast iron is literally just\nthat it's a layer of porcelain on top of cast iron. Which means because it's a\nlayered material it can crack it can chip it can fade I've seen little\nhairline cracks around the drain sometimes. It's not something that's\ngoing to happen tomorrow but it's probably going to happen five or ten years\ndown the road. Anybody who's had a cast iron sink for more than ten years will\ntell you, you always end up with these little chips down at the bottom and it\nstarts to kind of rust through and that's what leads to getting them\nreplaced. Fireclay that's not going to happen. Now fire clay doesn't have to be\nan apron front you can do an undermount or\ndrop in sink out of fireclay, but it is the same material all the way through and it's baked to a much higher temperature than cast-iron, so if you\nwant the porcelain look but you want something that's going to be the same\nnow and 20 years from now and it's not going to chip or rust fireclay is an\nexcellent material to consider. Now that brings me to our final selection here\nwhich is a composite stone material. Like the fireclay the composite stone\nis a solid material all the way through very durable some people touch it and\nsay it feels a little plasticy it is a man-made material so it does have\nsome resin in it. You can hear it on my ring so it does have a lighter weight\nfeel as compared to the porcelain enameled cast iron or the fire clay\nmaterial. It's also a little bit more contemporary in it in the way it looks\nit's usually a more matte finish although some of them do have some\nsparkle to them it's not going to be as glossy as a fire clay or porcelain\nenameled cast iron. Now that brings me to the ways you can mount a sink. So\nthere's again three basic ways to mount a sink. A drop in sink is a sink where\nthe hole is cut and the sink is actually dropped into the countertop and the\nfixture is installed on top of the sink. An undermount sink is a sink where the\nhole is cut in the countertop and the sink is actually mounted underneath your\ncountertop and the fixture is usually mounted on the countertop itself, and\nthen you have your apron front sink like we show over here. You've got this is an\napron front sink this happens to be fire clay but you can get them out of seeing\nthe steel or even the composite stone material. This is a great cool\nfarmhouse look. You can get some more contemporary you get some\nthat are hand-painted in France and very bougie. Which brings me to the three\ndifferent ways to undermount a sink. Your most typical way to undermount a\nkitchen sink is like this one right here where the cutout of the\nkitchen sink tends to line up with the cutout of the countertop and it's pretty\nmuch just a flush design. You can have your sink and your countertop cut so\nthat the edge is actually pulled away and you see a little bit of that lip all\nthe way around so that's called a positive reveal. You have your neutral\nveil which is the flush design you have the positive reveal, you also have a\nconcept called negative reveal and that's not very common in the kitchen\nit's a little more common in the bathroom and the way it looks is the\ncountertop is actually cut so it overhangs into the sink a little bit\nagain not very common in the kitchen but it does happen so these are\nconversations you want to make sure you have with your countertop fabricator\nbefore the sink goes in, because once that countertop is cut you're pretty\nmuch done. Now there are three ways to properly mount an apron front sink so\nwe've covered the three ways you can have the countertop reveal which is\nthat's one way is to undermount you can also bring it up so the countertop\nis going to be even with the edge of your sink such as in this installation\nright here you can actually bring it up so the countertop and the sink actually\nmeet up right here. It's not very common but I do see it from time to time where\nthe apron front she sticks up above your countertop. The\nfinal selection to make is whether or not you want to go with a single or a\ndouble bowl. A single bowl is great because you've got lots of space and you\ncan fit lots of things you don't have to worry about pot handles sticking up like\nthat, as opposed to a double bowl which is obviously not as spacious. There is a\nthird option in that category if you want to go something in the middle and\nthat is something with a low divide. A low divide gives you the option to lay\nthings flat but you also have a little bit of a divide if you really like to do\ndishes by hand. Some people prefer it, I'd rather say get a dishwasher that actually\nwashes the dishes. Thanks for hanging out with me today again my name is Dave.

"k2gpQgu5ow0": "welcome back to appliance educator today we're going to install an undermount kitchen sink so we have a countertop that's pre-cut the sink does come with a template and on this template it actually shows you where to mount all the hardware the hardware it comes with are these mounting brackets for the sinks so we'll show you how to install these guys the hardest part really for this install is to get the brackets um pre-drilled into the countertop and installed before we install the countertop though if you're doing like a brand new installation you want to make sure you put your sink inside the cabinetry and then install the counter on top of it that way you can work with the under mount sink if you're doing a top mount you need to worry about that or an apron front but for an under mount sink make sure you put your sink inside your cabinetry before you put your countertop on so aside from the included hardware we have a lot of these brackets we're going to be using 12 of these brackets around the frame of the sink we also have a drill with a drill bit the drill bit will be determined based on the material of your countertop so obviously if you have like a ceramic countertop you're going to use a glass drill bit if it's going to be concrete or stone you're going to use a diamond drill bit and so on so depending on the material of your counter that will determine the drill bit material itself you also want masking tape so the masking tape will come into play so we can get the depth needed on our drill bit for our brackets which you'll see later on you're also going to want a 2x4 that's wider than the sink opening and a clamp we have our drill bit and our tape we want to get our tape wrapped around our drill bit at the depth of this bracket that will be inserted into the stone so the tape is more of a guide to show how deep we don't want to drill like just eyeball it because you might just drill straight through your countertop especially depending on what type of material it is you don't really need that much tape but just enough to show that that's how much down we're gonna drill and that will allow enough room for this bit to rest inside the countertop so since this is small enough i'm going to flip this over and then drill into it so you can see what we're doing at this point if your countertop is installed you'll need to crawl underneath your sink or your vanity excuse me and drill it in so ideally this part will be done before your countertop is installed as well so this is what we're going to drill and this will be inserted in there the screw will screw in this bracket will rest on there you want to put it in a position where this can rest against the counter top and against the lip of the sink and the under mount again we have our drill bit which is taped off to the depth we want that way we don't exceed drilling through the countertop so without further ado let us drill for the bracket [Music] sweet so this won't just go right in there uh what we need to do is get an epoxy and we're going to adhere this with epoxy which we'll show you next and that will basically be the glue and the cement to keep this into the countertop and hold the weight of the sink we're going to repeat this step throughout to get all 12 of these bolted in the counter top and then we're going to flip this countertop back over get the countertop installed and we'll move on to installing the sink itself so we have our brackets pre-drilled installed with epoxy into the countertop kind of flipped over that's dried so we have our 2x4 and our clamp here the 2x4 is going to act as a support to hold up the sink that's where the cam comes into play as well so you have the drain hole for the sink the clamps going to go in through that and actually hold the sink up and against this 2x4 for support but right before we do that we need to put silicone on the edge of the sink because it's an undermount just to help adhere it to the countertop any further so let's go ahead and do that so we have our silicone here we're gonna run our silicone around the edge of the tire sink right before we adhere it to the bottom [Music] we're almost at our last step we get our brackets installed i think we need to get the sink adhered to the countertop that's where this comes into play so right now i'm going to get this through the drain of the sink get this guy brought up and attached to the 2x4 [Music] so we have our silicone set on our sink it's clamped in place tightened it so it's really adhered well to the countertop you want to let it sit here for about an hour obviously wiping off all the excess silicone underneath the sink and on the inside so you don't see any after that dries for an hour we'll go through and install our clamps and after that your sink is good to go to make it easier on us we've flipped over our camera cup the sink has dried and is essentially glued to the countertop itself and now we have to go around and install all of our brackets you want them to be installed just like this where they can hold on to the lip of the sink and the countertop itself if your countertop is small enough to flip it over that's probably gonna be the easiest way to do it if not you'll have to work underneath the counter and the sink to get this installed so we'll do this with every single bracket with this sink there are 12. so we got our sink installed under mount sinks are probably one of the more difficult and challenging things to install hopefully this video gave you the knowledge you need to go forward and install your own sync i always recommend to have a professional do it for you they've done it before they know what they're doing they'll have all the tools needed to do that most diy-ers might not have every tool needed to get this installed just to cover some of the things we did the sink itself we put a silicone bead around the top of it you want to let that rest i pressed against the countertop with the clamp like we showed before for no less than an hour that way the silicone can dry all the brackets that we installed with epoxy you might want to let that epoxy dry overnight just so it's solidified and almost like concrete please subscribe like and if you have any comments or questions just leave them down below", "L0OAODYYZx8": "hey guys Chelsea here from Mickey manzanita and today I am teaming up with LK to show you how to clean a quartz sink so you'll see here that I have a white quartz sink in my kitchen and one disadvantage of having a white sink is that it gets pretty dirty from time to time but the good thing about quartz inks is they are very easy to clean these are the supplies that you're going to need LK recommends bar keeper's friend soft cleanser a non abrasive scrubbing pad and Elka's rejuvenator polish first you want to start by covering your hands with gloves first you're going to take the bar keeper's friend soft cleanser shake well and rinse your sink thoroughly before starting then you'll take the bar keeper's friend soft cleanser and apply it all over the sink you want to be sure to get it on all four sides as well as the bottom [Music] then take your non-abrasive scrubbing pad and start scrubbing away be sure to focus on any areas that you see that may have any marks or extra grime buildup [Music] finish by rinsing well for any marks that don't come off easily with the bar keeper's friend a magic eraser will do the trick a magic eraser is also a great way for everyday stains you can just wipe them away as soon as you see them next dry the sink thoroughly before moving on [Music] finish by using L Ches quartz rejuvenator you want to apply this to your dry sink it's in a spray format and then you polish well be sure to cover up any areas that aren't quartz like I cover it up the drains there with a towel before spring to use the rejuvenator all you do is spray it on and then wipe off with a dry towel you want to use the rejuvenator to keep your quartz looking new and you only want to use it from time to time I would recommend using it when you do a deep cleaning on your sink like this one benefit to choosing a quart sink is that as is so easy to clean and maintain mostly because quartz is a non-porous material because of this most dirt and stains are gonna wipe away pretty easily from day to day if you keep your sink rinsed out when I'm doing dishes I always do a quick pass around the sink with a sponge and rinse well to keep it looking good if you want to learn more about quartz inks be sure to hop on over to our blog post the ultimate quartz sink guide there's a link in the notes below have a great day guys [Music]", "zwS5a9_GEkw": "hi guys it's Danielle from blissful and domestic and today i have a quick I don't know it's quick a video for you I realized it has been a ridiculously long time since I have done a what's up Monday video I started them probably when I first started my channel and I did a few of them and then I would just forget to do them or they would get busy or I would be like I don't know what to talk about but so I'd a few things actually did want to talk about this week so I said I'm gonna do what's up Monday videos so the first thing that I was gonna talk about is or say is thank you thank you thank you for all the support you guys have been offering the reviews on Amazon I have two reviews which is super stupid exciting like haha it's so fun to see how you guys are liking the book this literally is like a dream come true so it's really cool to see you guys purchasing the book loving it hopefully your libraries get it I know that the Henderson library they just put in a request I guess to get three so hopefully that goes through so that more people Henderson you guys don't have to buy it you guys will get it from the labor which i think is really awesome so and the cool thing is that you do not just have to be in the United States to get the book I know that Amazon UK and Amazon Canada they have it I know that I've seen it in some other places as well so I would definitely check your Amazon it seems like it's everywhere my name is on so I would check it it's in Kindle and paperback um of course I think I have a link to that below and I'll put it somewhere over here but so thank you thinking thank you again for all of your guys's support your love just everything it's awesome another thing I was going talk about is I posted an Instagram picture of these cute sandals like out of the first store and someone asked me if I had jamberry nail wraps mom which was awesome that you thought I had Miller outside but I did not so I thought I would share the nail polish ion I had it's called mint sorbet and it's hard as nails extreme where these are super and they're like a few dollars and then on top of it is just the mega rocks gold glitter I love this use this as a topcoat I seriously have had it on my toast for about three weeks and it has not chipped yet um okay I thought they were they do one video where they sneak up on me and they just think it's hilarious so that's why I have on my toes until last a really long time I don't have it on my nails right now I went a little patriotic but so it's kind of awesome nail polish and it's not very expensive so it's what I like because I do not go and get my nails done I just do my own and then another thing to other stories I was going to share is the first one is so earlier in the week it was really close to bedtime and we have cincy candle warmers in our bathroom and I have no whoo why he did this why he didn't do this but he I guess I guess you don't realize that whenever I oh my gosh how cute why should I you I mean chicken eater this is like the most adorable thing I've ever seen umm it's so cute it's like a little you see it's like a little family drawing how cute is that oh you know what Libby did it little card for her brother how stinking cute is that see little things you figure out when you go into your kids rooms oh you know what so once Libby was being really mean to her brother and I told her she had to think of a way to like do an act of kindness for him so this must've been the act of kindness that says I'm sorry Keegan I hope you forgive me I love you being my big brother oh sweet proud mommy moment and he has it pinned on his bulletin board thinking this out and my camera just so here we go bring it back bring it back okay but so anyway that was adorable back to the candle wax so we have Scentsy candles and it's like it needed to be replaced and I guess he didn't realize that when I replaced it I wait till I get started I just pop it out sometimes I will just pour it into the trash I know cool what he was thinking but he started pouring it down the drain and there was that moment I guess as he poured down the drain that he was like holy crap this is gonna become a Sullivan it cools and he didn't know what to do and he tried to like scrape some of the candle wax out of the sink and he clogged the drain and it was very sad thankfully we had a wire hanger and I was able to break down the candle expose it's definitely something we will look back and laugh at but I was like really anyone else had their kids do this there's some things down the drain you're like what are you doing and then that same night he was supposed to go into my room and get paper towels thank you do not we have not had a bug in our house in like forever like over a year like other than we sometimes get a little um please leafy bugs or we get little beetles in the house but like spiders really get roaches as we have not seen anything in like a year and that morning I found daddy long leg and I filled it in vacuumed up its all one thing that he decided to build in my bedroom like you and then that night he goes into my bathroom and he goes and like we have a window over our counter I'm I'm Kim guys this big like one of those flying roaches like first of all why do roaches have wings I don't know if those ones are called water bugs if they're a little bit different but that's like one of those things like me like Heavenly Father I don't know I'm sure you had a purpose but why why are we giving huge big bugs wings like if it's on a bird it shouldn't be flying No thank you anyway so this thing was so so huge was so disgusting and thankfully Jason was home and Jason was able to go kill it because I don't I would have been cordoning off that rumors thing I like I'm horrible at killing bugs like I almost have like read myself up too and I'm just really happy I didn't have to kill the one so those are kind of the things that have happened this week oh and we had I had the budgeting class in the Henderson library which was so awesome and I'm trying to set up with them to do some more classes in Henderson so if you missed that or if you live in the kind of Vegas area I'm gonna set up some more and Henderson I'm trying to work with Clark County Library which is the library or Las Vegas well I guess all put county but those are the libraries that are in high bit close above mapa um the library Center in Las Vegas so I'm trying to set up with them to do more budgeting classes so hopefully those that in the area and something that I can have more access tool to go to a class and stuff like that I also announce the date for my first online budgeting class and it's gonna be July 18th and 10:30 and it'll be a live event and for money they say I've never done a live event before this is really just a learning process we're gonna go through it together um really just my goal is I feel like everyone should be able to have access to free financial guidance and again I'm not a financial expert I do not have a degree in finances or business but I am a mom and a wife and I have basically learned the the things you need to do to live within your means and I feel like this is my ministry and a ministry for me my ministry veil to share and um you know the other the other night I had an experience where it was probably I think the day that my book came out so I think that was June 9th um we're around there give or take a few days it was around the time my book came out and I just was kind of I think I've been praying off and on like what do you have any father what do you want me to do with this blog and this YouTube channel like all this thickest budgeting stuff what do you want me to do with it and you know there's a part of me that is like well being else leave and Lena is like no big whatever but there's not a part of me who like wants to do more and be able to reach out to more people and I was just kind of when I was like you know what like it's up to you what you want me to do and I can't then was like okay want me to read the scriptures and the scripture I turned to was one in Matthew and it was you guys probably all heard it you know it's let your light shine before men so they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven I'm sure if I left out a word or two but that's the basis of it and the verse before that is about paraphrasing is that you know you wouldn't light a candle and cover it because you wouldn't see the light you light a candle you put it on a candlestick and I thought well isn't that like us and our talents is that God has given us all these amazing talents these amazing things that we can do and so what are we gonna do with them are we gonna hide our talents and not use them to serve Him and glorify Him but or are we gonna use them to do good and that was kind of I felt like he's answered to me like you know what you need to do I've already given you this answer but let me give it to you one more time and that you need to focus on this and there's so many people that you can help and it was and then like the next day I had a reader comment how how cool it was that this is my ministry and I just thought using the word ministry and you know you think of crisis ministry you know sharing the gospel and how important that was and how we all kind of have our own ministry that we're supposed to do and the message is we're supposed to sharing the good things we're supposed to do and so I'm super excited to be able so that this is really what I'm supposed to be dedicating my time to and so that was kind of my big spiritual moment this week but so I'm just I'm thankful for that and people for the encouragement that you guys give and every single comment it's it's crazy how some of those just answers to prayers and and really just those times when I'm like oh I'm tired or always anyone is anyone hearing this is anyone actually spending benefiting from this so I just went about my hair I'm so thankful thankful for this whole experience and that's the fact that you guys take time out of your day to be able to come and read my blog or watch the videos or the fact that you guys are spending your money they love my my book that's amazing and so thank you thank you thank you but so that's kind of what's happened this week and I just I love hearing what you guys are doing and so leave them in the comments below and if you guys like these videos I'll try to do more of them I did take some of your advice he's asked for day in the life and I did do one of them I need to just we're gonna edit it and I did do a what did we eat this week I think someone requested that too so I'll kind of edit those hopefully this week for next week and and get those on the channel and then if you guys like them we'll keep doing them um feel like it's kind of a learning process and I just it's fun like YouTube is like a hobby for me I just I love doing it and I love sharing and it's just been a really cool experience I feel like it's a really cool community I love that recently I was watching a video by Lydia you know I love Lydia from frugal debt life and she I think hit the nail on the head when she was like in YouTube is not just this way to become YouTube famous because really that happens for like three people YouTube is really a community and you know like-minded individuals be able to come together and encourage each other and that's what I love and so I love being able to share those videos and how do you guys share with your friends and family and stuff like that so I think that kind of wraps it up for today for this week's what's up Monday um let me know what you guys are doing it's been crazy out there let me know you guys the plans for this week I am so excited to I'm sorry I forgot it's okay you think um it's kind of fun here alright well I will I will get your 32 labs with you alright well I will talk to you guys later and if you need this channel hit that button subscribe and I was like two days later bye", "1KLWE_xdZ9o": "hey guys so as you can see we've had an incident with some wax for my candle warmer my son was shy and helped and made a bigger mess of classic mom life problems so I was trying to scrape it off and as you can see I have scratched my freaking wall making it worse thankfully is behind the toilet no one will see it but I think I have found a better way to get this cleaned off so I wanted to show you how I did that so all I have is a bowl of water I have some rags and I have a blow-dryer so I'm going to show you what I'm doing and tell you how I get all of this wax off without damaging any more walls or I does [Music] okay so as you can see worked really really well they do not have any more wax on my wall there's the spot I scraped flitch backing up thankfully can't see real bad but whatever but now way better what's on the wood baseboard the linoleum floor and the painted wall so pretty happy with that trick now we're gonna try it on the middle cam and I'm actually gonna switch over to using paper towels just because I have nice to burn but you sent like to throw out those rags once you use them so I'm going to see if it works on this [Music] nobody worked really well too so this is definitely the way to do it in my opinion all right guys well I hope this was helpful and that you learned how to clean up after your kids are trying to help you clean up and that this hopefully you never have to use this trick with your kids or maybe if you're clumsy like me you'll do it yourself and have to use it on yourself but anyway hope you all have a great thing [Music]", "i8IpDdwu8f0": "[Music] now to my way of thinking this is a perfectly good granite countertop on the kitchen island and the thought of putting a hole in it it makes me kind of shudder but that's exactly what my wife Lynn wants me to do she says that because we have the oven the cooktop the microwave the dishwasher in the sink all clustered over here in this corner that we create an enormous traffic jam and she's asked me to put a prep sink down in the far end of the island now I resisted this idea for quite some time but then being the smart husband that I am and knowing that I have an anniversary coming up I've decided to send her off to the spa for the day and surprise her Greg Pia a third generation stone cutter has agreed to do the surgery he's using a diamond-tipped blade the water cools and lubricates the blade and helps keep the dust down step one is to cut out the four sides of the opening next Greg makes angle cuts at each corner leaving only small bits of the stone holding the cut out section in place [Music] then he attaches a suction handle gives the stone a few taps with a dead low mallet and out comes a rather hefty chunk of granite to finish the opening he switches to a smaller tool and extends the cuts as far into the corner as possible that done the remaining corner pieces break away with a couple of taps [Music] a little grinding removes the final bit of granite from the corners now I can remove the dam that kept the water from flooding the countertop well this is the ultimate test to find out if that hole is the right size and in the right location here's my new sink I'm going to drop it in it fits and the hole is just slightly oversized which is exactly the way we want it with the sink in position I lower a plumb bob through the center of the drain hole and Mark the location directly beneath then using an extra-long drill bit I bore through the bottom of the cabinet and into the basement below well I'm down in the basement and here's where the drill came through right here that's the center of the sink opening and actually I'm in pretty good shape because I have a cold water line right here a hot water line here and a drain right over here so everything is in fairly close proximity because I've put in shutoff valves for the kitchen and laundry room I don't have to turn the water off of the entire house the first step in tapping into the existing water supply is to cut the copper lines with a small pipe cutter that works very well in tight quarters like these [Music] then I make a second slice and actually remove a small section of pipe this will give me the space I need to install the t fittings I'll be putting in shortly I'm sanding the pipe to remove any surface dirt and oxidation this is the first step in getting a watertight solder joint with the pipe clean I next apply soldering flux this paste helps the solder flow evenly and promotes a good bond with the metal the inside of the fittings also needs cleaning and this I do with a metal brush made just for the purpose once I'd finished the cleaning I coat the fitting with flux too now I can slip the pieces together [Music] now I'm turning my attention to the drain slicing through this guy calls for a substantially bigger pipe cutter for this project I'm removing about a foot of pipe the new drain line will be PVC plastic pipe that's glued or welded together I first apply a purple primer to both the fitting and the pipe followed by an application of PVC cement now a good rule of thumb when applying the primer and cement is to make three complete rotations while the surfaces are still wet I slip them together give them a slight twist and hold them for a few seconds if I don't hold them securely the pipe and fitting can actually push away from each other this why assembly will allow the new sink drain to join the existing drain line these couplings are what some plumbers call mission clamps first I slide on the metal band then lubricate the pipe with dishwashing detergent and slip on the rubber sleeve the dishwashing detergent acts like a lubricant and will not deteriorate the rubber once I have the WHI assembly in place I pull the rubber sleeves over the joints slip on the clamps and tighten them up [Music] this perforated copper hanging strap will help support the drain taking any strain off the coupling now I'm back upstairs drilling the holes for the water supply lines this long shaft spade bit is the perfect tool for this next I move on to the drain here I'm using a two inch hole saw with a shaft extension I'm doing the best I can to make sure the drill bit stays as vertical as possible now I need to put in the run of pipe that will connect the drain and the water supply lines to the sink I want to do a dry fit first to make sure that all the pipe is cut to the proper length then I'll go back and cement or solder it in place [Music] before I disassembled the pieces I make reference marks so that I can put them back together in the same position then I glue the assembly together [Music] attaching one end to the riser that goes into the kitchen cabinet and the other to the Y in the drain [Music] finally I check to make sure there is a gradual downward slope to the drain now I can fit the copper pipe together [Music] for this project I'm using pre soldered fittings the solder is already inside all I have to do is add heat when things get hot enough the solder liquefies and begins to flow out of the joint you can see it here and here all the connections are made in the basement the pipes are all coming up into the cabinet now I have to add some fittings on this end and then I can start on the sink first I'm installing what's called a sanitary tee the sink drain will attach to this later above the teego's event and at the bottom a trim escutcheon next I cut off the water lines install escutcheons on these slip on the shutoff valves and tighten the compression fittings with a wrench with the heavy part of the plumbing done I've taken a break and gone to the Home Improvement Center to pick up my new faucet now I only have one rule when it comes to putting fittings and fixtures on a sink and that is I attach everything I possibly can to the sink before I drop it into the opening I always love modeling clay as a kid and this is about as close as I can get to it in home improvement it's plumber's putty a mixture of oil and minerals like limestone and clay plumbers buddy has been around for ages it seems to last forever and it's what I use to seal the seat basket to the sink itself on the underside of the sink I place a rubber seal an anti friction fiber washer and the lock nut this Basin nut wrench has only one purpose in life and this is it with the basket snugly in place I lift off the excess plumber's putty here's my new faucet to install it I dropped the water lines through the hole flip the sink over slip out a mounting plate screw on a nut and then tighten it up using a plastic socket that came with the faucet set next I passed the flexible sprayer hose through the center of the faucet and connect it on the underside now if you've ever tried to put all these fittings on a sink after it's in place you'll appreciate exactly how much easier it is to do it this way I'm ready to drop this in the opening now I just need to put some silicone sealant around the edge [Music] this type of sink drops in from the top and is called self the watertight seal around the edge comes from the silicone and these clamps on the bottom side that pull the seat down into firm contact with the countertop when they're tightened to make the last few hookups on the drain I attach this tail piece to the bottom of the sink basket slip on the p-trap and connect everything to the drain system [Music] on the water supply side all I have to do is screw on the lines from the faucet snug them up with a wrench and turn on the water keep your eyes down the floor only well you've been out luxury in the spa yes which I'm glad you did I've been hard at work here okay every eyes so this is something you've been wanting for a while you go ahead take a look oh my god Wow oh my prep sing thank you so much honey right Wow wowie this is

something with me Deborah to toe and today we're going to take the sprayer and turn it into a dish soap dispenser check a while back I replace the faucet on the sink and it has one of these guys on there so this is no longer needed we're going to take this out and we're going to get a little squirter Deeley doodad and we're going to mount it in there then we're going to have a tube run to the bottom with a big endless container of dish soap so let's head to the store and go get in supply bed that's beyond I got the main item for the pump I'm going to take this guy right here and then we're going to go to Home Depot go tube so let's put design that's what we need right here [Music] all right so we have this guy from Bed Bath & Beyond we're going to take that out and that little tube right there is going to be replaced with that little tube fits in there the brush metal matches which is cool so what I don't want it way down here so I want it to stick up about right here so I'm just going to turn oh what is that three inches er yes exactly and so we're going to insert a piece of wood in there so let's head down into the shop and turn this on the lathe their range is exactly have this leftover piece of coconut palm we're going to cut this up and then spin it on the lathe Wow [Music] [Music] oh I need to create a little I need a Creole I need to create a little things for this thing to go into we need to drill a little hole to allow this think that you know in saying [Music] using some normal CA glue and we're going to apply to a paper towel same way you do a pen [Music] [Applause] [Music] that super glue will give it a nice super waterproof coat I don't want to ruin my finish so I got this little guy in there and this little guy technical terms just look up little guy on Amazon this worst Chuck ever made that on camera because it should be drilling into endgrain it's some tough stuff there's a little threaded insert on there trying to figure out a way to attach it to that I think I'm going to take a little chisel or some sandpaper knock off the edge just kind of give it a little chamfer and then five-minute epoxy it right in there just coconut palm is

installed we're going to just fold this out of here that wasn't doing anything and we can feed this tube down in there if you were going to do this correctly you would use some silicon silicon silicon silicon you would use some goopy stuff in here to seal that because you don't want water in there I've already been to Home Depot once today I ain't doing it again so we'll fix that later now we got

"ifRlSywn4FI": "okay so let me tell you about this sink well rather the material this is called silgranit silver and sol Granite's has only made by Blanco it's a 80 percent natural stone so so Granite's compasses we take the granite granite dental pulp we mix it with the color silicone as compression molded so we can make it any shape we like with these nice curves and nice design features now I'm sure your white one which is voted 10 different colors and many different designs so let's talk about cleaning cleaning a sink what more people will talk about is water marks and staining so this is got several lines of defense the first one is how the surface deals with water so if I put a little bit of water here you'll see what I mean I'll lay that on there take that away if we watch this you'll see immediately that water seems to bead up and run off so very quickly that surface is clear of water that's going to stop the water laying on the surface and building up your water marks what we suggest is ones you used to sing give it a quick wipe over and that will keep it nice and clean now hard this staining let me show you how hard this is who as thin is still fork if you were to do this on many other types of sink you would damages if you drop that into the bottom prongs down like this very easily cushioned damage to the surface and I'm going to show just how tough this is watch this so I'm really putting some pressure on this this is a normal stainless steel fork now those marks there that's the stainless steel at the end of the fork so I'm actually wearing away the end of the fork the sink is harder than 1810 steel so any normal activity so fix Japan in the bowl marks you see here I consider that normal use if your sink can't stand that then you shouldn't buy it so keeping it clean will show you how to remove these marks here's a pan scrub a little bit of water give it a rub now most of that's gone already but because I've abused it I'm gonna use a cleanser this case I'm gonna use a cream cleanser thus if could be any type you're not being tied into a special product let's just give that a quick rub with that cream cleanser it's got a slight abrasive action to it there we are that's pretty much off now and as I say I've use that fork which it wouldn't normally expect to use in normally they'll use their well that's gone back to normal most like this quick rub that's the sort of material you need in a kitchen and remember I was showing you on a white sink it is about with 10 different colors and many different designs so let's talk about staining people always worry about tea coffee red wine that sort of products now let me just try this surface off always think it's easier to stain something when it's dry it's not protected by the water so that's dry let me show you this this is beetroot juice lethal in the kitchen that touches anything wood knife handles material stains and you've lost it let's put some of that on our nice white sink there we are now if you did have an accent in the kitchen and you have a spillage like this hopefully you're going to spot it you're gonna clean it up and minimize the damage problem comes when you don't know you've done it so for example put something down like that you leave it overnight come back you've got the dreaded ring red wine coffee that's all material now this is beetroot juice so I'm going to do that give us some rings a little bit of problem to deal with excellent okay now the other product everyone talks about is curry with some curry paste here this is concentrated it's got tumeric heads they're lovely yellow Indian spice let's put some of that on there onto this nice white sink and leave that to Jordan off for us okay now just remind you there's no special coatings no surface if you take a cross-section of the sink it's the same all the way through there's no surface to wear off or deteriorates over time good now coming over to this side we're talking about use in the kitchen food preparation not just washing up and as you'd expect is 100% kitchen safe by which I mean if you wanted to give the chef's nice stainless steel take this carrots and a cut on the surface there even that's soaring action there we are now don't suggest that you do that purely because you're gonna blunt your knife they always suggest that you cut on wood but I wanted to show you the qualities of the material so for example those marks they're little soft cloth give that a white that's completely gone excellent let's come back over to this side here now yes as you can see this Betelgeuse is now dried on so that's dried beetroot juice on this white surface how we're gonna clean that I'm not gonna use a pan scrub I'm not going to use the cleanses you can use some cold water a little dribble it's a lot of jets it's a cold water gonna put that straight on there as you can see that lifts that straight off so if you look here it's dried on beetroot juice I put some water on that that lifts that straight off the surface you go to the curry paste a little bit more water now that mark you see there that's what everyone dreads at Yellowstone there isn't one that's Kong one because it's greasy you just need to cut that grease I'm gonna use this you could use any material washing up liquid anything to cut the grease sponge straight on there give that a quick twist that's gone so that's dried on beetroot juice and concentrated curry paste with turmeric sink deals with that no problem and lastly talk about food preparation imagine the cooking is on the gas electricity or boiler vegetables boiling pasta you want to strain it into your sink no problem at all there's an added benefit you can actually place your pan directly onto the sink without any fear of damage in fact is heat resistant to 280 degrees that's the sort of material one in the kitchen and I remember I've showed you white one which is about in 10 different colors and many different designs including under mounted inserts and over supernodes thank you", "qvOLmu255y8": "hey guys this is shannon with nearly organic noshing and do you have a granite composite sink does it look like this and you want it to look like this we'll stick around and i will show you all the tips and tricks i've learned in the last three years to keep my sink looking great for longer now my sink looks awful right now you know the last time i did my sink that i cleaned it and detailed it and oiled it thanksgiving guess what it has been almost a year since i have really really really gotten in there and really given my sink a good detailed scrubbing cleaning oiling and all that and yeah it doesn't look too too hot right now but used to in a month or two after cleaning my sink in days it would start looking like this you'd see the white you see the scale so let me empty my sink out and i will show you the process that i have found to keep my sink looking not like this but like this okay guys my sink is all clear i've taken everything out of it and off of it and you can see just how it looks right now you can see the white you can see that it just looks really grungy and i admit i have just been giving it quick wipe downs and it has had so much alcohol in it it is unbelievable with the covet stuff right now i throw my items into the sink and then i have a spray bottle of alcohol which i then spray everything down so there has been so much alcohol sprayed in the sink which has dried it out even more that it is just ridiculous but i'm going to show you what i have learned and how to keep it looking spectacular for so much longer than it ever has in the past and this is all you need people left comments in my comment section in the last video which i will link up in the corner about how they use vegetable oil they use olive oil they use crisco they use all the stuff maybe you can use that stuff but i know a lot of oils go rancid and mineral oil doesn't so it is something that you can use that is food grade it is safe and i am sticking with mineral oil some people put car polishes and stuff like that probably okay but i wash my vegetables in my sink i wash my dishes i just don't want anything like that on my food or any residue so this is what i am sticking with um vinegar and baking soda the combination gets down in the grooves be when i'll show you how i cover my sink literally cover my sink and this stuff and really get in there and scrub it really really well so be generous when you're doing it don't put just a tiny little bit a good toothbrush and you know an old toothbrush or whatever and then another scrub brush and you're going to need some soft cloths and of course the real standout of the show is the mineral oil so let me go ahead and get the camera set up and start cleaning okay so i have my sink all empty and now i'm going to take my baking soda and i am literally going to put it everywhere now when i actually start scrubbing i'll speed up some but then if you really want to see a detailed scrub of how you literally get every nook and cranny you can go to my previous video but that was one of the complaints in the video is that nobody wanted to see me scrub my whole sink so i am not going to make you watch me scrub my whole sink so it is covered in baking soda now and this is just a little squirt bottle with vinegar i use this in my dishwasher and stuff like that it just makes it easier so i'm going to start just adding in the vinegar and you can see what the vinegar does it'll start fizzing and foaming and you can get it all around the edges so i'm going to do this and start scrubbing okay guys when you have it good and scrubbed one time give it a rinse down and do it again because by doing it this method you're not going to have to do it as often so make sure you get it really good and clean and that you didn't miss any places and everything is all scrubbed out so take the time now just to go ahead and give it a second scrub down before moving on to the oiling step your sink is nice and scrubbed you've gotten all your nooks and crannies and everything is scrubbed out now is a good time to refill your soap dispenser to take the screen out of here and clean your screen if you've not done that in a while to scrub out your garbage disposal get those flaps really really well when you're cleaning and you can throw one of those garbage disposal tabs down there or you can throw some ice and lemons and refresh in your garbage disposal great idea to go ahead and do all of that kind of stuff while you're cleaning your sink now's a good time just to knock it all out so now we're going to dry all right well your sink is dry and as you can see all those pesky white streaks are coming back clean sink but you can still see the white shrinks so what you need to do now is get your mineral oil i like to use a paper towel just because this is going to get so saturated and i want to just be able to throw it away when i'm done and you are going to coat your sink and i mean coat your sink do a nice layer i mean you don't want oil dripping down your drain but give it a really good thick coat of oil make sure you get all the edges up under the edges make sure you wipe your faucet and your nozzles and everything down and that everything has a really really thick coating of oil on it all right your sink should look like this see how shiny it is it has a very thick coating of oil over the whole sink now the way we figured this out that it has literally been thanksgiving last year the last time i really really did this with my sink i did it before we had all the family over for thanksgiving because of course everything wants to look lovely and chris had mentioned why don't you let the oil sit for a while and maybe it'll sink in because the granite composite sinks are porous so maybe if the oil really sinks in and sits on it for a while that it will last longer and it did our lives took a crazy turn right after thanksgiving chris had health issues in and out of the hospital the kids had health issues life has been crazy we have not had family functions here because of covid and all that so i wasn't overly concerned with my sink and i was looking at it and thinking oh it's looking pretty bad i really need to get in there and do my sink and then i stopped and thought when was the last time i really really did more than just a wipe down on my sink and it was last thanksgiving i couldn't believe it i i was sitting there thinking have i done it since then no i haven't so it seems like the key here is to let the oil just sink in let it sit go do a couple loads of laundry go scrub your bathroom cook dinner whatever give it like an hour and then come back and buff it out and you will be amazed at the results i mean it's been almost a year since i have done my sink and you saw what it looked like before and my sink used to look like that in weeks after cleaning it before i mean it was just immediately the white would start coming through if i didn't oil it and then once i oiled it it might last a month two months you know just depending on how much cooking and stuff i was doing but when you let it really sit and sink in you will be shocked at how great it's going to look and how long it will last now i will say this if you have a soap dispenser like this or you use vinegar in your sink it is going to strip that oil away faster what i used to do in the past is where it was just getting a white streak i would just get a little bit of oil and wipe it right there instead of doing my whole sink if i was in a hurry if you know we gotta call oh company's gonna be here in an hour and i look at the sink and i'm like oh yeah no just put a little bit of oil touch it up no problem but like i said it's been three years since i did the previous video and i have been oiling my sink and doing it like this for three years but it's just been in this last year that i realized that if you let the oil sit and just stay on there a nice good coating of it you're gonna have amazing results so i am gonna go start pulling things for dinner and switch a couple loads of laundry and then i'll come back in an hour or so and buff this out and just a little tip while you are waiting for your oil to sink in take that cloth and that oil and instead of using this which this was always my go-to and it is expensive i want to say it's like five dollars a can or so at our local walmart that is what i used to use on all of my stainless steel now i spray my appliances down with alcohol first to clean them and then i go back with the mineral oil over it and it gives a great shine you don't have all the fingerprints if something spills wipes right off and it's so much cheaper than using this and i still have a little bit of this in the pantry and if companies coming or something i might just do a quick wipe down but on the whole i go for the mineral oil it's just so much less expensive and works as well and you can use it on anything that is stainless steel in the kitchen okay guys the oil has been sitting for over an hour so i am going to go ahead and start buffing it out and just getting off any excess and buffing out the stainless and just making it look really good guys here is the finished product the sink looks great you can actually see the reflection in the back of the sink from the uh the drains there it is so shiny but it is not all thick you know it's all been buffed out the key is letting it sit for a while so take the time to use the ingredients um the mineral oil to go ahead and clean your fridge your dishwasher your toaster your coffee pot whatever you have stainless steel while you're sitting and waiting it waiting for it to uh to soak in and this is cheap this is easy and it has lasting results like i said my last video was three years ago i have been using this method of vinegar baking soda and mineral oil for

going to talk about Mr directs line of bamboo apron sinks so let's jump in and talk about all the benefits and unique features of bamboo bamboo is 100% natural and extremely sustainable to grow to make an mr direct apron sink the outer portion of the bamboo stalk is removed and cut into long strips the strips are then layered to form the shape of the sink then they're sanded and laminated to make sure they're perfectly smooth and beautiful bamboo is also naturally waterproof so it's an ideal material for a busy kitchen when it comes to strength and durability bamboo is harder than red oak and maple work and it also has greater compression strength than steel but you won't compromise on beauty one thing to keep in mind is that apron sink models require a custom cabinet so we recommend working with a professional to ensure that your cabinetry seamlessly fits your apron scene go strong and durable bamboo has a beautiful and delicate finish that you'll want to preserve so when it comes to the care and maintenance of your bamboo apron sink use a soft sponge and mild soap for routine cleaning we also recommend scrubbing your bamboo seat with a mixture of 1 ounce of white vinegar to 1 quart of water never use ammonia based cleaners or other harsh chemicals because they will soften the finish of the bamboo aside from routine cleaning mr Direct offers various accessories that will help keep your sink looking beautiful for years to come due to the organic nature of the sink we include one custom-fit stainless steel bid with every bamboo apron sink they feature rubber feet and sit in the bottom of the sink basin to add an extra layer of protection the grit prevents utensils or pots and pans from damaging the bamboos finish and doubles as an elevated space where you can leave your dishes to dry in addition to secrets mr direct also offers stainless steel strange to protect your drinks if you have a garbage disposal you will not need a strainer but if you don't have a garbage disposal we offer a basket strainer to protect your dreams and help with meal prep bamboo is an all-natural and sustainable material that is sure to transform your kitchen into a beautiful eco-friendly space thanks for watching I'm Eric Dunaway with Mr directs inks in [Music]", "dME4_6Km9gU": "hey guys today I'm gonna teach you a little trick that can help you remove wax from objects like this which are not easy to clean in the sink with hot water which is usually the best way to remove wax from something this is a piece of metal that is kind of like lodged on to the wall on a gigantic thing and cleaning it would be a big pain in the bum so if you have a little concentrated area of stuff plaques like this here is what you're going to do and it seems kind of counterintuitive this comes from using a candle that does not have excuse my own nails this comes from having a candle that does not have like a protective barrier around it I just put the candle there which looks really pretty but then that happens and it's annoying you kind of need something like this and if something like that happens then you really need something like that because that is the key to getting rid of that this has already begun to melt because I've started one earlier so I could show you how it works this was completely stuck on here before so you take this little candle here and you simply set it down in the middle and just burn it you know just just burn it like a regular candle and then you come back to it and you will see that your wax has been completely loosened up and can easily be removed so when something happens like this and you get wax on something that is stuck onto a wall or something that is large and kind of awkward just put a little candle surrounded by plastic in the middle and the heat will loosen it up and you can just clean that right off okay guys I have to turn the camera back on because I guess that an epic fail as I was taking a paper towel and cleaning off the wax I dropped it here and it landed all on top of the spare car keys so this is even worse Oh No total fail alright guys if you use this tip just make sure that you protect whatever is underneath you and just clean off the wax dang it", "Lg3aYZqKF-Q": "if you've got a foul odor coming from the kitchen and you're pretty sure it's coming from the sink area I'm gonna give you a couple of places to check you may just need to clean the drain it's pretty simple and in this video I'm gonna show you how to do that don't forget to subscribe turn on notifications let's go change and get this done come on odors coming from your kitchen sink are a pretty common thing and we get questions about it all the time now before you call a plumber or a drain cleaner to come out and take a look there's a few things that you can try yourself to try and clean and get rid of the odor number one is obvious as it might seem make sure the dishes are done clean the dishes and then see if you're still smelling an odor now if you are still smelling an odor the second thing you want to try is actually some baking soda and vinegar put baking soda down the drain followed by some vinegar let it set for a few minutes and then follow that with some boiling water the next thing you want to check is if you have a garbage disposal make sure that you don't have food still in the garbage disposal and make sure to check up under the black rubber piece make sure there's no food and things stuck up underneath give that a good cleaning if you need to we have a different video about cleaning the garbage disposal so I'm not gonna go in-depth in this video about how to do that if you've tried all those things the next place to look is actually under the sink I'm going to show you how to clean the drains underneath there if you've got a double basin sink and a garbage disposal it'll probably look very similar to what you're looking at here you'll have a line coming off of the garbage disposal going into the main drain that leads to a p-trap that connects to the main drainage system of the home if you're having odors from the drain more than likely it's coming from these pipes that are before the p-trap because the p-trap is designed to keep sewer odors from coming back into the home water settles in the bottom of it and creates a barrier to keep the sewer gases from coming up the drains over time as you pour grease fats oils and other food down the drain they can collect on the walls of the drain and overtime produce a sour decomposing smell before you start taking these pipes apart pay attention to how they go together it's a good idea to take a picture so that you can reassemble it the way that you take it apart so this piece goes to my reverse osmosis system it's a drain that can sometimes get plugged up with food particles this is the drain hose from your dishwasher if you see a lot of food particles in the drain from the dishwasher you may want to clean that out as well now you're gonna want a bowl or a bucket or some type of container to catch the water that's in the bottom of the p-trap so we're gonna take these apart clean them and put them back together take a paper towel clean out the drain like a pipe cleaner that'll get most of it off and then we'll clean these in the sink you can use a toothbrush or a sponge or whatever you can find to clean the inside of the pipes you can use warm soapy water or if you have a favorite cleaner you can spray that inside and you are reassembling the pipes you want to dry fit them together first don't tighten anything down until you're sure that you've got everything where it goes pay attention to the direction that the washers need to go fatter part is up at the top of the connector and it's made so that it tapers down into whatever pipe you're putting it back on once you have everything assembled it's a good idea to dry underneath the pipes so you can easily see if there's any drips we want to test and make sure that there are no leaks so we're gonna fill both sides of the sink and let the water drain and look for signs of water if you do find a drip double check and make sure that your connections are tight I actually forgot to tighten this one if you end up with no drips of everything back together call it good well as long as you're careful and pay attention to how the drains come apart and put it back together make sure you check for leaks you should be okay this is something you can totally do yourself now after you go through and do all of those steps if you're still having an odor that you're smelling you may need to call a plumber or a drain technician to come out because it's possible you have an issue with the venting or something something more because if you've got you may even need like a whole house like jetting like a pipe jetting of a single line kitchens or the most common lines to have pipe jetted but hopefully all the things that we just did solves your problem and you got rid of the odor thanks so much for watching don't forget to subscribe turn on notifications leave me a comment below let us know the other videos you'd like us

is going to be how I put my sink to bed at night so in other words my nighttime routine for cleaning my sink I call it putting the sink to bed because that is what mrs. hinge calls it if you're not familiar with her she is a cleaning queen on Instagram you should definitely go over to her page and give her a follow if you're interested in cleaning tips because she is obsessed with cleaning and she does such a good job she's also a mental health advocate and just a really beautiful person so today I'm gonna borrow her nighttime cleaning routine for cleaning the think this is a very thorough clean of the sink that I aim to do about once a week all of the products that we're gonna be using today are as follows fabric softener a stainless steel cleaner baking soda lemon vinegar Lysol or bleach some kind of disinfectant and a scrubber to scrub the sink out the first step is to put fabric softener in the sink two capfuls full for each sink and then pour boiling water or extremely hot water in the sink and let that sit for four hours the fabric softener makes it really easy to remove all the dirt at the end of this process but it does take a while to sit in the sink the benefit of this is your whole home smells amazing I really recommend this seventh-generation fabric softener because it uses natural fragrance and this is a lavender fragrance and my husband said it smelled amazing when he came in the door and I think it just puts everyone in a really calm sleepy mood so a great thing to do at night [Music] Alexa set a timer for four hours please [Music] so after this had sat for four hours I removed the water and I took a look at the drain the drain was particularly gross after this process and so I grabbed a brush that I have in my cleaning closet I had meant to use this on my retainer but I never did and I thought maybe it would be good for cleaning so it's just a denture brush and I'm gonna use that and a little bit of Lysol and see if I can clean out just that really a wee gooey part in there I'm not super concerned because really I never put anything down there that's not just permanently going to go down there but just in case a fork goes down there and touches it your sink is actually one of the most Germans in your whole house believe it or not after I disinfected the sink I spray the disinfectant all over the sink and I'm just using a plain kitchen brush to scrub out the rest of the sink and then give it a good rinse afterwards [Music] now I'm going in with this Wyman or Wayman stainless steel cleaner this stuff is really good it also smells really nice and it's not a disinfectant or anything it's just going to make this thing shine up nicely and so I'm going to spray that liberally all over the sink including the top handle and it really made a huge difference in the aesthetic of the sink it's so shiny now and I haven't had this shiny in a long time now I'm gonna go in and actually clean the garbage disposal and this is something I'm going to let sit overnight I'm going to use baking soda they say to use about half a small box of baking soda so I'm going to use about 10 of these small scoops and pour it right down the garbage disposal we rent this house this is an hour sink but we know from the owners that this garbage disposal is not very robust so we hardly ever put large items down here but I am going to follow this up with some cleaning vinegar and then I'm going to put in a few very narrow slices of lemon and squeeze the lemon juice right in there this combination will give it a nice scent and sitting overnight will break down some stuff in the sink itself and then in the morning I'm going to turn on the garburator and run hot water down there for a good 5 minutes [Music] so there we have it the sink is looking all shiny and new again and ready to go to bed I hope that you guys enjoyed this short cleaning video if you'd like to see more of these types of videos please let me know in the comments and I will see you in the next video thanks so much for watching bye for now [Music]", "701UoJ5pgeo": "hi I'm Johanna Cahill I own healthy home cleaning based in Asheville North Carolina and we specialize in green natural and non-toxic cleaning today we're going to be talking about how to clean stainless steel sinks and get those rust rings out of there for you so today we're going to be using just any kind of scrubby brush that you might have around with nice stiff bristles on it I've got a couple lemons here if you wanted to you could also use lemon juice the kind that you get out of the grocery store in the little tube container baking soda and a pumice stone which you can buy any hardware store they're fairly cheap usually about a dollar and vinegar which is also really cheap and you might have it underneath your counter or you can purchase it at your local supermarket so we're going to start with our baking soda which is a mild abrasive that we can use to get this rust out of the inside of the sink so you're going to want to go ahead and sprinkle it in and then we can go ahead and add some of this lemon for the acidity cleaning power of lemons sprinkle that over you're going to hear a fizzing then we're going to get some more fizz here with our vinegar kind of like that fifth grade volcano project mmm and then we're going to take our scrubber we're going to go ahead and scrub all over the areas where you have rust in your sink a lot of times that's right around the drain so go ahead and get that really good some muscle into it so if you have a really difficult rusting and you're just having trouble using your muscle to get it off then you can use a pumice stone you just go ahead and dampen the end of your pumice stone right here and then focus on the area that's really difficult go ahead and scrub that on there you'll see a little bit of that residue from the pumice stone coming off on the inside of your sink and that should really do the trick it works pretty well you're going to go ahead and distressing clean rust-free sink this is Johanna Cahill from healthy home cleaning and I want to thank you for watching how to remove rust from

"idnven7Y5jA": "[Music] see you're at home this weekend you want to get something done I'm gonna go work on the car work on some remodeling trim your window but instead your sinks clogged what are you gonna do call plumber you're gonna watch this video see if maybe it'll work for you all right it's with a bit of a situation here I have a plug I have a plug drain that is the garbage disposal that is where the drain goes out into the normal drainage of the house and both sides are plugged you know a lot of times you'll see this side plugged in that side draining fine because the pathway from the garbage disposal to the normal drain gets blocked and you have to clear out that pathway if both of them are plugged then you could potentially have an issue with your p-trap setup down here this off to the side I've already been working on this a little bit but here's my garbage disposal I did disconnect my dishwasher because I want to minimize my variables that I have going on here so that is makeshift disconnected and plugged off right now and I checked all these lines so both are plugged which means this this pathway is clear and I've already actually been in here and I know this is all plug so I have an issue in my wall no I've already fished a 25-foot drain cleaner auger whatever you want to call them into that hole you never want to do it from the top on either side and try and fish you're just going to put a lot of pressure on these pipes so all of this has to be removed so I can get a clear shot at going in here but I went to Home Depot and rented a 50-foot one and that's what I'm going to use right now to try and clear this drain out every other drain in the house is working fine this one is not so I need to figure figure this out now when you disconnect these fittings you're going to want to make sure that you have a bucket down below they come it's gonna spray because there's a little bit of pressure on the line above you have to be aware that the amount of water that's gonna be flowing I know that I don't have enough water up there to totally fill my bucket it was gonna be close but as I was testing my situation I was just making sure that I didn't I didn't go to too far in terms of filling the sink up where it would exceed a bucketful because then I would have to fill up a bucket tighten everything up go dump it and then fill up a bucket more so when you're troubleshooting just be aware of you know how much water you're using and get yourself in a situation where you're you know not having to make too much of a mess it does make a mess that's water water is awful they got the baby not this is the p-trap it's clear it's clear there's nothing in the p-trap so I know that's not the issue I'm gonna set this off to the side over here I have to disconnect this as well this has got to be disconnected this is where I'm gonna go added with the with the auger this is Russian fitting there a little bit but now now I can get right at that disgusting pipe you know this is a drain sorry folks this is this is uh this is how we live this is how everybody was just disgusting now I can get right at that pipe with the with the auger and go right down there without putting too much stress on these less rigid pipes here so I'm gonna come back at you after I get this bucket out of the way like I said I've already been and already been through here with with the 25-foot auger and that didn't solve my problem so no I'm gonna I'm gonna go out this one with a 50 footer so I'm gonna get this started so here's what's happened here's what happens with these uh if you get to a point where there's a bend in the pipe and there's inevitably gonna be bends in the pipes you're gonna have to what you do is you end up tightening this and what helps you get past the bend is you tighten that you put some pressure on the line you want to have some slack going and then you you turn this crank and then that will help kind of it'll help kind of twirl and twist this and get it or get it around whatever angle it's encountered and help you keep going with what the pathway that you're trying to clear all right now here's what I'm doing along the way I'm quite a ways into this but I'm stuck on another Bend but you don't want to be too far off the pipe so if you have to start turning it to get it to go so if you have to start turning it into another another corner this is what you do there I just cleared another bed so stuck so this is what the crank is for you lock that and then you spin it and it'll turn that inside the inside the pipe and you know clean the pipe and you know auger it out you want to be somewhat aggressive but not too aggressive and you're gonna have to be careful when you take it out as well all right now I went in about as far as I feel comfortable going I know I'm Way in there with it so I'm gonna start pulling this backhoe and I probably was maybe six feet shy a couple coils I probably called pulled about two coils back already but this is one of those deals that if this doesn't do it all right we're a moment of truth I got this all all comes back up here I ended up having to take this one off too just so I could really get in there with that Hager and get a good grip on it that time after you redo these you're gonna want to make sure that you you watch those fittings and make sure that there's no leaks a good way to do that is to slide a paper towel there you know maybe double layer it come back every half hour or an hour and just make sure that you know you're not gonna get any leaks but you know yeah at the moment of truth right now they solved my problem right or I didn't see this is either gonna fill up with water well it's gonna keep draining I don't know keep in mind both sides were filling up before it took a while okay so got my problem maybe not so that 50 feet I must have been close or at least close to shoving it past the line because and back at you here and to be honest I was standing over in my living room having a bit of a wall was in the moment and I heard the drain release and the water went down so out of all 50 feet I must have been close or whatever was down there I was shoving to a greater opening that allowed this kind of victory but I did it straining now and running water now that water is running freely in here I filled up a large pan and then boil some water and pour boiling water down there for a couple of pots of boiling water down there just gonna make sure that you got good water volumes going down this drain so I make sure I solve my father it is [Music] very very selective about what they put down the garbage disposal so a little commentary I want to add to the video I've been having the water run for here a little bit and it's going well no stopping anymore I did pour a large pan of boiling water down and I haven't had any issues yet we'll continue to let it run and drain and I'm very happy about this now I rented that 50-foot drain cleaner auger whatever you call him I see him calls everything under the Sun since I've been looking at him you can get a 40-foot one for fairly cheap that was a manual 50 foot one was a little bit larger diameter unit it was what I would say easier to work with than the smaller ones when I say smaller ones I mean this this was kind of a pain in the butt compared to that big one so that they'd one might seem intimidating but for what I felt was making progress in the drain the big one just worked well and felt like it worked well from the beginning you'll again want to make sure that your fittings are all very tight and secure I hooked my dishwasher back up you know that's I'll have to test that here to really really want to make sure that you dry this off really well if this type of material gets wet this is laminated particle board and it bubbles and looks like crap if some of you have older homes and someone who lived there before you didn't take care of it you might already see this underneath your sink but this is why you'll always want to lay up paper towel down where you did some plumbing work and just check to see if you have subtle drops so I'm gonna I'm gonna run to Home Depot and return my my auger that I rented for twenty-five dollars and that's the moral of the story here I have never touched an auger in my life or a drain clean or whatever the heck you want to call it I've never touched one of those in my life never had to have the opportunity to never need it to the 25-foot one I borrowed from my father-in-law lost his heart appreciated that he had one available for me to use it didn't work I've to say it go deeper with it so I rented the 50-foot one but I was faced with what could have been a $500 plus depending on who you go if you're your victim to or subject to however you want to look at it a plumber and you know they could say that it's got to be sculpt it could be your vent pipe it could be your drain there's a number of different things that could have happened here and because I was persistent in God at it I was able to do my own repair here for $25 so at the end of the day take it slow be careful think through what you're doing but give it a try because what you could do with four hundred and seventy five extra dollars and only spending $25 is a lot so hope this helps and we'll get back at you at the next project now just to give you an idea how I'm cleaning this up you do the right thing folks clean the crap out of any tool you ever borrow from or borrow from anybody or rent from anyone return it the way you found it so this was down in my disgusting drain I don't know how well the next person is gonna clean it and you know pay for it these are little things in life but as I'm cleaning this I've extended it down my driveway and I wanted to show you how far really essentially in my adrenal system into my house I was but you can see it all the way down my driveway it's almost to the end down there my ways this was all in the plumbing of my house just trying to fish its way through and find a problem [Music]", "I2m9IFzEKXc": "I might just put nuts on there now whatever it takes I got not support just put nuts on the arrow and you know input a new saddle just something huh yeah I know thing in front of a rocket and you wonder was he oh yeah all right well oh yeah ain't looking too good is it that's we had yeah all right clean so you think that there's food in there what'd you put in there I don't know could be gosh I could be from the dishwasher yeah I can fix that too you going back listen you going back to teaching you're all done you've had enough huh all right send the old lady to work I would do yes that's full body weight loss why are you in close plastic the last one mom I said she's a nasty one you ever had this clean before never never on a million years huh well that's probably just the emulator stuff it with a rag see we get some water down in this your rate is clean probably a diverter that's bad we'll change that faucet out ain't worth it playing around with it that deaerators clean is probably at the virtus jump well that's what the sweater works the spray is the Berta well I guess the pressure is bad nice thing holy once we got the drain cleaned well worried about the water what is that that's what the problem is bad little better let's make sure I get it so I took the burger out of it probably what the problem was sit yeah it's still not good right go on a couple of times back and forth don't Clara oh that's us full of grease they don't grease down here yeah yeah wouldn't surprise yeah well yeah oil is considered grease you know bottom and oil from the pans and all that stuff you dump that down there how about the young guy how about the EVDO no yes yeah because the problem is I don't know he'll look too bad the snake is not a white and so see ya if I want to get wet I try not to use that you know at times I guess you could use it but let's see if we got it well the problem with that is an event hands over the water can go up the back - there's no man then you can blow it out you have to get that on on the pipe directly if it's both event obviously it's like it's going to book the vent or push the walking dog at times you got some nasty plumbing on the end we are I will have to open it up boil record my work I could sometimes I don't for my records going down now brother cross the snow running kind of weird yeah I must be the aerator we're getting a good flow now look at the flown out right here we are that's probably aerator going down now we already get or thought it was our stuffing now this this here is a diverter that's for the sprayer so if you take that diverter all this will still work watch well not this faucet I'll put that the burner back please does she use the spray away um I never was any good one the top one that's definitely nice so that is really on your side to be guinea pig a shower in here so it's not backing up now so I think we're good I could probably put nuts on there but the faucet seems pretty shot I'm gonna he's gonna nother classy and I use that one you are not everything what happened yet this is not a bad faucet compared to another piece of junky boy let's try putting the diverter back in I could always you know put nuts on this and fix that put a new one on it whatever it takes no it's better than that other would you get the other one at Home Depot well the one I did in the package yeah that's from Betty's Denny's about the only deal is over yes figure you know I would have gone got I'll see that the bird is definitely bad see that one see that the vertibird er is like smoke we'll just put that in me you you want to use that faucet yeah that Manny's faucet I don't care yeah whatever work well this this thing is that the virtus mold you know if I don't have a throat it out of that spray is not gonna work yeah maybe big be better off just

good deal to me in the wall that condition is like one yeah little mini splits yeah they don't have an outdoor thing just I mean uh yeah they do good some mini split you mean a window unit sorry it's all in one isn't it no you know you got a unit outside too you have to have a unit outside yeah you have a condenser outside on the mini split I mean a big machine outside well it's not a big that's small button or just mini splits are basically for one room you know yeah but that's just uh the vent out I mean you know how they have those big units with the fans outside you don't have to have one of those oh yeah it's the same thing it's just a smaller version of it a mini split is ductless there's no ducts all right there's no ducts well a regular conventional hall with a conventional system you have ducts supply and return duct what a mini split it's all you know all one piece but you still have to have a condenser and you know a line set going outside right or a heat pump I'll call them

stiff bristles on it i've got a couple lemons here if you wanted to you could also use lemon juice the kind you get out of the grocery store in the little tube container baking soda and a pumice stone which you can buy any hardware store they're fairly cheap usually about a dollar and vinegar which is also really cheap and you might have it underneath your counter where you can purchase it at your local supermarket so we're going to start with our baking soda which is a mild abrasive that we can use to get this rust out of the inside of the sink so you're going to want to go ahead and sprinkle it in and then we can go ahead and add some of this lemon for the acidity cleaning power of lemons sprinkle that over you're going to hear a fizzing then we're going to get some more fizz here with our vinegar kind of like that 5th grade volcano project and then we're going to take our scrubber and we're going to go ahead and scrub all over the areas where you have rust in your sink a lot of times that's right around the drain so go ahead and get that really good put some muscle into it so if you have a really difficult rust stain and you're just having trouble using your muscle to get it off then you can use a pumice stone you just go ahead and dampen the end of your pumice stone right here and then focus on the area that's really difficult go ahead and scrub that on there you'll see a little bit of that residue from the pumice stone coming off on the inside of your sink and that should really do the trick this works pretty well you're going to go ahead and just rinse out all that

internet. Welcome back to the channel. And today, we have a great video for you. You're looking at a new kitchen that we just got finished remodeling, and what sometimes happens is\nyou're left with a sink here that has two sinks as\npart of it, two basins. But now, the question that pops up is how do you handle the drainage for those two, when there was only one\npipe before underneath? So today, we're going to show\nyou how to drain two sinks and how to connect them\nup to the drain pipe that goes into the wall. Let's get started. Okay, so just to get you up to speed. We're showing you a picture here. This is what the kitchen\nlooked like before. It was this ugly yellow Formica\nthat went straight out flat and it had this big ole white\nkind of like a ceramic coated or maybe porcelain coated single sink, and we've replaced all that. We redid the whole ceiling,\nthe cabinets, everything as you can see here and replaced it with this double sink here. So now, when you look underneath at what we had before, we still have the original pipe that was coming out. That leads to the drain. That goes down to the sewer there, okay. So we have that, and then you have this\nsink on the left here, which is gonna need a downpipe, and it's gonna need to connect into there. And also, at the same\ntime, this output here from the bottom of the\ngarbage disposal will need to drain in there as well. So there's certain considerations that we need to take into account when we do something like this. And so, we're going to go\nthrough all that with you and show you exactly\nhow to do this properly so that both sinks will drain. Well guess what, it's Chalkboard Thursday. So I wanted to show you,\nhere's a couple methods that I normally see people do. And I don't agree all on these with some of the ways people do things. So let's say you have\nthe sink on the left, sink on the right, and\nyour drain's in the middle. And what you see a lot,\nvery common, is this. You'll see a, put a downpipe there, downpipe there, and\nyou get this cross pipe that kinda connects like that. And this is what they show\nyou on the packages a lot in some of the stores. And I'm like, \"Well, I\ndon't agree with that.\" Because what's supposed to happen is, if there's water in this\nside, it'll drain down and go into the waste pipe that goes into the wall there. And then, this side too\nwould do the same thing. But I don't like the fact that\nyou have water that's here that can go rushing this way. And likewise, water coming down here can go rushing that way, and it could cause a collision and maybe you lose the effectiveness of your ability to drain fast. I just never really liked that idea. So anyway, if you're\na professional plumber with a lot of years' experience,\nchime in and let us know down in the comments below. Let us know whether you\nlike this method here. I don't like it. I don't think you should\nimplement it that way. I just don't think it's any good. You can't have any good come out of it. What if you have two sinks\ntrying to empty at once, like if one of them was full of dishwater and then the other one's\ngot the faucet running at full blast? You open this guy up, now\nyou're gonna have a huge deluge of water coming down, and then you're gonna have this\none just streaming water in. And what's gonna happen? Who's gonna win? I don't know. I don't like that idea at all. Okay, so, the other idea\nthat some people do, and this is the one that I wanna here. So we have our two sinks here, and what we wanna do is the\nline that comes down like this and the line that comes down like this is going to go into a wye. We call this a wye, and I'll\nshow you the wye in a minute. But it basically looks like this, see. And this connects into the wall, into the waste pipe\ncoming out of the wall. So what happens is the\nwater comes in there, and the water comes in there. So here's our 1 1/2 inch wye that we're going to use here so that each one gets its\nown entry into the part here. This is going to connect\nup to the wall pipe that comes out of the wall there. And as you can see back in there, it's pretty hard for\nthe water to turn around and go back into the other. 'Cause you do wanna make\nsure that the water entering both of these two here\nin the front doesn't try to come back in through the other side. That would be bad. (upbeat rock music) (soft piano music) Okay, so now we're testing it. And with the water coming down, down the drain there, we're\ngonna test this path here. And you just want to\nmake sure feel around, make sure there's no\nwater leaking around here or here or around here where\nit screws into the wye. You gotta check all of that spot there. And I always reach way in the back and check where it's cemented\non to the waste pipe there. See, you gotta check all of that. And then likewise, when we\ncheck the left side sink, you wanna go ahead and check\nall of these components here, as well, and check up here where it attaches to\nthe bottom of the drain. You gotta check all of that. And then as a final test, what we'll do is we will fill this whole\nside up with water here, let it get all full, and then we'll turn on\nthe sink, the faucet here, and let it run down the left side. So while the left side is draining, we'll pull the plug on here, and we'll see how the water does and how well it drains. Because you wanna make sure\nthat they're both draining at the same time. You wanna make sure that they\ncan both empty their water out into that wye without any problems. And again, let me just point out to you that remember, since\nthis is horizontal here, you cannot use a santee, code prevents it. A santee is only to be\nused in a vertical plane, if the water was coming straight down. You wanna be able to make sure\nyou can get a snake in there if you had to snake out. So if they ever had to\nsnake this drain line out, it'd be pretty easy, 'cause all you gotta do is\ntake off this P-trap right here and unscrew this part of the pipe here and just stick your snake\nstraight back in there. As a final step here, I usually put down paper towels like this and then test both sides again to make sure that there's\nno water dripping. The paper towels will show it immediately if there's even a single drop. And you'll leave it like\nthat for a day or two under normal usage and\njust see how it does, because I've seen cases in the past where you have water just\nsitting in the trap right here, and it can leach out through here, through that point there. So that's something to keep in mind there. We just have to hook\nup the dishwasher now. All right, so here we have the trap arm. So remember, we're putting in\nthe transparent P-trap now. And so, I've already got it\nsized to fit in here, right. So what you do first is you\ngotta put on the first nut and you gotta put it in\nwith the threads facing down like that, 'cause it's gonna come down and tighten down to the\nbottom of the trap here. See it's gonna meet up to this piece. So that goes on first. And then, remember, this is gonna mate onto the wall over there. So this nut now comes on second. And this is part everybody forgets, and this is what causes a\nleak over here at this part. They forget to put this gasket on, and sometimes they get\nthe direction wrong. You have to put it on so that\nthe flat part of the washer is facing the nut like that. And the reason why it's\nangled is because the piece that it connects into in here is angled, and this is what fits the watertight seal. It makes it nice and tight in there, so when you screw this on that pipe, it's knocked everything together and it pinches against this washer here. So that's why that needs to be there. And this doesn't need a washer, because they sort of have it, their gasket is this right here. It's the shape of the plastic as it connects into the other plastic. So now, while we're here\nbefore we connect it up, I'm going to see if we can get this screwed\nin together before. All right, so now we're going\nto join these two together. Now, you see how it's important\nto have this thing perfect, like absolutely perfect, 'cause if this is off, let's\nsay the alignment's off, see how the water can\nslip out right there. 'Cause this joint is\ngoing to be under water, as I mentioned before. So we have to make sure that\nthat's really perfect there. We're gonna just loosely\ntighten them together for now, and once we get the whole thing together we'll do a final tighten on it. I tightened this one\nfirst, and he's satisfied. Now, we're going to tighten these other two. So these two have the rubber\ngaskets on them, those washers. And so, they'll tighten up\npretty good on their own, pretty easily. Just about a quarter of a turn, like that, And I don't know if\nit'll let us in that way, or if we have to come in from the bottom. Okay. So those are in nice and tight. So now we're ready to turn on the water. Okay, so there I've let the\nwater run for a few minutes now. It's coming through. It's all hot water at this point. And as we look up top here, there's no moisture around the drain, which is a good sign. That means we sealed it up nice. And we've solved the link up here at the kitchen drain. But our testing is not done yet. All right, so now that\nwe know that at least with the water running\nin it, we're doing okay. What I wanna do now is\nfill up the sink with water and let the whole thing go. That's another good test\nto do here for your leaks. Okay, so our basin is\nfilled with hot water, and now we're going to let it all go and just watch it rush through there through the P-trap. And there we go. So it's all done. So now after a little bit, you'll see of the water settle back here. See how it's the little air\nbubble up top there's growing? It's setting the level of the weir. So the weir is what we call this top level of the water here. Now in this particular case, we would actually like\nto see it a little lower. And the reason why it's not, this should be up higher, but there's really not\nmuch you can do right here because of the way the\nplumbing was done here. The pipe comes out\nhorizontal from the wall. You really should have a\nlittle bit of a decline down towards the wall, not a lot, only a quarter of an inch per 12 inches. But you can at least see it. You can at least get the air behind water. So you can see now here\nfrom looking at this, you can see why you sometimes\nwill have water leaking out of this nut, because this whole column\nright here is under water. This column right here from the weir to the upper dip right here. So from this column right\nhere is what protects you from all the methane gases coming in from the sewer system, from the drain. The gases are right up\ninto this point right here, and then the water stops it. This column of water is what stops it. So sometimes when you winterize your house and you leave, and this evaporates, and that's why you can smell sewer gases when you come back if that evaporates. You just fill it right\nback up with water again by running the water\nfor a few seconds here. So you can see the water\nlevel is like probably right around in here, up to here. So anyway, there's no drips, but we're not quite out of the woods yet, and I'll show you why. Okay, so this is the level\nof the weir right here. Now my opinion, that's\nup a little bit high. It's not that far off. Ideally it's supposed to end at the bottom of the crown here. So right on the bottom\npart of that trap arm, that's where the level really should be, if you wanna be absolutely ideal. Because when you're looking at the weir, which is the top level of the water here, you should be able to look down the drain right down the drain and look straight into the middle of the vent. If this can't see air, then this would all be filled with water, and you'll have like a vacuum and that's what creates\nwhat we call a siphon, and it can actually cause the water in your P-trap here to disappear. It'll just go (imitates slurping). It'll suck right out\nand down the drain there if there's no air behind water. Now here we have it, so we're okay. We've got a little bit.

new one now you'll notice this kitchen has composite laminate countertops what this means is we're going to need to use a drop-in or countertop sink there is also a wide variety of undermount sinks available but they can only be installed on solid surface countertops such as granite or marble so know what type of countertops you have before you go shopping for a sink okay let's get started as with most plumbing projects we start by turning off the water at the supply valves place a bucket under the drain trap loosen the slip nuts and remove the trap now remove the coupling nuts connecting the water supply tubes to the faucets tailpiece and be sure to have a rag on hand in case there's still water in the lines then disconnect whatever other plumbing fixtures you may have such as disposers or sink sprayers okay now slice through the caulking around the rim of the sink and lift the sink up off the countertop remove any residual caulk with a putty knife and you're ready to start work on the new sink if you rest the sink on some saw horses it makes it really easy to flip the sink back and forth as you do your work also at this point it's probably a good idea to go ahead and install things like the basket strainer the disposer and the faucet into the sink before you lift it and actually put it in a position once the sink is installed it's obviously more time-consuming and difficult to install these items from below the manufacturer of your particular faucet and garbage disposer will include installation instructions and putting in a basket strainer it's pretty straightforward begin by forming a rope with plumber's putty wrap that around the underside of the strainers housing and press it so it sticks to the housing set the strainer into the sinks drain hole and press it firmly into place flip the sink over and slip a rubber gasket over the threaded tail piece then a washer and finally a lock nut and hand tighten the lock nut now hold the strainer in place and tighten the lock nut with some adjustable pliers and be very careful not to over tighten the nut and damage your sink flip it back over and remove any plumbers putty that may have eased out and you're ready to install the new sink start by applying a steady continuous bead of silicone caulk around the opening of the countertop now drop the new sink into the opening and press it down firmly onto the caulk check that the sink is level and clean away any excess caulk reconnect the drains and water supply lines turn the water back on and check for leaks so really that's about it as you can see you can really improve the look of your kitchen in an afternoon and you'll enjoy the benefits for years to come you", "aLlbfTkenTs": "this home is up for sale and the homeowner asked me to switch this sink out for a stainless steel the buyer requested a new sink be put in as part of the agreement they did not like this with little rust spot down at the bottom I got a whole video on how to get rid of that so if they just cleaned off that rust the buyer probably wouldn't have had a problem they wouldn't have to do this whole project but it is what it is so we're gonna take out the sink and put in a new one looking underneath there's a lot of things we have to disconnect here here here here here here here and probably somewhere else and underneath you can see how the sink is clamped to the countertop with these screws so here's an atom tip these valves are notorious for dripping once you've messed with them so don't shut them off here don't turn off the water by spinning these handles go to the main shutoff valve for the house and turn on the water off there and that way you'll stop yourself from having to replace these because once they start dripping you're just gonna have to swap the whole part so save yourself that trouble once you've shut off the water drain any remaining water that's left in the pipes and then you disconnect the hot and cold lines get some rags ready because you will have water still in the pipes unplug the disposal and take note of this you see how the pipe leading from the disposal is slanted downwards make sure you keep that slant it can't be sloping towards the disposal because it will mean that the disposal will say full of water and it'll rust out quicker so when you're hooking it back up make sure there's a slight slant away from the disposal this hose that the top is the drain from the dishwasher and take it off all of these drain connections are meant to be done by hand you do not use a wrench on these this is a neat tool that I'll tell you more about it at the end of the video but what it does is help you lift and attach the disposal it's like a wrench and a holder at the same time insert couple screwdrivers or even the wrench they give you into these slots and give it a quarter turn hold on to it because it will fall disconnect these and this is going to be full of water that's the p-trap and it's gross water as well so get a bucket ready okay this pipe is going to lead right into the sewer so to stop the funk from getting into your kitchen shove a rag in there and we're undoing these clamps once you loosen it it'll fall off its gonna be several all the way around with the clamps off you can pull out the sink and depending on the amount of silicone yours might be a lot tougher to get off do a little cleanup around the edge this is the sink they want to put in for me I would have spent more money on it it's really thin so it's gonna dent easier it's also flimsy when you move the handle of the faucet it's gonna flex the sink I recommend spending more money but is what it is before you do anything dry fit it in make sure it all fits fine next up is plumber's putty we're gonna take a chunk of this it's kind of like play-doh so we're gonna make a ring put it around the drain and use a lot it's gonna squish out and fill in all the little cracks and voids so that the water doesn't leak out now this stuff does make grease marks on the stainless steel but you just clean that off later rubber gasket paper gasket metal nut first tighten it by hand and then you can use a wrench while you're tighten it look straight down make sure it's all lined up you don't want it off-center flip it around and you should see the plumber's putty losing out on all sides if it's not you probably didn't put enough so you're gonna tighten this and then let the putty is out and then tighten it again and let more putty come out do that a while until it feels like it's really snug and tight and can you spot the mistake I made there's no food that's going to go through this drain let's see how it's blocked so I have to remove this later not a big deal but it's just easier to do all these attachments and parts while it's on the kitchen floor not when it's up under the sink and you're working upside down this is a different style of clamps I'm getting them all ready before I put the sink on the counter here I put a bead of silicone and the base plate so the water doesn't leak underneath out under the sink this is the nut that secures the faucet next step you're going to want a hundred percent silicone with a stainless steel sink you're going to use clear and we're putting a generous bead all the way around the edge normally do the silicone last I just forgot a couple connections here these are new water lines the old ones were too short so be prepared you probably need new water lines ok now carefully put the sink in act kind of quick because it's easier to clean off the silicone when it's still fresh tightening the new clamps hook them back up the hot and cold now I'm loosely fitting these pipes back together I'm not going to tighten anything now the problem is this sink is a little higher than the last the base of the sink it's not as deep so this pipe here is probably gonna be a problem I'll have to get a couple more parts I'm just loosely fitting everything together Here I am putting on the correct drain this one's for a disposal and this is the hard part you have to snap on a metal ring this is a lot easier when you're doing it with the sink on the kitchen floor it also helps if you have an assistant pushing down from above it keeps the drain from moving here's this disposal lift tool again goes on like that and it makes it easy to pick up and attach give it a twist and make sure it's all the way tightened all right timeout for just a second I'm editing this video and I want to make sure this part is absolutely clear and I don't think it is from the footage that I filmed so I'm gonna explain it right now when you're tightening this there's a little lip on the threads okay you want to make sure you get this part right because if it's not totally connected all the way past this little notch right there there's this little lip so when you're putting on your connection it comes up onto this Ridge there's three of them it spins you're turning it turning it and it's gonna go over this little bump right there and once it's over that tiny bump then it's locked in let me show you my current disposal under my sink this part is on the disposal this part is the sink mount okay it might be hard it's gonna want to stop before it goes all the way over the lump so you can get some pliers and squeeze that together if you need to and that way you were gonna make sure that it is secure all right back to the video yeah now that it's hooked up I can see this is too short I'm gonna need a longer piece luckily I had a little extension and now the pipe from the disposal seems to be a little bit too long so I'm going to cut that off loosely attach everything together don't make it really tight yet just once everything's at ease and all put together then you can tighten it securely this brass one you can use a wrench everything else do by hand you can plug in the disposal and put back in the dishwasher drain and we are done again you can see those greasy fingerprints from the plumbers putty stainless steel sink cleaner and you can get all that cleaned up so what do you guys think it looks like fun huh it's actually not so bad and if any of you have tips something maybe I have missed or you got another way of doing things go ahead leave them in the comment section because a lot of people read those and you can

right here click that follow me on Instagram and then send me an email with your address so I know where to ship it to and I'll ship them out until I run out of these and if it's something you guys want and I think this is a disposal lift comm I don't know anything about them they are not a sponsor I get no kickback there's really nothing in it for me but they were nice and sent me some that I could hand out to you guys so tell me what to think if you liked the tool or not it's kind of Handy I don't know the price and I don't know how much I'd pay but it is helpful some people use car jacks getting the disposal because you're almost straight arm lifting some of those disposals and they are heavy so it is handy but depending on the price I don't know how worth it is but you guys can check it out and the next video we will be doing a sponsored video we're going to be doing the Lowe's garage makeover clean-out I'm going to be finishing the rods walls and putting in a little workspace so

a lot to take a little bit of time to show you how I do that because I have one in mind okay so as you can see there's some pretty hard water stains here around the sink InSinkErator it gets a lot of use I do not have a water softener in my home so as you can see on the high use areas there's also some spots from where the water just dries and another hard water stain there under where I keep the brush so I'll just leave that out there but overall pretty dirty actually not too bad but there's a couple products that I'll use to get this cleaned right up then I'll show you okay so to get started here there's a couple products that I use that I'll be showing you but basically what I do is I just take this granite quartz and marble treatment give you a look at that it is a supreme surface is the brand you can buy it on eBay or Amazon I don't know how I happened to cross this product I think and I've got some google reviews for the best granite all around and make sure you get everywhere and then this bottle does come with one of these microfiber towels but any microfiber towel will do now what I do do is sometimes about once a month as I clean I try and clean the sink about once a week if you have to black especially the black granite epoxy you'll want to do it about once a week so what you can do about once a month if you really get a dirty I really want to scrub part is just get these scour pads I made sure that they don't stretch so just these this is Winco Graham you can get the the better brand at the store but they won't scratch so you can do the same thing with the scour pad instead of the microfiber towel but for today I'm just going to be using a towel so make sure you get a nice coat in here you want to kind of see some standing spray in there and then what you really need to do is put some elbow grease into it really kind of remember I can't see those hard water stains quite as much anymore where they are put some is extra elbow grease in there so it is kind of get in there really give it a nice scrub now and you'll see the towel gets pretty dirty so my sink was pretty dirty now what I'll do there's a actually the woman at the showroom when I got the sink gave me the site together and so there's a secret ingredient and if you guessed Pam then you were correct what you want to do is just kinda just do the same thing as you did with the cleaner to spray all around get a nice coat in there and what this does is act as a excuse me it acts as a protectant for at least a few days it will eventually run off with the water but it access a protectant to kind of seal in the granite composite and sparks sparkles it right up makes it look nice and shiny so you'll rub that in there actually I should probably use a different part of it microfiber towel actually what I'll do is use a paper towel yeah that works a lot better but he'll just want to rub that in everywhere I'll give you a view of what the scene looks like [Music] [Music] so basically looks like a brand-new seat all right and there's a sink after the cleaning so you can see it's nice and bright and shiny and that's how I suggest cleaning your granite composite sink", "9YUPbn3fPUs":

you purchase the right size for your space when choosing a new lk sync it's important to make sure the size you select will fit into the new sink base cabinet you can download a detailed spec sheet from our website with all the dimensions you need you'll also need to measure the sink from front to back to make sure you have enough countertop space between the sink and the backsplash to install a faucet and accessories before removing your old sink measure its overall dimensions left to right and front to back you'll also want to measure the depth of the boat once you've removed your old sink measure the length and width of the cutout measure the corner radius to make sure the corners of the new sink will cover the corners cut out of your countertop if your base cabinet has a tip out tray

every now and then with sinks that hit that runs slow or maybe they get clogged well there are a few simple things that you can do before you have to call in a professional one of the things I like to start with of course is the old fashioned plunger why does a plunger work well with common clogs all that you really have to do is give that material just a little gentle shove down the drain and away it goes how do you use a plunger this way I feel get this think about a third of the way fill with water put the plunger in make sure it's seated really well on the bottom of the sink and go ahead and give it a couple of quick strokes and then pull it out and see what happens now if that doesn't work you might want to scoop all the water out of the sink as much as you can and use a very common household product that might cut through the clog what is it chlorine bleach works great okay now if that doesn't work what I want you to do is to go ahead and get a regular drain cleaner and I've had the best success with the ones that are thick look on the label it will show you that it's very thick product pour it in the drain follow directions see what happens if that doesn't work your last source of do-it-yourself type things before you take everything apart is to use some of the new foaming products that actually fill the entire pipe with a foam that helps to get rid of the clog just follow the directions open the packet pour it into the sink pour in the hot water and you're done well we waited the eight hours for the foaming drain cleaner and it worked it's beautiful oh yeah you can some time to clean these drains just follow the directions on the products you might have some great success if not it's time to call the pro if you want to discover more home improvement tips go

practical for using them under the sink so I'm going to conquer that clutter using some very affordable and practical organization storage first stop Walmart Walmart has some pretty amazing organizers for just about everything you can imagine like this wire basket is used for veggies but it can easily be used under the kitchen sink because they are stackable these stackable bins caught my eyes because they were large and they were under $6.00 use airtight containers to keep your items dry these were my old containers that I use on my old baking cart you guys remember so I upcycle them and place my mom's items inside she already had and I use peel and stick letters for labeling so here's a tip if you're going to tackle this job remove items from its original packaging because it eats up a ton of space and place them in containers these containers were 399 and they are from home goods these containers has to be my all-time favorite from my favorite store IKEA they have several different sizes from small to large they're white and cream looking and you can use them in your pantry in your larger room I'm using want to store mom's garbage bags inside it's big and wide and deep perfect for her trash bags again using plastic labels to keep them organized I snagged a pack of Walmart washcloths and mom can use them for her dishes 18 came in a pack but under $4 I used them in my kitchen as well because they were very easy to clean and you're getting 18 of them come on you cannot beat that I immediately placed them in her container she already had and I love that there's a handle that she can pull out when she needs one here's the before everything was crammed in she had to do a little work to get what she needed now it's organized functional and very practical he has just a few of the boxes that I emptied see how much space it takes up in a stackable bins I have her daily and weekly items she uses on top and on the bottom I have her Swifter pads on the other side her dish tab sponges magic eraser and garbage disposal cleaner and her dish towels and the contain you can get from Big Lots for about $2 below I have her garbage bags underneath for easy access mom's old school she loved to occasionally wash her dishes so I purchased this collapsible dish rack but only $15 is perfect for if you have limited countertop space and it holds up to 8 plates and it collapses for easy storage when it's not in use for 2 bucks you can tame the crowd of bottles by adding a curtain Newton Giraud it's a great use of wasted space for your spray bottles another great use of wasted space is to use over the door storage mom has had this unit already but it wasn't being used to its full potential so I'm using it to place her items that she uses the most like her sink cleaner and her all-purpose cleaner in her glass cleaner from grow collaborative I will have a link down below if you like to purchase gross cleaners and more I had no idea small single use steel wood pads existed mom has saved a few of her spaghetti jars and I was like why she said because it's a mason jar see it says Mason I'm so glad she did because you can use this to put your pads inside this is a great alternative if you're low on money in case you missed it I organized a few trouble spots and my mom's kitchen cabinets and added some affordable storage solutions and her drawers and I will

explore the resources provided by nature to bring innovation to the kitchen this is how we have developed a new material that enables us to produce original kitchen sinks with elegant shapes and

impacts scratches and abrasion in addition to allowing them to withstand temperatures of up to 180 degrees thanks to their special composition and to the high quality of the natural pigments added during the manufacturing process the kitchen sinks produced in kha'zix have a warm and natural texture very pleasant to the touch and are available in different colors that withstand chemical agents

bathroom so I'm going to show you how to unclog a drain that is smaller and then we're gonna move into my kitchen and I'm going to show you some tips and tricks and how to freshen up your kitchen sink if it is also clogged give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed subscribe if you're new for all things cleaning and organizing related okay first and foremost this part right here you're gonna want to check it if this is in your bathroom and you're gonna make sure that this is cleared out if not I just made a whole video about how to remove that and clean it because if you're gonna be sticking stuff down the drain you want to make sure that there isn't a huge obstruction of hair especially if this is in your bathroom so I showed how to uninstall that and reinstall it and clean that baby out so I will have that video linked in the description box below if that is not your issue and it is just simply the drain and there's not a ton of blockage here the second thing that I would like you to do if you need to buy one of these little snakes if you have a bunch of hair down up in there now the products that I'm going to show you here shortly will definitely help remove this stuff but if you can give the products a little aid even better hair is pretty difficult to break down so I would get one of these little snakes is what they call it here and I would show you but I'm one-handed and essentially feed it down you're to pull it up and you're gonna find some disgustingness which is gonna be really satisfying as well alright let's so let's move into the products now of course you can buy some heavy-duty like Drano or something like that but this video is about teaching you about more natural products that you have probably already laying around your house if you are very environmentally conscious or you are pregnant with child like I am I definitely like this now don't get me wrong I do love chemical products as well there's a time in a place but not stay okay first and foremost there's two ways that you can do this and again I want to show you here in the kitchen as well because the processes are very very similar you can choose some the in Sona and vinegar these two products create a chemical reaction in which carbon dioxide gas is produced and that's going to help loosen gunk stuck in yo drain if you do not have these two products on hand my friend I have got you covered I'm saving you the most time here that's what this channel is all about you can use salt you can use this kind of salt you can use Epsom salt and boiling hot water are you ready to get started I'm going to show you both ways here super fast to help you get moving on to some other things so if I have already run some hot water in here I think it just helps kind of flush out the drain a little bit as best as it possibly can this thing was super super clogged before I try these methods and the water would just go slow down there there's no rhyme or reason for the exact amounts that I'm going to be using here today but I might have bought 1/4 cup baking soda so just gonna stick this here towards the drain spout and I'm just gonna I got cleaning vinegar here I like cleaning vinegar I usually buy mine from the Dollar Tree this one's from Walmart the great value brand because it is slightly more acidic than regular vinegar you can use but I would vinegar you have I'm gonna pull that see that movie okay super satisfying or if you're someone that does you like absolutely hate the smell vinegar that's why I'm going to show you this salt method as well so I'm in a little bit more again this is going to depend upon this is why I don't want to give you exact amounts it's gonna depend upon how badly your drain is clogged if you do this and you find that it's not fixing it try it again maybe a little more product it's not like baking where it needs to be very precise all right so we're gonna let this sit I would say 15-20 minutes to let it work its way down the drain to really use that carbon dioxide gas to help move anything that's stuck down in there we'll come back here and I will show you the next step and that has bubbled and done its magic here you can still kind of hear it super satisfying the next thing is going to take a big jug of hot hot hot boiling water and you're gonna dump it down your drain really give it a good flush the hot water helps break down and flush anything out that needs to be flushed now I've already done this so that's why it's going down so so nicely now if you find you've done the baking soda and the vinegar and it's still not draining and you've cleaned this out you know there's no hair gunk up in here the next thing that I would recommend this is called a p-trap and often times if something big went down your drain it gets stuck down in here and all you would want to do is safely remove this and empty this out if you're finding ok I've cleaned out the drain I've done everything there's got to be something lodged in here and stuck now oftentimes you may notice if you go on vacation or you haven't used your sink in a while there may be some sort of a smell the reason that that happens is because this p-trap is designed to help eliminate or reduce gases that come up from your sewer so that's why you got this but sometimes things can get caught in there maybe you have small kids and you know who knows leaves you name it things could get all trapped up in there now if you are using salt same principle applies what I would do is I don't know about 1/4 a cup depending upon how big your drain is so you're gonna use salt rather than your baking soda and you're gonna flush it with hot boiling water if you're not using the vinegar yes you're gonna wait 15 20 minutes come back do another flush with your water ok so let's head into the kitchen I'm going to show you some tips and tricks when it comes to a drain that is a bit larger and different sorts of substances often go down in your kitchen drain as opposed to your bathroom drain so we'll talk about that here we are in my kitchen don't mind my saying this is a very old sink I don't want to replace it I'm waiting so we remodel our kitchen here so alright this time we're gonna use salt now you definitely can use the baking soda and vinegar I would try that if what I'm going to show you here does not quite do the trick for you but you're gonna need some salt again you can use iodized salt or Epsom salt it doesn't really matter now why salt can be helpful in your kitchen is because fat deposits from food and oils can get trapped in your drain and salt is believed to help push it down and break it down and so what you're gonna do is I've already ran some hot water you're gonna put your salt in there just like we did with the baking soda get it in there and then you're gonna take hot boiling water in our bathroom example we used vinegar hot boiling water get that dumped in there a good amount again there's no precise amount there we go and you can see I've already unclog these it's going down very nice so yours probably will not do this the first time just to give you a heads up again we're gonna let this sit for about 15-20 minutes and then I'm going to show you something cool here we are for our final steps again you're gonna take some hot boiling water you can boil it on the stove or if you have some other way put it in the microwave dump it down there to really flush your drain this not only is gonna unclog your drain but it's gonna help with any sort of smells I don't know about you but often times my garbage disposal will just attach to your sink obviously it will have a very pungent disgusting smell because food gets lodged and trapped in there now to freshen things up if you have lemon or an old lemon peel what I would do I don't want to waste this one just yet I already did it put down your garbage disposal run it flush it with hot water and the acid from the lemon is going to help break down stuff stuck in your garbage disposal and in your drain and it's gonna make it smell delicious lemony fresh and who does not love that so I want you to give these methods a try again they work both for your kitchen sink and your bathroom sink I will have additional videos linked in the description box to help you along the way subscribe the video thumbs up also hit me up on Instagram at Andrew Jean Co I teach women how to turn their passions into profits in this cleaning channel is one way that I do that again if you're wanting more all-natural products or you are with Z child I'm having a baby here in a couple weeks definitely give these a holler thank you so much for being here I appreciate you immense and I will see you my friend in the next one", "2-DrvoqQvEg": "you know I always enjoy being a good Samaritan of sorts dropping in on folks and lending a hand where it's needed and even though I put down my roots I don't see any reason not to keep on doing that just a few days ago one of the gals in town called me to complain about washing dishes no it wasn't the pots and pans she was upset with it was her sink I hate it it's just dusting it's I think it's the original sink that was here when they renovated this and we've redone everything in that think of stay the same it's corroded under the faucet it sprays when I go to spray the dishes I always have hurt myself the way it comes out of the sink I just really want something nice and clean all right Ron so here's the thing this is it you're really unhappy with this I just think it's disgusting it's old it it just needs to go okay I agree there's enough there's no no repairs involved here just replacements why don't I go out and do a little looking around kay some shopping and you know see what you'd like to replace it with great okay okay so this looks pretty much like what you've got right now huh like this one or this one right here so you want to go back with the stainless steel I feel like it gets finger pretty and dirty on this think I see that the drain is kind of off to the side what a difference between that and the ones that are in the center it's off to the side I love that side look at the process who lot to choose from Wow well the first thing you've got to decide is do you want metal or plastic or silver chrome versus white I think definitely the silver you like this oh yeah we'd like this faucet right here that one Moen yeah this is it right here great very beautiful now did you want the soap dispenser yeah and this one is chrome that matches okay oh my god we're gonna do is we're gonna take the sick out with a lot of stuff attached to it but one of the things we can I don't want to take out attached is the girl we just okay you turn the garbage disposal on I go around and flip some breakers and when it goes off just give me all right good okay go ahead and turn it on it's just stopped there we go that's all yep it's off you look in the back you see that black pipe coming down now we want to disconnect that alright with your hands first of all and see if you can loosen it yeah now you follow that around so you shape the supply for the other side connector they're the same thing well guys that white pipe coming up this one yeah yep is that where the garbage comes out of no that's where the wastewater from your dishwasher goes okay see down here in the vitamin C that sort of metal wire Damian well that's the electrical to the to the disposal you might be able to just leave it alone yeah do we have to now disconnect the dishwasher alright now for that if you look way up on the top of the garbage disposal you see a ring up there put this screwdriver right through that one of these loops right here whichever way you can reach them kind of pull it in that direction okay it's just a ring that's gonna rotate actually you go you're rotating okay alright now you see those two okay back there once hot once cold just reach in and turn those off now you see those pipes coming in from the top right just above the valve these yeah okay there you go here's a wrench oops thank you oh there we go we've disconnected all the plumbing but the sink is how the place is attached to the countertop so what I want you to do is lie on your back and have towel right here will help okay all right look up here between the sink my hairs all wet grab the faucet I'm good bye-bye now we go a bare sink here with no fittings on it it may look like we've taken a recess to sculpt some modeling clay but it's called plumber's putty we apply it to the sink flange and slide the flange through the hole in the sink then we slip on a fiber gasket a backup ring and a mounting ring the snap ring holds everything in place finally the entire assembly is tightened securely to the sink take your fingers and remove the excess all right to mount our faucet we first set the trim plate on the sink deck and then pass the faucet through next we turn the sink over slip the mounting bracket into place and hand tighten the mounting nut centered here with the faucet assembly in place we'll insert the sprayer hose through the center of the faucet and then pull that through and attach it to the discharge tube so we'll just drop this in through here right well these are different the other ones again the reason I like to do this this sake actually is gonna get glued into place with silicone to keep the adhesive from losing out onto the countertop we lay strips of masking tape around the opening this is silicone final time now we want to go high so we don't hit any of our dip your finger in a finger and drawn over the bead of silicone smooths it out and blends it in hot back under there you should see the water lines hanging down spray them onto the valves okay good now we're gonna put the garbage disposals all back now trick is to hold this up and then turn this collar so Natalie okay yes I need to attach hmm the the line that's coming from the dishwasher to the disposal okay nice and tight okay I'm sorry yep okay so what's next next I have to reattach the you pipe that right you what's called a p-trap this is how you shape piece of drain okay yep it's working really yeah you get it as tight as you can waters on mm-hmm drains attached yep let's fire it up all right what you do after consulting the directions it seems I've overlooked a key step we were supposed to flush out the water lines before attaching the pull-out spout so we unscrew the spout and do a little test it turns out most of the debris at the waterline got trapped in this screen washer so we rinse it out all right you gotta love it I do I love it you know this is taking know larger and opening and before here but because of this cutaway back here and the fact that it's deeper I love to me this looks like how much of big oh yeah definitely it really does and I think also because it's quite it just looks a lot moral it's great very interesting material I've check this out a little bit this is actually porcelain enamel okay over a sort of a metal base okay and then behind that is a composite that really gives this the feel and sound dullness but a fraction of the weight believe me if this had been cast-iron getting this in and out here would have been for two of us I thought it was gonna be harder than it was mm-hmm and I'm pretty impressed that I was able to do it but it still was a lot of hard work it wasn't just you know turning on and off the water so yeah let me give it one last shot I didn't mean to do it", "5V9oe4SRWKo": "loose razor blade and then i can just run my caulker right around there and then you can see right there how i'll have some up onto the actual stainless steel on the sink so go around to your other corners and i'll do the same exact thing across the back is actually where i want the largest bead of caulk up onto the stainless just because uh it's probably where water lays the most i do like to get a few of the paper towels wet if you haven't seen my countertop painting video maybe go check that out it's actually my most viewed video [Music] the key here is getting a consistent bead swipe my finger on the card or paper towel smooth it out i don't really uh right there's a little fat i would rather there be a little bit of shiny section of caulk than i would there be a damaged countertop back here i want this entire i want that entire area filled this is just my experience other people might have a different experience with rentals these are my experiences of eight years seven eight years whatever it is now of renting property these are the areas that get damaged and these are the areas that i try to improve on so if it's going to mean a fatter fatter b to caulk behind the sink then so be it but this area back here is notorious for just water i mean people just splash water and then don't clean it up i mean i wish it was different but people just don't really some people take care of my rental properties but not many so yeah only thing left to do is pull the tape and i like to pull it up and away i find that that gives the best result and i don't wait until the caulk dries to pull the tape pull it while it's wet you pull this you wait until this dries and it is not probably going to turn out very good for you but the only thing i need to do is throw that knob on there and that project is done check it off your list your honey-do list is done uh there is the old one so quite an improvement from that to that and patient and you can do it i promise hopefully you

science jeez I was gonna make a wax hand see your hand my hand I was gonna make a wax hand problem is I was using wax that I've used over and over again and it should've worked but it didn't I'm not sure why so I started throwing the wax out and something crazy happened I have new acts that I'm gonna use and I'm gonna color it blue to make some blue wax hands it's gonna be really cool we're gonna make lots of different shapes lots of different thumbs up signs and peace and all that cool stuff but for this wax I wanted to show you what happened when I flushed it down the toilet CJ what happened when I flushed it down the toilet don't mean gebel Hey oh they alarm fire alarm not exactly the fire alarm just went on for something else never a dull moment here but I poured it down the toilet and I want to show you what happened I also want to show you what happened when I tried to put the wax on my hand and make it a wax hand I think maybe there was some too much lotion in it cuz you need lotion hand lotion to make wax hands so here's a clip of me trying to pull my hand out of the wax hand and then I decided just to throw all the wax out and I poured it in a little bit of water and then I wanted to show you what happens when I poured it in a toilet bowl did not go down the drain I knew it wouldn't go down the drain but it was really cool to see what happened all right I will be making a cool blue wax hand video coming up yeah big hands yeah wax blue hands now very soon but for now I just want to show you what happened because I thought it was really cool you think that was cool okay but hey maybe you will too low did you think it was cool when I put the wax in the toilet oh sure what did you think is cool the toilet was cool oh you just think these rigs CJ you're gonna laugh see you guys all right no like yeah so as you see here this is actually black top black that's now cold wax is a wax fall out in the middle of making a wax hand videotutorial wax and to the point a tutorial can easily make a wax hand at home problem is there something up with this wax there's something different about it and I want to show you what happens when I try to pour it down the toilet now let me show you what happens now I think I have some ideas as to why it's about to happen I don't wanna ruin the surprise for you so let me pour it down and you'll see and then you can build comment below let me know why you think that's happening to the toilet bowl I hope this works like it did before help us just not like an epic fail even though the video is sort of based around that it can have to fail but I hope it doesn't fail on the film all right you know I'm Tracy alright let's see if it happens again I'm a trompe l'oeil kid one yeah there it is the contestant what that's happening this wax is hot wax [Music] it's just turning into salad Wow look at that it's actually hot that think I displaced all the water we need to add cold water to it what happened what happened was as you see here as soon as it hit the cold water it turned into further blacks because this hot wax is roll over hot cold water so in order to get the rest that's turn hard like this right here so just wax now look at that just a chunk just a chunk of wax and it makes for a good way to throw it out to dispose of it just add cold water to it and you'll just have hunks of wax to throw out instead of having to spill out all that hot wax I just hope I'm not fogging the toilets when I did it before I didn't have as much so the whole thing the whole thing just solidified right away with it oh look at that you see the clear water underneath look at that how cool is that look at that that is awesome so through the little math the I know but I the public school look at that look at that all clear look at that open none of it went down the toilet all of it just turned into sort of like a fart and actually the way to clean your toilet I'm definitely gonna happen I have to watch well after this man guys I did not expect it to really go all up and around yeah that is nasty but cool at the same time and yeah that's what happens when you flush hot wax down the toilet you and not wash it down because as soon as it hits the cold water it turns into hard wax and you'll just suck your toilet nothing will go down and even more so as you add the water it gets harder the wax gets harder and harder so yeah well anyway I'm working on that I'm working on the quest video I am working on a nature trip that we went on that we did amazing videos there it was so kind of milk

with hot water and leash and right now i don't have bleach but what i did here was to sprinkle my vinegar my cleaning vinegar and just like the way you wash um your dishwasher when you use the vinegar and um baking soda and that is what i did here what's he gonna be using the same the process of um fly lady but it's just i'm not going to be sucking it maybe i'll do it some other time but i'm not going to be soaking it with hot water according to fly lady but i'm just going to embrace washing this sink like the way i'll be washing some other part of my house maybe the bathroom the toilet the clothes even the plates that kind of care is what i want to give to the sink right now that i don't usually do so they saw the solution of my vinegar and their baking soda is what i'm trying to sprinkle around yeah we know everybody watch they are sing when they cook and all but this special care of coming to tell the same damn here for you you know there was this satisfaction after i finished it i was like wow i mean especially touching the other um washing a utensils or washing equipment you know actually washing them that these days for you not when you're washing plates and you wash everything but i'm just for this sink on this video you know i try to put make sure it goes round and some parts where the places that i have sprinkled um the vinegar solution yeah the cleaning vinegar yeah i have to put it here the baking soda around so that they had um water if there is already hard water let's stop melting everything so let's keep watching thanks [Music] whenever i see

for you and give my life away never leave me my love is forever [Music] so i'm all done now um if you look at it you might say ah what does she do here you know how you take your time out to wash your toilet i think um what fly lady did this idea is a very good one uh because everything here i know they are sparkling cleaners including the rack and um yeah i did i watched this one you know there are some people who are good at doing everything all at once but not everybody know how to do it all at once and the longer you leave and you start you start um seeing some stains around i have to like just do it so that there's something my husband always says maintenance is the key if you don't watch these things nobody will come out watch them for you so see how my sink is let me remove this normally when you finish washing places normally clean but you never know there are always some sticky things at the edges you know and i'm kind of happy i did this and um like what she recommended once a month you know you could do this once a month and um yeah you'll be satisfied so all these are clean i have to touch here there are people who do it i agree once and um they are done but the way you set out your time to clean your toilet i think this place also you should give it a time where you also clean so i want to say thank you for stopping by my channel today um thank you to fly lady for this wonderful idea i wish this thing can remain like this i wish you could remember like this but unfortunately i have to start dinner right now yeah hope you also try and give your sing some love and care so i want to say thank you very much for stopping by hope to see my next video bye", "-7kE8JN7t4c": "- [Instructor] Welcome\nto TomahawkDIY everyone. Today we're gonna take a\nlook at unclogging a drain. (water rushing) So if you have a bathroom\nsink drain that the water is backing up. (water rushing) It can be a pretty easy thing to fix. So if your sink fills up with water after running for a little bit, and it's backing up, it's pretty easy to fix. So let's take a look at how to do that. When doing this, one of the first things\nyou wanna do is remember you're gonna be taking off\nthe drain pipe down below. So, I like to do\nsomething to remind myself not to turn on the faucet. Otherwise you're gonna send water down to a place it's not going down the sewage. Alright, so under the sink. First, get these cleared out. Make sure you put a bucket of some kind under the goose neck, or the pee trap. You're gonna get a little\nbit of water that runs out. It may get a little bit smelly as well, I'll warn you of that. Because the purpose of\nthis goose neck here is that there is water that\nsits in here all the time, and that water acts as a\ntrap to block any sewer gas from finding its way back up. So, if you're every wondering\nwhy there's a goose neck, that's the reason. So, to work on this, we're\ngonna loosen these two rings. Some water is gonna start coming out. So just slide this thing down like so. I dump it out. Alright, I can see some hair in there, not a real pretty sight. Now next thing we're gonna\ndo is disconnect back here. There's this rod that actually goes back to the drain pipe up above. So, undo that. We've got to unscrew this. This one has gotten a little\nbit of corrosion on it. And we're gonna pull out all the piece. Okay? That's gonna allow us\nto pull this guy out. Okay? We're gonna set this aside, and we're gonna clean this off. And then, you can see all this hair and other junk backed up in here. So, to clean it out, I like to take a newspaper\nand work it down. It's gonna kinda chase everything down into the bucket below. I'm gonna use this big screwdriver, you can do something else\nin order to help push this down once my fingers\ncan't get it anymore. You pull that out at the bottom, and then send another one down. Now obviously make sure\nyou've taken the pee trap off down below before it starts\nsending the newspaper down. Otherwise it's not gonna work so well. You don't wanna try and\nsend this down to the sewer. You can use paper towels,\nor some other soft, flexible paper to do this. So let's see what happened down below. Alright, so now that I've\nchase all this junk out, now we're ready to work on\nputting the sink back together. Check out the inside of here, see if there is anything\nyou need to clean out. In this case there is. (shuffling paper) We got this thing cleaned out. So now we're gonna reconnect it. Slide it up, and get. See, there's these gaskets, so you're gonna get nice\nand tight right on the edge. Now before. I like to just tighten a\nlittle bit down on one side, and then come over the\nside and start tightening. You can do that. Work your way between the\ntwo rings on the pee trap as you tighten them down. And that will help the\ngasket sit nice and smooth. And get this guy cleaned off. (water running) Hopefully you don't have any drips. If you do, tighten things\ndown a little bit more. If for some reason you\nneed to replace some parts, I'll include a link down to\nAmazon where you can get some new pee traps and gaskets and things. I like to make sure I've\nwiped all the water off and then keep an eye on this\nover the next couple of days. Maybe leave a bucket down below, a dry bucket to check on, be sure there's no water leaking. So, there we have it. Now we've got our sink fixed, and pretty straight-forward, easy to do, save yourself some money\nfrom calling the plumber. Do it yourself.

the issue is though look at this gap right here is that it that's it all right so when this was first installed ten years ago it was pretty straightforward the countertop would have been inverted at the countertop shop or here and that sink would have been mounted that would have been caulking and a series of clips would have been drilled to make that sink attach type looks like those clips of either fail to come loose so now it is not that easy to repair this without pulling the countertop but we're going to try let me go to the truck and see if I can find these clips you ready to get under there I'm ready okay all right then I have spent a little time under here look at this here's one of the clips right here at stainless steel is a wing nut right here and look at how loose it is it's completely loose writing it so it's not holding up tight and this is actually the best one you've got right behind it look that one's gone completely over here looks like the faucet has leaked and this clip is completely rotted away see it and the one in the back is much better so really one out of four those do anything so it's hanging on by a thread what I want to do is I want to get the weight off of the sink and that means I'm going to disconnect this disposer and break these plumbing connections that we can try to drop the sink okay okay this should drop right down okay okay so all of our clips are loose let's see if it drops now okay they're good okay now what are our chances of getting this thing out of here Hey look at that a little aptitude test yeah worked all right good just set that aside now we want to clean up this surface down here we're gonna have to clean up that sink too all right all that caulking is gone thank you very much thank you all right so now we got to think about reattaching the sink and I was able to find new clips to replace those rotted ones looking how bad they were and here was the screws that are also rotted now what's really important is the way that a sink is attached into granite you know you don't want to have a hole drilled and try to use a conventional concrete screw or a wood screw any screw that as you tighten it it gets fatter and fatter because you can actually put force inside the grant and split the granite like the old feathers and wedges okay so what they've got is these little brass in sets you can see they're threaded and these are already up inside the granite right now and because they're breasts they're still good so we can reuse them okay but I was able to find the matching machine screw and wing nut right here we'll put a washer on we're in business great you let me put my thumb on the bracket so it takes a weight off it no no we're going to do is catch them loose okay this one okay is too okay all of our clips are just set loosely in place once you grab the sink and drop it back into place okay we'll get it down through the opening okay there you go thank you it came out it has to go back in right that's right hopefully okay so now just let it come down I'm gonna hold it down below okay now there's a tube of caulking somewhere right around there you see it yep it's all set to go why don't you take it and put a bead of caulking around the center of the rim of the sink all the way around you you good yep alright alright so now if you're set I'm going to push this up and you'll notice I have a little string tied into the drain do you see it I do I just pull it up yet let's pull it up and you're gonna happen that you can put your other hand and the other drain where the disposer goes okay you like that yeah I think that that's good okay so now you hold that up I'm gonna make some of these clips up okay holding now the caulking is going to take a couple of hours to cure so to add a little additional upward pressure I've got a couple of pieces of blocking to hold that sink up tight to the bottom now while the caulking is wet use your clean finger and just let's smooth it around to make a nice clean edge under the granite add more caulking if you need it now we just need to reconnect the drain lines and reinstall the disposer I tell you did a great job on the caulking looks great cleaned up perfect and the sinks upward should be so that's good now I'd like you to leave that blocking in for another day or so right let that stuff really cure and maybe not use the sink tonight take your wife out dinner actually love that okay you you", "QAryDSASo4g": "day to day care of your integrated DuPont set a narrow sink is very similar to looking after your bench top for simple cleaning take a damp cloth or sponge and clean up the spilt food or drink for more stubborn marks like dried red wine or coffee it may be necessary to use soapy water or a household cleaner like Ajax spray and wipe and damp cloth be sure to remove all excess water to avoid buildup of residues from materials dissolved in the water from time to time it may be desirable to give your DuPont set a narrow sink a deep clean to do so use an abrasive cleaner like jeff cream cleanser but unlike your bench top a scotch brite pad can be used it is important that you clean the entire sink to obtain an overall finish in much the same way as polishing a car do not use this technique on our bench top or you risk creating a dull surface you can also give your sink a back to new look and remove those stains with a diluted bleach solution fill your sink with a mixture of 30 mils of bleach such as white king per liter of water let it stand for 30 minutes and drain your integrated DuPont set a narrow sink is a contemporary and stylish design element however it is more sensitive to thermal shock as compared to stainless steel and so it is recommended that you partially fill will have some cold water running when pouring boiling water directly from the cooktop into the sink you", "MtNB44pKIT0": "[Music] hi i'm ethan tucker from hadar let's kosher our sinks for pessa capturing a sink is pretty straightforward unless it's not and let's go with the straightforward case you've got a stainless steel sink or something else made of metal that is valid for koshering through pouring boiling water over first thing you got to do is clean out your sink the faucet and any other knobs or valves that are a part of the sink apparatus one of the places going to want to start is the catch the drain at the bottom of the sink depending on its nature it may be difficult to clean out so if you can that's great if not you may need to get a new one for pesa something that's made of a fine wire mesh that has little particles of food in there that's the kind of thing you probably need to invest a few bucks in getting a new one but otherwise once you've got everything out of the drain you're going to want to scrub down the whole surface of the sink at that point you let it sit for 24 hours and then you take a kettle a tea kettle is usually the easiest way to do this and get the water to a boil if you can't for some reason wait the 24 hours you can also put some soap in the boiling water in order to make sure that it will neutralize anything it comes in contact with and at that point you just work carefully over the surface of the sink in order to cover every part of the surface with that boiling water and after you're done you'll then want to just rinse it with cold water from the tap now if the sink is made of another material like a ceramic material or something else that we don't traditionally kosher and you don't have a good option of cautioning it through boiling water so in that case you're going to have to just basically put distance between you and the surface and there's a couple ways of doing that you can get a you know a special grate that you put on the bottom and then put in a sink insert basically a wash basin with some kind of drain on the bottom uh and that becomes kind of your sink within a sink for the uh duration of pesa another option is you can cover the actual surface of the sink with maybe one or two layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil which should be able to withstand the use that you'll put the sink through even if you're using heavy duty foil to cover the bottom of the sink you'll still want some kind of rack in there just to be able to do your dishes over the course of pesach back in the beta miktash in the temple we're told that various vessels that were used for preparing the sacrifices after you used them they would be scrubbed and then the shutoff and then rinsed off with cold water and it seems that actually some of this practice is an echo of the ways in which our homes are our own temples the vessels that we use in our kitchen are our best approximation today of what it is to offer a sacrifice to god and this is connected in one of many ways to how pesach today is this kind of sacred preparation of our kitchen to do something of a much more elevated nature i hope you enjoyed watching this

don't forget to hit the like button", "QY0zXqA3Vb0": "hi friends we just had an amazing Memorial Day barbecue and hosted a bunch of friends Timothy made amazing pulled pork I pulled together some incredible if I do say so myself cole slaw cornbread and salads and beans but stupid me when I go to clean up I decided to just kind of throw the extra food down on the disposal oh yeah that was genius I just thought that maybe I just suppose I could actually eat up some cabbage and name stuff but I'm wrong so first thing we're gonna do is try the plunger because this little sink plunger very different than the toilet plunger the shape is actually different so you want to make a nice seal this me flatmates nicely over on the bottom under sinker and then you also wanna make sure you have a rag to cover it hip two sinks here to cover it up so that the air and water doesn't push out from one head so what you want to do is hop in here and one end a couple little water in there so it's mostly pushing water and not air you should hear things kind of moving in there and hopefully this is enough to clear it it's a good look and hopefully it should start draining it doesn't rain oh man how many times you try glasses blender is not working the next we need to do is check out the p-trap which is under the sink so P trap is this u-shaped piece under here there's a little bit of water in here and what it does is it prevents gases from coming back up into your sink but it also helps sediment something it can get stuck in there so we have to remove this see if there's eggs in there and then hopefully that will clear the drain okay so not looking good but here we go he's gonna open up the p-trap soap we'll see what's in there could be a lot of junk coleslaw potential coffee grounds after knows we've never opened something's Magdalene so these are actually kind of nice little collars that you can twist off [Music] make sure you started to close SLC water though right oh my gosh oh my god slide and explosion yeah oh so what now you just clean that and this looks like it's clear clearly yeah so now I'm gonna pockets back to behind the wall why we can take a snake and now we need to make it I feel like the biggest idiot and the worst part I knew it wouldn't work I just thought I was in a hurry and why not trying to throw a bunch of gunk down my disposal we pulled out the drain hugger during a snake pretty simple release this button here into the pipe that goes into the wall and then when you reach the blockage turn this counterclockwise and it should start to grab it and pull it back out winning this you can't attend to your drill you want more power so some of these come with a drill attached but this one you can use whatever tool you have so this way to tap to train yourself makes it faster okay wait and so question our dishwasher has been a little funky so hopefully reflected here so I don't know where this is gonna end up but hopefully it will take care of that so you feel when you just hit the end okay loosen it up a little bit and got past 25 feet I got through some one thing I'm going to try it again and see how far I can go with this and seems any more blockages further back up here [Music] a weird because before it went like 2052 work gloves so the bucket did don't come out necessarily if they're just breaking that down okay buddy come back down okay in the bathroom ever seen a bunch of hair come on so I'm just gonna pull it back and they won't hook it up again and see if that cleared everything okay [Music] it's kind of anticlimactic I expected a giant hunk of junk to come out but well hopefully that junk is broken up now it'll just go down the drain [Music] that's good that's right [Music] we have success yay success no need to call a plumber just call Timothy thank you babe [Music]", "4dV-AmouAFc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] and the little plate here I got from Target so now let's move under the sink so as you know under the sink is a difficult space to organize because of all the plumbing it makes it difficult to kind of maneuver around that to maximize your space and so I want to show you the tips that I use to kind of help me out and now what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to take you on my journey of putting this together so you can see actually how I did it in my thought process for doing it this way it really works great number one I only keep the things that I need under my kitchen sink under my kitchen sink so the first thing you're gonna have to do is you're gonna have to purge get really anything that just really does not need to be there and then determine what do I really use under my kitchen sink now I want to show you my kitchen sink where it is empty and you can see here that it has a lot of plumbing under here which makes it difficult for me to have just kind of a clean kind of way to organize it now I can maximize this space here because it's really open I can go all the way back so this is prime real estate here under my sink now the garbage disposal takes up the center part of it and there's plumbing on the other side so it's really not as valuable there but I'm still going to show you a way that I kind of worked around that space now we put a new garbage disposal in when we renovated our kitchen here and it's larger than the one we had so I have even less space than I had before but the first thing I did was I lined my kind of under the cabinet and you want to put a liner down because this will help things not move around and then it just helps in case something spill also now the first thing I did was I found this organizational tool that I got on Amazon and I'll link it in the description box below but it fit perfectly in that spot and it gives me so much space not only I can go vertically up and I can sit additional baskets on that shelf which is perfect below it also has this drawer which is absolutely great storage now to sit on top of the shelf there I have these baskets that I'm using throughout my kitchen to organize it I got it from Target they're lined you will remember this from my coffee bar video but I also have them under my kitchen cab now I'm not going to use the liner for under my cabinet because it's such a dark space and I want to be able to see all of my items easily so I can get to them easily so I'm just taking that liner out and I'm simply going to use the wire part of the basket so here is how that all fits that space and look how much I can fit in there it really does fit a lot very efficiently and I can easily get to it so you see I'm maximizing that great valuable real estate right there where it's not interrupted by any plumbing so this is perfect to fit a lot of items now I want to show you how I have this section here organized in the first basket I have cleaning the items such as my disinfectant wipes my granite wipes for my countertops I also have my stainless steel wipes for my appliances in my kitchen and then I have my stovetop cleaner there so it all fits nice this is stuff that I use everyday and it works great now in the second basket I have my microfiber cleaning cloths I do not keep my dish cloth under my kitchen cabinet I keep that in my coffee bar you'll remember that from my coffee bar video and and so you know it's efficient I just replaced all of my cleaning cloths my microfiber with some new ones I'll link where I got those things for below on Amazon but of course you guys know out this color when I shop I tend to gravitate towards this color so you will see that under my cabinet seems to be the majority of this color but that's fine you guys know how I love to coordinate colors anyway and so back here is all of my hand wash mind stuff to replace the hand wash that sits on top of my kitchen sink area so it all fits in there nice and then individual in the drawer here I just have my dish soap here a supply of that along with additional dishwasher cabs and my let me shine kind of additives for my dishwasher and things like that all housed there and I use a pantry they deliver my cleaning supplies every month so I don't have to you know worry about it so it's just really easy for me to use them I like it and you guys know if you've been with me a while I love the basil scent of Miss Myers and it's not because of the color but I do love the color of the packaging but I do love the product and the scent is just amazing so this is how I have that section now on to the more difficult part to organize under the sink and that's in front of the garbage disposal because it's a tight space so I found these acrylic organizers and solutions in target I love them because they came in small medium and large they were the perfect fit for that area because they fit in that area and allowed me to store plenty of items and it was not disruptive to the dishwasher or to anything else so you can see here they're stackable and again because they come in to various sizes it was great because I could house the different things that I needed to house so it worked great and even though I have some behind the bar there it still worked great because I just put the things that I didn't use everyday on the middle section there but I still can get to them easily because these are stackable I just lift one up and can get to it now here I keep my dishwasher tab so that I can just take the lid off at night grab one throw in the dishwasher works easy I have my replacements down there I have my SOS pads here and I want to give you a quick tip I've shared this tip before but what I do with my SOS pads is I cut them in fourths I find that this saves money because a lot of times I don't really need a whole SOS pad and when I cut them in fourths it gives me the perfect sized piece to kind of clean and do what I need to do so that's just a tip to save money in that area there but then also here in the center part this is where I store like I said those things that I really don't have to get to every night but I still want to get to and they're still simple to get to as you see I can just lift it and grab it so it's really still easy it's not anything that's hard to get to so in the portion there I keep my still kind of scrubbers there I keep essential oils that I use in my kitchen I keep disposable gloves in case I have guests who are helping me clean in the kitchen around holidays they can grab a pair of disposable gloves and then I have disposable dish cloths which I rarely use those but still wanted to keep those under the sink so again those are things that need it to be under my kitchen sink but nothing necessarily that I accessed everyday but still is so simple to you know get to and then here I keep my eraser pads and my sponges okay for another challenge in space I had this area here that had piping so I could not go all the way back so I had to get creative so I have this acrylic like organizer that I used in my other refrigerator but I did not use it in this one it's where you put bottles in it and so I'm going to use this as a riser and that way I can set a basket on top of it and easily make use of that vertical space that I have and it works out so great and then I have my cleaning caddy which sits in front of that so you don't even see the acrylic riser so it works out great but it gives me that you know area there that I could really use and I keep my kitchen diffuser in that area but I want to say my husband gave me some tools for our garbage disposal and he said that these really needed to stay close to the garbage disposal not that he would use him at any time but they belong to the garbage disposal so I got this little plastic bin from Target put them in there and then what I did was I store this under the sink under the garbage disposal because you don't have to get to it but we know where it's at and then in the little basket I have my diffuser here and if you're interested in my specific diffuser I'll link it in the description box below but this is the one for my kitchen so that after I clean at night I can just run it and it gets all that keen smells and everything out of the air and get my kitchen back fresh so on the door I simply have just two items and I use command strips I have the plug for my sink there and I also have my cleaning gloves and I have them on a hook here and Alejandro from home organizing you all know her and she recommended this in one of her videos about a year or so ago and I thought it was the neatest thing to clamp your gloves on to your kitchen sink so that's what I've done there and I'm easily able to get to them so very simple on the doors there so this is how I have under my kitchen sink organized and how I maximize the space because it is a tricky space to organize so I hope I've shared some tips with you that have been helpful I tried to kind of show you how I did it in case this is an area that you're working on in your house I also want to encourage you to go over to my Instagram I'm going to be sharing all of my kitchen cabinets and everything with you and I kind of give you heads up on Instagram and Facebook also but I would love to have you over there and by the way my husband said to tell you all thank you for your for comments when I posted our picture the other night he really was excited to hear from all of you and also I'll be doing a coordinating blog post on my website at home with Nicki calm if you want to check that out I'll be sharing a lot of my kitchen stuff over there as I do it I hope you all are doing great I'll see you at the next video if you're not a subscriber I would love to have you and this is Nicki saying goodbye [Music]", "hWuiHcFn6yg": "now what I want to do is I want to dive into some of your comments and questions from this week [Music] as we are transported into the via the land of the comments section on my kitchen sink video and on my kitchen sink video which is actually my very very first video it goes through how to pick out a kitchen sink the questions you need to ask the terms you need to be aware of when you're shopping for a kitchen sink you what they mean how they affect you the you know this is all very important and that kitchen sink video has been getting lots of love lately on that could you sink video Annetta says what are the price points for each material does that vary with the type of installation what do you think about gold tone sinks now so I'm gonna go fullscreen for a second and talk about that Aneta so that is an awesome question and I love awesome questions with the materials yes as a general rule and this is just general because it varies from manufacturer to manufacturer it depends on how the manufacturer determines value of their product as well so but raw material wise stainless steel is less expensive than a porcelain product and stainless steel is also sometimes less expensive than a composite granite copper is a very expensive metal and tends to be much higher priced now this is in general now here's the thing it depends on where the material is coming from as well stainless steel from Italy costs a lot more than stainless steel from China yes what I'm painting for you is a very broad spectrum it depends on each brand there's you know Blanco has Chinese stainless sinks that they sell for three four five hundred dollars Blanco also has some actual German sings stainless steel that are actually made in Germany and they sell those stainless steel sinks for $1,600 $1,600 on Ceres but that's a chinese-made product even though LK is an American manufacturer they sell the Crosstown series forth I get three four or five hundred dollars and depending on which model you pick and what size and all that other good stuff but when you look at the LK luster tone series which is made in the United States prices like again two or three times the price the that compared to the Crosstown so it just depends mythologize that that's a very vague answer yes as a general rule undermount sinks are a little bit well here's the thing now economics comes into play as well not just material not just country of origin but economics now now it's supply and demand it's marketing a brand that you see everywhere that does a ton of marketing is probably going to be a higher price also supply and demand so everybody wants undermount sinks so you take two sinks that are fairly equal ones a drop in and once an undermount the undermount is going to cost more than the drop in even though the drop in technically would probably have a little bit more material in it because again supply and demand more people want undermount sinks so they are going to be slightly at higher priced again these are general rules these are I'm sure if you're diligent enough you will come up with some way to prove me wrong because there's going to be some manufacturer that doesn't do what I just said however there's gonna be a lot of manufacturers that do so these are just some general rules general guidelines for you to go now gold-tone sinks most of the gold-tone sinks that you see out there like Revati and stuff like that I just did a video on that maybe a week ago I actually filmed it back in February when I went to cavas but I released it about a week ago and that is their gold tone sinks or brass tone sinks are actually stainless steel sinks that are anodized likewise so is rolls now roll and Revati both you know say their product comes from Italy but the Revati is gonna be a lot more price conscious from what I've seen so I hope that helps you out I'm going to leave a quick summary of this discussion in the comment section here however I really would like you to watch this whole thing Aneta if you could and go from there so we're gonna say we're gonna apply to another high the answer to your question was not a short one and make sure you're subscribed so you never miss an episode ooh", "h6W0-EajBG8": "the powder thank you you", "91mZrnZ2cWs": "hello are you supervising me keeping an eye on what I'm doing lovely oh yeah functional at the beach Dahlia hello so today we're looking at how to clean white fiberglass sinks we'll start the clock now be quite honest thief sinks have been a bit of a bane of my life the method that I've used on these steel sinks hasn't been very effective not being sure what to do to get the best finish on these sinks so I've actually reverted back to a a product that I was allowed to go back to which is cream cleaner I found it's the best thing for getting rid of all these stubborn marks but you can see I'm using a magic sponge it is absolutely shredding the cream clear after who shreds the magic sponge however it does do a very good job of getting rid of all the dark marks on the sink unit it's totally shredding that sponge once you've cleaned it all up with the cream cleaner in the magic sponge rinse it all off using a microfiber cloth and plenty water just to get rid of it all out of the way the reason I don't like cream cleaner is because he does have a tendency to leave a residue the spray bottle eating see there that's just standard oxidizing bleach a thin bleach which I'm spraying and leaving and the reason why the clocks moving faster is while this was taking effect I've gone off to do some work on the hop so using a fresh magic sponge I'm just gonna clear away all the bleach and the bleach is actually helped get rid of some of the remaining marks I'm applying a second application thin bleach leaving it again while I go off and do something else on the hop it's just a way of multitasking so that I get more things done while I'm at work again just rinsing off with a magic sponge just to get rid of all of bleach as you can see it's done a really good job now what you'll see me pointing out here there are marks in the sink they were actually scratched on the surface and it's gone right through unfortunately nothing will get rid of that it is actually damage to the surface so all this acrylic needs now is drying up and buffing on with a dry towel and this is what it looks like when it's done so I'm quite chuffed with that and the customers really happy I'm just glad to get it looking a lot better if you like this please give me a thumbs up you can subscribe by clicking on my head and here's a couple of other videos that you might also like like very much for watching see you soon bye you", "_WVDfoc_uws": "[Music] a few turns out just a little bit hey guys it's Breanna sorry world cup craziness is going on in our house right now Adam and Lanson are watching the game it's Russia versus Spain and looking like what are they getting into Adam it's getting into penalty kick so it's like super exciting I can see the TV a little bit from my little vantage point over here but my kitchen sink is horrendous it isn't such a need of just a clean organization so I'm really excited to tackle this with you guys today and show you again the hot mess the before you know I will always show my real mess with you guys and then clean it all up and I've got a couple of different organization bins and ideas I've been watching some tricks from best their beauty and do it on a dime they're some of my favorites oh I get inspiration from regularly also I watch the video I think it's at home with Nicki so I've gotten all these ideas from these other cleaning gurus on YouTube and I'm gonna see what will actually work with what I need underneath the kitchen sink today so keep watching and you'll get to see the hot mess - all cleaned up at the end hopefully um after I clean and organized underneath my kitchen sink alright so this is the current state of affairs the before it's just sloppy like I tried to have some bins to sort of keep things organized but there's clearly a lot of things I just don't fit and it's I mean it's just it feels like very sloppy to me and I just think there's a lot of stuff that I'm gonna be able to purge first and then just underneath here it's like really gross I think I might actually line the bottom of these even though I hate putting in liner but I think it probably really needs it just so that it's easier to keep clean in general [Music] so if you're not already subscribed I really hope you click the red subscribe button especially if you like cleaning videos because next week on my channel I'm going to have a new cleaning video to motivate and inspire you Monday through Friday so every single day I'm so excited but first thing I'm doing and getting everything out from underneath my kitchen sink so I can figure out what exactly I need to keep under there what I can purge and then I want to clean it out really really good I'm going to use hot water on a microfiber cloth with the mrs. meyer's honeysuckle multi-surface spray this is one of their summer scents I'm obsessed with it lately and next week there's a new offer from grow where you can get a mrs. meyer's gifts back with one of their new summer scents so be on the lookout for that I will have the link up on my channel next week but I needed to dry off what I'd cleaned I wanted to make sure that the contact paper would stick really well to the surface and if you saw my family command center video you know contact favor and I do not get along well sometimes but this actually wasn't that bad today and I know moving forward it's going to be so much easier to clean underneath the sink since the contact paper is there [Music] has an update because it still looks pretty messy even though the contact paper is in there what I tried to do was just like group like things and I pulled out like all of the different types of organization bins that I could possibly be using and I'm so sad because I ordered this on Amazon and I wanted to use this hack I saw investor beauty and it's just not going to fit like the way that the door is designed I know if you can see like because of this notch here like I'm just not able to even attach it so I think I'm going to use this other trick I saw or you can use like these command hooks and this to like hang a little basket on the door but I'm sort of figuring out I think this is all of the stuff I know it looks messy but this is all the stuff I'm gonna find a new home for I think maybe store in our laundry room where I have some cleaning supplies but these are the things I'm like reaching for all of the time in the kitchen so I'm going to figure out like which of these bins then actually even fit under this thing because I think because of our garbage disposal in these pipes it's just a little bit tricky so [Music] and if you guys have watched like my pantry organization videos there pretty much anything when I'm organizing you know I really love these chalk labels I found them at a craft store but I also found some on Amazon recently too so I will link them down below in case you like using these types of chalk labels but people always ask who I actually attach them to my basket so I'll show you how I do it alright so with my hot glue gun I will just take the glue gun put the glue on like the inside of the bin there and then just with this string and apologies I'm doing this one-handed so it might look a little goofy but I just push the string into the glue and then you've got your chalkboard label to hang so I grouped everything that I use every single day or at a minimum once a week and I use those chalk labels and label the two bins so one bins going to be for all of my regular cleaning products and the other bin will be for all of my dish detergent dish soaps kitchen hand soap sponges and scrubbers and I also labeled two jars that I had for the different detergent packets I have basil vented and lemon scented so labeled each of those [Music] [Music] [Music] and I'm pretty sure I've seen Britney on basser beauty show this but I just used to command hooks and attach this dollar-store wire bin and I decided him to use it for my garbage bags on the other side I'm using the same command hooks and I decided to use them to hang up my three different cleaning gloves that I have I think this is a great hack especially if you live in a small space and under the kitchen sink is a small space so this just saves a ton of room all right I'm gonna give you a little tour to show you how it all turned out behind door number one I hung my different cleaning gloves that I have and this little two-tiered drawer stand I found on Amazon I will link it down below but I decided to make this where I would have all of my different dish soaps so I have my different method dish soaps here and then my dishwasher detergent I put in these little airtight containers that I just used the chalkboard labels so the basil scented ones and the lemon scented ones but in this container and these wet containers are from Target I'll have them linked to but again I just hot glued my chalkboard labels to this and I have all of my different mrs. Myers dish soaps and hand soaps and lotions in here along with some of my sponges in the back there and scrubber brushes but next week during clean week I'll share all of these new summer scents that are out that Grove sent me and there will be an offer on these next week during clean week so make sure you check back for that door number two I use this Dollar Tree hack these little bins are from the Dollar Tree and these little command hooks and this is where I decided I'll just put our garbage bag rolls I have to get another one of these I'm actually out of recycling bags anyways but I think I'm going to keep the garbage bags and one and then I'll put the recycling bags below it and then in this other bin this is just all of the different cleaning supplies so I have all of my different kitchen cleaning supplies that I'm grabbing on regular basis so I've been using this heavy duty degreaser on my stove and microwave I use the wood for good on my kitchen table that has a wood top I use the method glass and surface on glass of course but I also use this for my stainless steel so that's one I'm grabbing all of the time and then I like using the mrs. meyer's multi-surface for my countertops when I'm cleaning them and behind kind of everything I've got my two different method for cleaner so I the squirt and mop that's the lemon verbena and then I also have the wood for good that's almond scented for our wood floors but I feel like everything does just look WAY tidier then it did originally and I especially this is like my favorite part I think is seeing those labels I like when things are nice and neat and labeled and there's a place for everything now these are the things I use on a daily basis and it will be super easy to find whatever it is that I need right underneath my kitchen sink and now i'm swatching the office so if you hear that music watching the office in the other room but if you guys liked this kitchen sink cleanup video make sure you click that thumbs up button don't forget if you're new to subscribe because next week is going to be clean week so Monday through Friday I'm gonna have a new cleaning video for you guys and I've got some really unique ones that are gonna be coming out so things I don't ordinarily clean or organize on my channel will be next week during clean weeks so make sure that you're subscribed and have those bill notifications turned on so you get five full days of cleaning motivation next week I will see you my next video I love one fast edit I decided to use these shower curtain hanging clips to hang the gloves up this way because I realized since these were pretty wet this is just more practical so that I can hang them up in here so that they dry and I'm able to like shut the door after I live with this over the next week I will let you know if I add or change anything during my cleaning videos so make sure you're subscribed I love [Music]", "zTfGx-DG_0M": "this is called red card the lines the direction of the lines you see going all the lines are going this way please birth me which way the lines are going in your sink these are scratches here and a deep scratch here let me get this out now I'm going to take the pad I'm going to move the pattern the direction of the lines since the direction is going to say the first scratch has been removed so now the second scratch is over here all right well that scratch is gone there's one more scratch over here Rolston remove Doc's breath depending on how deep the scratches are you may need to send in one area longer than others but please make sure the direction of the pad is going the same direction as original lines on the sink - thank you", "1BVm0_RMHdw": "If you ever find yourself with the kitchen sink That's clogged do yourself a favor before you call a plumber, Try using a plunger, if you have the right plunger and the right technique Most clogs can be fixed without having to pay a plumber to come out and do it for you And in this video I'm going to show you how to unclog a kitchen sink a double basin sink to be more specific There's a trick I want to show you I'm gonna go change first. Do me a favor subscribe to our YouTube channel There should be some type of button or link that looks like this down below, it'd mean the world to me Appreciate you watching our videos. Let's go unclog a kitchen sink Now this plunger is really good for sinks It's got a flat surface and creates a good seal over the opening. Now if you've got a double basin sink like this one is, what you're going to want to do is plug Whatever hole you're not plunging because you want to be able to take full advantage of the the force of every plunge that you make and if you don't plug this other side the air can just come up the Other side, so grab a sink plug or even a rag stuff it in the hole make sure you're getting a good seal Place over the opening 10 really good firm plunges, you might have to repeat that a couple of times Hopefully that dislodges and gets the water flowing again If you still have a sink that is not draining call Any Hour Services we have drain professionals that can unclog sinks, tubs, toilets, showers Even the sewer main line that connects out to the city, whatever issues you're having.

And in this video i'm gonna show you both scrub subscribe ah scrubscribe Is there such thing as a scrubscribe button?", "XVAU1ZWL-7Y": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel first I want to apologize for my voice because I'm getting over a cold and my voice is just completely changed today I'm going to be rearranging and reorganizing the under the sink cabinet because it has been over a year now and this cabinet did not hold up well everything is not in its place it's just a disaster in there and then I'm just gonna show you guys what I picked up from Grove collaborative I've been using them for way before I started YouTube I actually started using this company from a youtuber so yeah I always pick these up I love the walnut scrubber sponges I have four packs of them there's two and then I do cut them in half because I feel like I work better when I have like a grape of just half of the sponge and it lasts longer and because these I mean these works so well and then I have these pads right here I haven't tried these pads so I'm excited to do so I just picked up three glass bottles for my windows I'm leaving these all in each bathroom I have three bathrooms and then I just picked up this mrs. manners like I need any more of these but I just picked up this scent it's called it's just radish scent and then I have that dish soap I don't really pick up the hand soap because I do use like these from Bath and Body Works I just have the Christmas one still but I really like this I just picked those up because I love the smell of them and I love having foam hand soaps instead of just a regular Kjell ones and then of course I love love love love these all-purpose cleaning cloths these are the best cleaning thoughts out there I used to try the ich lots I don't like the e cloth honestly and I just I swear by these I got three four packs of the three there's a three pack variety and I've had so much more of these and I just loved them but I did pick up some too so I can keep them in my kitchen which is why I'm showing you guys because this is for my kitchen these products as you can tell I don't really like them um like at first I was liking them I was liking the smell of them but you really don't do much I don't know what is the hype with this company like these are just trash I feel bad because it's like all the way fall but I don't know I don't really like them I overdo it with dish soaps [Music] and this is literally it's called real simple it's the worst product ever it does not at all work on my camera tops like I don't I don't know I don't see any difference in this with this thing it doesn't shine it just leaves the product like on top of the granite this is crap [Music] late at night and died at least when I know [Music] so I did pick up this liner at the dollars of liner that I have which is fine I don't really care about covering every inch of this place so I am just going to work with what I have also something I decided to use this time is this lazy susan I don't even know if this is a lazy susan but it's something similar where it just spins and I did have this in the fridge but realize this would be so good for like products that I use on a daily weekly basis and just to have them displayed and I can just turn it around because sometimes whenever I have the baskets and I put it back it doesn't always end up getting put back in the baskets whereas with this I feel like I would just easily place everything back on this and I'm just going to place it right here and I can just spin it around to get whatever I need to get now I am still keeping this we don't really use the dishwasher as much only if we have like a really insane amount of dishes which probably never happens but I still keep this around just in case you know why the unit [Music] so these two containers were part of like a makeup organizing set that I had in my bathroom and I don't really need it excuse me Mia will you uh what are you doing anyway I don't need them for just anything anymore so what I decided to do is put all my sponges and just small things that I have like a lot of amounts of yes and then I picked up this a while ago I think I wanted to do like a pantry organization but until I get my wood shelves that can't have happened right now so yeah these are just stickers chalk stickers that I'm going to place right here and right here and I'm going to just label them I guess so let's go ahead and clean this out first [Music] okay um so like I said I'm going to start cutting these sponges [Music] got no limits I like that you're free I wanna be there with you Jason tries to take the way [Music] Oh in a way that I just can't but [Music] so there's three of them and I think I'm going to add one to this um just because I have an extra one so let's go ahead on like them I am just using this chalk craft marker from Hobby Lobby this was also from popular [Music] I used to be so now I can't be alone but I see [Music] now I do have these old baskets that I had in here and here I'm just going to put everything that I use but a lot on a regular basis and I won't be putting them in the back just so it's out of the way [Music] my father [Music] [Music] so this basket right here that I used to have I'll be filling up these towels right here just so I can have in the kitchen and I don't have to be running around in the bathrooms trying to get some whatever I need to clean this area of the house I need something from you and I need something Oh [Music] you're moving with the lights they follow in the night you always doing right [Music] you may not know me but I know your love it's around me [Music] [Music] under an above it's something I gotta say before we fade away [Music] you may not know me but I know your laugh it's around me [Music] so this is what I came up with and I feel like it's so much more functional and just works so much better so starting off with this basket I purchased this from Burlington about a year ago and so is that basket in the back that I'm going to show you they were just from Burlington there's a lot of like baskets like these on at Hobby Lobby and I've also found some in the Dollar Tree and then I have this dishwasher pods just as container that I got from Burlington as well about a year ago I literally bought nothing this time around and just used things around the house that felt like it would be like a perfect spot in here but yeah this was just from Burlington and then these stickers with the chalk pencil were from Hobby Lobby a year ago but I never used them so did not buy them this time she's so needy and then there's like I said this was a girl so I did not buy this separate but I did look online on Amazon to see how much they were and it was like less than $20 for two of them and they are stackable so like you could always put like a third one and then here I just have my sponges and my pads and Magic Erasers so back here I am just keeping things that I use but like not on a daily basis like things like you know stainless steel wood extra dish soap extra granite cleaner my bar keeper's friend that i love and an extra these right here and then back there have my floor cleaner and a dish soap refill and then I love this layout that I did I love this spinny lazy susan replica or whatever it is it was just from Walmart I think it was like six or seven dollars I picked it up a couple months ago when I redid my fridge organization and instead of in the fridge I just decided it goes so much better in here it's so much like more free and then everything that I have here is things that I use like on a daily basis like multi-surface spray I have extra dish soap so I don't have to go all the way back there I can just have one here this is my window cleaner and then I have a heavy degreaser which I use every day and then I am using this branded cleaner right now and I really like it so yeah just like this so I really like this this is just such a good way to add storage and just organize your cabinet and then last but not least I China DIY this this had like the hooks to the door here where it would show like from the outside of the door and I just cut them off because I didn't really I wasn't going to use it like that because it does not close right so I just used some command hooks to hook it I spray painted it white so it's not like too noticeable because it was like a dark brown color like a bronze color and then I just have a multi-service cleaner I really hope you guys enjoyed this updated video of my cabinet organizing system I'm so happy with how it turned out and the fact that I literally got rid of a huge trash bag of used products and things that just did not work for me if

Channel today I'm decluttering and organizing the cabinet underneath my kitchen sink as you can see this is where I keep all of my cleaning supplies and it has turned into a huge disaster so the first thing I'm gonna do is remove everything and wipe the cabinet out [Music] here is everything that came out of my cabinet [Music] [Applause] [Music] now that that is done I'm going to go through each item and decide whether I want to keep it or get rid of it I'm going to throw away any trash and consolidate some of the same cleaning products into one if I can and also get rid of any products that I don't like or use anymore [Music] now I'm gonna go through my microfiber cloth there are a lot that I don't like because they aren't good quality so I don't like cleaning with them those are the ones that I'm gonna pick out and get rid of here is everything after I went through it all I went ahead and grouped everything into sections so I could figure out how I wanted to organize everything into bins and this is all of the stuff that I decided to get rid of before starting this project I knew I had to come up with some kind of clever ways to organize everything so I did go on Pinterest and I found some cute organization ideas that I will be using if you want to follow me on Pinterest I will leave my link down below in the description box so the first thing I'm gonna work on is my dishwasher detergent container I'm gonna label the box with this decal that are ordered from a local business where I live and I'm sure you can find these on etsy or just find some kind of shop they can make these for you I bought this plastic storage container from Target for $10 and it's obviously where I'm gonna store all of my dishwasher tablets and I did find this idea on Pinterest and it's just a super cute way to get rid of this ugly boxes to get a more sleek pretty look [Music] next I'm going to apply labels to these two boxes that I got from Dollar General for a dollar each one is going to be four sponges and the other four gloves [Music] [Music] the next thing I did was organize all of my microfiber cleaning cloths into this cute little caddy that I purchased from world market for $10 [Music] now that all of my organizing is done I'm gonna move on to installing my shelf paper which I bought from Target for $5 [Music] [Applause] [Music] now that I'm done with that it's time to put everything back I purchased the storage basket from Walmart for I believe around $5 or so I keep my extra cleaning products and ones that I don't use so often in this bin this wire caddy is from Marshalls and it was $8.00 I used this for products that I use all the time so it's easy to grab these three storage bins are from Dollar General which I mentioned earlier and they were a dollar each this is where I keep my sponges gloves and dishwasher cleaner next is this wire basket where I'm storing all of my extra dish soap I bought this at Target last year for around $3 here is my dishwasher detergent container which is from Target for $10 and also my white caddy for my microfiber cloths which is from world market for $10 and lastly on the back of my cabinet door I have attached this clear plastic spice rack that I got from Amazon for around 1150 this is going to be used for my sinks trainers a brush and extra sponges and here's one last look at my cabinet before I started this project and here is what it looks like now I just love how everything turned out it's super organized and super cute and everything is going to be so much easier to find now [Music] [Music] and that is it for this cabinet organization video I have linked most of the products that I used in the description box below for those of you who are interested in checking them out if you want to see me clean out and organize the rest of my kitchen cabinets I just recently posted that video so go check it out on my channel and don't forget to subscribe if you are new and I'll see you in my next video bye", "OvUuoY4veRA": "Graci we're gonna get you a new sink and a new faucet but it starts by getting rid of this old one now I have been under my share of kitchen sinks in my career and it's not that comfortable let me give you that okay so check this out they designed a pad made just for me oh wow isn't that cool so I'm gonna start by disconnecting the water so water connections are done now I want to do the drain connection so if I break this nut right here and loosen it that will allow the safe to go up but we're not done yet the thing that's holding the sink in place is a series of clips way up underneath the countertop okay so that is last of the clips so now we could push a sink right up but this countertop is laminate and this rim could have some adhesive under so I don't want to push it up and have this laminate get destroyed that's what I like to do is to actually put a little putty knife underneath okay good and just try to release any adhesive that's in there and you got one over there just try your side okay good now I'll just unplug the electrical to the disposer and now I'm just gonna push this sink up to you Christy and just you hold it I'm gonna jump up okay let's lift straight up good all right Christy here is your brand new stainless steel sink what do you think it is beautiful we ordered it as a standard size 33 inches by 22 that means it'll fit this opening just right okay great also get in a double bowl so we can leave that disposed around the left-hand side okay and what I like about this is this a really heavy gage sink the way they measure metals is the term gage and the lower the number the heavier the metal okay stainless steel sinks come in 22 20 we actually order this as 18 nice and thick okay all right look at this this manufacturer also offers something unique it's a gasket built into the underside of that sink rim normally you have to put a bead of silicone all the way around we don't have to do that okay they also have the clips already factory mounted so the combination of these clips in that gasket is we won't let any water come in between this and the counter great all right we also got a single hole drilling okay and look at this in your faucet what do you think oh my gosh I saw the spray hose is integral part of the spout okay now what we can do is actually do ourselves a favor and actually install some of this stuff up here okay so we'll just feed that down through he's not gonna look right oh yes that's amazing all right good all right and the manufacturer actually makes a special wrench allows us to tighten up the last little bit nice okay good so now this hose right here connects to the spray hose a stainless steel flex and what the manufacturer provides is a weight now the weight will help to retract the spray hose up into the spout and once we've done that we can make the watertight connection between the spray hose and the faucet by pushing these together and they have a special clip which holds it watertight all right so now the faucet is attached to the sink but before we put the sink back into place I want to show you something here okay on the drainage system you have two traps one trap right here that was for the sink and for the disposer and another trap right here for the dishwasher no I hadn't seen this before so I asked around and in this jurisdiction at one time this was code and the idea was they didn't want to have any chance of contaminated water from the disposer getting back into the dishwasher so I had this stand pipe with a little thing called an air gap right here now it turns out there were a couple issues with this one is if this trap ever clogged up the water from the dishwasher could overflow the stand pipe and flood the cabinet okay and not go back into the sink and the other was if you didn't use the dishwasher enough the water this time this trap can evaporate and then you get sewer gas into the building so now this is no longer coat so what I want to do is get rid of this stand pipe completely okay and run this dishwasher discharge into the disposer where they've tapping right here made expressly for that perfect right I'll take that now I got it this way okay all right the trappers got water and just hold that carefully don't spill it okay all right so you don't need this trap anymore so I want to cap it off so what I did was I actually cut the trap off right here leaving some of the shoulder of the oil fitting because that's the same dimension as the cap that I have okay so you put that on and tighten up this stainless steel clamp and we're watertight Christy let's get that new sink into place lift it high enough to get those water supplies in okay all right let's drop in place careful your fingers okay look at that yeah all right I'm going on there we got to tighten up those clips okay they flipped down into place and tighten them up with a screwdriver okay so now next thing I want to do is to make these water connections is hot and cold red and blue okay and then I just have to make those compression connections to our shutoff valves okay so that does it for our water connections now we're going to start thinking about making the drain connections to the sink okay now we're gonna reuse your disposer and that comes with its own set of connections to the sink so here is this top piece the throat I need some putty right here so I'll just grab some of that a whole bunch you get out and then roll it in your hands back and forth so it turns into like a snake long enough to go right around here okay keep coming like working with dough oh good all right let's try that about the right size yep good now what I want you to do I'm gonna push this down into the sink opening and you can hold back against me while I make the connections from below okay the key to this connection is the groove right here in the throat piece we apply these two adapters onto the throat and then this lock ring snaps into place once it's in place I can tighten up these four screws and when I do it'll pull down on that top throat squeeze out that putty and make a nice tight seal any putty squealing oh yeah yes okay when I tighten them all down equally yes that should do it and we make a slightly different connection on the basket strainer on the other ball okay this connection is made with a gasket this bell-shaped flange and then nut I tighten it up with a pair of plugs so you see a lot of putty coming out up there oh yeah all right know what you can do is you can actually scrape the excess putty from both the balls okay and put it right back into the container all right so here is your old disposer this is where we're gonna lock it to the bottom of that syncadapter we already put in here's where the food goes down right here this is where the discharge goes to the drain okay now this piece right here is provided by the disposer manufacturer for a dishwasher now they don't know if you have a dishwasher or not so from the factory there's a knockout plug okay so now that we're going to connect to this disposer we actually have to knock it out okay now we're gonna get the little piece out there you go alright now we can connect this to the sink the disposer secure is utilizing this lock ring push the gasket up and now I just turn it just a bit more than a quarter of a turn and then using a screwdriver it'll help for leverage there we go beauty now for the drain connections I'm going to try to reuse as many of the old pieces as I can all these connections are called compression connections because they have a nut and a gasket so I've loosened all the nuts which means everything is adjustable so here I go here so now I bring this straight piece right here and now what I want to do is make this connection at the top with a very special gasket called a top gasket and now I connect that to my basket strainer okay now this is the T fitting that's going to go over to our disposer I'm going to turn that to where it wants to be and I have a straight piece right here that has a special gasket that goes into the disposer right here and that looks like it's a tiny bit too long so we better mark that and cut it good I could use a hacksaw but they make a special cutter for it that's terrific I just put it in line it up on the guide hole right there and then spin the pipe yeah we don't that is cool all right that's going to be perfect on the disposer there's a gasket and a yoke the yoke has two screws and as you tighten up the screws the yoke will compress the gasket and just snug them up good our very last connection is the discharge from the dishwasher to connect it into our disposer now they make a special adapter that'll fit that tapping on the side of the disposer on this side and it fits hose connection on this side the stainless steel clamps we just have to tighten them all up all right Christie I ran the dishwasher hose as high as I could up inside that cabinet to make sure there's no chance of back flow from the disposer to the dishwasher okay plugged in the electrical to the disposer and hot and cold is turned back on it's time for you to try out your new faucet and sink oh my gosh changes from spray yeah pulls out oh thanks I can't get over it is a major upgrade no more leaks it's beautiful", "sGj4ozr1RY8": "Tired old sink bringing your kitchen down? Replacing it is easier than you think. We're replacing a drop in sink, which fits\nover the countertop. Bottom mount sinks, attach from beneath. Be sure to get the right one. And measure your old sink to be sure the new\none will fit in the same space. Make a list of the things you'll need for\nthe job. Things like supply lines, gaskets, plumbers\nputty, PVC primer, and cement. And if the supply valves are in bad shape\n- or not there at all - get those, too. If you're replacing your sink, it\u2019s a great\ntime to replace your faucet too. For more info, check out our How To Install\na Kitchen Faucet video. Start by turning off the water. Then turn on the faucet to relieve the pressure. Turn off the power to the garbage disposal\nand disconnect it. Position a bucket to catch any water and remove\nthe supply lines. Then disconnect the drain pipes. Then unscrew the discharge pipe. The disposal drops right out. Next loosen the metal clips beneath the countertop\nand remove them. Cut the caulk around the sink with a utility\nknife. Gently push up from underneath to loosen the\nsink and lift it away. Use a putty knife to clean up any old caulk\nor grime. Drop the new sink into the opening to make\nsure it fits. Then take it out and set it on a work surface. Put a bead of plumbers putty around the drain\nstrainer and press into the sink. Place the gaskets and flange, and tighten. Clean away the excess putty. If you're installing a disposal, install the\nmounting bracket. Next, install the faucet and place the clips. Run a bead of silicone sealant around the\nsink edge and carefully lower it into place. Tighten the clips and wipe away excess sealant. Now, hook up the supply lines to the faucet. Tighten the connections, but don't overtighten. Connect the sprayer too. Attach the disposal to the sink and install\nthe discharge pipe. The drainpipes may not line up exactly with\nyour new sink. You may have to cut the pipes, or replace\nshorter pipes with longer ones. Once it\u2019s all lined up you can reattach\nthe P-trap. Then reconnect power to the disposal. Some sinks may require a bead of sealant around\nthe top. Install accessories like a soap dispenser. Finally, slowly turn on the water and check\nfor leaks. Then turn back on the power to the disposal\u2026 And that's it! Want more great ideas and how-to\u2019s? Go to Lowes.com/HowTo or just click to subscribe.

messy if you have a messy cluttered and crusty sink but keeping that sink clean and shiny is a tall order because let's face it the sink as you can see right here is usually the repository for every dirty dish in the house so with that in mind and because many of you have asked here are a few handy tips to help you keep your sink clean empty and shiny in fact I bet you this will be the most comprehensive detailed megamix of information on one video about a sink that you've ever seen keep your sink empty the real secret to keeping a clean sink is to not leave stuff in there in the first place and trust me I know people who think this sink is some sort of magical transporter which transports dirty dishes directly from the sink into the dishwasher if you know one of these people or if you are one of these people all you need to do is start putting the dishes directly into the dishwasher and not into the sink and make sure you do this every day for a couple of weeks and soon enough as I've said before you'll create a habit and you'll end up always putting your dirty dishes where they belong and you'll have a cleaner sink if you don't have a dishwasher then the habit you need to embrace is just washing your dishes after each use and while that might not sound overly appealing I believe it's better than the alternative of having food rot away at room temperature for four days in the sink how to clean your sink if you have a stainless steel sink like I do cleaning it is actually really easy you want some sort of detergent or soap to clean and then some sort of mildly abrasive product to scrub away the build-up which often forms when dishes are left in the sink I remove debris from my sink traps and then I spray the sink with all-purpose cleaner or just dish soap and water or even vinegar and water and then I use baking soda we here clean my space use baking soda so much we put it on the payroll once the sink is sprayed down all you have to do is sprinkle baking soda all around the sink and leave it for a few moments then scrub it with a sponge and rinse with hot water which is key get all debris and baking soda granules down the sink and buff it with a dry cloth if you notice brown stains forming around your drain these are pretty simple to clear up all you have to do is create a paste of dish soap and baking soda and apply it to the area leave it for a few moments and then scrub it gently with a cleaning toothbrush [Music] clean your sink traps your sink traps can get disgusting have you ever smelled one to clean it which I recommend you do monthly take it apart if you can and soak it overnight in soapy water and baking soda then in the morning rinks and replace so before you do that take a little cleaning toothbrush get into all the nooks and crannies rinse well dry it and then you can use them again how does shine you sink there are a few ways to shine stainless steel sinks but my favorite is using rubbing alcohol which works wonders on any stainless steel surface and of course disinfect it all you have to do is use a mixture one part rubbing alcohol to one part water spray the sake down and then wipe everything dry with a clean cloth boom sparkling unclog or deodorize your drain if your sink drains slowly or if you've noticed a little funk coming from your kitchen sink you may have some build-up that you need to clear out of your drink to do this you take about a cup of baking soda and just dump it down the drain then you're going to leave it there and do nothing for about an hour coming up to that sixty minute mark you'll boil about three cups of vinegar in a kettle and doesn't this serve double duty you're actually going to descale your kettle and the proces so you'll take that boiling vinegar and you'll just dump it down the sink and then your sink won't stink no mo the garburator I don't have a garbage disposal or a garburator but for those of you who do you're lucky and you can use the same steps we just talked about to get your drain unclogged to also clean your garbage disposal just add a cup of baking soda down the drain then chase it with three cups of boiling vinegar and run the garbage disposal it'll be loud it'll be noisy but it will smell beautiful now to keep odors at bay you can cut up a lemon or a lime or a grapefruit or even an orange I can't catch but any citrus fruit will do you just plop the slices into the garbage disposal turn it on to rid yourself of the garburator funk or just do this at any time you have used citrus peels for good measure and it's so much easier to juggle with two things in three finally the faucet which is not technically part of the kitchen sink but it's a close relative so we'll clean you two for chrome and nickel faucets all you need to do is fill a spray bottle with a 50/50 vinegar and water mix just spray on the vinegar mixture to the faucet the faucet handles and let it sit for about a minute or so then you'll take that microfiber cloth make sure it's bone-dry and wipe it to a shiny finish if it's even the slightest bit wet you'll have streaks if you have pesky water spots just spray and leave that vinegar for a few minutes and then wipe it off with a dry cloth really vinegar will counteract those water spots now if you have copper stainless steel brass or bronze faucets and they're you know high-end a little expensive it might be best just to use simple dish soap or even a specialty cleaner which a manufacturer can recommend well there you have it everything you wanted to know about the kitchen sink in one

we really like it so I'm going to take a minute and just show it to you but first I want to just let you know we did all of our granite and our backsplash and we're going to purchase our kitchen sink all from the same store right here where we live when it came time to purchase the sink we loved it it was big a single bowl which is exactly what we wanted to match the rest of our kitchen but they said it's going to take two weeks to get to your house and I thought and that's going to take forever what the heck so I decided to go on Amazon do a search for the same exact sink and fat it on Amazon Amazon Prime shipped free in two days and the price of the sink ended up being $200 cheaper then it was actually in the store they're asking $550 for this sink in the store and on Amazon it was $320 so if you're interested in taking a look at it I posted the link right below this video without further ado let me show you the rest of the remodel and the kitchen sink so again this is a blanco

replacing with the new one", "fm2CE2e_3To": "when it comes to clogged drains and toilets one thing for sure is the timing is usually pretty bad so the question is which one these products works the best now just because a product works in the short term is it causing long-term damage to your pipes well we're going to do some testing today and find out a lot more information about each of these products and if one product is actually better than the rest for the most part clogs fall into three categories the first category is hair these type of clogs typically happen in bathroom sinks tubs showers and laundry drains chunks of soaps sometimes go down the drain and mix with the hair to cause a clog as well so we'll see how effective these products are at dissolving hair and a chunk of soap the second type of clog is from food and grease these are often found in kitchen sinks we'll see how well these products work for dissolving vegetables and globs of bacon grease the third most common type of clog is from a foreign object since the list is nearly endless we'll see how well these products work on a piece of tape and a paper towel when it comes to chemical drain cleaners there are four main broad categories sodium hydroxide also known as lye seems to be the most common type of drain cleaner other ingredients are present and some of the retail drain cleaners as well sodium hypochlorite or bleach is the second category some products such as liquid plumr combine both sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite the third category includes acids will be testing both muriatic as well as sulfuric acid you won't want to use a product as acid in it for stainless steel aluminum chrome or galvanized steel pipes however it is safe to use with plastic piping the fourth and final category includes organic drain cleaners that use enzymes or bacteria these tiny organisms digest the wastes and reproduce spreading throughout the septic system well any of these drain cleaners cause damage to plumbing we'll be seeing what impact they have on a small metal pipe and a rusty nail as well as some PVC pro strength liquid plumr nothing is tougher it offers three times the action destroys clogs protects prevents and it's guaranteed according the back of the label it's designed for standing water slow drains clogged prevention and hair clogs in order to produce a fair test I'll be mixing warm water with each product and then pouring the products into test cups well first check back on each products after they've been exposed to the chemicals for 45 minutes since the instructions don't really provide a product to water ratio I decided to mix 10 parts of water with one part liquid [Music] Draino max tol Proust rank clears total blockages it's guaranteed or it's free court in the back of the bottle it clears hair clogs standing water slow drains and pipe build-up so what's the active ingredients includes sodium hydroxide sodium hypochlorite and sodium silicon just like liquid plumr I mixed one part of Drano to ten parts of water I didn't notice any sort of chemical reactions or noises when adding the liquid plumber or Drano to the test samples [Music] so why buy a liquid drain cleaner when you can just use pure lye which is designed to be a drain opener clears out drains grease traps and septic systems I added the live very slowly and mixed it thoroughly since light causes an exothermic reaction in other words it causes the water to boil very quickly this strategy worked very well well this product doesn't claim to clear drain clogs it does claim to break down food grease and more in any drain so we're gonna test that out to see just how well this works because I've had a lot of people request we test these drain sticks so instead of using chemicals these drain sticks use bacteria when adding the drain sticks to warm water the drain sticks began to dissolve fairly quickly turning the water blue so why use harsh chemicals when there's products like robic granular drain and trap cleaner it's a concentrate that's designed to prevent and in slow drains it uses a patent bacteria to digest waste build up the robic mixed fairly well but there were large particles that didn't seem to fully dissolve in sulfuric acid now kelabra claims to be for professional use only and not for household use it is designed though to use as an emergency drain line opener according to directions it disintegrates hair paper cloth food organic matter and scale melts grease and thaws frozen waste lines I only added fifty milliliters of sulfuric acid since it created a lot of heat when mixed with water and I didn't want to melt the plastic cups this is obviously a very powerful acid and it'll still be very effective diluted with water so if you've got a difficult clog to use and acids are used for clearing clogs why not use meriadoc acid now merry otic acid is 31.4 5% hydrochloric acid in this case I only added 50 milliliters of Meriadoc acid to the water you can see vapours from the mixing of water and acid together this is a very powerful acid it's been right about 45 minutes so let's take a look at each one of these products to see how good they've done as you can see it did not dissolve the soap or of the dog hair okay there's been no damage to the vegetables okay this is the grease the paper towel on the tape bow seems just fine inside the liquid plumr it doesn't look like it's removed any sort of rust the metal does not seem to have experienced any sort of damage okay no visible damage to the PVC okay we'll check out the Drano to see how it did on dog hair and soap okay it looks like the soap is still inside the container as well as a dog hair so everything seems to remain intact okay no damage to the vegetables okay this is the grease okay no apparent damage to the paper towel or the tape all right I don't see any sort of removal of rust or any damage to the steel so this seems to be very safe on plumbing hey the PVC looks just fine like it's starting to dissolve the dog here well it's not dissolving the vegetables the car the vegetables definitely looks a little bit different Drano and liquid plumr seem to have done a little bit better job with the bacon grease okay no damage to the paper towel of the tape the live didn't cause any damage to the metal or the PVC the drain stick is still dissolving and it has not dissolved any of the hair there's still a layer of grease in the cup other than coloring everything blue the drain sticks did not seem to have any impact on the paper towel metal or PVC the robic didn't seem to have any impact on the dog hair vegetables grease paper towel steel or PVC the sulfuric acid was diluted quite a bit and it didn't have much of an impact on the hair vegetables grease paper towels or PVC but it did begin removing the rust from the nail later in the video I'll try a much stronger water acid mix in a Pyrex container that can handle the heat created by the acid while the muriatic acid didn't seem to dissolve the hair in vegetables it did a pretty good job on the grease it didn't have any impact on the paper towel or the PVC but it did begin removing some rust from the nail which indicates that it is fairly corrosive after 12 hours liquid plumr didn't seem to do very well at dissolving the hair however Drano seems to have done a little bit better job d'lai did by far the best of all the products we've tested totally dissolving all of the hair the drain sticks robic in water didn't seem to dissolve the hair the sulfuric acid did thin out the hair a little but the muriatic acid did a better job but not as good as lye none of the products seem to do very good at dissolving the vegetables however the sulfuric acid did show a very small amount of progress once the bacon grease cooled off it seemed to thicken some both liquid plumr and Drano did a good job with the grease while light is all the hair there's quite a bit of grease that's at the bottom of the cup the drain sticks just seemed to have died the grease blew the robic didn't seem to have done much either clobber definitely seems to have done a better job the muriatic acid at dissolving the grease none of the products seem to dissolve the tape or the paper towels both liquid plumr and drain will cause corrosion on the steel pipe however if these products are used as directed steel pipes should not experience any sort of corrosion why did not cause any corrosion to the steel pipe or the nail the drain sticks and the robic did not seem to have any impact either the kelabra and the muriatic acid removed the rust from the nail and seemed to remove the plating from the pipe so that both highly corrosive and can cause damage to metal pipes if not flushed out and diluted with water then the prize caused any sort of visible damage to the PVC we have a pretty good idea as to which products work really well liquid plumr and Drano seem to be about the same so we're gonna use a little bit higher dose of Drano and we're also going to use a higher dose of acid in these Pyrex containers in order to test their full capability so we're going to do is add the festivals and rusty nail and some dog hair to each of the containers and we're gonna see how much work they can do in 15 minute period I bet at approximately 2 cups of warm water in each container so what I'm gonna do now is add a 50% mix of Drano to water to this container to see just how effective it is in a 15 minute time span I'm gonna shake the container real well to make sure everything's thoroughly mixed I'm gonna set this aside temporarily since I don't want it near this facet in case we get some splash as you can see the temperature inside this container is extremely hot at sixty two point six degrees Celsius and climbing it's been right at fifteen minutes so let's go ahead and see how well these products did the job the dog here is definitely starting to disappear that dog hair is just about gone it's done a very good job actually as you can see it did nothing to dissolve the asparagus it doesn't appear to have done any damage to the nail and it does not look like it's dissolved the carrot at all it doesn't look like it's dissolved the asparagus very well it has done a little bit of work on it wow it's definitely eaten into that carrot another aratoon this carrot would probably be totally dissolved the drain will actually did a lot better job dissolving the dog hair as you can see that all the rust has been removed from this nail so the acid did a very good job of removing rust but it's also highly corrosive it's go right out three hours let's see how well this acid has done on the solid objects in the hair okay it looks like the asparagus is just about totally dissolved very impressive there's still hair inside but it looks like the acid has done a great job at dissolving most of the hair the carrots not as big as it used to be it actually looks sort of green now that it's been exposed to this passive it doesn't look like it's caused any sort of corrosion to the nail also it doesn't seem like it's had any effect on the solid objects the following assessment is subjective with the letter A indicating that the product did an effective job B indicates that the product showed some effect C indicates that the product didn't seem to have any effect Drano liquid plumr and lye earn a's and are definitely the most effective at dissolving air the acids earned a b since they didn't dissolve the hair but needed a very strong concentration of acid for several hours to be effective the biological products just didn't seem to work the only product that seemed to work on vegetables at all was the clobber or sulfuric acid I believe the hydrochloric acid would have done a little bit better job if a higher percentage of acid was used Drano liquid plumr clobber and hydrochloric acid were all affected with grease but lie drain sticks and robic seemed less effective no the product seemed effective at dissolving the paper towels or tape Drano and liquid plumr did show a very small amount of corrosion and the acid showed quite a bit of corrosion so you've got a stubborn claw declare which product should you select if you're dealing with the bathroom clog it probably involves hair and fur I would choose liquid plumr Drano or lye those products worked extremely well at dissolving hair I was really surprised at how well they work now for the kitchen you're probably dealing with a solid object or grease acid definitely works better on that type of a clog however acids also highly corrosive so if you have a garbage disposal unit or metal plumbing you might not want to do that because it could cause some damage you probably need to use a drain snake but we didn't see quick action out of the enzymes I think those products work very well for maintaining the plumbing now when it comes to these different chemicals I really discourage mixing them because you could experience a really nasty chemical reaction that can cause some health issues as usual just want to say thanks so much for watching the video I hope you'll provide me some video ideas for the future please take care and I look forward to next time", "ON8DnFxQy9c": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to my channel rental your daughter

and it's a quite cozy little space I don't have a lot of storage which brings me to this video I wanted to share with you some organizing tips specifically organizing the cabinet under your sink because we all know how tricky that cabinet can be primarily because of the plumbing but also because it tends to become like a catch-all cabinet for most people I would say I was definitely one of those people I wanted to share with you awesome tips on how I manage to keep things tidy and organized okay now let's get started so one of the very first things that I noticed when I moved into my rental was the fact that I don't really have much space much floor space in here so having a trash can out on the main floor wasn't really working for me it was always in the way so I took to my cabinet under my kitchen sink as an alternate method an alternate location and I installed this track system it's a dual trashcan system that I actually purchased at a thrift store it was brand new in a box and I paid $12.99 for it I completely left out before we start adding in any kind of organizational products into this cabinet I'm going to line it with this shelf liner that I purchased at Walmart it is an easy liner smooth top and what is great about this kind of liner is that it is going to be easy to clean any kind of spills I will advise that you refrain from getting those like mesh kind of liners and the only reason is because those kind of only provide a grip so if you get yourself a liner that is completely solid it will actually help prevent some spillage onto your actual cabinet and prevent some damage too cabinets so don't forget to add your liners what I did here was cut the liner perfect to size I am just focusing on the front that's gonna get the majority of the traffic [Music] this little caddy was purchased at Target a few years ago it's actually meant for utensils at party wear paper plates things like that and I'm repurposing this and using it as a little cleaning caddy I use it to store a few essential things and I want to share with you how I store them very handy way that I store my trash bags is by taking them out of the box as soon as I get home and I pull the center of trash bag to start the process going it's kind of like a tissue box and I just stick them in the very first little compartment here I also stored these cleaning brushes and a squeegee why don't you just like clean these little hard surfaces and then the other one for my windows and I just put them in the very back container back here I also keep some cleaning sponges here I have some regular dish sponges that I use for cleaning more of tough surfaces around the kitchen and then I have a raised sponge back here as well well if you have a garbage disposal right in your sink make sure that you make room for this garbage disposal tool because they can get lost really quickly it's best to just leave them right next to where they're needed my landlord use have a taped and it would fall so often so I just untaped it from the little wall and just sticking my caddy and then the last thing I have is is trying that and I just stick it right in here and this one just goes right next to the trash can this two-tiered little drawer system was purchased at Ross for 9.99 about a year ago on the very bottom basket I store just the essentials back here I have two little dish cloths I have a microfiber cloth that is used for a multi surface this spray here is specifically made for windows and mirrors and things of that nature right in front of that I have this little container that I use to store the little gels made for the garbage disposal and then in front of it I have this little scrub brush and it's tray that I purchased from Grove collaborative this thing is really cool you pop some dish soap inside a little bit of water add this little spring system on the top it's really cool your brush and all you do is kind of push on it to get yourself some soap so that you can wash your dishes it's really really handy and in there I keep this drain stopper and this drainer and then on this top basket I keep all of my kitchen cleaning products every single kitchen cleaning product I did pare down and just stuck to the essentials when it came to my cleaning products and a few thing you have already seen are these glass containers and both of these glass containers were purchasing from Corp collaborative I really do like that website they have some great cleaning products one thing I did was label them the top of this spray bottle says multi on it for multi-purpose cleaner and the top of this one says glass for mirrors and windows and that's how I'm able to differentiate the two I also have these oXXO containers which are the best containers that I have used I used them to store some of these cleaning products and I also use them in my pantry which is right back there and I'll do another video for y'all on a later date on how I organize my pantry but for now I'm going to show you how I use these oXXO containers for under my kitchen sink I buy my tablets in a pretty big sized container and as soon as I get home I take it out of its container and then I throw them in here they're really easy to open they are airtight containers and they are absolutely amazing so I keep my tablets in the biggest one and then I keep my cleaning gloves I prefer to use some disposable ones when they're necessary and then in this last container I have a few other essentials I have these mr. clean erasers that I have just cut in half I find that when I use them I only use half of a sponge so I just took initiative and I cut the thing in half and now I have four instead of the - I did the exact same thing with money glass stovetop sponge I cut it in half so that I can get more use off to the side I have these SOS pads I just have one of these labs and I just put it in a ziploc bag because I didn't want to scratch the container and then I have some additional dish sponges [Music] I really hope that you'll enjoy this video today and we're able to take some of these tips and incorporate them into your home and if you were able to don't forget to leave me a comment below and let me know where I can go to check out that photo or you can just post a photo and tag me on Instagram I would love nothing more than to see those photos

video and if you haven't already make sure you subscribe below about three years ago i organized my understand kitchen cabinet and it's been working for about two years so for the last year we've just been throwing things under there not really taking care of it like i should have or like i would and finally i have some time to finally reorganize it because i always say you can organize the space once and it doesn't necessarily and it won't necessarily work for you forever you have to things change products change the amount of products you purchase change so you will be reorganizing your space in your lifetime so i finally found time to reorganize it and i am absolutely obsessed with under the cabinet i'm constantly going into my kitchen just to look at my understand kitchen cabinet that's how much i love it and the most important part is it's so functional so outside of it being aesthetically pleasing as you already know that is my forte it also is functional so it makes sense not just for me but for everyone that lives in this home with all that said because you already know my intros are a little bit long with all that said the first thing i did was to remove everything from that cabinet so again i haven't seen a lot of this stuff under there in a while so i removed everything and i was very surprised to see how much of my recycled items remained in that area they were supposed to go out but they stayed in so i took everything out and i was able to see my cabinet in its entirety so with that said it's important to take everything out of a space especially if your goal is to add organizing products to the space because this allows you to see how much space you have therefore help you determine the amount of organizing products you can add to the space not just the amount also the size and with that said the next tip is to always measure your space outside of emptying it out you need to measure your space especially if it's a small space and you'll be again bringing in organizing products because i knew i was going to replace the existing organizing products with new ones outside of measuring it i was also able to clean it out i haven't cleaned it in years yes i haven't cleaned it in years so i was able to just thoroughly clean it make sure that it was clean there was some erosion from water from years ago so you can see that there are some like texture under there um so i was able to just clean it and of course it is good there's no pipe leakage and after cleaning it out measuring it i was able to then start searching for some organizing products i did have some in mind i have been looking around trying to figure out how i wanted to organize or change out my understand kitchen cabinet and i did come across different organizing products that i knew would fit perfectly in that space i decided on two and i purchased them from the container store of course i mean honestly the container store has everything and yes the price may be higher than others they just have everything and i'm a really simple girl so if i can find all of my organizing products in one space i will do that plus i get to see them in person and fill them out rather than of course ordering from amazon though amazon is a great place to find organizing products so anyway once i picked up the products i was able to place them in the cabinet just to see how they feel it's important that you do kind of see the feel of it outside of knowing what you want to get but also putting it in the space to make sure that they kind of gel and it did i did have to do some maneuvering around things and i did use a zip tie to kind of move one of the components to the drains but that was very easy to do and it allowed one of the pieces to fit in there perfectly so once i did that and i knew for sure i would be keeping these products i wanted to cover up the bottom portion of the under sink kitchen cabinet floors as you can see there was a bit erosion as i mentioned earlier on the bottom and that had been there for a long time but i wanted to finally find a way to cover it and there's many ways to cover up cabinet bottoms and i decided to go two ways so i was either going to add some type of contact paper to the bottom or i was going to add some vinyl flooring to it yes i said flooring i went the flooring route because i just love how it looked and it was going to allow me to achieve the goals i wanted for that space the flooring that i use is very easy to customize and all you really need is a box cutter and that's what i used and it's easy to break off i don't think i showed that in the clips so really simple to use and what i did was i literally just measured it it was super easy and i traced and measure around the cabinet areas that i wanted the flooring to sit to come into i don't know if that makes sense and i was able to come up with this beautiful beautiful looking under cabinet flooring i love it i love it and the best thing of all is if the drains or the pipe were to leak it would leak on the planks which is easy to clean up rather than having it leak through paper and then possibly leaking through the wood so i'm so happy i went this route and i was able to use something i already had and because i have been trying to figure out what to do with this stuff and finally i figured it out and yeah it looks so beautiful under there like you wouldn't even know that the original flooring was like eroding and really ugly to look at you wouldn't even know so yes if you are trying to cover up some damage i think going the vinyl flooring route is better than contact paper but if you don't have vinyl flooring and you don't want to spend the money on that you can always use adhesive liner or contact paper those work perfectly they're going to give you a very fresh look under your sink under your kitchen cabinet and without really spending a lot of money you can also use liner under there to give you a different look so after i did that after everything was good i didn't even like adhere it down i literally just placed it on top of the wood part or the bottom part after that i then brought in the organizing products again just to make sure they looked good on top of the vinyl flooring and then i took off the stickers so once i had everything in its place i knew where everything was going to sit i then started to bring in the products i did take out some products that i either didn't use or it didn't need to be in the cabinet and i put them in a storage closet because that's where a lot of our stuff sit and i only kept to the items that we use either in the kitchen or for the sink i wanted to be very intentional for that so that it's easy when i'm either doing the dishes or cleaning the kitchen rather than me having to go back and forth to the storage closet or to another area to get the product i needed it's all about functionality and efficiency in my home and aesthetically pleasing i mean it has to be beautiful too so after i decided all that i put everything back in its place and i also added some labels to the organizing products just so that it's easier for anyone who needed to find things they could find it without asking me so what i would tell you to do outside of taking everything out of course getting rid of things that you no longer need or use and of course cleaning everything out under that under kitchen cabinet i would always suggest that you bring in organizing products that fit your home fit the space or fit your needs when it comes to products for the under sink kitchen cabinet there are so many out there there are roll outs there are pull outs there are stackable drawers or stackable bins i mean you can go any direction and still create a very functional and beautiful under sink kitchen cabinet space but i'm all about ease which is why i brought in these two drawers and then i added a bin in the middle just to hold products that couldn't fit in the drawers so on the left side i have all of my cleaning cloths before they sat on one of the very top shelves in my kitchen cabinet and though it worked it was just very it was it was just not difficult but i always had to get a stool to get it and this that's just too much work so now i brought them lower so now i just have easy access to them and i just love the fact that i can just literally open that cabinet and grab the cleaning cloth that i need in the middle as i mentioned i have the cleaning products that just don't fit in those drawers and honestly i'm happy that they're there because for the most part these are cleaning products that i use more so on the daily basis and then on the right side i have other cleaning products that actually fit in the drawers and most of these cleaning products are products that i use maybe once a week or twice a month like you know stainless steel cleaner and um oven cleaners you know and i also do have like a spray like my bleach spray i love using bleach to clean i have fallen in love with the scent of diluted bleach yes no i'm not addicted but the smell just smells so fresh and clean i'm so happy with everything i don't have a lot of products in here because i've noticed that i don't need a lot of products to clean you just need those few good ones and that is it it's so functional it's aesthetically pleasing like i said i go into this cabinet every day and just look at it just because it looks so good and it just makes so much sense now so i'm super happy i think that's it so let me know in the comment section below if you've already organized your under sink kitchen cabinet and where did you buy your products from and if not let me know if this video helped you at all let me

installing the farmhouse sink and a butcher block countertop it's a great way to make your renovations stand out in this video I'll install the farmhouse sink I'll show you what you need to know to do it right farmhouse things can be mounted three different ways top mount sinks are the easiest to install there's a flange that sits on the countertop just like a regular sink they can be installed on any type of counter surface flush mount sinks sit even with the top of the counter they typically require a solid surface or custom-made laminate top undermount sinks sit completely underneath the counter they require a waterproof top that is custom cut for the sink and faucet we're gonna be installing this Kohler Whitehaven cast-iron sink farmhouse sinks are also available in stainless steel now one thing to know is these things are really heavy so they're gonna require some additional support now the plan for a project like this is to remove the old sink and countertop prep the cabinet install the new sink and finish by installing new counters and faucet if your new top is stone a countertop installer is going to measure your cabinets and sink to create a custom top some installers are gonna require a farmhouse sink to be installed before measuring have your faucet soap dispenser or any other accessories that need a hole drilled on site for them it's also a good idea to ask the Installer if there's anything you need to do to prepare for the installation now one of the great things about this Kohler sink is it doesn't require a custom cabinet like other farmhouse syncs with taller aprons I just referenced the instructions online before I picked it up to make sure it would fit most instructions will include measurement requirements for your cabinet in our case we needed to measure the width of our cabinet the distance from the top of the cabinet to the bottom of the drawer opening or screw holes to make sure it was shorter than the apron and the distance from the top of the cabinet to the doors to make sure the apron wouldn't interfere with the doors now if your sink is near a corner just make sure that adjacent doors drawers or dishwashers will clear the apron front now obviously your old singh's going to be removed but it's a good idea to take a picture of your drain setup in case you need it for future reference for a typical sink removal turn off the water and disconnect the plumbing also remove the disposal remove the sink clips underneath cut the sealant on top and pull out the sink click the link for steps on sink removal now all our plumbing is at a good height for our sink install but you might have to lower yours to clear the bottom of the sink basin I've created this model to show you what you need to do now remember you're gonna be working inside a cabinet so you might want to call a pro for PVC mark your length and cut it with a hacksaw or PVC cutter then remove the burrs with 80 grit sandpaper outside the pipe and inside the pipe fitting just dry fit the PVC drain right now you can secure it when the sink is in place for copper pipes and water valves we're going to use these push connect fittings cut the copper with a pipe cutter secure it spin it and gradually tighten it until it cuts through deburr the pipe with a special tool then you can slide on the push connect fitting done the next step is to remove the countertop if it's screwed down you can simply use a screw gun to back out the screws however if it's glued down use an oscillating saw to get between the counter and the cabinet next we're gonna make sure that our cabinets are even and level use shims if needed to level the cabinets with your countertops removed next we can prep the cabinet I'm gonna remove the doors to make sure we don't damage them and to make access easier take off the false front drawers if you have them and remove any screws or brackets that might be in the way now our sink came with a template to cut out the front of our cabinet before I attach the template I'm going to take some painters tape and mask off the areas that are going to be so I don't splinter them with the saw next we're gonna mark the center of our cabinet for a template we have a 36 inch cabinet so we'll mark it at 18 inches then I'll line up the cutout template and tape it in place we got lucky the bottom of our template lined up perfect with the opening trace the template out of the cabinet then remove the template now cut the outline with a jigsaw or an oscillating saw sand it smooth if it's a little rough farmhouse sinks need extra supports and the inside of the cabinets because these things can be really heavy some can weigh over 300 pounds with full of water now you're going to want to make sure your sink top is even with the top of your cabinets so the countertops sit correctly some things can sit a little bit lower but never higher measure the thickness of the sink and transfer that to the cabinet walls our instructions say the support should sit 5 eighths of an inch below the top I'll use a straightedge to mark the line apply construction adhesive to the horizontal two-by-four supports pull them in place and secure them with screws then add vertical supports that extend to the base of the cabinet you'll most likely need an extra set of hands to help set the sink if it's a little low you should erase it then double check the height now that our sinks in place you can call your installers to install your new top however we're gonna be installing a butcher block top you can see the installation of a Lowe's

floor apartment of their century home it's got tons of character tons of tradition and what we wanted to do was kind of spin it on its head and put in something unexpected so we did this very beautiful contemporary kitchen this house was in pretty rough shape when i first saw it it had had years of i think owners that instead of doing a proper fix to it they you know painted over the wallpaper or paneled over the wallpaper so nothing was done correctly so when we started peeling back the layers we found delicious things like rosettes on the ceiling and you know the most amazing window and door trim it was just every every day was like christmas it was very very fun when i first saw the place where i'm standing right now was actually a wall so behind this wall was the kitchen but we wanted it to be open to the living space they've got little kids so we took the wall down so it really made the space feel bigger and brighter and gave like the mom can see the kids when they're playing it's a great fit for them as a family a kitchen this cool needed an equally amazing sink we searched high and low and found the perfect fit which is this beautiful anthracite sink from blanco there's a lot i love about this sink it's made of steel granite so it's basically indestructible it's almost velvety there's no scratching kids can't do anything to it drop a pot it's going to look as good as it did on the day that you bought it even though our kitchen is very contemporary and modern we did use a farmhouse style apron front sink from blanco and it just looks gorgeous plus you get that extra view of that silk granite velvety texture on the front it's really really lovely i love mixing different design styles like in here we have a bit of a farmhouse feel and then we also have a very contemporary kitchen i also like mixing metals and we have the rustic dark on the stools and then we have this very very beautiful sleek faucet from blanco it's a touchless it's a lent to senso faucet which makes it so convenient and it looks just gorgeous when i take on any new client i actually do a lot of research because we're doing different styles of houses for just about everybody so i take that very seriously and this house was no different i did a ton of research looking at you know different styles and how to mix that contemporary and traditional aspect and then we use this great company that did all of the doors the backsplash the island so it gives it this great contemporary feel for a fraction of the price if you would have done it through a custom cabinetry company and when you save that money then you get to spend your savings on things like countertops and sinks the counters are crazy in here my client is not afraid of bolt i originally just pitched to matte black and she wanted something even more so when we found this slab she said can we can we can we and i said let's do it it's marble that we had antiqued and leathered it's durable you're not going to see anything they have little kids so they didn't want anything that felt precious i love a waterfall countertop and because we're doing this peninsula i wanted it to feel finished i also wanted it to kind of block in you know the stools for the seating and so it was the perfect place to do it but yeah i just think it's like wow it's the first thing you see when you walk in the ceilings in this place are crazy high we actually had a drop ceiling that we didn't know about when we first came to the site and then revealed that we had even higher ceilings and so they actually have a ton of storage in a very small space i love open shelving in a kitchen not everybody does i think the best way to do it is to have a combination of open and closed because you know you can't have all of your stuff looking great all the time but when you have that open shelving especially in a small space it feels like it breathes a bit so it's not just covered to cover everything closed and you have a moment to add some styling and it's a pretty little vignette we are fully open concept in this room so not only do they have the kitchen and one nice spot for the kids to tuck in and have lunch but we also have a dining table which is great because it's right beside the fireplace makes for super great dinner parties they love it the paneling on the walls we completely started from scratch nothing was there i really had this vision for it my client loved the idea i think it adds so much texture it's an architectural detail that i love and it feels like art on its own you don't have to layer it up can we talk about these delicious floors they are stunning it's a walnut but we did it in this chevron pattern that feels like authentic to the original house right which is what we wanted to do and it's just i mean it gives you so much texture again it's gorgeous i would like floors like this in my house i think one of the most fun parts of my job is being able to mix different design aesthetics together and play with things and figure out the puzzle of how those two things can work together and i think you shouldn't be afraid to do that i've never been one to be afraid to go graphic and bold and use color or you know something surprising and i encourage you to do the same it's amazing what those big moments can bring to a space", "tyCI9OIh9oQ": "welcome to

kitchen sink every day and usually do this deep cleaning activity every other week but for the last few days I got caught up with work and life in general so wasn't able to deep clean my saying for the last three to four weeks I guess so now it's high time for me to do this because if I procrastinate in any further then it will become all the way more difficult for me to clean it later so guys let me show you how I transform my kitchen sink from this to this so let's get started so we just finish our dinner and I'm done with doing the dishes so after washing up the sink looks something like this as you can see that there is water everywhere we had a big meal and hard to wash a big pots and pans that's why that's the leftovers food particles I don't even why I'm showing you this I must be crazy so yeah I'm going to quickly wipe up the sink and throw away the food particles and I will be back so today I'm going to be using vinegar water and baking soda to clean my kitchen sink you can use bleach or any other same cleaners as per your choice but after my daughter is born I do not use any harsh chemicals at least in my kitchen area so only toxins free and organic things you'll find in my kitchen um so my kitchen sink condition is not that bad but I'll show to you this strainer or needs some love and care today so yeah this is the result of not deep cleaning it for four weeks in a row so it's not that bad but yeah but still it needs it needs to be cleaned so here are four some when you go into this bowl and now I'm going to put some baking powder into it be careful if you do it because it bubbles up a little and it reacts to just be careful if you're trying this and then I'm going to put this bad baby in this bowl and let it sit for a while [Music] now I'm going to sprinkle baking soda all over the sink area now depending upon how much clearing my sink needs I sprinkle less or more baking soda accordingly now let me show you my sink drain can you see all that Brown gun from inside yucky mmm it is so strange guys that every time I think of cleaning something assuming that it does not need that much screening and every single time I end up discovering that how dirty it was every single time so I'm going to claim it trying today yes have all motivated to do it so what I've done over here is I have fought some more baking sodas straight into both the drains and I will be spraying some water vinegar mixture onto that baking soda is basically a salt which is composed of sodium ions and bicarbonate ions and when it is mixed with vinegar it becomes a wonder cleaner vinegar and baking soda both are outstanding natural cleaners and they also carry some disinfectant properties and the mixture directly attacks gunk like that but guys before doing any of this make sure you know what material your sink is made up of as it is not it's advice to use it on some surfaces like aluminum and granite I think but if you have a stainless steel sink like mine then go ahead and do it now I'm just praying some water vinegar mixture onto the sink generously and I'm gonna let it sit for five minutes at least [Music] guys um if you have a real nasty sink trap which is damaged by hot water then take a kitchen floss like this or a kitchen towel dip it into the baking soda and vinegar mixture and wrap it around your tab if the stains are really bad you can even leave it for two to three hours to work it properly or even leave it overnight my tapping our dad's badge so I don't need to do this I'm just showing you that how it can be done now I'm going to take a damn kitchen crawl and I will be simply spreading the mixture evenly on all over the sink area [Music] [Music] then I'm going to take this use lemon and scrub it ah scrub the sink with it ah the citric acid and lemon makes them perfect for removing any hard water deposits if you have a garbage disposal system in your sink then just save your leftover orange and lemon pieces in the freezer and at the end of the day just throwing one or two pieces in it and run it which will clean your garbage disposal and will make it smell refreshingly amazing so now I will just finish scrubbing it and let it sit for 20 minutes and meanwhile I'm going to put my feet up and enjoy a cup of tea that's my husband so after 20 minutes I'm back and now I will take an old toothbrush and try to clean difficult places where grime deposits like the tap of names the tap extensions [Music] this part is the most ignored part of fat tab because I use it so often and the heart and the water is both inside and so two cultures clean it tip so that's why I just try and do it every other week but this time yeah it didn't happen so here I have taken a skewer and just trying to scrub the slime in the drain as you can see that it is already clean so much but I am just scrubbing it gently if you want you can also take out the basket and the drain basket but I'm I'm not doing it so now I'm going to just wipe off the sink first of the soda and then I'm going to thoroughly rinse it with water so I have rinsed this thing properly and now I'm going to quickly show you how the strainer looks like I didn't scrub it much just I took it out of the bowl and then give it a gentle scrub not bad so I applied the same dry and now the final step of buffing for buffing and just taking few drops of olive oil on a kitchen towel I think that I have taken too much but only two to three drops to do and then I'm rubbing it all over the same and after buffing it looks like this the olive oil not only shines the same but creates a protective coating on your saying to deal with hard water spots so I am pretty happy with the way my sink is deep cleaned it is this clean and shiny I'm feeling happy and

next one [Music]", "NHDxOoYl3aw": "guys two very very important tips when it comes to a kitchen sink that's backed up on a third floor or second floor you as the contractor and you as the homeowner must follow come take a look all right here folks were here at a condominium complex with common area dream kitchen sink it's backed up it's affected the cabinetry here swelled up the wood see here too so the first step we're going to do is get prepped up to extract the sewage when the sinks were able to cable [Music] all right so here we are up on the roof this is a great great alternative to sneaking out a kitchen kitchen on a condominium complex especially when the line is a common area line going through the roof it is the best way so let's go ahead and I'll show you what that looks like we're actually right on the stoppage right now all right we're in unit 104 you can hear the cable that we have all the way down from the roof what I'm doing after we've been sneaking for about a half hour filling up the sink in 104 with hot water and we're gonna verify if the drain is clear on this floor here so let's go ahead as you can see it's draining pretty good a nice burst of air meaning it's a healthy thing let's get the hot water running now we're gonna go ahead and go up to unit 204 and run their water to make sure that the training is actually opened up all right so here we are in 204 [Music] wanted to make sure you straining properly all right that's first I want to show you a quick little drawing that I did here so this right here is the larger what we call main pipe so this would be like in a garage people park underneath there you've got your sewer mains then this is the first floor so this would represent the first floors kitchen sink so think of a cabinet the pipe underneath okay second floor third floor and the ruiers the tip when you're dealing with kitchen sink stoppages or any stoppages in a three-story building so first and foremost if you're on the third floor and you have a stoppage make sure that if you're gonna steak you want to sneak down all the way down to the main the problem in that video is when they did the stinky they pushed their cable and so what happened was they put the stoppage they left the stoppage there so when they went to go test on the third floor he ran water well it's gonna take a very long time for the water to come all the way up in addition if nobody's home which in this case nobody was home for over a month in the second floor because the second floor is the lowest point well guess what yes stoppage is gonna rise here water's gonna come up here and then dump over so when the club who was actually testing the third floor all the water was dumping into the second floor this plumber thinks up got it we're clear so anytime they're sneaking out a stack very very important knock on the door of the second floor knock on the door of the first floor make sure you test the best way to test is to fill up the sinks especially on the third floor and verify that you've got full flow because the key to this guy's it is taking this topic all the way down to the me when it gets to this point here the stoppage is clear hopefully that helped thank you alright so the second tip is if you have access to a roof and the vent is coming right up straight giving you a straight shot then what you can do is actually get your larger capable machine like you saw in the video and we ran our cable all the way down we actually felt we hit that stoppage and pushed it down now the reason why you want to go from the roof is again the larger the cable the better you're gonna clean that line it's a very very important tip now a good way to do that is you can actually take a penny and drop it down the vent and put your ear to it if that penny makes a sound of splashing in the water you know that your cable is going to be able to go in here and in clog this or if you're trying to figure out what vent to use up on the roof just take a penny drop them down the the vents and if you're hearing a water splash that's the vent that you're going to insert your cable the unclog well folks hopefully this gave you the inside on how to snake out a drain and economy Miam complex as always thanks for watching", "sTEvPGIxBMc": "hi guys did you work our welcome to my channel hi guys doing you missed me cuz I miss you you don't know me my name is mark girl and in today's video I want to show you how to tackle that under the cabinet sink I know I promised you the bedroom tour which will come I think after this video but I hate to do this person to that is unnerving me Oh golly it's the disorganization that I have under this counter under this kitchen sink so what I want to do is show you and also I have a leak so I had a garbage disposer that must be placed so the other one left thumb deep and you know I have like the white cabins on the inside when you have these white cabinets you have to be really really careful cleaning constantly they are behind maintenance so anyway they love to stain and was kind of like yucky looking so I want to take care of that situation so I want to show you my captain how is so disorganized and sometimes I know some boys had those cabinets that are a little disorganized so put the tackle under that kitchen sink alright guys so I'm gonna take you to Walmart you're gonna shop with me for a few minutes and let me show you what type of containers I got for they also I'm gonna show you some cleaning supplies I use from silver cleaner all the way to what I used for the st. the towel and the floor is alright let me show you my labeling system as well so you know just in case you may have other family members that you know how you have things that your family members put stuff all over the place you don't owe me and when you looking for cleaning supplies you can't find it look that is what I'm gonna tackle as well alright guys so let's get started alright guys it's your girl and welcome [Music] now the first thing I want to do is clean the bottom of this cabinet out so I'm gonna remove all the cleaning supplies in this shelf and the bucket out and I'm going to start this cabinet I want it free and clear so I'm gonna put these clean supplies on top of the kitchen counter [Music] okay once I have everything clear and free I'm going to vacuum so I'm going to just get rid of all the debris that is left here you know so anything any particles that fell down and then I'm going to spray I'm using this cleaner with leach I'm gonna believe saturate this because I want this to kind of the sit and soak okay because this is like really dirty down here so I needed to soak for a while and I normally do something strong it's a cleaner like with bleach like the mrs. Myers to me is a nice cleaner but when I was something really that's gonna tackle something harsh and hard to clean I want either a bleach or I want to use zap and Zepp is usually at Home Depot and the next thing I'm gonna do now is use my cleaning tabs now guys these cleaning tabs I made this DIY I made from mrs. Meyers products I use her dish little her cleaner citric acid and I'm using my eraser and I also used um some essential oils because I like a nice like a nice lemony fresh scent to these now let's tackle the bottom of this cabinet as you can see here that it is coming up you see I let it soak and this is a strong cleaner so make sure you ventilate and you also have your windows open for that and sometimes you if you have asthma guys make sure you use a mask for this because it's a really strong product [Music] over here you can see that most of the degree came up and most of the cleaner came up this thing came up just about you're gonna have some stains left over because it's been sitting there Wow so what we're gonna do next is just let this dry and then we're gonna head up the Walmart so I'm gonna go to Walmart to look for some supplies I'm already have my cleaning supplies I don't need any cleaning supplies but I do want to take you down housewares and to show you some of the storage containers I use for my under the cabinet organization and also again guys I like I showed you I will show you later how I like to label just so I know where everything is at all times I like everything I had a certain space so I'm coming down a towel and this out here is where you have your containers your food containers for your cereals for your any not so grays so these containers are like some look at the different size of the containers [Music] okay so I'm checking out the different store just it's the 21 copy or not something like this our light for the laundry room to use for like the tabs for your um soap powder and up top here is the four and a half cup which is a little bit too small our other sixteen cup here is just too large because it won't stack on top it'll really be too big for the cabinet but I like this size right here which is a seven a half cup that is a perfect size for what I need look at that way and look how secure it is it's text1 on top of the other and guys this is another reason why I go to Walmart and not home goods because look at the supplies and look at this 3-pack you know but I want all the same size but this is good as well because it's only $15 the reason why I go to Walmart instead of the other stores is I want to see a quantity I want to make sure that if I need 4 or 6 4 or 6 pieces and normally when you go to like we know when we go to what any other stores and yes we do all I can love them but they don't have the quantities of time and that's the problem I don't have the quantities at this Walmart I know I can go to another Walmart or order online and I know they're gonna have the same product that is why I mostly stay with that [Music] now I'm coming over here are the dishcloths now I use these for cleaning only and I keep these under the sink as well now when it comes to dish cloth and dish towels I would never put them under my sink because for a discount example what happened where I have a lead because of my garbage disposal went bad or if my dishwasher backs up so I wouldn't want to have that chance of having some clean dish cloths that I used to wash dishes under my sink all right I keep them above the counter or I put them on my towel rack another thing I decided to do is do a liner for the bottom so once I you know clean and prep it I'm going to put a liner there so this time is protected and also God I use these liners for the jurors from our Alex shells for my makeup tests as well and it keeps my arm containers from sliding so these are really cause so again this is an under $10 guy so this is a great thing to put on your shelf ok coming over here is now this is exactly what I was looking for look at this is for the under the counter and these little bins they only three dollars and 87 cents so they're cheap here at Walmart so with these they are so stackable and I'll show you how what you do is it's clip the gray part off and they stack on top of each other but I won't be using it for that I just needs to house my cleaning supplies and also I have room as you see the lid here for label making alright guys let's get back to the cabinet and let's get the rest of this project done all right guys let's get started okay so this is a product I will be using for the cabinet to kind of be stored back to that white where it was staying so this is a stain blocker this blocks heavy interior stage disease kills this is at the home oh I think this only cost maybe like four or five dollars no it's five dollars and some change okay so it's called interior or base so you can use it on the inside I have used this but make sure if you use anything like a spray paint it doesn't smell as strong as straight-8 but when I used it before I do open up all my windows and I then as well but it doesn't have that small that's pls strong smell so again I use this and it cleans the cabinet's up so guys let's get started I'm gonna show you how quickly this works okay so make sure you shake the can you know really good and make sure that the nozzle matches up on the can so you can have a nice even flow all right this is an easy thing to do is basically like spray paint and remember you want a nice even flow going back and forth you don't want it to run so just make sure they're good make sure you line it all up so again I'm shaking it again and I'm gonna light flow I'm only gonna do the edge there I got easy to decide and I'm only gonna do the bottom you see how clean and white that looks it's not shiny like spray paint it's just a blocker a lot of people use it for their interior basements you know because it kills has use for that if you have a old home especially East Coast home so you have basements that's what they use a lot of these parts for but never comes in a spray can so you want to probably try this product cause look how it's just even look how bright white that is and I probably do maybe one more coating I'm gonna let this dry overnight and then try again in the morning again like I said make sure when it's open and everything is fitted properly [Music] these are the containers I got from homework so what I'm going to do now and you can see that they are already labeled so I'm just going to separate all my supplies and put them in each container [Music] the bins already and they're already labeled now I'm just going to divide my cleaners and put them in each one as you can see here in order to stack them you just have to flip the gray tabs and the business knocked out on top of each other now I won't be stacking up my bins because of course the cleaning supplies are way too tall and I won't be using anything underneath that so I'm going to go with this theory I only going to use the bin side-by-side and just put the supplies in them and I'm going to divide them into each bed now guys this is the silver cleaning the right super clean I used to clean my silver and also if it's really hard to clean I use a bar keeper's the cleanser and also use a liquid now I'm not too crazy about barky because it does a great job but to me it gets a little chalky especially that one and also it gets too abrasive towards your sulfur and sometimes my pieces seem scratch and here it is my favorite supplies also are that I like Home Depot's brand of zipper supplies so when I have like really really tough hard to stains like I showed you before I use em so now I'm the second I'm in and then that's it guys it's time to get this ready and also what I'm going to do is its line everything up and position exactly how I want it under the cabinet [Music] [Music] as you can see here this is the overview of all the items is going under the cabinet so I have the two bins here to the right and then I'll have my the two tall ones that I use for sponges now when I label it because it has a black lid I used a white tape and when I have the white lid I use a black for my labeling and as you can see and as you can see here they are by cleaning tabs gloves and so as pads and also dish washer tabs coming over to the left you'll see a small bin here I can't remember exactly where I got that small bit but those are the cleaning cloths and there and also like when you get a little popup on pipes from the Dollar Tree so there will be house there as well alright guys so everything is ready for under the counter so the next thing is to put in that liner all right so what's the liner goes in I place everything and that is it alright guys so let's get started with this let's finish this project up [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] I just want to show you real quick this quick product this heavy-duty scouring stick this is the first time I've ever used this is amazing so let me know in the comment section have you ever used this product before it cleans your porcelain like you told it especially here in Nevada where being able to like a lot of linemen are told is it scrubs it it sort of looks like they dumped the file like I figured out a file that you would use to scrub and it didn't scratch it I wouldn't put this on your silver but also use it for different products like maybe the inside of your oven if you want to clean out the grills so let me know if you ever try this product it is awesome this is a second best particle up next to the eraser [Music] [Music] okay this is the end of this video let me know if you like this hopefully you did so if you get any tips let me know what works for you and if anything help alright guys let's get this bedroom done okay so let's do the spectrum tour and thanks again guys again for being so patient with me and my illness alright guys this is your marker and I'll see you at the next video", "mEvxqo1BIX0": "was Reutimann say Christine for

solid service sink they get so dirty and stained up well it's not really a stain it can come out with some basic cleaners from the local market first thing you're going to need is an abrasive cleaner

you haven't already get this printable so you can follow along today we're tackling under the kitchen sink set your timer for 15 minutes hopefully it doesn't even take that long this is about finding things you don't use you don't love you don't need any more of those extra vases those cleaning supplies you never use get rid of them and then just tidy up your cupboard it should not take you more than 15 minutes so let's get started right now okay let's do this this isn't even that bad but like crazy okay so I had an extra boss and instead of just like having the extra buzzes - like what case joe buys me flowers which he never does I shoved them filled with all the grocery bags so it's like storage tickets to use the buzz if I have to I could still use it but otherwise it's storing all of the extra grocery bags that I got there okay so day one I didn't really have a lot to declutter in this space but I did find paper bags that I never use that I can donate to my kids schools and just a lot of extra cloths and sponges and some garbage that I'm no longer using i declutter this space quite often so this perhaps was a bad one to start with but I really want to see yours I want to see what you do and how much you get out of your space so post a picture on Instagram don't forget to tag me or you know post on my facebook page so I can check out what you've decluttered and I did want to show you a little bit about the organization under here and just we have a lot going on under this kitchen sink but it's really organized because of a few things number one we've turned this into our recycling center so we have one here for paper and we have another one on this side for cans and plastic and they're really thin I'm gonna put a link below two garbage cans that are really similar to this where you can get them and because they have this curve you can still store a ton of stuff underneath and I also love using these dollars to our containers these are from the Dollar Tree but they're like impairment from laundry I'm not sure but they're like sort of squishy so they're perfect for getting rid of pipes and other things that you could be storing under your kitchen sink you really Corel everything and keep it from getting like crazy messy so that's it for today that's it a quick declutter of under the kitchen sink it probably didn't even take me five minutes I want you to do the same thing right now like shut off the computer go what are you waiting for declutter under your kitchen sink and I'd love to see you before and after picture if you want to post it and I'll put some links to my Instagram and things like that in the comments below thanks so much and I'll see you next time so thank you guys so much for those of you who are staying to the end this space wasn't cluttered I have some cluttered spaces but they're coming in the future my whole point of this was I wanted to really inspire people to declutter their home by these little chunks right so it's not some big crazy undertaking and it's not about having something be Pinterest worthy and you know super beautiful to built it being functional and the thing is sometimes declutter it's like super overwhelming especially you know if you've read the Marie Kondo book which it that works you guys it does but I don't have the time or the patience to grab every article of clothing I own in my house and pile it all on my floor and make a huge mess in the process and then go through and say does this bring me joy to everything I touch ain't nobody got time for that well some of you so good I don't have time for that I'm a DD this is called a DD perching so this is what this is gonna be all about it's quick 5 10 15 minute decluttering projects that are gonna add up to the same result as if we took everything out and piled in a huge pile in our living room only without the mess and the aggravation and the stress and having to touch all our stuff so I hope you're gonna enjoy let's move on to

at how to unblock a sink for more help done we hope you enjoyed this tip", "n3kVpCEsOqA": "Welcome to Tomahawk DIY everyone.  \nToday we\u2019ve got a little problem with the kitchen sink. As you can see it\u2019s plugged full of water and there\u2019s something going on here.  \nI\u2019m going to show you a few ideas, a few different ways you can work to get your sink flowing again.  \nThis side\u2019s plugged. This side\u2019s the side with the disposal in it.  \nOver on the other side here we\u2019ll turn on the water and this \nis actually flowing still. So, Let\u2019s take a look under the sink and \nsee what\u2019s going on. So, this side\u2019s still flowing over here, so we know that the path is clear down through the U bend and P trap here. This side with \nthe disposal is where the plug is, so somewhere in here.  \nAlso, check out my other video on getting your disposal working again if it\u2019s \ngiving you a hard time. So, Let\u2019s see what we can do to get whatever\u2019s \nplugging this up taken care of. One thing you can try is using a plunger. Now, you might want to consider carefully, first, Whether you want to use the same plunger \nthat\u2019s been used in your toilet or perhaps you have one specifically for a \nkitchen sink, or you can pick one up for pretty cheap. That\u2019s not a bad way to go, \nputting a plunger to use. If you\u2019re going to do that, make sure in \nthis drain you cover it so that as you\u2019re applying some pressure \nhere you don\u2019t get a spout coming up on the other side, it\u2019ll give you a little surprise.  \nAnother thing we can try is dumping a bucket of water down this.  \nHere goes the bucket. That didn't work. So, if that doesn\u2019t work or maybe your sink\u2019s \nalready too full, the next thing to try is reaching your hand down. Again, making sure the disposal\u2019s turned off, feeling around there for anything that\u2019s plugging it. If you don\u2019t find anything to free up there, maybe you know sometimes there\u2019s a rag or \nsomething or sponge that\u2019s gotten jammed down in there.  The next thing we\u2019re \ngoing to try is actually taking apart the drain down below. Before we do that though all this water\u2019s \ngoing to come out when we take the drain apart, so we need to scoop and transfer this over. \nOne of the first things to do is get something to help catch the water \nthat\u2019s going to come. I like to have a towel handy, as well, \njust in case we start overflowing or you can have a second bucket handy.  \nAnd then it\u2019s pretty easy, start disconnecting. These are simple thumb screws.  \nYou can check out my other video here if you want to learn about cleaning out your P trap and things like that.  \nIt\u2019s pretty much the same process. We've got\na little bit of water coming out here. I\u2019m just going to help that along. You want to avoid having a big flood. I\u2019m just applying a little bit of pressure here \nto separate these connections. So let\u2019s take a look in here. \nSo, the way this joint works, you\u2019ve got water coming in from one side here and \nthen you have water coming from above. There\u2019s a panel about halfway through to keep these flows from trying to prevent \nthem from background up to one another.  We can see that right here.  \nOur plug\u2019s going to out blockage is going to be in this \nlittle section back there. To get at this, we need to get in through \nthe top here. To do that, we\u2019re going to loosen this \none right here so we can swivel this. All right, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got.  \nYou might need to get some needle nose pliers or something to get in there.  It looks like we\u2019ve got a bunch of eggshells going on here. Slide this whole thing out and we\u2019ll dump it out. So, there it is, jam packed. Let\u2019s empty this thing out. There we go. That looks a little bit better.  \nWe can see right through it. Now one thing always to remember when \nyou\u2019re working on your sink down here always, always, always resist the urge to \nrinse something out like this by turning the water on up above because then \nyou\u2019ll just create a flood down here. I might have learned that by experience the hard way. So now you just start piecing this back together and slowly tightening things down. You don\u2019t want to go and tighten it all at once, but rather \nstart getting them lined up and work your way through the \ndifferent rings tightening a little bit as you go. That\u2019ll help ensure everything sits \ntogether nicely and seals up well. One thing I like to do is wipe \neverything dry around here. Slip our pan back under and then we\u2019re going to run \nsome water for a few minutes and check, and just make sure there\u2019s no slow leaks that start coming. If you\u2019re a little unsure of your handy work, you can leave a pan under and just keep an eye on that.  Make sure you \ndon\u2019t have any water leaking slowly.

life before starting preparation is key remove the old silicon with a sharp knife and clean the area to remove any oil or grease ensure the area is dry before applying the new silicon a mold resistant silicon is recommended for kitchens and bathrooms and they're available in a range of colors when applying silicon applied a 45 degree angle with even pressure to ensure the silicon fills any gaps and doesn't just sit on the surface keep the nozzle and the tools clean at all times make use of a silicon tool to get a perfect finish and allow the silicon to completely cure before using the area they haven't the joint has been resealed a brand new bead of silicon it looks fantastic the applicator tool made a huge difference to clean up beat up smooth and flush from all clips just like this check

it just looks so fun cool really and so you put your hands in it yes and now you have wax all over Ian's hmm what were you supposed to be doing right now what cleaning my bathroom all right well let's see if we can get it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "8_5gX6--ZWk": "[Music] now most of us don't appreciate a drain that's running properly but if the kitchen sink the bathtub the basin or the toilet get clogged up we got big problems we'll show you how to manage those problems come on let's take a look now here's what we have in our arsenal first of all chemical warfare these chemicals are great but be sure that you read all the caution notices on the back and use them safely the next thing I recommend in most cases is the plumbers friend the suction cup and it can actually be your friend because if you use it properly you probably are not going to have to call that plumber the third thing is the plumbers snake and it is called also an auger and you can see why they call it a snake I mean it's really flexible it works its way around curves inside the pipes comes in a lot of different sizes and shapes and even one that you can attach a drill to and this one is also called a snake but it's also called the closet auger and you use this in connection with a toilet that's all stopped up and the last thing that I think is really neat is a little device that fits on the end of the garden hose when you stuff this down the pipe and you cover up the overflow or the other side of the sink or whatever and you turn the water on this swells up inside the pipe so no water can back up all the force goes down to remove the clog right now though we got a kitchen sink that's all clogged up that we need to take care of now for a kitchen sink clog remember I told you that you don't to use a drain cleaner if it's completely clogged but if you've got some flow in there you can use a drain cleaner and it'll flow on down to where the problem is it's best used as preventive maintenance be sure you read all the directions and the safety cautions my first tool would be the plumbers friend you don't have to have a higher education to be able to handle it all you have to do is have enough water in the sink to cover about an inch at the bottom of the plunger and be sure that the other side of the sink or whatever else like an overflow in a basin is covered up then you want to get in here and make several good shots a lot of people will do just a couple of them and they'll look for the water to start running out and it doesn't happen they feel it's no good you've got to have fifteen or twenty good and then if you step back it's probably going to work if it doesn't try it again it's great exercise and works off the frustration that you might have you know the most common problem area is this a little u-shaped trap that's down underneath the sink maybe you wonder why they'd have something like that and under there if it's going to cause all that problem well the reason is because with water that's trapped in here the sewer gas cannot back up and come in into your kitchen so it's a good thing but if you've got a clear plastic one you can look in there and see the problem if you can't you can take this off of here be sure you have a bucket under there because it's gonna be full of gunk and water and incidentally this part of the trap system right here is coming out of the wall now if the problem is not in the u-shaped trap then the problem is probably on down the line this way you can remove this and you just take a slip nut off and now you have a straight shot into the drain with your snake so you'll probably get to the problem this is not the only problem area though let's go to the bathroom so to speak now when you have a toilet clogged use the plunger first nine times out of 10 it's going to take care of the problem as we've always told you you want to be sure to be patient with it let it have a time to do its thing if it doesn't work give it a few more tries because it really should work if not then we go for the big guns and this is called a closet auger and what you do is you see that padded part right down there is plastic it's not going to scratch up your toilet you want to be very careful because if you make scratches in this porcelain they're there forever and there'll be a problem forever now you can feed that snake on down in there when you get it down far enough you can turn and it's going to take care of any clog that's in the toilet when you get ready to take it out after you want to sing your victory song be sure you retract the snake so it doesn't scratch and put it aside one of the most common problems for toilet clogs is tree roots that grow into the pipe when they grow in there the treeger roots will catch all the toilet paper that comes down there and before long you've got a clock now this is a product that has copper sulfate as a base and if you'll use it a car to the direction it's going to eat up those roots and if you use it correctly it will act as preventive maintenance so the roots will never grow back actually you've got something in your house right now probably that'll do the same thing that's rock salt it's not as good as copper sulfate but it can get the job done just put a couple of cups down flush it twice and that ought to take care of the problem you know there are other problems in the bathroom though how about the tub now when the drain problem is in the bathtub I think it's fairly normal that people would think well we'll attack it right down here at the drain that's not the best place the best place is up here this is called an overflow up here this big hole and you remove the over full plate and pull this out of there and a lot of times this is where the problem is you're going to find a whole bunch of hair caught on this it may be a brass cylinder a plastic one like this we don't have that problem so our next thing is to attack the problem right through here and what we're going to do is feed a snake down there and then so we don't have to do any work we're going to use the one that has the drill on here about any kind of clog you have now fall your efforts inside have them worked out look for one of these it's called a clean-out plug it should be either on the side of your house down in the basement or someplace get a wrench to it and remove the plug don't be surprised that some water falls out when you open it up but what you're going to do now is to take the plumbers snake and feed it in here and you just keep feeding it until you reach the clog it will make the turns and when it gets to the clog it's going to be able to break it apart and you're going to be home free without having to help the plumber put his kids through college [Music] you", "j_fZC5d_E68": "Pam Pryor cami\u00f3n para Oh hey guys welcome back to our Channel today we're gonna unbox this cute little set that is like a little kitchen sink it does come with some different little accessories little spoons and forks and plates and stuff but you're supposed to be able to fill this bottom part up with water and turn a

and we'll see you guys next time thanks for watching guys why [Music]", "WJShOM0Pxws": "[Music] hey guys this Jen welcome back to my channel today I am sharing a video that I filmed this weekend I had a goal to organize under my kitchen sink you can see here that I have a corner sink in my kitchen which I totally love but it is sort of an awkward space to organize along with the garbage disposal so I've already taken everything out from under the sink because we actually had a small leak so you can see that I've got some cleaning supplies in this mop bucket some leather wipes sponges Murphy's wood soap and just tons of different cleaners that are totally unorganized I was trying to organize some different things in a basket there but not doing a very good job of it so yeah just a lot of household items that need to get organized and put away so that I can find them easily again so you can also see that I like to store my extra plastic bags under the sink and I'll show you here in a little bit what I'm going to put those in like I said it's a nice big space under here but it's just sort of awkward with the shape and how big the garbage disposal is so in preparation for this project I went ahead and picked up a few things on Amazon I did end up liking these I will leave links in the description box below if you're interested in purchasing the same thing I did these slide out trays are by idea works there are two of them that I ordered and then I also ordered this plastic bag holder and it comes with both screws and adhesive so that you can either adhere it to the wall or screw it to the wall I'm actually going to put it under the sink so I went ahead and it took the 3m adhesive strips out of the package and then I'm just going to adhere one of the foam squares to each corner of this now I will say that the next day I went back under the sink to grab a plastic bag out and this had already fallen off the inside of the wall in there so if you want to do this I would recommend that you get some command strips you can get those basically at any store Dollar Tree Walmart and I think I'll be getting some of those soon too to put on there so that it doesn't fall off you can see here that I'm just kind of adhering it making sure I press it down really well to the inside left of the cabinet and then I'll just go ahead and fill that back up with my plastic bags [Music] I really ended up liking the placement of this it's really just the perfect little tool to help organize those plastic bags in a space where no one can see them so the next thing that I wanted to do was just clean out the bottom of the cabinet before I started organizing everything in there so I'm just using my mrs. meyer's peony multi-surface spray which is my favorite one of the spring since it's now out of stock which is very sad but I am enjoying using it while it lasts and then while I was down there I decided to wipe down the cabinets a little bit as well [Music] okay so I'm going to start putting together these sliding trays by idea works you can see there that there's just one sheet of instructions they're not too complicated to put together but I do have to say that the instruction sheet is not actually the most helpful there's just pictures on there there's no words and so kind of with some trial and error I had to just decide how they fit if I wasn't following this video for you guys I definitely would have taken them to my husband and said here put these together for me he's an engineer and that's what he does for a living so he's definitely more well suited for that kind of work than I am but either way I got it done the back piece there you can see that I'm really struggling with that and I'm like comparing it to the drawing and trying to figure out why it's not popping in there here is a word of advice if you're going to put these together definitely have like a small rubber mallet or I actually used a screwdriver to kind of pound as a pieces in that really helped get them snugged down now once I got it all put together it was very sturdy I really like the finished product I think that it will be great to hold cleaning products and it will be great in case anything spills it will be super easy to wipe down so like I said just make sure you have some kind of utensil to kind of put everything together I'm gonna get a screwdriver here in a little bit if you could hear me talking right now I would probably be saying some curse words but anyway I'm just gonna get the rest of these put together and then I will start adding them to under the sink [Music] so yeah once I figured out that I needed that screwdriver to sort of hammer everything together it all went a lot smoother you can see there that I'm also using that to sort of hammer in the top and then once I get the top on you just basically take those drawers that you built and slide them in super easy there's like a little lip on the back so that it won't slide through the back but yeah overall I am pretty happy with them what I like about these particular slide-out shelves is that the bottom shelf is fairly tall so you can fit some fairly tall bottles underneath there and still slide out the top drawer okay so you can see here how I decided to configure these I put one on either side of the garbage disposal and I also ended up putting my garbage bags down there kind of behind the garbage disposal that's something that we need to access quite frequently when we change the trash and so I wanted to make sure that those were quite accessible and that we weren't frustrated trying to get them out my dishwasher tabs come from Costco and so they're in this kind of big giant tall container I had a couple of containers just laying around from the Dollar Tree that I had bought for another project and not used and so I decided to use kind of a shallow clear bin for the dishwasher tabs and then I had two smaller containers I'm using those for my dishwasher cleaners I have one kind of more heavy-duty cleaner and then those lemon plank tablets that I use more on a daily basis [Music] so now I'm just gonna get started loading up my trays on this bottom left slide-out I'm going to put things like my scrubber sponges from Grove my magic eraser I also have these kind of reusable paper towel pads from Grove that I haven't tried yet either I have two pairs of regular cleaning gloves and then I have a couple pairs of disposable latex gloves I like to use those for different projects where I might want to throw them away and then I also went ahead and put one of my dish brushes in there in the top of that I'm just going to load some of my mrs. meyer's in method all-purpose sprays and I kind of had to play around with the height of these there was actually just enough room for me to stack those in there and not hit the top of the sink [Music] in the bottom right slide out I'm putting some of my mrs. Meyers cream cleanser some jet dry and then some miscellaneous other bottles I just basically had to find the shortest bottles that I could and put these on the bottom so that I could still slide it in and out pretty easily on the top there I'm going to put some of my multi surface cleaners and my mopping products actually had two bottles of this pledge floor cleaner and so I basically consolidated those into one container and I was actually able to put that in there and still allow it to slide in and out freely so I'm just adding some different things my granite polish was actually too tall and so I went ahead and put that kind of back behind there's a couple carpet cleaners that I don't use very often and so I went ahead and put those back behind the plastic bag holder as well but pretty much everything that I needed to have under there was able to fit in those two slide-out containers the Windex and then that k'rud Kutter degreaser that I used for my stove or two things that were too tall to fit in those slide outs and that's fine I just ended up setting those right in front of the garbage bags and I've been using this configuration for a while now a couple days and it's been working out well so you can see there kind of how I have everything organized I have my dishwasher tabs right up front and center which is really great I obviously use those several times a day so I need those to be accessible and my sponges and my rubber gloves and magic eraser ant dish brush in this slide out I have some of my multi surface cleaners I like to keep a variety on hand so that I can switch those up I have those two small containers of disposal cleaner back under the garbage disposal I have my two tall containers there and then the bottom right slide out has just some miscellaneous cleaning products that are short enough to fit in that slider drawer and then there on the top right is my method wood for good cleaner which I use every day my stainless steel polished at some other mopping and floor care products so basically that's it I'm really happy with how this turned out it was just such a mess before and everything was so cluttered and it's nice to have everything kind of in its place now so I hope this video inspired you to clean out under your sink I know that this has been a problem area for me for quite some time and I've just been putting it off so thanks again for watching this video if you haven't already subscribed I would love it if you would do so and I will see you in my next video bye [Music]", "Urvzf62ARnU": "thinking about updating the look of your kitchen replacing your undermount sink is an easy upgrade and we're gonna show you how to do it right our undermount sink was installed with our new countertops and it looks great but recently I've been thinking about replacing this stainless steel with matte black to add more contrast to my kitchen we want to make sure the new sink will fit perfectly in the hole we already have so we took measurements and went to Lowe's comm for some online sink shopping our sink is pretty standard but even if it had a unique shape and size Lowe's can special order just about anything you need well our new sink just arrived and I can't wait to get it installed but first I have to remove the old sink an undermount sink is attached to the countertop with silicone sealant and metal clips we're going to use a razor knife to slice through the silicone then unscrew all the clips removing an undermount sink is definitely a two-person job yeah and I appreciate you not dropping the sink on my head babe I know we can't afford a crack sink yeah but what about my head if your old sink is in pretty good condition you can call your local Habitat for Humanity or other donation center before you just throw it away they may be able to give it another life now we need to prep the surface for the new sink I'm using this razor scraper to remove any old silicone that was left behind then I'm going to clean the countertop and the st. with denatured alcohol next we're going to position the sink in the cabinet below the hole and apply a bead of a hundred percent silicone sealant along the edge after Cody raises the sink up to the countertop he'll hold it there while make sure it's positioned correctly we laid this 2x4 on some towels to avoid scratching the countertop I'll run one end of the would clamp through the drain hole and Cody will place another 2x4 between the clamp and the sink to avoid damaging the sink now all I have to do is tighten up the clamp to hold the sink in place now that the sink isn't going anywhere I'm going to reattach the mounting brackets there are several types of brackets for undermount sinks ours are attached to the countertop with epoxy others use a mounting system that anchor into the countertop and may require a specialty drill bit to drill the hole while Cody is sawing the mounting hardware I'm going to use a damp rag to wipe away any silicon that has oozed out into the sink now all we have to do is wait 24 hours for the silicone to dry before we remove the clamp install the drain and hook up the sink to our plumbing we're gonna be adding a garbage disposal and Lowe's already has a great step-by-step video to show you how to do it go check it out this sink looks great and it wasn't too hard to install remember projects like this should be a fun inspirational adventure and now you know how to do it right hey guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to hit the like button and let us know how your undermount sink installation went in the

RV has pretty typical kitchen sinks white Corian if you have this type of sink you've probably also seen that over time white Corian as easy as it is to take care of tends to discolor we normally keep the cover on our smaller sink and you can see here that the larger sink is much more discolored now recently we've intentionally been leaving things in the sink that tend to discolor it like tea bags fresh fruit other things that have a lot of pigment to them that tend to stain the reason we did that is so that it would be really clear on video how badly discolored it is you can definitely see how bad the staining has gotten you can try using just about any cleaning product on here even comet or other abrasive cleaners won't get the discoloring out of the sink we used to try bleaching the chorion which works pretty well but it smells terrible and we'd rather not use bleach and we have a quick tip today on what we now do to whiten our quarry an RV sink start by filling the sink with hot water once you've got an inch or two of water in the bottom of the sink pour in one scoop of OxiClean and just mix it around to start it dissolving while we're doing the big sink we might as well brighten up the small thing too for the small sink you can use about a half a scoop if your sinks are older and really stained up the sides up toward the top of the sink you can fill the sinks completely with water and just use more OxiClean accordingly now just let that sit for an hour or two after an hour to just let the water out both sinks are now bright white you can see that all the stains are completely gone stains from tea or blueberries or any other really difficult stain will come right out obviously this will work on any white quarry and sink not just one in an RV so if you have quarry and sinks in your house obviously you can use it there too OxiClean is also a great laundry booster just put between a quarter and a half a scoop in the washing machine and it will help get your clothes bright and clean [Music]", "HLi0ZVJKzYM": "so what we have to do here of course we're doing plumbing rule number one turn off the water so we have shut up valves under the sink nice and simple now these ones are not quarter turn valve they are the style of valve that have gaskets on them and now this house is really ancient and they actually don't even have modern plumbing coming up to the cold water line that's really creative that's another problem so we're gonna go down stairs and turn off the main water supply because these old valves the gaskets are bad they'll end up leaking and last thing we need down here is to start ruining the cabinets for the water leaking everywhere so we're gonna be installing it's actually kind of cool it's a brand new Kohler cast-iron enameled sink it's a double sink and it's 30 inches which is oddly enough a little bit too big for this cabinet so what we're gonna end up having to do is we're gonna have to cut down through the gable side of this cabinet here so that we have enough room to get the sink in it won't be exactly on center but it'll only be off what a quarter wrench should be pretty invisible so because we have to do that remove this we're gonna be cutting the countertop best to just get rid of the doors this is a nice quick system little pin in the back to pop them off so the way you take these braided faucet lines off really simple it's a three-eighths fitting put your wrench on and you just start loosening it and if there's a little bit of slack once you get it loosened up a bit you can usually do it with your fingers these aren't really difficult to attach and traditionally it's just a little bit of a gasket in there so the reason you need a wrench is when you do it finger tight to install take it and give it another half turn that's usually how you said it okay so this is never fun but you really can't do this blind so it's always good to get right in here just kind of like going for a trip in an MRI machine here we go it's a single faucet and they have just this little threaded piece here to hold that in and on the other side I've got my pullout hose alright these things just we're tightened of course with time you get a little bit of water getting in the wreath and then the particle board on the countertop swells that's more than finger tightened after a while so that's good I'm glad we got that off without too much of a fight disconnect this hose so that have come up through the hole we got lucky today because this one's plastic and not metal so I'm all for keeping my life simple so now we're just gonna take it apart in the reverse order when it was installed so we're just gonna pull out the hose and pull that faucet out now this is always gonna be nasty underneath I've never seen this look good crowbar to pull that out that's ridiculous the way things are done around this I was makes you wonder I'm playing it safe I'm gonna wear some gloves for the rest of this plumbing what is he pulled out the faucet all we have to do is remove the sink back underneath we go and those are a lot of different clip assembly situations going on this one's really simple it's just a long screw and this clip sits in the saddle here and when you tighten this screw it goes up and so it creates that reverse compression pulls the sink down so usually you know six eight to be ten depending on with the rest of the Installer is [Music] just double-check reach around make sure everything's good we're not connected to the counter anymore but we are connected to the plumbing so we have two options you can undo the collar right here if you're going with the same kind and this is really simple you have two connections here so this brass ring here connects the drain with a tail piece and this plastic one here compresses the tail piece onto the ABS usually with a gasket so we can take our wrench and we can put it on here and we can rip this off it usually comes off pretty simple so if you have the ability to reuse your plumbing later this is a great technique let me just separate like that and I just give it a pop I know she goes here's the original rubber gasket this is the plaster steam seen that they send you and you stretch it out around the underside of the sink and then you put it down the compression on those clips is supposed to hold that in place to keep moisture from getting underneath you can see how effective it is it doing that I mean it's not that's why when I'm installing my sinks I like to always make my own gasket out of plumber's putty because you can always use more than you need and let it get compressed out of the gap and then clean that up afterwards so as a contractor I'm always on the lookout for a good deal I have a lot of suppliers that have discontinued product or return product or just they've changed their stock and so they're no longer selling something what are they going to manufacture rebate and they're passing the deal on to us so I have this horrible habit of buying things that I don't need anticipating that someday I'll be able to use it and when I saw this sink I fell in love and whether I was putting this in the clients home or in my own home someday down the road I didn't care this is a Kohler cast-iron sink this sucker here is worth a lot of money and I think I picked this up for 50 bucks great deal so when I got the phone call to do this job Mike I got the sink for you because I saw the cream color tile it's not the greatest but I think this sink is gonna pop and have so much character you'll forget the the rest of this kitchen so the downside of buying things that discontinued or whatever is they don't always have all the parts in this case I don't have the template obviously somebody bought this sink special order this color isn't the standard it's a bone color they went to go install it took up the template realize they had a problem brought the sink back so what I have to do is I got to cut a hole in my existing countertop and into my cabinet that will allow this to be installed without a template so I have to now make my own template we're gonna go 31 and a quarter inches wide 19 and a half deep so before we get too carried away and start cutting holes now that we have our measurements we want to pull out our faucet and just confirm that this faucet and this sink are going to work together in harmony my hope is is that I can cut the hole and remove the countertop and attach the faucet to the sink only not every single faucet will do that so I just want to double check here real quick make sure that that'll be possible we're gonna do a partial installation just to see if this will tighten on this is where we play the jeopardy music well I try to find a thread that I can't see wearing gloves this might seem monotonous but trust me it's a lot of you here to do it here and discover you have a problem before you have this all installed now some of you might be thinking oh you're crazy of course it's gonna not gonna work if this was a regular steel sink the steel gage is so thin you'll see on here on the faucet that once its installed this nut only leaves so much space but because it's a cast iron and it's a thick sink that allows me to go right on to it so I don't have to drill holes after the fact I just saved the step because I took two seconds of my note if that's going to work awesome so we've taken our measurements of our sink we've reduced that number for the over mark them with a pencil now we're just laying some tape out on the countertop so visually I can see it and you can maybe see the pencil line in there son but when I start cutting my jig saw and that gets sawdust blowing everywhere you're really hard-pressed nor my line is this line here represents where I'm cutting I'm also gonna cut right against the back wall you can see this is a much bigger sink so we're not relying on any of the structural components of this cabinet to hold that sink in from the front or the rear and most likely we're gonna have to take the whole front support right out before we even bother starting it's gonna be the gable support of each of the side cabinets that's gonna be carrying the weight direct load transfer just like structure it'll support itself from the side to side without any difficulty at all so before we can remove this piece of cabinet from the countertop just good to know they installed the countertop through the cabinet with these little one and a quarter inch screws you could buy a blade specific for from Ikea countertops not really necessary here because we have a half inch overlay you'll find that the chipping that happens with this blade is so minuscule it's not even 32nd of an inch it's irrelevant to our situation I don't use the tape to keep her from chipping that's so old wives tale if you have to rely on tape to keep something from breaking and you're already made the mistake you know what does work if you use tape on plaster before you put a nail in it that works it's the only time tape isn't it good to you [Music] there we go we just got a trim up a little bit of the particle board in the back corners here grab my fine multi-tool is just like a vibration cutting tool if you don't have one of these bad boys that's fine you can always just use a hammer and chisel you'll get the same result this is just a lot cooler so now we've got the whole set for our sink the the sink is it's only got a half-inch gap on the front so we've got to cut pretty tight here but in the back there's like a boat of three and a half inch space which is awesome because that's where the faucets gonna go so I just traced out the line for where the sink is gonna go the idea here is we're going to cut through the Gable and then we're going to shim underneath between the sink and the gables that there's a direct load transfer so we're not putting all the weight on the countertop so now we're just gonna roll this in all right perfect so now the next step now that we have our sink in place we're going to attach our faucet our drain all that kind of stuff this particular sink doesn't need a gasket it is just too heavy and too flat and it doesn't have a cavity for the gasket to sit in so if you want to seal around this the only thing you can use is a little bit of cured clear silicone that's good when you're tightening this up you don't want to go is you know full full tight right away especially if you're working alone do you have someone working with you like a cameraman you could reach over and hold it in position while you tighten it otherwise finger tighten so it still has a little bit of flexibility we want to lift it forward away from the back wall and that'll be nice there we go just take your pliers what I want to do is to just separate them a little bit there's tabs on that you can turn with but if you have a little bit of torque with a pair of pliers you can really get up tight so you don't ever want those coming loose once you got the rest of your plumbing put together I always want to test to make sure you got it on there tighten up okay yeah those taps are going to move yep so this particular faucet it has a threaded assembly and it has a gasket ring inside here so we're just gonna seat this in push down on this part now the gasket assembly is inside nice and strong there we're gonna just make sure we're not cross threaded we're going to tighten this collar on here and that'll hold it all in place doesn't matter how tight you turn this it won't affect the ability for the faucet to move so feel free to make sure it's nice and snug one more thing we're since we're out in the country and we have well water here a little hard and you saw the cottage plumbing I'm concerned about debris I'm gonna take my knife here I'm gonna take off this extra bit of screen how many screens does a tap need now that the screens are gone we won't have a problem with the faucet bugging up you won't have as much aeration but I'd rather have a faucet that works so here we are with our sink components we've got our basket strainer to take off our nut another nice little gasket here I call it the top hat gasket just so I can differentiate between that I know regular over in I am NOT a licensed plumber I've just installed them gazillion of these things okay and then we just go back all that back together so they simply simple you take your ring you put your brass extension in there then you drop in your washer no pace lose otherwise necessary so once we've these in place we'll be good yeah this is inch and a half pipe and this is an inch and a half hole in the kitchen your father your your strains are always inch and a half hole the exact same piece they make it for bathroom sinks and it's inch and a quarter do not get the wrong one let's drive back to the store you're gonna regret slide that on so it's important once you have everything finger take take the wrench and you really want to tighten the basket nut here it's moving around just put your hand in the top put a little bit of compression resistance there there we go all right just so give us our measurements I just adjust these I'm looking to measure we measure from the inside to where you want the pipe to finish we're looking at a nine and a half inch pipe that's comfortable all right so we're gonna go and cut that first we're gonna cut a one-inch piece for here so we can stick these together and send our water back towards the back corner in this particular application there is no p-trap it's actually in the basement downstairs which is great because it gives you a little extra storage you can keep your garbage and recycling under the sink that way a little old-school love to sand up my ends a little bit one of my birds rough up my fittings I just like to believe that that might just make things stick a little bit better I happen to be aware that there's two kinds of ABS out there one of the building store that was that today to pick these fittings up doesn't carry the kind that I like to use my plumbing supply stores closed and it's the Saturday so I got stuck using this stuff and I know and if you don't rough it up it just does not hold very well then it's time to grab the glue using the yellow ABS glue here I'm going to grab a cloth that stuff can make a mess so respect people's property in their cabinets we're gonna do just do these in first get these prepped up loosen the collar slide that into position just lay that one into position this is really how simple this is iron your glue and then turn these in together tighten the callers leave a bit of a slope hand tight and then 1/4 that's it so what I'm gonna do here so I'm gonna put a little bit of glue here get this connection piece in then I'm gonna just kind of dry fit my corner I'm gonna measure you can see you have to cut the back plate so 10 inches to here 10 inches to the bottom of this so I need a one-handed tool so I can hold the pipe so something is good [Applause] perfectly the secret when your plumbing is your last connection how do you get that pipe in I always think you want to finish somewhere where you can glue this way and then go like that and then shove it in so just pay attention to your process it's your last joints an easy one and then I'll go together really simple like that so this is a braided supply line with a 3/8 female connector has a gasket inside so once again you know we just gotta line it up find the happy place with the thread finger tighten it now you know you've made it to the gasket oh there we go and take your pliers set that on there about a half turn you can over tighten those so this is a lot of tool a lot of torque you can keep going until you can't go any more the danger that is if you ever have to take it off and then reattach it again that gasket will be shot and you'll have to buy a brand new supply line so just another half and if you get a little drip developed you know another little quarter turn that's all you're gonna need try to extend the life of your lines so the last thing we have to do is just silicone the seal around the sink because the nature of the way this is designed there's no room for a gasket underneath so we're gonna just take our new flex 302 love this product it smells a lot like vinegar but the reality is is it works [Music]", "uubJbib3iZg": "## http://topproducts.com/reviews/best-kitchen-sink.htm TopProducts.com Search topproducts.com for the

see if we can give it the old Gundy mama even when I was working again y'all see if we can get a fix for hang on to your panties in my war away whoever's on a job y'all nicholae a victim you in a while but yeah so I was definitely backing up and you did pull some stuff down there right yeah yesterday went in the bottom of the dishwasher wouldn't empty okay and then it back up and dancing you dream my husband came home used a plunger nothing nothing worked all right did it apply try sneaking art yes they took the bottom knot off and tried sneaking it but I gotta get that trap off but he did try right yeah yeah what's the trap that stops the sewer gas from coming in you know ever have a sewer gas that's what the trap that stops the sewer gas without that you'd smell like saw oh yeah cool how do you mom and dad doing really well there are 83 and 87 yeah I know what they what they look pretty good for their age yeah my mom's unbelievably active it's incredible really my dad was more mentally alert than she is but like a good team helped out when I can I got a bucket over here to do you need a bucket I don't know why you did that well to stop the water I guess I'm sure once you took that plug out it really drained a lot yeah we'll fix it up this is like an old farmhouse built in the fifties that wasn't so bad where you get lucky who's your lucky day oh maybe maybe not want to even know false hope you know yeah the key is you got to get the snake down the drain you can't be going up the vent and you know if you don't take this off you can't tell oh yeah holy cow yeah oh that's a blockage you gotta take a look at that I'm gonna give you it's blocked all gonna snake it anyway you want to take a look good grab the light and look right down in here you could see how oh my god you see how walk though Ching well we're going to get the snake down here anyway so I'll clean that out also that's what my husband was saying he said you know take that apart you can have the snake do it anyways yeah right why would you wear gloves I can never figure it out that's what everybody says to me why would you wear gloves figure it out yep Wow I mean it's tough it really came yeah we don't want to go look at that stuff that stuff there's been in there for what it is little bit on the hot I don't want to bolt through the back of the pipe so go easy with it stuff yeah you know we'll get the snake down here we'll be all right a lot of stuff in here it's gonna run a lake up it's gonna run like my ex-wife thought that was funny huh hey I'm bad in bed now she's on a plumber huh yeah no it's better this way this way yeah I can charge her I charge a full price hehe that's better got a kiss getting up getting the snake down the drain do you mind a lot of vegetables awful something that the down and then oh this seems awful seems awful hot in here maybe my husband when he rinses the pot out there the thing that goes into the coffee maker just some coffee grounds on it I wipe it out does he dumped them down he doesn't dump them down just like this paper filter that fits in here sometimes grounds one times you have to cool a couple of times get it down there we're good but it will see we'll give it a flush with some water and oh yeah why didn't call that fire in their plan it was pretty much good at Wow well would you wear gloves I could never figure out know figure out why some older wig loss so she was definitely backing up not going down at all right so you consider retired so I don't get like a full commission like other regulars roses on but I guess partial commission on all the sales she's still back no let's take a look in the basement before I do anything is this can we reserved a basement of this yeah okay yeah so we just call right down there and then we'll go on into this and then this goes up to the toilet so the toilets fine and everything else is fine yeah all right all right so this is the pipe here that's blocked I'll have to snake it again oh that's where you're doing the whole design of it but it's wicked fast yeah what the tiny tires huh shut yer ap-- so we'll snake it again it seems a little a little monkey in there sending a snake in it seems a little tough but do it sometimes you got to do it twice once we get it clear try it again ah see it all morning the water down here we'll see if the taxi is back on up so it's still not still block we'll get it there must be a lot of muck in there so I got to say you got to set the care - huh how long has it been since you've had that cleaned it seems to be getting better here as we go so crazy probably never been cleaned you said huh she's going down probably run the snake down there one more time just for good measure so what happens it gets all full of black mark likes black mud and then you snake it and the mud just goes around your snake so you got to flush it a couple of times back and forth to get it get it clear you know the water helps down in there you do those of you you have radiators or the you got haria huh - you pump your boiler then if you don't radiators should do it now I should be clear now I mean it was some makhani see ya why would you wear gloves like Nastya should be able to give it a full gun day now yeah dumping water down here you can see right you don't do this then you put it back together and it backs up you're gonna take it apart again makes no sense you know so it's good to flush it we should know when you put it back together it's gonna be functional so I'm thinking that's good ma'am that baby flowing three months Littlefoot you better hire someone else me mom's well they gotta strip it and then they gonna do the sheetrock three months since everybody tells me that they go they don't tell you three months that are lying and I mind a permit for it took her a year to get her kitchen yeah yeah and that's their summer as soon as that seems a little bit extreme an imino wouldn't it everybody says it takes about three months oh yeah but you know ya gonna be without a kitchen for three months maybe order in the stuff but you don't have to discontinue no the discontinued no these people I talked to seemed really organized and professional and they were really because I said be honest with me what can I expect you know they tell me well you know I wash my dishes in the band I'm gonna do that well that's enough to scare you yeah it's just like black Wow Wow the dream plane I'm not coffee well you know it's been 25 years since you've had a claim so let's just do you know you have to live your life you know and just don't worry about it just try not to dump grease down the app you can but I didn't see any grease I didn't see any grease so I think whatever you do was working for you just don't worry about it oh that was Jesus I got really hurt years ago there you are she's been gone man huh long time 30 years ago yeah I was just joking around with that oh trying to get you to laugh a little seeing that your uh your sink - disarray what so long okay told me I would see these are not usually not that big a deal you can get the snake down there and full give it a good cleaning your husband back to work we go to work tonight Wow try know what kind of engineer is he rina engineer fired okay great point it was that long top at one time it's always been to burning power from the police station must be I don't know that I never worked all that I used to be in the Union yeah years ago and I worked in a lot of the ball plans was it backing up in the washing machine was it backing up in a dishwasher dishwasher was okay well see I'll tell you why see how this is coming down and then it's coming right in here this is supposed to lube up underneath the countertop and then come back down so if that ever backs up again you want me to fix this I will back up into the washing machine I'd have to add or not on the piece of hose on there do you want me to fix it so let's poke the way it's supposed to be you want me to leave it like that would you have to make holes in the cabinet no what I would have to do is I would have to disconnect the holes here and here and put along a piece and then go up against the bottom of a counter and then back down to this drain if this think of a backup it won't flood your dishwasher alright I'll leave it then you don't want it done believe it man I don't usually have a problem okay well I'm just letting you know that's not that's not wish begun that the hole should go up against the bottom of this cabinet and then back down go up and then back down I see you say so if the sink it doesn't sink ever backs up it won't go down that hose because it's not up against the top let me just talk it's not that big of a deal I got holes in the truck understands all loose me Wow you know I say yeah I'll just do it in the video but it's not right because if this thinking of a backs up its gonna dump in the dishwasher now the hose comes up against this counter top and then back down if this ever backs up it won't go it won't go in the hose I just want to make sure it's going down I got no leaks then we'll change that whole front of until this faucet was all loose man did you see how loose this was I kind of like I tighten it by hand the thing was loose by hand I can't even apply my hands man I mean nothing like that there's two faucets getting a little little vintage here but should be already for a while I mean that thing was I tightened it up by hand good luck he didn't have a flood that's a paper cup that multiply chronomaly them oh yeah yeah right we had size or what you said I want I want to do it right yeah so issues later on no issues what is a clock for an can't squish down see the idea is to get it up as high as we can that make sense yeah so now if the sink ever backs up it's not going to get down the holes right that's just the safety just a piece of 70 holes and 5e holes how's that look as I look better yeah definitely right wanna make sure the wall off us thank you got her on the dishwasher go up underneath of the drain I just want to make sure that connections okay p.m. two jumped up and should be my scooping that out that wouldn't affect now so she's done look what is mean it's a baby dog when she don't wanna you're looking for troll comeback a neat little me he's on licking patrol y'all alright pushover oh I know you got a tough life you got a tough oh yeah I know you do you got a tough life Oh necklace necklace", "sLnZ-oEIGuA": "renew the look and feel of your composite

to be using the drain King this is like the bladder system for a hose so here's how it works it's got this attachment you attach right here to the end of your hose and this part goes in the pipe if you have a pipe like the clean-out and this expands and holds pressure and keeps pumping water through this end and hopefully what that does is the pressure of the water builds up and we'll get the clock to move down and free it up it also comes with this attachment that goes on to the end of this and a little that'll allow us to do is stick it right on this sink fitting right here so we don't even have to use the clean-out so hopefully it'll work on this one and we won't have to use the clean-out normally I'd use a plumbing snake but I'm gonna try this method first because I always like to try the easiest thing first it also comes with this adapter this adapters for say if you didn't have access to a hose you could unscrew this little fitting on the end of your sink and screw this in like so and then you could attach this end to maybe a little hose coming off of here and use it the same way and then just use the water from your sink but all right let's get to it alright so we're gonna go ahead and get our garden hose and bring it inside the house gonna go ahead and take the end of the hose then we're gonna screw the big end right onto the end of that like I said if you're going to use the clean-out or another pipe like directly into the sink of maybe a bathroom sink you can just stick this right and make sure you stick it all the way you know past the bladder part past this part so you need to have it all the way maybe even up here but definitely right here now we're going to use this adapter and this adapter goes right over the whole bladder right like so so it I guess it'll stop this it'll blow up a little right here alright so then we're gonna place it right in the bottom of our drain and it fits right in that hole so it's gonna get a good little section right there alright so it's good to have someone outside running the hose that you could yell to turn off if you need to huh oh okay now he's gonna turn it on don't be afraid of the noise that makes that's normal so see it's coming into my garbage disposal area what you're gonna want ah [Music] all right so see it was backing up back into my garbage disposal area so even though I was holding the pressure I'm you're gonna want to make sure you didn't cause any leaks under the sink as well if you were using the bathroom sink you're gonna want to cover up the little overflow the overflow hole you know at the end of the sink you want to cover that up with a rag or something to create more pressure but all right so the pressure doesn't seem to have released but as you can see there's a bunch of gunk in here so we're gonna have to try it again in a minute all right we're gonna try running it again so we're gonna hold this again and we're gonna hold this down there again and turn it on see if we can't get and I think I got it go ahead and turn it up all right as I was holding it I could feel the pressure coming back up and then all of a sudden I felt it let loose and put the strainer in there to catch all this junk so I definitely loosened something up it looks like I got it all the way so it's just going to drain out now yeah so like I said I held it down with this to create the vacuum so there would be more pressure and I could feel pushing back up and then all of a sudden it just went sucked down and I could feel it sucked down and that's when I was pretty sure I got the clog undone so so if you're doing this and you know you gotta do it for a while to let that pressure build up the water and that's what's causing it but if you're doing it for a while and it's not working it's not working you may want to have someone go on the roof and get a rag and plug the top of your roof vent because that will even build more pressure and you'll probably be able to get that leak undone so just to be sure we're gonna go ahead and run the sink to make sure it's unclogged and these things are great you can get them at pretty much any hardware store for about fifteen to twenty dollars and they have different brands but they pretty much all do the same so yeah it looks like it's pretty much undone altogether it is great all right looks like this drain King was a success if you guys liked this video give me a thumbs up comment like subscribe I'd really appreciate it thanks for watching Johnny DIY guys keep on doing it yourself take care just think", "uVuAl5BXrSQ": "hi guys Shirley here welcome back to my channel so in today's video I'm gonna share with you quite a few different storage ideas for underneath your kitchen sink but before we get started if you haven't subscribed I would love it if you would please consider subscribing and if you find this video helpful please don't forget to hit that like button okay so as you can see this is just a disaster I've just thrown everything in here this is what it looked like before I did anything and this is my after okay so the first thing I did was line the bottom of the cabinet with white shelf liner because I have a natural wood color cabinet I really wanted to brighten it up underneath here not to mention underneath the sink is usually a dark place anyway so white was a nice choice to kind of lighten everything up there was also a little bit of water damage from a previous leak that I wanted to cover up because it just didn't look the best now if I had white cabinets I probably would have done like some kind of fun really pretty pattern but because I didn't I just stuck with white I felt like it looked clean and having the shelf liner also helps for any spills or anything I can always wipe it and if there is a leak most likely I'll be able to clean that up without causing any more damage to the cabinets so then I started putting in my first organizing container which are these acrylic drawers they are all individual and they nest on top of each other you can move them around and they hold all of my essential items and they use all of that vertical space that I wasn't taking advantage of before so in this one I have my microfiber cleaning cloths and then in here I have all of my pretty dish towels that I don't want my kids to dry their grubby hands on and then in this one I have all of my sponges for dishes and then these are they're called bar mop towels I get them at Walmart you get like a whole pack of them for 6 bucks and I really really like them they really clean up the counters and things well and then down here I just have my dry erase markers no no they're not dry erase markers girl they are magic erasers and then over here I have my dishwashing tabs so now I've taken advantage of all that vertical space and all of these items has a home and you can clearly see what's inside some moving onto the left side of my cabinet I decided to put one of these little shelves I got this up Bed Bath and Beyond I think and I'll link everything that I can find that I've used today in today's video I'll link it in the description so you guys can check it out if you're interested yeah so underneath the shelf is where I have the filter that's for the hood for above my stove and then I just switched out the basket that I had it was like an ugly green one that I've had forever I got a white one $0.99 at Walmart and it holds all of my racks so in front of the Shelf I have my two cleanin caddies I have a clear cleaning caddy in front and then in the center I have a white one and inside the clear one I have all of my essentials all of my mrs. meyer's and if you guys are interested grow collaborative is giving away a bunch of these for free so I'll link that in the description that's how I got mine and then in the back I have my baking soda I like to use this if I have like nasty pots I can't get clean and then in this container I have my almond oil I use this to polish my stainless steel and then in this glass container I just have white distilled vinegar that's what I use to clean all my stainless steel and then next to that is my granite cleaner for my countertops in the white caddy I keep my less used items so I use a steam mop so I'm not always using this squirtin mop unless I really want to give my hardwood floors like a super good cleaning and then the rest are just usually for my DIY cleaning solutions that I like to make and so I have the witch hazel and some vegetable glycerin and then this was a freebie I got from Grove collaborative too and it's actually like some really good concentrate cleaner so the next door solution has got to be my absolute favorite and it's a wet bag they were made for cloth diapers but I'm using them to hold all of my dirty kitchen towels I hung them up with these comand spring clips they're called and now when my kitchen towels get nasty I can throw them in here I don't have to put them in my regular laundry which kind of grosses me out and when this is full I can take the towels and the bag wash everything in the washer and then just hang it back up when it's dry so another way that I'm taking advantage of vertical space is by hanging a paper towel holder on the door you don't like them on my kitchen counter I really don't like a lot on my counter so I usually keep them underneath the sink and this way I can still keep it there but take advantage of the vertical space you guys I'm so in love with the way that this turned out and it's so much more functional than the way it was before so I wanted to ask you guys what are your favorite ways to organize under the kitchen sink do you have any tips or tricks that you could share with us it would be awesome if you could leave them in the comments below and if you haven't subscribed I would love it if you would please consider subscribing thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "2ntELub95Jo": "hi I'm Jill the co-author of the cookbook dining on a dime and today I'm going to show you how to clean a porcelain sink usually I use when in my dishwater of a couple of caps of bleach and I just take it and I swish it around right before I start washing my dishes like this and I just let it sit kind of on there while I do in my dishes it doesn't take long and my sink happens to be clean but if you have stains just let it sit the longer you let it set the better it bleaches out now sometimes people don't like to use bleach and different things and I used to use even more so common when you have darks marks from a pan you know how you put a pan in a white horse I'm thinking you get those marks in there so then those types you can use just on the mark or you can clean your sink with the comet and when I clean it with the comment I just scrub it all around put my pan out here and I just scrub it these that's where my force on this person's about 70 years old I think and I have Dinks in it and then once you get it all scrubbed really good I will walk away maybe let it set for 10 minutes you don't have to necessarily it depends on how dirty your sink is now for something like this I would just let it set for a minute or two then when it's ready you just take and it rinses there easily I just lost and if you don't get all fully rinsed off it really won't matter you'll just sit there and keep cleaning damn there you have it like I said this think is about 50 years old and it's really not for a white person was thinking too bad shape tarah asked me she said okay show them how to get a mark from a pan out of your whoreson sink I don't ever have marks in my sink so I I said well I'll try and I was trying to make a mark and I finally got a little mark made but when you when you set a pan in the sink or when you are scrubbing a pan let a rag down the dish rag or another dish rag down and put the pan on top of that that prevents the the marks from getting in there in the first place and so then you don't have to worry about scrubbing scrubbing prevention is way better than trying to fix fix the mistake or fix the mess and I also have this rubber dish pan that I wash my pants in and so I sent them on the rubber and it automatically makes it fine you some people use a rubber mat in their sink too and you can use that to set your pants up now I've got a little bit of a mark here just a small mark I finally made and I'm just gonna take a little bit of Comet powder you could probably use any kind I use comet and as you can see I just even use my finger and the marks gone it just totally just I always use comment because to comment you can use Bon Ami and things like that maybe but the comet is good for porcelain sinks it bleaches it we're bonne ann\u00e9e and the other powder cleansers don't always have the bleach in them so that's why I like using the comet because it's it's just about as gentle as a bond and bonhomie and those other types of powder detergents so that's as simple as it is you just can sprinkle some bleach or comet in the sink and take your rag and scrub and those marks are gone if comet doesn't get it off you've got a really bad spot you can use what dry sandpaper just go to your hardware store and they will show you what to use and then voila it's gone especially if you have a lot of them you can do it that way too thank you for watching us and please join us on living on a dime calm you", "fnNz2e5IsRQ": "welcome to kraus where we create innovation for real life although a

up installing the sink this happened to be one that was a good balance between size and not so snug that you can't install it price is about 250 dollars depending on where you buy it i got mine on amazon and i always do mine with the reveal that comes in the template i just think it's a nicer look than a flush also it's a thicker gauge so a little bit more resistant to denting versus some of the other ones on the market and my personal policy as far as things go is if you're gonna have a dishwasher a big single bowl is best but if you have no dishwasher then a double bowl is best so you have a drying side and what i mean by this being a good size as you can see there's not a whole lot of room in the back but the front there's enough room for the tray which i like to do and also since i have a eight foot window in front of my sink here there wasn't a whole lot of room for venting so mine is vented in the underside so there's enough room for all the necessary plumbing and still in the film to be able to get in there and put in the brackets you see what i mean and also this comes with a drain catch on the underside but i actually didn't use it because we went with a garbage disposal and like you can see there's not a whole lot of room on that shelf but it does fit there's my brackets again for concrete counters i have a bracket that i like to use that i cast the counters and put the bracket inside of the concrete so when it gets hard you're ready to go anyway i've installed a lot of different things when i need my counters this was the one that just so happens to be my favorite and it's not crazy expensive but it also isn't dirt cheap at 250 i think it was a good value and like i said it comes with the drain apparatus hardware and the the rack on the inside and that's it let me know what you think talk to you next time", "gzbY7V5n7L0": "what's having a band in Asia Peter Brown Panda here I've got a copper sink and you can see it's getting discolored but I want to see if I can fix that basically a copper gets a nice patina with time age and actually it's kind of artificially accelerated I think at the factory and as I put in some chemicals here what I got is some of that patina worn away and the copper that pink rose gold is shining through and one of the things that happens here is I thought well maybe I should just clean the copper and remove all the patina and get it really nice and shiny but then I realized you know what that patina actually is supposed to be there it helps to protect the copper so I picked this up it's Barry's restore it all products copper patina rescue and it comes in this little kit here and basically what it has is a little patina Oh chemical praying like an acid and then a wax and the only thing you're gonna need is like a cup to apply it and I think everything else will come in here but you're gonna need like a hairdryer or a heat gun so I'm gonna try it here and let's see what kind of results we get now that I've cleaned up the sink unboxing it looks like we should open up pretty easily here it is a rag this is going to arrest the patina process we got a little sponge here and a little piece of steel wool to kind of scuff up some of those areas and so I think this is going to be what we apply the patina acid with we also get a couple of plastic gloves so I'm gonna definitely use those and then oh look at this the wax looks like it has kind of leaked a little bit here so that kind of stinks but luckily the patina chemical looks like it's fully intact so let's get started even though I've cleaned this up I'm just gonna use the steel wool here to kind of detail up give a little key to some of this area looks like I have a little corrosion I'm not gonna press hard just want to get to the surface stuff off especially where it's kind of a green copper and then I'm just gonna wipe it down here now I went ahead and port the patina solution into a little cup here now all the most of it cuz I have a lot of area because I'm gonna let this sucker go kind of looks like pert plus to me or head and shoulders so we're gonna use it with the sponge gonna get clogged up and tried out alright now as I mentioned one of the things that you're gonna need here is heat and because I don't have a heat gun I'm just gonna use a regular hairdryer here so I'm gonna turn it on and the first thing we're gonna do is heat up the metal itself okay so now I can feel it's kind of warm and then because the metal is warm now I'm going to use the sponge and I'm going to apply the patina here and then what we do is I'm just gonna dab it on for now and then we're gonna hit it with a little more heat to kind of cure it on there and get it to react I'm actually not sure what this is but if you good for you if you've got to wear gloves so just get this on especially all these bare areas it's got a little bit of a smell a little bit of a unpleasant odor but they're okay now kind of got it dabbed on I think in most places here what I'm gonna do is just hit it again with some heat did we get it well you can see it turning brown as it heats up okay you can see it's starting to turn brown and particularly compared to the other side which I haven't done yet it's already looking quite a bit better this part right here where it was built up quite a bit his darkest but I'm just going to give it another hit here another layer and heat it up again see if we can't darken it up a little more all right now that I've got that dry I'm gonna take the cloth here I'm just gonna go ahead and wet it a little bit and we're gonna use this moist cloth to arrest everything and remove the remainder of the chemical that is sitting on the top of the surface here and I tell you what it has definitely darkened it up but where I put it on really thick it is definitely thicker and so there's a couple things that I would probably recommend on this I think it's an improvement over what it was and as you can see here we don't have that shiny copper look that we do still do over on this side and so that is the compare and contrast on it but you can see how thick it is here so I think it doesn't seem to just wipe off what I think you might want to do is just take that steel wool again and just kind of give it a little brush kind of feather it in a little bit but that looks a lot better and far less obvious to me that I don't have that patina now on this side and I think it's gonna take a little while here to kind of dial it in which I'm gonna do and kind of darken up some of the spots that are still a little light and then apply what I can of this wax which will give it a little bit more of a matte finish as well as health protected in the future from any of those chemicals salt water vinegar though type of stuff so I'll keep doing this but I am pretty impressed because this is a pretty easy do-it-yourself project at home restore a copper sink I will put a link to this product in the description below Peter Mumby endeth out", "NX-MFx4L-6Q": "welcome back remote lights it is Dave with remodel media and we're here in Las Vegas Nevada for the kitchen and bath industry show cabe is 2020 I'm here with Brandi at the Revati booth and she's going to tell us what's been making a splash [Music] so so far these are some of our nursing these are going to be our porcelain bathroom sink they come in various colors they come in silver they come apart we have black on silver have a goal kind of like our checkered now only these are going to come with a drain and the drain is going to actually match the sink itself okay so the sinks come to drain the drains match the sinks the sinks are is this so talk to me about how this is made this is a porcelain with what a metal overlay yes it is overlay these are vessel sinks so they're made just to kind of sit on the counter okay and I see you've got a selection of two-tone faucets as well ah gotcha okay all right and now when the name Revati comes up the number one thing that people have been referred you know bringing up to me has been kitchen sinks but you guys have bathroom sinks as well so talk to me about your kitchen sink collections right now most properties think is going to be the work station see so these are gonna come without your cutting force you're building rags things like that but we also have your do you have one here we do have let's take it up all right so this is the workstation sink yes this is gonna be our 8320 - so this is our 33 inch purchased agency so it's gonna come with these flaps coming board it's also gonna come with a platform or with two mixing bowls so it has the mixing bowl that's complete then it also the strainer fixing wall here and then on the top it's gonna have a compartment where you can switch out for my cheese mm-hmm then it also comes with so then it comes with the shallow colander here so to take two cutting boards to calendars so cutting board a platform to colonies and a rollup rug like roll into different and this little serving ball here has cheese graters in it okay slice dice and Juliet so then this is negative 33 so we have many different sizes okay we have 30 smaller okay and then we'll go big okay so then this one is our smaller works workstation see it's going to be the 30 inch so but then when it goes under 33 inches it's not going to come with the platform is just gonna come with a small cutting board the colander the roll-up and abortion okay and then over here oh that is a big sink entertainers dream yeah the one thing about these things not only on the top tier but also going tourney here well that is that is a smart decision and so like if you're chopping up things and say you're making a salad or something like that you're talking go right into the mixing bowl do you have the same colleges on the side here uh-huh you also have your shallow colander and then again your your tools this particular seat is on the other side it's gonna go the butcher's block as well so the butcher pockets are you hiding this will go on any of our sinks of any workstation st. it's a one inch put your one so it's pretty thick this platform with serving trees so we have a rectangular thanks now I saw some fire clay are these fire clay sing to you okay like most porcelain sinks they're they're coated they're only coated in of course ours are Italian our clay through and through so that means I can you know if you get a chip you don't see that black I like you know like this one right now why is this one have the markings and is that part of the design this is the shabby chic blue oh good it's good to see that up close here it actually does have sort of an aged appearance okay and then I see we have the classic black these are new these are our nursing so then this one it's going to be the porcelain sleep and it's going to have like a black matte matte exterior nice okay I believe we also have it in silver oh nice nice all right now the faucets you said are not yours okay the Granite's yes now generally speaking when a customer comes to me asking for one of the most durable sinks they can get I usually steer them either towards a fire clay or a composite granite so talk talk to me about your composite granite see what may our granite sinks they're also made in Italy what sets us apart from the others is that the color is all the way through a through again if we broke this think in half it still be yellow all the way through so this is made with 80% cranek so it's very eco-friendly crushed granite and then it's like into this mold a lot of our granite sinks are a dual mountain so they could be dropped in or on-demand okay so we have many different colors these are new edition so we have these planets as well you know those are gonna be our apron front oh this is these are anodized stainless yes okay so they're a colored stainless that is either gold or copper or black board of course stainless steel and another granite sink I want to do oh whoa now wait a minute there's only one other brand that I'm aware of that is currently producing an apron front sink and up until now they have cornered the market on that in in the granite category and I am happy to see that there's some competition competition makes things interesting really new this is gonna come out in the next probably 30 days or so good this is the first of the apron front that we had I believe it's gonna come with a cutting board as well now where is the seamless steel manner this segment still is it is made in Italy Italy so all of these sinks are made in Italy that we've talked about today now that is fascinating to me because when I see your prices online super competitive super competitive and the first thing I think of and the first thing a lot of people think of I think when they see super competitive prices is maybe it's an import from the other side from from Asia or something like that okay but yet functional and modern so it's for people like it really if it's all alright well I am sufficiently impressed I actually came here one of my goals here this year for cabe is was to learn more about Revati where it was made and I'm I'm glad you were able to help me out Brandi thank you all right cool", "KWHI06KT5vI": "welcome to your everyday life where l.k innovation lives meet Mark LK product expert thanks mister LK announcer now marks a guru ah dude no need for a guru I'm gonna show them how easy it is to install an elk 8-quart Singh how about you show them what tools they'll need I'm on it [Music] okay mr. LK here's the deal first you want to make sure that your sink has arrived undamaged you know it's time to cut the hole in the countertop turn your sink over centering it in your sink base make sure that it's even on all sides next you want to scribe around the perimeter of the sink now we want to Reese cribe around the outside perimeter of the other sink [Music] remove the sink now we want to measure 5/16 of an inch inside the outside perimeter line [Music] next take a straightedge and identify your inside premier why now that you've drawn the 5/16 line inside the frame of the sink now it's time to start making the cut up you want to be careful here so let's put on our safety glasses and also we want to use our one and a half inch hole saw so that we don't have a square cut in the corners because we want to mimic the outside corner of the sink now it's time to cut your straight line along the inside line next step will be to punch the faucet holes onto our sink using the pre scored locations let me show you those you have to make sure that the countertop is stable so that when you strike the kitchen sink it supports it fully and the best way to do that is to put it back into the cutout you've got four selected spots on this kitchen sink and suggest that you do is pick the ones that are most convenient for the faucet and/or accessories that you're going to use for our purposes we've selected a single lever faucet that's going to use the center hole and then we're also going to have soap and lotion dispenser that we're gonna use on the right side make sure you place the nail punch on the center of the sticker next we're going to clean it out a little bit more [Music] now that you've punched out the hole round it out with a file that would be a good time to install the mounting clips take the pre use ition mounting clip grab your punch [Music] continuing the same procedure around all the perimeter to the sink to save yourself a lot of time later on now would be a good time to install your drains and faucet [Music] put it be a silicone caulk around the perimeter of the sink now we're ready to put the sink back into the countertop you may need an extra set of hands for this part [Music] you [Music] and don't forget to tighten the mounting brackets on the bottom of your sink once that's done your LK court sink is installed we hope you enjoy the

candle wax on the floor on the cabinet and everything from a candle warmer so I just wanted to put a video out real quick of how to get it up actually the easiest way I found right now is a magic eraser so using a magic eraser to get this stuff up works wonders you can see it sprayed all over the floor but you can see this is coming right up a lot better than scraping it off the floor see the splatter over here coming right up so if you spill candle wax on the floor and don't know how to get it up other than just scraping it just go to a magic eraser I see it on the cupboard comes right off some right here comes right off so if you have candle wax dried and can't peel it off you take it right off of the magic eraser", "bw2W__tcie8": "so in this video I'm going to talk mostly about building the support for the sink and it's a little bit of a fluid process just sort of a nice way of saying I didn't really know what I was getting into it I wasn't quite sure how to support this specific sink because it's an undermount apron sink so you don't you don't just sent set it on the countertop so it needs support from below so I actually I actually got out the instructions on this one it has you make two side supports for the sink that the sides of the sink sit on I started in to make those supports so I cut the pieces I needed and join it and playing them it didn't seem like I wanted to just use two by fours as you'd see the inside of the cabinet when you when you look under the sink I had an extra piece of maple that I used in making the pieces for the supports I made everything a little bit longer than I was going to need when I started to attach the legs to the horizontal piece I started to have to get specific to the size of the cabinet I marked where I thought the legs should go I wondered about how to make the joint between the leg and the beam piece and it seemed like the quickest and easiest way to do it would just be to use the pan rod or to make a mortise and tenon so that's what I went ahead with once you get it set up it goes fairly quickly I think it's funny that I'm doing this in the shadow of my old beautiful mortiser that really should be doing this job but with this I can do both the the mortise and the tenon so now I'll cut the Tenon's for the Tenon's the the guide just tracks around the outside of the mortise and tenon jig as far as the direction to move the bit around the tenon it felt better to go counterclockwise as far as the bit not wanting to climb on the on the material then it was time to glue the pieces together once I had everything cut with this kind of joint the strength of the glue is really in the side grain so you don't you don't really need the ends and the end grain glued although it doesn't hurt to have glue there and I can use the clamp to push the joint together I basically got glue everywhere and it goes together and just wipe off the excess glue and clamp and I can get the glue off the bottom and I can let those sit overnight and dry and the next day they're ready to start fitting into the cabinet so I made these a little bit big figuring I would cut them to fit once I had the basic shape made the one dimension on these it's super critical is to get the support for the sink to be just below the support for the counter so that the rim of the sink is is either flush or just a little bit below the bottom of the counter so there's some room for some caulk to go around the sink rim so they're a little bit tall to get that relationship perfect I had to put the counter top support or the the rim piece on top of the cabinets and then from there I could see how the supports were going to fit on the sink now on the right side or the support that was going to be on the right side when you're facing the sink I decided I really didn't need the legs because I have a 3/4 inch sheet of plywood there for support and the lair I had the legs we're going to kind of be in the way for the hinges on the doors or for the door on the right side and we would have to drill through that back leg for all of the water supply for the dishwasher so I ended up just cutting those lids off and the length of the support had to be shortened a little bit here to fit in the cabinet so I'm cutting off the back of the support and then the back lip of the cabinet has a little piece of wood at the rim so I needed to cut out a little notch in the support for that then I attached it first with two screws to see if my height was around this is the one relationship that has to be perfect and it seemed to be good it's easy to check with a straightedge and now once I had that side in the right spot I could use that to make the other side and get the legs for the other side to be exactly the right length so I could cut off the legs to exactly the right length and I cut off the back of the support as well and did the little notch in the back of the of the top of the support then things got even a little more time-consuming alright so I have a problem which is completely of my own making I should have I should have built a 36 inch wide cabinet for the sink because the sink go is in a 36 inch wide cabinet but I made the sink cabinet a little bit wider hoping to use up some of the corner and not make the drawers that are on the other side quite so deep and that would give me room to adjust the sink to Center it under the window well it turns out to be centered under the window it wants to be up against that side so I could have just made it the 36 inches wide and not had any adjustment so now I'm stuck with this a little slot over here and the support for the sink has to be away from the edge of the cabinet so I have to deal with what to do with this slot which I really didn't think was going to be an issue or much of a problem but what I'm realizing is how the hinge is attached for the doors on this side I want to be similar to that side so that the the doors fall under the sink centered and look look worked out so I'm going to have to build a little corner of cabinet here basically to attach the hinges to to kind of separate the sink support from the cabinet that sort of makes sense and then I think I can still do the shelves I want to do under the support so it's a whole bunch of work for this tiny little bit of hard to get to storage but this is a learning process this is what happens when you've got so many different things going on at once that you're trying to solve all at the same time I started putting the corner piece together it was at about this time when I had the the support on both sides in and the corner started that I realized the sink wasn't quite sitting flat on the top of the supports but what I decided to do before I tore the cabinet apart or tried to start cutting off little bits of the cabinet or doing something to get it to sit flat I should bring the cabinet up and actually set it in the kitchen where it was going to be and see if the sinks that flat there and when I did that the sink was perfect so it's it was the shop floor that was off a little bit so it meant that the cabinet was just fine that was a big relief so I meant that the rest of the project was up in the kitchen so I put the corner together in the kitchen and then attached the whole assembly to the cabinet and once I had the sink in they came with the countertop to put that in the plan is to do a video that has a lot more of the countertop work so this is just the work around the sink so they set the sink exactly where it needed to be and then they glued the back of it in with little pieces of wood with epoxy on them the sink came with little clips that screw into the underside of the countertop but you can't really screw into this quartz material so they just used epoxy and then a little bit of caulk around that edge and that's all that's holding the sink in but it seems to be sturdy then the plumber could come and actually hook up the faucet and the dishwasher and the sink and the drain for the sink he had to move the drain in the wall down a little bit which would have been nice to have known before I plastered around everything yeah but it works and the sink seems to be working just fine we have water in the kitchen so you can see the little wood bridges or wood connectors I guess you'd call them between the sink and the countertop and then in the end the plumber ended up drilling through the maple support anyway so really I could have just had the leg coming down in the back but but it's fine either way it's a bit of a mess down here but it's but it's fairly well organized thanks for watching", "bGKAYRMv9yw": "today i'm going to show you how to install sink on a countertop [Music] today i'm going to show you how to cut a laminate countertop and install the sink properly before we do that though we're going to need several measurements and best to measure four times and cut once so we'll go ahead and keep going and get it done so the first thing you need to do is know the size of your sink a standard sink for majority of homes is going to be 22 inches deep by 33 inches wide if you have a manufactured home it could be roughly 19 inches deep by 33 inches wide and you can also have oversized apron sinks but today we're working with a 22 by 33 standard sink so the first thing we're going to do is i'm going to find center line on the cabinet because i want everything to set center on his so we'll mark that we'll mark how deep the from the front of the uh the counter top behind to where the back of the base is i don't want to end up cutting this and b end up being out here with the lip so i want to do this measurement make sure i want to be within the counter top when i'm cutting and is the same on the back so i'll go ahead and do those measurements get it drawn out and we'll show you what we got so what i'm talking about is you want to when we cut that top i want to make sure i'm cutting back here i don't want to be cutting here and end up trying to i won't be able to clamp my sink down to anything so i need to be make sure i'm in that cavity behind the base [Music] so now i've got my center marked out the sink is 33 inches wide so we'll divide that by two mark each edge of this remeasure make sure we're at the 33 mark and then we'll measure the 22 make sure that's all correct and we'll double check we'll make sure we're in that sink cabinet cavity and then once that's done then we'll take measurements on the sink because there's going to be clips on it we want to come in we don't want to cut on 33 22 we want to cut at least a half inch in depending on where the clips are [Applause] we're actually going to be reusing the sink it's a this is a nice kohler stainless steel sink so i've i've already got a clip on from when i pulled it out so what we're going to do is we're going to take our tape measure and measure into the clip and that's going to be roughly one actually it is one one half inch what we're going to do now is we're going to measure one half inch off the back one half inch off the front so this one will be end up being 21 and a half and then i'll draw a line there i'll measure here one half inch in and basically the whole the whole square will be one half inch smaller than it is drawn out on the countertop right now and i'll be cutting on that one half inch in and that'll allow the sink just to fit straight in and the clips to work in the end you're going to have two lines one is the actual footprint of the sink the exterior and the inside one will be the one we cut [Music] [Applause] okay so we got our lines all drawn out and what i do is i have this oscillating tool that i'm going to go ahead and score that inside line i'm going to cut through the formica or the top and that what that'll do is when i put my sawzall on this i won't be chipping up any of the uh laminate so i'll just be actually just sawing wood it'll be super super simple i just want to stay away from any type of chips because it's a brand new top and okay so we'll just go ahead and get started [Music] [Applause] so okay once you get it cut um what i did um i just went ahead and cut opposite corners uh all the way through so i got this corner over here and the opposite corner over here both of these are loose so i can push down on it both of these i didn't cut all the way so if by chance you're by yourself you can take a couple utility knives push up on this side and stick sticking the utility knife into the uh into the wood and then just go ahead and let that set right there come over to the other side do the same thing drive your utility knife in there okay so i'm going to go ahead and cut this far corner over here right now the only corner that's holding is this corner right here so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to cut that so now everything is loose the razor blades are holding it on these opposite corners and i'm just going to come in from below lift up on the formica and take the blades out and the sinkhole is cut one thing i do want to stress is that if you're going to be cutting with the sawzall or any type of reciprocating saw you do need to use more like a bi-metal blade with a fine teeth on it you don't want to go using a wood blade the wood blade will actually chip the formica i learned a few of these from hard knocks so yeah just a fine blade and you should be good to go so the sink is set um everything fit perfect uh as you can see it wasn't a big deal you just have to re-measure and re-measure and re-measure and uh before you cut so i hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions let us know in the comments i'll be happy to help you out on that i've put a number of things in to being a plumber so yeah if you would like it thumbs up subscribe to our channel we have a lot of how to's and a lot of other videos you might enjoy so thanks a lot watching diy on the house", "vfqJJ75dBT8": "[Music] congratulations on your new multi-purpose unabomb sink our supervisor here will show you the installation of a flush mount sink a flush mount sink installation is when the sink is at the same level of the slab in which it is fitted to avoid any kind of slipping or getting hurt from rough or hard edges we recommend using protective gloves whether cloth or rubber place the sink on the slab on which it has to be fitted turn it upside down to mark the area to be cut on the slab on the side of the slab from where we will be using the sink take a marking in contrast color at about two to four inches as per your preference this will be the gap between you and the sink make these markings at least at three positions [Music] draw a straight line connecting these marks align the sync edge with this line [Music] now mark the outer periphery on the three remaining sides [Music] please take care that the sink doesn't shift from its position or the markings will go wrong remove the sink you can very well see the outer marked boundary inside of this outer boundary mark a distance of 10 mm on all four sides [Music] connect each side points with a straight line and you will get another rectangle inside the earlier one [Music] cut out complete inside boundary to the full depth of the slab on all the four side this is the cavity for inserting your sink now on the outer boundary mark make a cut which is 10 mm wide and 6 mm deep [Music] this is how the l-shaped cut will look like once the cavity and the shoulder of the slab are ready we will take the sink and fit the faucets hand shower and soap dispenser along with couplings and ensure that the sink rests properly on the 6 mm deep cut shoulder of the slab place the supplied masking tape on the sink on all four sides exactly from the outermost edge fill silicon between the sink in the slab and dab it gently for it to fill any vacant space clear any extra silicon the masking tape will protect the upper edges of the sink from the drying silicon when silicon is dry remove the masking tape [Music] and then the green colored protective covering [Music] your sink is now ready to use we highly recommend installing of the drain pipes before we lower the sink in the cavity please see the respective video for your supplied drain pipe available on our website and pump sinks com thank you", "BvZD1ZTMXCQ": "today we're getting our organize on hey guys do it on a dime here so I don't know if this was half laziness or half just meat-eating content for my channel but either way we moved into our house I just put things under the bathroom sinks because I thought this is the perfect opportunity to show you my complete process when organizing cleaning streamlining everything getting rid of stuff do you feel me on this during the springtime so I hope you find this video motivating and doing it on a teeny this is teeny tiny budget first up is to get my supplies I have a laundry basket for donations a trash bag for trash my cleaning rags and tools which is my 50/50 water vinegar solution as well as my Oil Soap next I entered purge mode so many of these items made it over to the new house that really shouldn't have to be honest because we moved so quickly it was in a matter of weeks so going through looking at each one am I really going to use the product that burns the hair off my legs like why do I just have that to begin with I also found a bunch of two blade razors those were invented clearly by someone who's never shaved before and going through and reevaluating each thing and only keeping the stuff I am 100 percent sure I am using and even taking the time to evaluate systems that used to work that are no longer functioning by taking everything out you can get rid of products you don't need but also change up the systems to find things that really are going to work fast motion cleaning guys I've got my Dollar Tree microfiber rag and my 50/50 water vinegar solution next I'm going to test out my dollar store basket everything here came from the Dollar Tree and I want to see how it's going to fit inside of the space I get a lot of questions on how I do this and I have to play around with it a lot to really find a system that works whatever system you go with choose something that makes it super easy to reach whatever you need the simpler the better this next up is probably one of my favorites of the whole process decanting everything and putting things into their new space now you've seen me mention this in videos but I wanted to show you it in action I've got my poster task which I got from the Dollar Tree and this is what I'm getting used to hold my bins in place put one piece of tack on all four corners right on the little knob ease of each of the bins set it in your drawer and nothing is going to shift around you will be so glad you took the time to do this extra stuff and if you haven't done this before use cutlery trays from the dollar store they're a great way to store toothbrushes inside of a drawer so here is the messy before and the oh so satisfying after here's some great tips you might want to try to store your hairdryer use paper file from the dollar store this has been working awesome you can see I've got the shoe boxes stacked up in the back of things that I asked this West frequently I've got all of my feminine care products that are really easy to access and one of my favorite dollar store products are these drawers when you see them get them it's a great way to organize those small items and face creams have them really easy to access but not take up a lot of space and you can see I repurpose this mesh drawer with all of my shampoos and body washes these are things I will absolutely be using and they're not just taking up space here's underneath of Charlie's sink and here's the after I love the square bins to maximize the space for body wash cleaning tools travel supplies to finish out everything I just have to have it really clean I use the 50/50 water vinegar mix to thoroughly wipe down everything including the cabinet fronts now here is where my Murphy's oil comes back into play mix up a little Bowl with about two tablespoons of the oil and the rest water and use it to wipe down your cabinets this you guys is going to give them a show room shine I don't know if it's picking up on camera but it cleans them so well and makes them so beautiful these cabinets are over ten years old but you would never know after they've been cleaned getting organized is so is stinking satisfying I hope you guys enjoyed this video and thank you so much for your patience as I'm starting to get back in my routine getting videos on this channel and sharing the joy that I have of organizing with you

into it many things [Music] so guys today is the day to finish off decluttering and getting my life together i have to tackle this thing i know we're such procrastinators and we don't like to dive head in and get things done but today and this year i am cleaning out my life all the things that does not belong should not be junky we're just going to clean it out so i'm just going to start just taking it out um head dive right in and just take everything out i'm not going to organize it while i'm taking it out i'm just taking everything out so i can have a clean slate and i can think of what

first so if you didn't get a chance to see yesterday's video definitely go check that out but this contact paper is from yesterday when i cleaned out my pantry and covered the shelves with contact paper i had a lot of excess contact paper left so i figured i would use it to just kind of give the um under the sink a little bit of a facelift as well and make it kind of cute so i'm just going to use the excess and put it under here as you can see i'm having a little bit of trouble getting it um off of the paper but it's fine we'll get [Music] it in my way now don't be shy i won't be [Music] here [Music] you could be the one [Music] the things i love the things [Music] love love the things i love [Music] [Applause] [Music] baby the struggle was real so now that we're done struggling with that contact paper i'm gonna head for a lazy susan that i've had laying around the house for a while so i didn't have to spend any money but i'm just gonna organize all of my cleaning kitchen cleaning supplies onto this lazy susan so when i'm getting ready to clean or i need something i can just spin it around and grab whatever i need and go [Music] yesterday [Music] and as the light startled our eyes we so next i am going to be pulling a couple of bins that i got from dollar tree out of the bag i only spent a dollar on each and i'm just going to be putting my microfiber cloths up and my sponges up and then i'm going to label the um containers as well [Music] agents of the other i don't know if you can see it but i'm just showing you the 18 piece um labels that i got from dollar tree

so let's head over and see our beautiful finish so guys we have the contact paper and we have the big lazy susan over there with all of the cleaning products so i usually use like method and like the floor cleaners and the stainless steel cleaner is over there in the degreasers and then in the back over here we have the floor cleaner so like the bleach the wood floor cleaner um the draino empty little containers to the spray bottles back there and then we have our sponges and our microfiber cloths and that is everything guys doesn't it look so much better than it did before so if you like

welcome welcome if you're new here or you're coming from Ryan's channel my name is mie I'm a wife working mama for I post organizing cleaning decor and mom life videos you can expect new content every

scenes action today I have a collab with this boss mom her name is Ryan she's a wife a mother entrepreneur she posts all types of organizing cleaning and lifestyle content while juggling four amazing kids so head over to Ryan channel I let her know oh so Maya sent you so today I am decluttering and organizing under my kitchen sink and the first thing that I love to do is scroll through Pinterest I go on Pinterest just to get different aesthetics different looks different ideas inspiration that helps me out with under my sink you can google it or go on Pinterest it's up to you the second thing that I love to do is I love to take measurements I need to know exactly how many containers I need to get and I need to make sure that it can fit so right now I am taking measurements and usually it's up to you but if you want to do vertically if you want to build the containers vertically or horizontally it's up to you me I prefer vertical that way I can maximize the most of my space the third thing that I love to do is write it down I like to take the measurements and write down the exact measurements that I have taken and also I love to write down how many containers I need so that way when I go into this store I know exactly what I'm getting nobody has time to be an old store spending unnecessary money because you're not that's that's what happens when you don't know what you want so I'm about to head to the Container Store grab what I need this will be back organized underneath the cabinet well underneath the sink and then we get to go honey [Applause] [Music] Hey [Music] get [Music] let me [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] we want to show you how I organize everything and now I am ready to put everything in these containers that I did purchase from the Container Store and put everything away underneath my sink I have a house full of children I have two teenagers I have two little children so I felt that I want to make everything simple and this is the system that I'm going to use so from The Container Store I did purchase this and this will be for my cleaning products this as well will be for the cleaning products this will be for not short yet I have to kind of play around with it but probably my SOS pads my dishwasher pods and my cleaning rags some sponges that's what these two probably will be for but don't quote me on it yet this is for batteries for when I'm you know I did purchase some other things since I was in there for when I am doing the dresser dresser the drawers and cabinets and also I bought this over the sink rolled up drying rack and I purchase this drawing wreck with Amit I kind of like everything to be put away so easy cleanup and then I also okay so I also purchased this as well this will be for the children cookie cutters so all year round Christmas times Christmas Valentine's Day you're like every whatever every holiday is right there for that so I put all their cookie cutters Halloween because we do do cookies this is gonna be like our tape pins and again this is for my drawers when I do the drawers over so in today's video I will just be using this bin there's been this band and there's been great today's video now when now my biggest thing is you want to maximize the most space as possible so for instance this is a pretty nice size think under the sink is really spacious is really big so I feel that I won't have too much of an issue with it so that will go there [Music] so far right and then I'm gonna put the other one on top so it's gonna probably be something like this and I do have or I don't know I want to play around with it [Music] [Music] this is a real-life moment my daughter literally see me recording for you my youtube channel and she just comes looking for her Gator eat all in the frigerator do this happen to anyone else when you're recording for your YouTube channel and your kids just they just get in the video talking in the

what under my sink look like I hope you enjoyed this video please like share subscribe and most importantly comment in the comment section and let me know how do you organize under your sink [Music]", "JFXh_DnCG-M": "I work for Rooter here plumbing and in today's test we're gonna go over installing a basket strainer like so the only tools you need to install a basket strainer like this one here is a Philips screwdriver and plumber's putty this basket strainer here before you install it you want to remove all these pieces that it comes with first one is this brass nut here and it comes with this washer this washer is really important when installing your flange piece so make sure you don't lose this washer remove this piece here it has slots around here so all you got to do is turn it and it's gonna come right out and you remove this piece here and then you remove your gasket and once you have this piece just like that I'm gonna get plumber's putty and put it all around this section here once you got it all around your strainer push down on it get a nice nice on there and then once you got that on there you're gonna put it on your sink go ahead and set it down here push down on it it's normal this all this this extra plumber's putty is gonna come out you're gonna remove that after you get it nice and tight so you can push down on it as much as you can once you do that at the bottom the order that everything's gonna go back in is it's just like this you're gonna start off with your gasket and then this piece will go in there make sure that the the flat part is going in like this and not backwards so you got your gasket this piece and then you got this piece here and all you got to do is use these screws to tighten it up nice and tight for you it's really simple all right now for working on the bottom the strainer again like I explained before your first step it's going to be putting your gasket so you grab your gasket slide that on there and then it's this piece here again make sure the flat side goes up and not backwards and after that grab this piece here it's gonna have some slots so you might have to turn it guide it and then once you put it in slide it to the side that's going to lock and it won't allow it to come back out once it's locked by hand screw these screws on there as much as you can I like to do it little by little when I want to tiny one and then go to the next one cuz it's gonna be uneven so you want to do a little here a little on this one a little bit on this one and that's gonna balance the way you tighten this the strainer once it's hand tight grab your Phillips screwdriver a couple here a couple here and rotate it until it sits tight so this is what the top of the strain is going to look like after you already tie in the bottom simply just grab it and slowly just take it off now you can grab your finger just like that to split it off completely out clean it up and grab a towel once that's nice and clean that that should prevent any leaks from coming down and that's how you install a basket strainer [Music]", "6KSQuBRoyrg": "alright I think there's a pause snake it common I give this company get there down in

hopefully this will work so I'm going to put this into a category of both that product review and also into my general home repair playlist now what I did is I went to the store and I picked up it's called a mini plunger and this one's by Moen I picked it up at Home Depot and people think that unplugging a sink is you know you just get a plunger you can use whatever plunger you have will probably work but I think this is gonna work really good has a good seal on it which is important the other important thing is if you have a double sink especially you have to be sure that you have your drain plug even though all the water is sitting in here take your drain plug you have to make sure you put that down in there and make sure that at least one of the tubs are sealed because when you're pushing water through if it's not sealed it's not going to push through the drainage system so anyways make sure the drain plugs in on one one side and then what you need to do just go over here and I have some stuff in here still but anyways go over here and we're gonna put that plunger on there just dirt giving it some some plunges at a very important season start bubbling over there arrow is getting out so make sure you you hold your hand down in there push the drain plug down just dirt just keep pumping it back and forth like this there okay I think it's going down yeah release this one over here drain and let go is saying see how that air was coming up on that one at the first stage when I started pushing the air through there in the water often that's why I bought two though because you can actually well ideally use the second one to provide a good seal on the other drain and just hold that one down and then use the other side here and push the water and air through there like that but anyways that's all there is to it I mean that's gonna solve most of your drain problems if it's any worse than that now there's a few other steps but that's all for another video but this should get you going if this works out great if not we'll have to move to a next step [Music] you [Music]", "FsY30EIpukc": "thanks for joining us everybody this sessions blog is about sinks everything you need to know to pick the right thing for you let's start with first option first option is a stainless steel by far this accounts for 90% of all the sinks installed in our jobs they go with almost any single color they definitely go with all your appliances even if you don't use stainless steel appliances they go with any faucet and the least expensive on average is stainless steel on the mountain sink goes from $175 to $400 99% of all the stainless steel sinks that we install our other mounts so the over mount stainless steel is almost not even employed the next available sing for you guys which is a cool product that's been out for you know four or five six seven years as far as being popular our granite sinks granite composite sinks so this is a composite material made partly in granite which is supposed to be more scratch resistant and stain resistant and stainless steel so the benefits are this thing is heavy it's solid and it comes in colors the pricing are more expensive almost double start at $350 they can easily go to seven eight hundred dollars for some really custom really cool custom sinks again 95% of all the granite composite sinks will be installed our under mouth under the counter a couple people every now and then do over mountain the people that do over mount sinks mainly do it because they want to be able to pull it out if something happens really easy just disconnect the plumbing pull right out when to the undermount sink it's a little bit trickier to pull out if anything happens to it okay the only couple of drawbacks to grand composite sinks besides it's more expensive is that if you do get a scratch in it I have no idea how to fix it and this is a composite material made of factory it's not like stainless steel where if you get scratched in it you can take parky purrs you can take steel wool you can polish out that scratch really really easily so keep that in mind when you guys are choosing the pretty much the last option is just porcelain or often those cast iron those are by far the most expensive for the heaviest and sometimes need extra bracing and sometimes they're so big they don't even fit in your Asheville sink cabinet or too deep to fit your faucet holes so I've been very careful with the porcelain they start at five six hundred dollars they go up to fifteen hundred dollars scratch really easily once they scratch water collects and then you start seeing that mold line now you can get that repaired but the last time I checked it cost three hundred four hundred dollars to actually get something to come out and refinish yourself so I've personally had porcelain sinks and although I like the look of them in many cases the white is probably the classic look they also come in awful and black mine scratched in two weeks and the mole just kept on building and building a building to the point where I got frustrated so ultimately it's your decision and I just want to share the information with you guys so you can have to make the best decision possible and I'm always there to help you guys in the sales meetings to make the best decision for yours so thanks for joining us

pour add or sink stains and signs of daily use can easily be removed with a scouring sponge water and a little washing up liquid after cleaning just rinse with water and wipe dry often greasy residues remain in the sink after washing up greasy items a little washing up liquid on a sponge is all you need to remove even stubborn greasy stains from your silgranit sink again just rinse when you've finished and wipe dry to prevent limescale marks metal objects can leave visible marks on the hard surface of Scylla Anat these marks are easy to remove or the little washing up liquid ideally use the rough side of a scouring sponge incidentally the best way to avoid limescale marks is to wipe your silgranit sink dry with a microfiber cloth after every use for stubborn limescale marks or discoloration we recommend cleaning the sink thoroughly with a standard detergent or blanco active designed specifically for blanco silgranit pour adore sinks it provides the most effective results first close the sink and then sprinkle blanco active powder liberally around the bowl then fill the bowl with at least sixty degrees centigrade hot water from the tap or ideally from a kettle sprinkle a few cups of the solution over the drainer surface and anywhere else where there are limescale deposits leave blanco active to work for at least two hours and ideally overnight when you finish soaking the sink clean it with a scouring sponge and wipe it dry and you can be sure of the perfect cleaning results if a sink is used for several years without being cleaned and cared for regularly it can be left with marks on the surface that make it look as if it is discolored Blanco active dissolves this layer of dirt and restores the sink to its original color to retain the quality of your

many of you realize that sinks sometimes get plugged up and don't drain well and for bathroom sinks they quite often get plugged up where the pop-up stopper comes up hair and debris gets caught up around the pop-up stopper and it's very difficult to get this these off and I will show you how to clean these stoppers so the first step is just to take the top of the pop-up stopper if you untwist it counterclockwise they normally do just come off and you can just take it off it looks like that and there's normally a plastic sometimes metal little kind of a looks like an X across in there that comes up and down as you go in and out this one's actually a little bit stuck yeah and so this one does have some problems and sometimes you can take some needle nose pliers and get get some of the larger debris out that's typically not how it's done you actually have to do it from the under underside you have to disconnect this piece first so this is the underside of the sink you see the the drain line the PP line the on-and-off hot and cold water lines here and there but behind this pipe you also see where the pop-up bumper connects and then right here let me get a better angle okay so this is a little bit better angle now this bar here this all bent out of shape is where the little lever that you move up and down so the pop-up buffer goes in and out it controls this arm that goes into this pipe and this actually moves that internal pop-up stopper in and out up and down so this is kind of the control mechanism and this all bent out of shape because you could actually pinch this and move it out and actually readjust this to different heights so this is easily removed and it just does a little just a pinch thing that you can come in and out so that's the first thing we did we remove that disconnected with this arms so the second step which we do is we actually need to get this little pieces this screw piece off and quite often you can do by hand but this one is moving but sometimes you need some pliers to get this off but before we remove this I'm going to stick a pan underneath this sink because if it is plugged up might be some water here and it could leak out when we remove this piece so I'll go ahead and do that at first but I put the little bucket underneath the sink and I'm just going to reach behind here and try to unscrew this by hand I'm just me screwing it and then you can take this piece off and this whole piece comes off and this is the seal so if it leaks from that end that's probably one one problem but you want to keep all these together so I'm just going to put it down here and so that just removed there and that should disconnect the little the little pop-up this little bar that went inside here and was stopped by this ball this as it goes up and down controls that plastic piece and I'll show you how that worked so we're back from the top and you can still see the little X plastic piece and if I could reach down there maybe I can't but I might meet some needlenose pliers hope I got it now it just comes straight out and you can see how Rohde it is so let me clean this off first not in this thing because I have the pipe open so I'll clean this often in a different sink first okay so I cleaned off this little this little stopper and normally it stands like this with this little plate facing the back of the sink and so when we had this in the pipe it actually fit in like this and so when this moved of centered in this little ball it go up and down up and down and would lift and move this plastic piece up and down and it's as simple as that it's a pretty easy design but it does get clogged up and so we cleaned it off and now we're going to reinstall before we reinstall I'm just pulling out all the goop that was in that drain and all of this was being held by that pop-up pop-up stopper so you got to clean this out first and this actually even leaves in here so I'm not sure where that came from but we'll go ahead and finish cleaned out this drain and install the the stopper so I went ahead and put the top piece back on just so this won't slip down too far and again it goes with this little plate facing the disc bigot end so go ahead and place that down straight and just leave it like that and we'll go from Bonnie okay so from underneath but I've already inspected this washer it could be replaced but I think I'll just leave it as is for now and I just put this in just like this put the ball in then I put this little seal in there and then I slip Guillard do this with one hand place it this little screw piece on top just like that I just simply screw it back in then you could do it hand tight as best you can or use some pliers to get it tighter but it doesn't require much to be sealed and the tighter you have is the harder the plunger so as this tightens up this will barely move and want to move a little bit so we went ahead and did that and now I'm going to stick this will piece back in here kind of straighten it out and actually I have to put a little clip and first put this piece in and follow it up with the clip again and like that and kind of put it in a little straight now now it should be in okay and you can move it up and down to make sure that it has a full range of motion and that it will actually stop that once it's up that will stop the water but you could also adjust it with this little adjuster here that you just screw and and move this up and down the arm and so if you could adjust the stopper accordingly so let's go up and make sure it works okay so we're back up here and I did notice I didn't quite get it in the hole so we'll have to pull it back out and try to get that metal rod back in the hole so we'll go ahead and do that again there we go actually helps if you do the top and bottom at the same time so I got this full ring motion it's in there I go in out then high enough might be a little too high I'll have to readjust that but it does feel very nicely as the water here that drains so I'm happy with this it drains a lot better it's a little bit of a hit and miss with trying to get that rod in this plastic piece but it's not that difficult so I hope to see you next time", "Q54QMJbc6Q4": "hi I'm Vanessa and today I will be cleaning my kitchen sink let me open up the curtains here for more lighting oh maybe I don't want that extra lighting for now it is what it is and that's why we're cleaning it so to please my ceramic kitchen sink I will be using baking soda a scrub and one lemon the lemon I'm gonna cut into a couple of wedges and each wedge will be my another form of scrub that's to whiten the ceramic and this is to clean it so we'll start with this first so what we need to do is make sure water is splashed in every part we're gonna scrub every part that we'll be placing baking soda that way the baking soda sticks open push tab oops sprinkling it all throughout the sink about 1 layers worth of baking soda with some space in between even inside the drain around the walls once I've gotten all the walls every spot the sponge needs to be somewhat wet the baking soda will remove layers of mildew or any gunk that the sinker grows and then you can go ahead and start to scrub and you can add a little bit of water as needed so that the baking soda can dissolve and start to do its work I can see already the spots removing quickly remember to get around the drain as baking soda will also clean stainless steel get water whenever you feel the baking soda not dissolving and remember to look at cleaning not so much as a chore it can be very therapeutic so you can also ask someone else that you think would benefit from getting some form of therapy from cleaning the sink versus looking at as a chore you can listen to music you can chat on the phone listen to audiobooks chat in person catch up with someone that's visiting you or someone who lives with you so I've had enough scrubbing here and make sure you get all that baking soda off then grab your lemon cut it into several wedges and you can use the lemon wedges to scrub away the lemon will whiten the sink even more letting the juice come out and stay on the sink for about fifteen minutes I make sure to use all my lemon wedges and also scrubbing around the drain as lemon also helps clean stainless steel as I was saying you can look at this with positive perspective versus looking at as a dreadful chore it can help you clear your mind it can also make you appreciate your home more as it's nice to look at a better atmosphere better air quality as the bacteria is not floating into the oxygen into your kitchen so here's my little convenient trashcan and I put all my lemon wedges in there the seeds I set my timer for 15 minutes once the 15 minutes are up I'll come back and thoroughly wash away all that lemon and if for some reason you're not really satisfied you can scrub again as I said I've never done this before and since I was enjoying actually cleaning this sink I'll go ahead and reapply a little bit more of baking soda and scrub away as I was saying scrub away any bacteria that way you feel good you can breathe know that you have a better air quality another positive perspective way to look at it is your moving your body you're getting exercise so make sure you stretch out the fingers the wrists and right back make sure you're using both arms use the right arm use the left arm it's a form of exercise as well get your faucet clean all around and here we go a really nice clean bacteria-free better air quality making it so welcoming to walk into the kitchen even with dishes in the sink it is nice and shiny with natural ingredients such as lemon baking soda I hope you found this video enjoyable and helpful thank you for watching have a super great day", "8YWEPbO8500": "[Music] hey everyone this is a follow-up to my diy car camping kitchen setup video that i did recently so if you haven't seen that check that out and in that video i talked about how i use this usb battery-powered faucet and i just plug that into a three and a half gallon water brick and it works great uh super slick setup but couple things with this first of all it drips a bit so if the water brick is higher than the faucet and the brick is totally full it puts too much back pressure on the faucet and so it has a pretty decent little leak here you can see how quickly it drips now the other problem i ran into is well i broke it i just dropped it on the ground shortly after i recorded that video and bad things happened so the entire smoked dark part of this popped off and that's where the button is to turn it on and off and so i thought i'd be smart and silicone that back down but once i did well the buttons stopped working very well so i think i kind of broke it so since there was so much interest in that last video i figured hey let's just go ahead and buy some stuff so i went on amazon and i picked out three very different styles of these usb battery-powered faucets and so we can take a look at them today and test them out so the first one actually when i bought it online i thought was going to be really large and it turned out to be this tiny little thing uh but fortunately i was able to get this with a six dollar coupon so this whole thing only cost me ten dollars uh shipped so it's kind of crazy and so you can see what it looks like it is very very small so compared to the one in my original video this thing is about half the height and the thing i like about it though it's got this really big clicky button on top so and it also feels really light so i could drop it and maybe feel like it's not going to fall apart like the first one um this comes with this really short piece of silicon tubing and you can see it alright has kinks and our second competitor here is this guy uh this is kind of the old school style so when i was researching these maybe a year or two ago they all kind of look like this so i figured let's pick one of those up uh the packaging has no english on it uh and this is the amazon listing it was 16 and this one has a different kind of design from all the others wherein it is basically a cylinder and in that cylinder is the the pump and the battery and then there's this little metal piece that sticks into the side and that's the spigot and so you know it came pretty well wrapped the construction is this kind of shinier plastic and at the top there is a clicky button it's not nearly as clicky as our first short one but it does work and also in the box you get some kinked cheap tubing which you should not use so that is our second faucet and then our third and final faucet actually costs one dollar less so this one comes in at fifteen dollars and uh comes pretty well packaged it's in a much bigger box than the other two and you know it's wrapped up decently and overall this is made of higher quality plastics than the second one there's a slightly better fit and finish on this item here you know i don't love the design but it's at least fairly well executed and the really funky thing with this one is the user interface because it has four buttons so there is a power button at the top that works like the toggle button on all the others so you can press it once to turn it on press it again to turn it off but it also has these three preset buttons so it'll dispense a certain amount of liquid automatically and shut itself off and this also comes with some really low quality silicon tubing that also came kinked out of the box so that stuff is just garbage so if you are going to use one of these faucets i strongly recommend that you go to amazon you can pick up a spool of high quality silicon tubing so on the left is an example of the tube that comes with any of these products and the one on the right is the one i bought on amazon this stuff will not kink and it's if you want to order it at six millimeter inner diameter and this one is 10 millimeter external diameter and again they all charge with micro usb so let's line all these things up and see how they look side by side because it's really hard to figure out how big these things are until you see them sitting in the same surface so this is the original faucet that i used in my first video and then the one immediately to its right is the four button jobby and you can see it's pretty much the same size so if you're looking for a one-to-one replacement i think this is probably the way to go and next we have our dentist special so this is the one that has the little metal tube coming out of the side that reminds me every time i'm getting my teeth cleaned so you can see what this guy looks like it's definitely shorter than the first two here and so it's kind of an in-between size uh it's not quite tall enough maybe to fit over a glass and the last one is this little tiny guy it is absolutely adorable and my kids think it looks like a roll of toilet paper so i think that all makes it kind of cute and with this one you know it's uses this textured plastic um it feels really really light i wouldn't say this is exactly a premium product but in a weird way it kind of feels burly and i kind of see this as being a nice little hard to break kind of faucet and if we put them all sort of near each other you can see just how small the short toilet paper one is it'll fit underneath the faucets for the original one or the four button faucet so the micro usb charging port is at the very top it's kind of hidden on the right hand one at the top but there it is and you know they're very similar in height like i said but you know aesthetics wise i really like the one on the left i'm kind of bummed that it's so fragile uh it has a capacitive button on it essentially and that's just not built for life on the road so if we compare the four button model to the dentist uh special you can see it's uh the dentist is shorter by at least an inch and a half and uh just overall fit and finish is pretty bad on it it just looks super cheap and uh just kind of a strange size frankly and the location of the metal tube is the real problem uh it's so low into the base that you know this thing isn't really going to get over a glass of any height at all so you know not my favorite okay and so the final one is our little uh micro toilet paper looking one so the thing i like about this is that the button on the top is very clicky uh it feels more like a physical button than an electronic button so i think that's going to be more rugged so that part i really like uh you can see comparing to all these other ones it is very short but otherwise it has very similar layout it's got the micro usb on the back uh the same connector for the tubing at the bottom you know these are all kind of the same thing it wouldn't surprise me if the guts of these are very similar or even come from the same factory and one little design quirk is even though this is very short the spigot is actually at a higher point than the dentist office special so you know design matters and what i wanted to do is throw all of these on a kitchen scale to see how much each weighed the first one really doesn't count because that has a whole roll of gaffers tape and a bunch of magnets on it but i thought it would be useful to show you the weight differences between all these honestly they're all super lightweight uh and they almost need that weighted base so that they feel more substantial all right next up let's do some measuring so the original faucet was about six inches in the back it rises a little bit in the front and the four button is actually a little bit taller it's about a half an inch taller in the back and our dentist office special is quite a bit shorter that's a little over five inches and then our little guy is only four inches tall so it's really really short and for length the first three are actually all about six inches so this is the original this is the four button and even the dentist office special weighs in right around six inches and our little guy is only three and a half inches like i said this thing is adorable so next up let's do some benchmarking very exciting so i just wanted to see how long it would take for each of these faucets to fill this glass of water all the way to the very top so this is going to tell us how fast each one of the pumps are and i was curious if any of these were going to be much much faster or slower than the others so for our original pump that came in at 19 seconds and i also wanted to test the loudness of these pumps so using my watch i ended up with 58 db so it's pretty quiet these aren't super annoying and for the four button model this one went a little bit slower so this ended up filling the glass in 22 seconds so three seconds slower than the original however in the noise test it did a little bit better so i would call this around 56 db so it's about three decibels quieter which is actually fairly significant all right next up is the the dentist office special you can see i had to hold this up because it's far too short to fill a 16-ounce glass sitting on a table which is kind of silly and so this one actually works fairly well and we ended up with 20 seconds so it was basically the same time let's say one second slower than the original pump and if you look at the flow in this it's super smooth so that's the one thing about it it is very smooth and that also translates into a quieter pump so you can see it's significantly quieter than the other ones and last but not least is our little guy that original noise you heard there is what happens if the hose is full of air so it's not normally that loud on startup and you can hear this thing going and uh this one was going a little slower and also you can see there's a little bit of turbulence going on here and so this ended up taking 24 seconds so this was the slowest one by two seconds and it was a full five seconds behind the original faucet so to sum up these all pump at roughly the same speed and at roughly the same loudness level i would say the dennis office special is probably the smoothest in terms of flow and then the next test i wanted to see is how much head these could produce and so i measured from the ground up to the gutter here and that's a full eight feet and i didn't think these things could even pump that high so but i was pleasantly surprised so this is the four button and that thing could go all the way up to the gutter full eight feet and the original pump could do that as well so that is very very good and you know this is really surprising for something that has a tiny battery and is essentially a usb powered pump these things can all pull at least eight feet of head so for any application that you'd have in a car camper these things will do the trick you can see again with the dentist office special the water is very smooth it's almost like a laminar flow so i don't know if it's something about the metal tube but if you really care about quiet and you care about smoothness and you don't care about how it looks it's kind of an interesting little pump this little guy believe it or not worked just as well as all the larger ones so i would say for this height test they all basically got a passing score they could all do eight feet no problem and for the final and probably most important test it's the drip test so can these things handle back pressure so uh like i said before when these were in the car and the water bricks were at the same level the original pump would drip pretty quickly and so what i wanted to do is test these exactly the same way so i filled the water brick right up to the very very top and between each test i would top it off and you can see i have a hose that goes all the way down to the bottom of the water brick and what i wanted to do is take each pump and put it at the exact same level as the water brick and see what happened and so you can see with the original it's definitely dripping quite a bit and then if you slowly raise it you'll see that the amount of dripping slows down dramatically you can see it doesn't fully stop though so it just becomes a very slow drip and so this thing would need to be fairly high to be at a safe spot in your car if you're storing it connected in fact around 10 inches and moving on to the four button you can see this one does quite a bit better so even when it's at the same level as the water brick it's really a slow drip it's much much slower than the original pump so this is a big improvement and if you raise it up the dripping slows down dramatically and it really does get to a point where it doesn't drip at all and so looking at the bottom you can see the safe level for this in the car if you're storing it is probably five or six inches if you're using a water brick so that just means it needs to be elevated off the ground if you leave it connected and for the dentist office special this one was leaking more for sure than the four button and as we start bringing it up you can see the dripping does slow down quite a bit so this thing does perform probably a little bit better than the original pump but not nearly as well as the four button so i think this one i would want to have it a little higher off the ground to make sure it's not going to be dripping everywhere so i would call that maybe nine inches all right so looking at the last one our little pump you can see this one is actually dripping fast so this is dripping again not as fast as the original pump but it's probably in second place so it's not doing that great and as you move it up it does seem like it handles the back pressure decently well so the dripping slows down eventually but with this guy i would definitely want to store it fairly high off the ground but because it's so small you could kind of just stick it to the side of the file cabinet or something and it would be fine and obviously as the water level and the water bricks goes down a little bit this dripping becomes much less of a problem so now that i've found some options that work better and will drip less i'll feel a little bit more confident my plan still is to just use magnets and keep these things stuck maybe to the side of the file cabinet so they're fairly high off the ground and then when i get to a campsite what i'll do is i will just grab the water brick and i'll put it on the ground and that way there's no back pressure at all on the faucet and speaking of magnets my thought is to try these larger ceramic magnets instead of all the smaller ones just to see if it's a cleaner install so i'll let you know how that goes once i get that finished up all right so wrapping up what are my thoughts on which one of these is the best faucet if you're putting together a diy kitchen faucet in your car or minivan or suv so i think as a direct replacement this four button model is probably the way to go i don't love the way it looks but it does perform really well and you know it doesn't drip too much it has good speed and it's not super loud the dentist special is surprisingly smooth and quiet but i just think the design is so wonky that i don't want to use it i also have concerns about the reliability of this button so uh we're going to skip on that one that one's going to go back to amazon and believe it or not i'm going to keep this really small one just as a backup because now that i know that these things can die on me this thing is so small i can just leave it in my gear and if my main faucet breaks i'll just plug this one in and just keep moving on from there so that's my plan so i'm going to keep the four button and i'm going to keep this little guy and the other one's going back to amazon and i'm going to retire the original one because it's super stressful that it never shuts off all right so this is a little simulation of my final setup so four button uh faucet you can see it holds the glass really nicely so even if i don't want to put the sink in i can still fit a smaller glass underneath it and the little guy is going to need a step stool so you probably have to pick it up and hold it over a glass or have this sink installed but i think it will work fine in a pinch so i just hope this was helpful to you as you're starting to think about your build and i'm honestly blown away by the response to my first video so uh thank you so much for watching and subscribing and i have a lot more future videos planned around the topic so thanks again so you", "9bqc5mVnwwc": "[Music] hi so today's project is fixing the pipes under the kitchen sink this is something that happened to me and just in case it happens to anyone else just wanted to let you know before you call a plumber it might be something really easy to fix so um because i wasn't dealing with enough apparently with pandemic and god knows why one day there was water pouring out of my cupboard and i open it up and it's full of water and the pipe is leaking so i'm like great now what so turned out i apologize for the mess but this is the tidy version of my cupboard you should have seen it before so water was all over here and um what i did was i just thought you know what i'm just gonna check the pipes and they were loose like why would why would these why would this be loose randomly all of a sudden so i used to have a lot of stuff piled up in here like containers and sos boxes and who knows what maybe it was getting shoved and it i i don't know or maybe just pipes can suddenly become loose these are plastic but all i did literally is i tightened by hand i tightened everything and knock on wood wow it's mdf it's not real wood but um it worked and i never had a flood like that again so i just i took everything out and cleaned it out and dried it off but um but yeah it never happened again so just in case if you do ever have a leak underneath your sink and you start to panic like you're gonna have to replace the pipes or the sink or whatever just make sure that everything's um nice and tight and you can even like even by hand just tighten um just the joints and the pipes and yeah so hopefully it's something simple like that take care bye [Music]", "Zbtrb3bw3_g": "[Music] my name is Ellie I'm a mom of two boys I have three mouths and it's a month out and today I feel before you all some think that you would have noticed if you pay close attention because I've been that I miss when I did my dcashman in my kitchen and that was under my kitchen sink excuse all the noises from outside I'm filming we still live in a building site there are trucks and lorries and builders and all sorts going up and down but yes today I'm going to be showing you all the decoy ring and the cleaning off my kitchen sink I've got a gosh it's needed to be done I have an issue with storing cleanup rocks and we use plastic bags for our bin liners and stuff like that my cleaning products are just becoming a bit overwhelming they're not even all in this cupboard which I'm about to show you because the majority of them are kind of spread out throughout my home upstairs downstairs I've always got them on hand but I'm going to show you what it looks like if you do not this video obviously please don't forget to Like and subscribe don't forget to hear that l'\u00e9ducation bell if you want to be notified of more video but I'm going to jump straight in and show you what it looks like okay so this is what we're working with now it may look well semi-organized what would the boxes and containers but it wasn't I assure you there was all these plastic bags shoved in this cupboard which obviously need to be sorted I am and there's a lot of cleaning products in there are using more plastic bags and there's lots of stuff there's loads of stuff behind here I mean it just really needs to be sorted so I am gonna jump straight in and I'm gonna start by taking everything out getting everything out organized it all into little piles and once it's organized into piles give it a glow claim before I start putting it back in I've also bought some storage bits which I will show you in a bit as well so I'm gonna jump straight in face to face in strategy bar another glass and I'm going please we love our music on the desk okay so that is the cupboards completely empty so I'm just going to quickly go in up with my method spray tracking method spray and get your old you find it in the mess amongst me and we go in and quickly give it all of this scrub I may actually need to use a harder cloth it looks as though something's been leaking and I'm a bit worried that it's kind of rotting mind units we hire off sink replace them a bit worried but I'm going to quickly clean it up as much as I can now and then I'm going to show you how to stop organizing it [Music] you got my attention so you [Music] gingka things it's quite early [Music] okay so I've cleaned and polished it up as much as possible that's completely empty it's pretty clean I just want to show you the full extent it's terrible I had in that cupboard so it definitely needed sorting now I am I have a lot of storage solutions which I excited to show you is I'm gonna start organizing this all now and I'm gonna show you what I'm planning to do okay I'm going to show you something I've got for all of those plastic bags it is this now I'll show you a close-up so you can see it but basically it's like what this ones you get from Ikea and things like that apart from maybe when you go in your cupboards they take a quite a mess this I found dog comes in oh I can't wait to pick up I've already had a know the inside what it looks like and I've kind of experimented a little bit in the cupboard and it will you can get it some places to live bit cheaper but I went to it really quickly and basically it's just like this I'm basically on your door now I've had to be careful because of my shelf I'm gonna make sure that I put this on first I'm gonna move everything out the way and basically it's for your plastic bag so I'm really excited to get this on here and then hopefully this will neatly organize all the bags and it won't be taking up any storage space in the cupboard or get knocked about a push to the back there's no instructions I'm assuming is normally just really easy I'm assuming it probably just something to do at his pad so where I was trying to have it was it start over here as possible as I think I'm just going to take the pads off and then kind of stick it to it and hopefully it should go on and there we go how do you know that I'm super impressed but not this and this is now going to be I've told all of my bits and bobs which I'm really excited about so now all my plastic ice and no inside here which is great so the next thing I'm going to show you are some other bits I bought storage purposes now game you would see he's used some of these I purchase one of these now this was for all of my bits and bobs like this I figured it'd be much easier if I can stand them up and I'd be able to see them a lot better if they were always stood up as opposed laying down so that was another storage solution that I can add I also picked up these baskets you would see these in my other video and I'm planning to store bits and bobs on my floor it in here and just kind of keep them all together because at the moment I have quite a few a bit and they're all over the place but it's kind of stressing me out when you're next to me [Music] okay so I pop all the bottom there and now I'm gonna start the counting stuff into these trays now how long is it I have a few different ones so I've got two nose square ones I also have one of these red ones which imply that your pot the back just there now I also have a few other tins so I have this one here which is a laundry team that I've had for quite a while now I picked up from math lab and so that would normally go from there and I like to keep all my laundry put up in the same area I also recently picked this one up I'm from eBay which is a dishwasher one so I'm planning to have that there and that will hold all my dishwasher stuff in and then I also have oh it's really heavy these one here as well which is my caddy which might keep a lot of my favorites in so I think I'm gonna go through all of these get out everything that's in here reorganize my favorites that I want that I currently have to carry all around my home and then obviously just starts up Nancy's basket these may change as I'm going for the product but hopefully this will be a lot more organized in a second so let's start with a Flores I think [Music] okay not so much left over so tej now I need to figure out what I'm gonna store so obviously I won't make some a little stand up ask it to be only if it's probably not the need for this penny why do use them quite they're about adventure times another drink and I'll go anywhere they smell like ash in the universe you are illuminating I don't really care about the people in the bar I don't really mind on the Google students I don't care at all baby you got my attention so you [Music] okay so I popped with my favorites in here so I'm going to show you what I would want in here all the time with whatever I'm doing so I always carry around the mr. muscle windows cause I always come around some by couch again I've mentioned in my favorites before I also always have it on one of these for the desktop all in one phrase I love them they can be sprayed on fabric surfaces all sorts they're great for toilet handle doors and stuff like that the job speckling carpet stain remover which I know I've mentioned again polish a couple of room sprays just the kind of good things to freshen up especially in the winter months I like using these when you can't get as much fresh air in it's a little bit colder from outside and things like that and then I also like carrying around the glaze shaking backs I don't use this all the time and maybe once a month or something like that sometimes I find it kind of build up dirt in the carpet if the suction isn't that good so I need you if I was giving the carpet of goods here with shark Hoover not the Dyson so now I've got all my favorites in there I'm going to pop that back up here I also organized all the way those doors in here with my favorite method spray which I'm currently using I also got another hold off at the back with more method spray stuff so I'm going to put that towards there I also got a bathroom method spray and a bathroom if it spray upstairs as well that's why it's not in this buggy here so that's going to go in there like so and then next I think I'm gonna try and get all the products I don't use that much and I'm going to pop them in this box or not because there are some bits but I just don't use it often and I use that quite a bit missed that one that one in the middle muscle shower lines now one which I use quite a bit as well yeah so there are things like black clean and shine I don't really use this on my floor that much anymore because I have a steam cleaner and then if I do and use the floor so I'm just gonna take this one out here the back adventure times another drink and I'll go anywhere they smell like in the universe so my next thing is just organizing everything out so I'm gonna pop it don't you pop back in now that back in I'm gonna pop these so these are my treasures I'm using at the moment so they're now in my cupboard as well all stored nicely and then with those I always use on stock walls so I'm gonna try and find a nice place to store these two there we go makes it perfectly in there and then the one last thing I wanted to show you is I actually bought some candies now I've got Cody from two different places I've got these ones from home bargains I from B&M sorry which looks like this and I also got these ones from home send pick up 11 points and folks I like these ones better because they're white guys I'm going to see how they work but my plan for these was to secure them to the doors like this so I'm hoping I can have one there and maybe one over here and they can hold in all my flops I'll show you I mean so instead of these lying around like bunnies store all my pops in there like that that way I'll know when I'm running low I'm going to need to buy more and then I can literally just hook them onto my door and it'll make it so much easier I think they might only need one let's try and pop that on okay so decided the best place of this is there and remove one of the UNSTOPABLES and just it kind of frees up the space for the door to shut okay so now that all shuts perfectly which I love and then the last way for me to organize is up here so I'm just gonna pop thing that I use all the time and they're putting my packets and sachets so I've got bits like my tumble dryer sheett they go up there my desktop i microwave white window my I've also got my color captures to go go up there and then I've also got my manic raises as well some hand soap which I'm just going to pop back in evacuate one I never the backcombing yeah and those last one there and that is pretty much the covered complete I have this little mesh bag which sometimes I like to use I'm just going to store that in the back here and then the last thing that I need to organize are all my cloths and again I decided MIDI the same method and put them over this side and then they pop this up on here and that will be where all my clocks will go and then that way I'll be able to keep all of these neatly organized and and that even my cover is completely tidy I'm going to show you around in a bit more and show you I've done it ok so I can't believe how good this is tell me I'm absolutely loving it so to start off over here we've got this thin thing that I mentioned with bin bags and then obviously we've got this little holder here which holds all the cloths you then obviously you've got over in this one you've got all the sponges and all the extra dish Matic ones that I have as well then as you can see in the cupboard down here we've got this lounger on which holds all of my tablet and my fabric softener next to it if I take that out then at the back you've got all those products I said I rarely use they're kind of all hidden away now in the middle you have got almost a Flores and my methods I use all the time with some bin bags you've got my UNSTOPABLES and my dishwasher tablets all of my method products at the back and then in that round container they're all my stand yup products then up here we've got my very much not liquid espresso my magic razors and all of my cleaning wipes as well as my laundry boxes full of colour catches and tumble dryer sheets and then in here you've got my caddy which has got some extra bits are unstoppable so that's fine and and then mainly all the bits that I carry around I don't think I've ever had a cupboard as organized as there I'm not sure you believe me but if I mean to show you well guys I hope you enjoyed watching this video and it's giving some of you guys some inspiration to clean under like kitchen sink and get organized I will try and link everything where I can if you need by this video then

in the basement that's backing up it's not going down probably a couple of yesterday or something says it takes a day or so to go down so it's backing up and it's i don't think it's the main drain because i asked him if he ran any water upstairs if it was overflowing he said no so it's probably just um a slow kitchen drain in the basement so we're going to go over there i'll probably cut the pipe get the snake down there and give it to you how you doing i asked him he said there's no standing water in the sink now so it probably drained out but it's definitely backing out well we're probably about 30 to 30 degrees here this morning oh crazy cold this molly is working again y'all oh yeah you're working again molly are you working again you are working again i know you are anyway i got three four jobs this morning to do so try to put some videos together if i can try to get you some shots this is that same guy i put the um cast iron toilet flange in for smashed the oil when i went back after you put the floor in and letting that other one in i'll probably a couple a week a couple or three weeks ago i guess anyway you're calling me for more work to get you some shots so he's got a lot of leaks here on this stuff so it runs all the way over and then so i'm probably going to cut this pipe here and try to give it though push it out with water maybe this is a basement just try to make a cut over here the best thing to do when we get the get the clamp down so oh yeah it's all full of grease somebody's dumping grease down there guy you want to take a look can you see it it's all full of grease that ain't good this stuff's all loose as a goose might be able to might be able to blow it out i don't know your wife over there dumping grease down here now that you know off how long has it been since you bought the house uh almost five years yeah it might have been from before trying to get this stuff right out of the way and see if we get a flow going through that you can take this right outside and clean it out with a garden hose take this assembly outside right wow wow look at that take it outside and blow it out with the garden hose okay watch it don't tip it because it's going to want to spill in the meantime i'm going to dead clamp that and give that the old doucheroom we'll give this the old jed clamp it see if we can blow this out of here keep it simple this this thing goes i don't know how far it goes quite a ways and it goes down let's see if we give it the oh you know how you doing now if it backs up i gotta shut off here i could shut it off and put holes on it it should blow it out we should hopefully we'll find out how want you to do about the grease in there maybe try to put some hot water and give it the flush how you doing mama i've got hot water right here so there's some give it the old flusher rule we'll have to fix the drain up put some little washers in there but not for the guy but [Music] let's just put my bathroom on it washing machine holes on there i hit a guy flushing out the thing outside it's probably not gonna be pretty she's a krusty one mr grinch she's crusty make up any kind of adapter you want right just just to get it so it's a regular lap supply with a half by hose adapter let's just get water down here this doesn't seem to be than any of the other plumbing so hopefully i could give it the old douche [Music] giving it the old flush treatment put some hot water down there so i think it's going down i'll be able to tell if we're loosing this up the water comes squirting out of here you know it's not going down yeah it's going down so that's good give it a little flush for a bit [Music] i'm just basically taking some hot water and flushing it down in there get some of that grease the hell out of there you could tell if it wasn't going down and it was going up the vent got lucky got lucky i don't know if it was if it wasn't if it was going up the vent would be squatting right out of here so we got lucky all right that's good enough for this neighborhood that don't almost work like i did did this time that's one way to do it all right not the jed clamp it the drain's not even pitched the right way drain's not even put pitched the right way but it looks like it's cleaned it out quite a much pretty much drains got a backward pitch to it we'll get it back together and get it back together uh let me get some some gaskets and some clamps out of the truck and we'll get this thing back together and run it and see what happens the drain's pitching the wrong way goes all the way back to that wall over there somewhere i see it's going the wrong way look at that that's grease that's what i say look at that yeah blow that out with the holes what about the rest of it wow i should go through you got to probably put a rag i'll go through now oh yeah see how it's coming yeah it's right here i mean i can snake it if i help i'll try try try doing it with the hose i'll get some gaskets and we'll try to put it back together yeah i try i might have to put a rag in there or something put your hand around it there you go whoa wow i mean it's blocked solid huh yeah i guess so holy i'll get my snake if i had to let me see me get a piece of wire all right wow bottom crap yeah flush it out with the holes i'm going to go on in i'll put a wire on here to get it to open it up once we get once we get some hot water in there and flush it good you know yeah that's grease this one's okay now yeah look at all the grease here huh yep that's really bad crazy took a piece of volume and cut the grease up yeah so it was right in the trap where it was really bad wow so obviously the other person that used to live here was dumping grease down there you know probably a portuguese family cooking bacon or something and just dumping the right down there that's what that is bacon or butter most likely bacon grease from like bacon you know it's white well when it's warm it's fine right but when it gets cold it turns back to fat where's the trap [Music] good thing it all came apart right you think that's a crusty one you don't think we're gonna get that outside it probably would have been hard to clean it give it the old jed clamp it you'll find your thing hooking up on this now i might have to get plastic nuts for these they'll have to go plastic on the bottom here because these other ones are kind of going wampus i don't like the looks of them if i can no work today you're going back in after okay the thing's definitely kind of cattywampus huh something's clear about it yeah these plastic nuts got a lot more slap on them you know know what i mean there's more give the brass ones up top definitely better these got built-in washers in them too so these glasses keep fogging up on me i try to do what's right with the mask and everything but it's such a pain in the ass you know know what i mean you get glasses too i wanted some stuff on amazon for that anti-fog i don't know how good it is but we're gonna try it all right so we got the brass nuts on the top and then the plastic ones on the bottom that should work yeah not much of a flow there is there no as long as it don't leak and it goes down straps on the legs how long did you play around with trying to get it just to go down the leak a while at least at least you come to the conclusion and good get it done right here it ain't going to leak anymore because i redid everything i've got new new brass nuts and washers and new washers down below nuts i don't see any leaks", "9i9jwVnk1QE": "hi this is Nikhil Sorachi the home source guy president no--nor source Development Inc a residential and commercial construction company in Garner mill New York and this has had a size a kitchen sink so the first element that we want to consider is our sink base cabinet in our case we have a 36 inch sink base cabinet so we're going to insert a 33 inch sink so in our installation we're going to fit a 33 inch sink in our 36 inch sink base so the overall dimension of this sink is 33 by 22 but if we were installing a sink in a countertop our cut out would be the track dimension so in this case it's 21 and 3/8 by 32 and 3/8 so our cutout or roughout dimension would be 32 and three-eighths by 21 and 3/8 if you were cutting out a countertop you'd want to keep the radius at the corners the reason being is if you cut the countertop square it would increase the chances of a break in the Formica so that radius actually keeps this Formica strong especially during expansion and contraction which you do get normally in temperature deviations and especially in room temperature you go up one down one you pour some water down the sink it heats up the sink so there's always expansion and contraction issues that affect the countertop as well suppose you had a situation where you had an existing opening in a countertop and want to replace it with a sink there's several different types of sink so the only variable that you have to be aware of is if for example you had an over mount sink on a stainless sink installation you'd have to just make sure that the outer dimension of the overall dimension is larger than your opening your counter opening so that it covers everything around the perimeter and this was how to size a kitchen this is Nikhil Sorachi the home source guy president no nor source Development Inc a residential and commercial construction company in Garner Ville New York helping you build a better life reach out to me on Facebook at the home source guy see you next time", "H0KJ3PX3GhU": "okay a heavy homeowner with you here this is a picture of my sink I know it's messy I'm actually in the middle of doing the dishes here and I realized that little issue looks like we have a clogged kitchen sink and it's the autumn matter of the it's not a matter of the garbage disposal being focus watch activating the garbage disposal isn't fixing I mean looks like it's going down a little bit now but this problem still there so what I think is happening is I think there's a blockage further down along the pipe and there's actually a really simple way to fix this that should take less than five seconds so let me go get the necessary tool and I'll be right back okay so you can still see that the cleared away the dishes here you can see and the problem still is there now notice no foam on the other side so I suspect that the blockage is in the back section of pipe too clearly to drain so what's the easiest way to fix this actually very simple no need to call plumber no need for drain or anything like that what are the tools you need basically you need a rag kitchen towel that'll go on oxide and then your typical plunger toilet plunger so with the towel and a plunger we should be able to resolve this in about five seconds let me put this on the tripod and we'll give it a shot okay here we go so actually I meant moisten this towel a little bit get it down so creates a nice seal on this drain here the idea is do you want to get that tight or you know actually I have a plug let me get the plug if you don't have a plug like this you can use a towel I think I'm going to use both in this case I'll go ahead and put the plug in their cover tell and the idea is we're just trying to create a somewhat of a vacuum in a system here okay so this is covered plunger is here but see if I can get this done in five seconds tight seal here hold it plunger in one two three four five I hear something draining already I think you might have done it let's see and we're good to go while install easy how to unclog your kitchen drain in under 5 seconds thanks for watching if you enjoyed this please give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more fun

stunning and then over the course of weeks it started to fade as I said patchy and white and didn't look very good and it's really annoying because we spent a lot of my own this thinking it's one of our favorite features of kitchen oven yolk work tops and so we try everything I wanted to try and keep it black and within a day I said Behold but what we did find was that if you use a cooking oil olive oil sunflower oil on some tissue and work it into the worktop into the the composite sink then it stays black and it stays back for longer and I've now let this sink for quite a few weeks and it's not used I've made a point so I'm trying to make it look as bad as I can for the video and to be honest was struggling to make it look bad now because the amount of oil we saw in the past so in this video I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how I do it it's very simple and and then hopefully you guys can try it as well and then you'll get some good results as well so for this example I'm going to be using Tesco's pure vegetable which pre means pretty much means that it's cheap it's crap and whatever but oil is oil so but everybody care and then I'm also going to use some kitchen roll all right so cooking oil bit tissue and then we just pour a little bit or a lot doesn't really matter okay and then you just work it into the sink and you'll get all howling crashing oil or a click but still nonetheless it works and this starts so cheap it doesn't really making today what I do it I cut myself it and really do flash it on and and thanks I'm going to shower up to this so it's not too bad but straight away but like when you spray wd-40 onto plastic it kind of takes the yeah gives you back that shine so see I'm really actually on there and then we'll do is we'll get a bit more in there and then we'll do the thing which are bit so you can see for the camera just keep my dream log out as well go around and then get all down in the sink the trail now please quite scabby get some more like so if not be on there okay thanks pretty much cutlet now everywhere like a coating of oil and what we're going to do is lead that five lips just to soak in and then we'll come back get some new to new kitchen roll and then we'll back it all up right five minutes is up now so I'm going to get some more tissue which looks like a little of this wrong kid and then I'm going to puff up wherever we put the oil basically you take off all the excess basically clean it all up and you can ignore anything looking awesome it's pretty much a little bit and there's not a maximum amount on the tissue not you know overly oily get normally get out and take that long and then that is it so yeah so that's it and that's it literally takes about 10 minutes to cluding the five minutes that you wing it and so what we do is give me a cue tripods around so as you can see so much better and that will stay like that for a week two weeks you know we're going to do it very often in why do we have a peanut so just to my other videos and so she often what she does every week as well and so yes that's how we've been keeping our composites in looking tip-top you can do it - really easy to the crostini and such so yeah so anyway I hope you enjoying the videos and if you do please do make sure you like them give me a thumbs up leave any comments below also subscribe to my

sink if you're not looking to use super harsh chemicals but it's gonna leave you with the sparkliest most clean fresh smelling sink ever so let's first go through all of the tools and ingredients that I'm going to be using and then I'll actually clean my thing so you get to clean with me as I clean my sink and my garbage disposal today and then you can see it the finer results of how to get a sparkling clean sink all right here are the products that I will be using today to clean my sink so you just need some dish soap any dish soap of your choosing is totally great but I love the mint scent of the mrs. Myers right now you'll need some baking soda you will need some vinegar to clean with paper towels I don't use those till the end either rubber bands or cloves pins and some Ziploc bags I have the snack sized ones I found those are a little bit easier to use for this you will need either a old toothbrush or I personally love this Rubbermaid reveal it's a fun little cleaning and catch it that I found on Amazon way back last summer I did a video where I try to all these different cleaning gadgets I found on Amazon and this one is a keeper brochure and then you will need a sponge or I like this sort of sponge scrub brush because I just think it's easier to use with a handle this one is from Grove collaborative where I get a lot of my natural cleaning products so if you want to try out grow for either the sponge or this dish soap or a bunch of other all natural cleaning products and also I'm just looking here that's where I have my little strainer is from I'll have a link in the description box below if you want to check that out because then you get a free gift set with any $20 order but all right let's get to cleaning out this sink the first thing I'm going to do is use my ziplock bags and the white vinegar and I'm just going to pour the white vinegar into the ziplock bag and again if you use a rubber band or the clothespin just kind of help secure this I'm gonna let the white vinegar sit on the faucet it just helps clean it so if you have any gunk or build up using the vinegar is a really safe all-natural way to clean your faucet and especially here I drink tap water a lot we do have a filter on our refrigerator but there's a lot of times I might be making lemonade or something along those lines that I'll just use the water right out of the tap and this way I'm cleaning it with something that is natural and doesn't put chemicals on it faucet so it's going to use my clothes pins to make sure this is nice and secure and sits on there then while I clean the rest of my sink and I'm gonna do it on my hot water I have a little hot water back here too so that's why I have to baggy and sorry the angle for the camera it's a little hard that's why I'm like scooting because I can't fit in ok camera this is behind the scenes but yeah that's why I'm basically squatting and awkwardly in this video I don't really like stand like such a turkey grace is my middle name just kidding it's where we don't don't have any gratefulness today I am just rushing a little bit because it's towards the end of the kids nap time about just wanting to finish this video before they wake up alright so I have the vinegar now in this dafuq bag with the clothes pins and it's just gonna sit there then and do its work while I clean the rest of the sink and I'm just going to move this over well I do that and I'm gonna take out this little strainer doodad I don't need that for right now I'm going to take out this is the other one that came with this think on this they don't need that for this part either okay so now I'm just going to take my dish soap and my sink was already pretty wet but I would make sure make sure your sink is a little bit wet before you put in the dish soap and then your baking soda and you can already hear like as soon as they put that baking soda on you kind of hear it doing a little lick sizzling work but I just have a small cup of water here for my scrub brush because I just want it to be a little bit wet while I do this and just move in big circular motions all over the sink you want to go up again just using like big circular motions to completely coat the sink with that dish soap and baking powder mixture and it just smells super fresh and clean even as I'm doing this but you will see after I let that set for a second it also really helps to refresh your garbage disposal because when you rinse all the baking soda and just soak down if you turn on your disposal get that baking so in there and it sort of deodorizes there isn't thump or build up in your disposal - now one other thing you can do if you're just looking for super scented clean you could add some essential oils to this as well if you just have like a plain dish soap and you want a super strong scent as you clean the skin for your disposal you could add just resolutely wedding this - a little bit - but you could add an essential oil and have it then the sort of extra sent it or an additional aroma if you want it top part here now this is a rather new think I just did a complete kitchen makeover of the countertops and the backsplash tile if you are interested in seeing that video I also just decorated for summer so if you want to check out some Ridge of poor in my kitchen and all around the rest of my home there's definitely more videos on my channel that I would love for you to watch and see but the kink is newer but this is something I love to do pretty much once a week I just I don't know about you and I feel like they're just always splatters or built up or food gunk that sometimes can get stuck we had a lot of macaroni and cheese in my house and I feel like there's always like cheese spectrum I don't know if anybody else has that but that's the face of Lake Mary and the two toddlers right now so I just always like to have a sparkling pane sink just because so much I feel like it's washed and clean in a sink - you just want the freshest cleanest think possible okay so everything is now completely coated in that dish soap and baking powder mixture so I'm gonna set my sponge this light over here and this is where you can either use a toothbrush for I love this Rubbermaid reveal scrub brush just going to get the head of it a little bit wet and if you have any build-up around the ring of your sink or if you were to have any sort of your drain I know our old that drain faucet excuse me if you were to have any fills up around your Bostick when there are old one used to have that too this is an incredible gadget to clean that so you're gonna hear it it's gonna get noisy but I'm just gonna do the ring around this thing to kind of show you how this works all right now we're going to remove the vinegar in those plastic baggies that was sitting here and honestly you can pour that right into the sink kind of like helps everything foam up really big get on this side - it kind of makes everything foam up when you mix that vinegar with the baking soda and now I mean I just like rinse my tools and then do an actual good rinse of the sink here kinda gives a nice refresh to your sponge too since we've had that baking soda and water soap rinse off the head my Rubbermaid reveal tool Wow right now I'm just going to rinse all around the sink everything [Music] on this side turn the watt up so you can actually hear me decently on this side because it's before the garbage disposal is I'm going to turn on the garbage disposal while I rinse this side out again so that baking soda just so make sure really helps to deodorize the garbage disposal [Music] [Music] okay so now that that is all rinse down I'm just going to take my paper towels put a little bit of vinegar on them and wipe down all of the handles with the vinegar that leaves your stainless-steel looking super shiny and sparkly [Music] I'm just gonna take a few more and sort of combine them and just wipe around the outside of the sink where a little bit of water splattered and I was cleaning out the sink and I love just Susan likes a good old-fashioned mason jar for holding some of my sponges on there and I found this little cake stand that there's a clear one out of that pink one for during the springtime when I have more pinks and purples in my kitchen but this was in the dollar spot at Target and I just love that for setting this is like a room spray and my countertop spray and my hand soap and dish soap just kind of set them up there and to me it kind of just add a little decorative flair for kind of holding everything that I need and now I'm just gonna grab paper and wipe out the insides of the sink really good this is kind of the last thing you do so that you can wipe it all out and have that sparkling clean think and honestly it smells so amazing just that little bit of mint and baking soda it's super like minty and fresh clean smelling [Music] and I guess I kind of go from like the top of the sink down to the basin when I do this wipeout because when I feel like it looks super sparkling and clean then [Music] all right that is it I hope that you enjoyed this in-depth thorough how to clean your sink video

ways to eliminate those pesky odors naturally in this short video we've gathered fast and easy cleaning hacks to help you get rid of those awful odors in your garbage disposal some other DIY way and then we have a quick easy way if you don't have the right ingredients around the house here's how to banish the owner of your decomposing food and leave your kitchen sinks sparkly clean but first I have a pretty question for you my husband and I have a disagreement is it a garbage disposal or duck garbage disposer he likes to say disposer but I think it's disposable what do you think leave a comment below and let me know first method is we're going to turn on the hot water and first flush things through now in this step you want to remove the rubber stopper out of your garbage disposal if it's removable mine isn't and in the process of trying to see if it was removable I discovered that the underside of that rubber stopper is disgusting I'm hoping that this will get it out but if it's not I need to make sure to clean that the next step is to dump in about a half a box of baking soda and then pour in one cup of white vinegar run more water through it and then turn on the disposal and next for the science project part vinegar watch it fizz the owner is gone the only problem is now it felt smelled like fish and chips in here which brings me to my next point lemons if you happen to have a fresh lemon on hand or one that's going bad and yet you haven't had a chance to use some time just cut it in half run the lemon through the disposal and then follow up with some vinegar I love lemon scented things I actually have a lemon scented hand soap smell will disappear and you'll have a wonderful lemon scent left behind I know that some people think that all you need is baking soda of water but there's something magical about the combination of baking soda and vinegar together it's kind of like a science project we've tried vinegar by itself and it just drains out immediately and does nothing and if you use just baking soda and flush it with water it also doesn't do much but when you combine the two you get a magical chemical reaction that cleans and deodorize is way better now when you do remove your rubber stopper if yours is removable it probably hasn't been cleaned in a while so make sure to pop it in the dishwasher for a quick wash now it's a commercial method if you're not the DIY type and you just want to drop a tablet in and have it do something we have the solution for you too just put a glisten garbage disposal foaming cleanser inside your disposal and let it do its job okay now I pick this up at my local store also put a link to it in the video description but if you don't have the ingredients on hand and you just want to make it super fast and easy with a lot of satisfaction - then you can use one of these so now this is what it looks like inside and it's not what I expected when I first tried these but these are biodegradable packages you're gonna put this right into this Rosal like this do not open it and pour the contents out so start with the turned off empty disposal make sure there's nothing in it and then you're gonna run a stream of hot water into the disposal side of the sink but not directly into the disposal after one minute reduce the amount of hot water to a trickle looking on both sides to Wow and you're going to keep doing it until the pump entirely disappears okay rip out this one alright now that that's done and it's so sparkly clean my next thing is to see if I still need to clean the underside of my rubber stopper thing so let's test it on I'm putting on some gloves because gross uh yeah that's still Grove so I'm gonna take a microfiber cloth I really love this kind it's called mr. sigue I'll put a link to it in the video description but they're awesome they're soft they never get crusty and hard and I'm just going to clean that out with some bleach I'm actually just gonna use some don t charge it because it helps cut grease [Music] Oh gross we're pretty clean I'm total clean freak and look how dirty that is so I'm not I cut that that's certainly gonna cause some smell [Music] I'm just gonna toss that microfiber cloth from the wash now because it's truly gross because it's truly disgusting now that we're done flushing out the garbage disposal it's a good time to just give your horse a washing toy I have my force of nature cleaner it's my favorite non-toxic cleaner that he's my just bleach but doesn't bring my man [Music] and there you go a sparkly clean pink plus one that smells great when the biodegradable pouch comes into contact with water and the disposal actions and cleaning foam is created which scrubs away the toughest scrunch build-up and foul odors from the entire disposal including the blade sidewalls and splash guards so everyone I hope this was helpful for you do me a favor and if you have a stinky garbage disposal and try one of

It\u2019s Abby and today we are going to tackle\none of those trouble spots when it comes to organization. Underneath the kitchen sink. Now, when we moved into our house I basically\njust took my cleaning caddy and all the bins that I had from our old house and threw them\nunder here and kinda forgot about them. I knew it wasn\u2019t the best configuration\nso recently I decided to do an overhaul. Before we jump into it, be sure you hit that\nsubscribe button so you don\u2019t miss any organization inspiration and head to abbyorganizes.com/bonus\nto get your free bonus from us that includes some of our best organizing tips and tricks. The first thing I did when I decided to tackle\nthe cabinet under the kitchen sink was take everything out so I had a totally blank slate\nto work with. From there, I was able to get rid of anything\nthat we were no longer using and see exactly what I had left so I could make a plan for\ngetting it neat and organized. While I had everything out of the cabinet,\nI wiped it down and put in some pretty contact paper. Not only does this help to make it look nicer,\nbut it also is easier to keep the actual cabinet clean and keep it from getting damaged or\nsticky or anything like that. When I had my remaining items organized and\nready to go, it was time to refill the space. Let\u2019s take a look at how it turned out. If you saw my pantry video a couple weeks\nago, you know I use a lot of clear containers with aqua labels. So to maintain consistency throughout the\nkitchen, I decided to go for a similar look in here as well. I found these acrylic drawers on Amazon. They were originally meant for cosmetics but\nthey are the perfect size to hold sponges and cloths and things like that. I will link to them in the description below. I cut all the labels out of adhesive vinyl\nusing my Silhouette machine and it makes it really easy to figure out what goes where. I transferred my dish soap into this little\noil container that was about $2 and it got a matching label too and it makes it really\neasy to just grab it and dispense it whenever we need it. In the middle here, I used some stackable\ncontainers I had to hold some of our under the sink essentials. These ones were a little pricey but I recently\nfound a more inexpensive version at Walmart in the Better Homes & Gardens brand so I will\nlink both below in the description. So, dish washer tabs are a must. We have two little containers of them and\nwhen we need them we can just pop the top and lift it off and grab one. This is really easy especially with wet hands\nwhen you\u2019re doing the dishes to get this off and just grab what you need and then put\nit back. So, the other containers hold things like\ngloves for really messy jobs and then this one has some random items that we need to\nkeep close to the sink like an Allen wrench for the garbage disposal and the sink stopper\nand that sort of thing. So I use the final tall container from my\nset to hold SOS pads. It\u2019s back there out of the way cause we\ndon\u2019t use those very often. This white container is actually a utensil\nholder meant to hold forks and knives and spoons but it\u2019s worked perfectly as a cleaning\ncaddy to hold my cleaning supplies. I really pared down my items and just kept\na few multipurpose cleaners here and that\u2019s really all we need to use. I did make my own glass cleaner. I used just a regular spray bottle and labeled\nit. We use this not only to clean windows but\nalso for our quartz countertops and it works really well. So that is our organized cabinet. In the past, I\u2019ve always felt like I had\nthis space packed with stuff and it really made it hard to organize it and keep it neat\nand clean so we could always find what we needed. When I took it down to the essentials that\nI actually need and use, I even had some extra space in the cabinet and I will never complain\nabout that! Of course, everybody\u2019s needs and setup will\nbe different but this is working for us right now so I\u2019m going to stick with it for awhile.

organized home that you want!", "wp1cVzu8Zkg": "when it comes to designing a kitchen bathroom or bar many times the sink is overlooked although choosing the right sink doesn't have to be complicated it is important to do your research determining what is functionally and aesthetically ideal will help you pick the right option for your project the undermount stainless steel sink is the most popular option for the kitchen they are typically inexpensive and easy to clean because these sinks have no lip liquid can be simply wiped right into it making cleanup convenient stainless steel sinks are available in many different shapes and sizes they are extremely durable affordable and versatile stainless steel sinks fit the decor and style for virtually any kitchen in addition it's possible to shape stainless steel sinks into a customized space when deciding between single Bowl and double Bowl sinks it's important to consider the function of your space if large pots and pans are common in your kitchen then single bowl sinks would be a better option another option is the cast-iron sink when it comes to durability and attractiveness the cast-iron sink reigns supreme these sinks are built to last a lifetime and have a much more rustic aesthetic appeal than a stainless steel sink cast-iron sinks are fairly heavy and will require extra support to hold its weight if you are looking for an eye-catching sink there are other options such as brass or copper these sinks while beautiful will require more maintenance for this reason they are typically found in lower flow areas such as bars when it comes to bathrooms the most popular choice is porcelain since the bathroom sink does not see the heavy lifting of pots and pans they can often be a more artistic statement than its kitchen counterpart the sink options for a bathroom are nearly limitless for a really spectacular look a custom sink can be made out of natural stone like the one we see here the sink is by far the most utilized appliance in your kitchen and bathroom so when shopping for a sink make sure you take into account its function placement and beauty the people here at marble comm pride themselves and

baking soda in the pipes and fill and back in there and then we're going to close it all back up and hopefully that will take care of my problem otherwise we're going to have to get a snake or something with the snakes [Music] this also has a drill attachment so you know you can turn it into a motorized thing right and I'm going to do that in a little bit after I show you kind of the technique that I got down um I'm on well after a little while our wall arms with a lot of hot look all the time um yeah so let me get it set up and show you all how we doing this goggles right so the big news that I saw online basically recommended kind of keeping this four to six inches right this length not more than that so this is the unlocking and locking function so just going to extend that out a little bit and what I like to do is go a little bit counterclockwise a few spins and then a few spins clockwise you see how over here that's like about to bend you want to try and get that bend in the pipe right as long as it's bending and doing all that in the pipe you're good once that happens if it happens outside of the pipe in the open space then this gets really kinked up and it's hard to control that's why I think they recommended only four to six inches there so anyways so you do that right and you keep the bend in the pipe as much as possible and you push it a little bit you know and finagle it and just get in real close and once you're real close unlock it pull it out a few more inches lock it back up and repeat there's a lot of other alcohols mollify works a little sortes a little help a lot of it Oh but enough about our apartment horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible I think it's in there like this point I don't feel like I want to go in any further I'm just going to put the drill on and cut pulling it out clean it up our local battle and all our laws and our and just as I set it in there little by little I'm going to pull it out clean up change the direction right so I feel like you get the idea when I get towards the end I'll show you what gummed I find think we have some success I spilled that cup of mix of vinegar and lemon juice all over here which is fine you need to clean up soon anyways but that tired of winding it all in so I think I'm just going to pull it all out drop it in the bucket and clean it at once that should know [Music] siding lemon juice mix for the moment of truth let's see what's up before I was fill it on this side and it would come up in there then I think we don't have any weak side note I ran to Lowe's because these washers are old and plastics so I got some new ones out of rubber that the point where this was fitting into there it was also leaking so trigger he'll be worth two three bucks to try a new washer everything used to be in working order and up here a we don't got any leaks what", "RBQPcYbHNHY": "hey y'all welcome back to the busy bee my name is chess and I'm so happy that you guys

keep a fire extinguisher under your kitchen sink I had this blue aqua paper just laying around I think and one of my closets I'm going to use this to line the bottom of the cabinet it's already pre-cut it doesn't have that sticky back so I'm just gonna use some of this tape here that I found I think it's some washi tape and put that down so it looks nice and fresh [Music] [Applause] such a mixed with little hurt quite hard into the daredevil boy less feeling I justified you know all the ways I like it but no if you must stop you might eat you boys when you see me am i watch try to make me feel my best it can be really hard to organize under your kitchen sink because of all the pipes and the garbage disposal that's there so you need to make sure that you find multiple size baskets to try out and make sure you use your vertical storage space I found some stackable containers at t.j.maxx too and a peg for only $6.99 and that was really the only thing that I purchased for this makeover everything else I already had at home so now what you're just gonna see me doing is moving the baskets around and filling the cabinet back up with my cleaning supplies [Music] [Laughter] Oh

install I had to replace my garbage disposal the new disposal did not come with the power cord so that was the first step the packaging says the rid wire so this one's got little Thai ribs and then you can see those little tiny ribs this means that is the neutral water and then the smooth one there's no ribs on this one is the hot wire of course greetings ground you want to route the wires through the hole and connect on the disposal the white is the neutral and the black is the hot wire you want to secure those with wire nuts and screw in the ground wire I like to go back with electrical tape and secure the fittings when I tighten the screws around the power outlet to hold it in place and then replace the cover plate and you are done with the disposal [Music] will pop out yeah you you just have this problem your one good good construction when starting with the sink you want to first shut off the water there should be one for the hot and one for the cold mine just had a pull tab that you pulled into it clicked and then the water was shut off you want to remove any of the existing piping and water connections from the students and then you move on to disconnecting the sink from the countertop there will be a silicone seal running around this keeps it in place and keeps it watertight I just use a screwdriver pry it up and then we pulled until it popped out you'll then want to remove the old silicone it's best if you use a paint scraper but I couldn't find mine at the time so I used the flat end of a screwdriver you wanted to do as much as we could with the sink while it was still outside of the countertop so we stalled the pocket so that he didn't have to mess with it once it was in place it was pretty easy all you do is thread a line through the hole in the sink and then tighten with the nut provided but don't forget the rubber washers like we almost did we then attach the hot and cold water lines to the inlet on the faucet it is a lot easier to do this while those thing is still outside of the countertop if your sink has an adjustable nozzle like mine does it will come with a weight all you do is snap that on at the adjusted length now we're ready to apply a new bead of silicone around the sink edge so that we can place the sink in this will give it a watertight seal and help hold it in place once I've done all you do is drop the sink in place a bit of the silicone did squeeze outs all we did is wipe down the edges now we're going to install the drains you're just going to use a stuff called plumber's putty you put it around the edges of the drain and this keeps a watertight seal on it for the life of the thing [Music] after the drain fitting is in you want to install the mounting piece for the garbage disposal this keeps a compression fit and holds that drain down by usually got our set time to reinstall the pipe fittings you should still be able to use the existing pipe unless it was damaged the garbage puzzle just clicks on to the mounting plate that we installed earlier yeah because my sink is a different size than previous one I did have to custom fit some of the pipe I just cut off a couple inches because of the positioning of the drain pipe I did have to get a new one and a half inch flexible key trap this actually really helped save me a ton of work and headaches in the long run once the new pipes are installed you want to hand tighten all of the connection so I have to replace this guy with this guy because the think is not in the same position that it was as my other one so this is coming directly down on this so they sell these like custom fit pipes and you can like bend it which is really nice and it will fit so once the drainage pipes are all in you want to reconnect the water lines the hot and the cold I did have to get a half inch nipple with two male ends on it to fit the cold water line because both of them had female inlets and then the hot water hooked right up after that you should almost be done just plug the garbage hosel back in the outlet should be labeled I have a test step in your garbage disposal yet so [Music] like it's working that was the most expensive part I had that that was like 90 bucks for the garbage disposal but the other one is cracked in linking so at 6:00 so I didn't saw a new sink because old garbage disposal was leaking and it was like draining through the power cord and I was like that's not good that's not normal so I've wanted a new sink for a long time my parents had a granite composite single basin so I was looking through one of those but I couldn't a lot Armon but I went into the store they're like 300 bucks at Home Depot and at Lowe's and so I looked on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist and luckily one day I ran across this on Facebook marketplace they were trying to get rid of it they've been they have for a while I was cool to get it for a steal I got this goes for $300 I saw this in Lowe's I took a picture I put it up here I got this normally 300 ollars I got it for 50 bucks because there was a tiny tiny crack on the edge here that I filled with some epoxy you can't even see that it's there nothing structural and it looks totally fine this is a double basin I really wanted the single basins like 50 bucks I couldn't pass this up and then I was looking for the faucet because I really like this oil brush I think they call oil rub wrong some of them like that I really like that look and I want to go on with a full handle I think ooh those are just nice for cleaning but those are also like 200 like I can't spend more on the faucet than I did on the sink well I end up spending a little bit more I found this on Amazon Amazon saves day for 70 bucks and I had so hurt it is exactly what I wanted nice and tall it looks really nice it fits this thing perfectly I did take the garbage disposal and the other sink drain they were just regular silver ones I actually painted them to match the sink and match the oil or bronze a synonymous metallic paint primer all in one central like outdoor use you can use on plastic metal and wood hopefully it stands up I don't know if it's going to make it the whole time it's probably minute scratching stuff but I can always touch it up a little bit but it looks so much nicer and I'm just having the children yeah but it looks pretty much exactly like that they had them at the store later Salman it was like $50 for a set I was able to get that one for seven oh and then I just painted the one and it came with the garbage pool so seven berg plus $5 can of paint so $13 investment versus fifty this was a budget build it definitely was and all together came out to be under one hundred and twenty dollars for a practically brand new composite granite sink I had a lot of help from my dad thank you Dad he has the knowledge of the stalling sink because this one was a little over my head network of planning so far so good put like a bucket in there and lay some paper towels down because just because it doesn't show any leaks in the beginning doesn't mean that it still won't leak morning leaks yet but I'll keep jumping on that and I'm really excited without it look I'll catch you next time [Music] well we all week it's big blue", "56bhEO4Vj28": "welcome back to my youtube channel you guys know what this thing is it's called a farmhouse style sink I never heard one prior to about two years ago they are all the rage this is the sink that your wife is drooling over she wants it I'm gonna build a custom cabinet to house this thing some of you may be new to this but others may not be new to this because you got the wife that keeps sending you the pins that said that she wants this in her new kitchen it's got the cutting board this drying thing here this this other column : very looking thing so you can take your cutting board out your drying rack this thing and you have a really nice deep I believe this one's 9 inches deep can almost get inside of here take a bath there are a lot of ways to make lower kitchen cabinets the method I'm going to use maximizes the wood that you can get out of a 4x8 sheet of plywood so I'll be building boxes like upper boxes and then little bases that's where you're gonna get your your toe kick that cavity that goes in this is the paste wax it's what I'm putting on my workbench table saw top and the extension over there I actually went with 220 then three twenty then tacked it off with mineral spirits dried it let it sit make sure that all evaporates off and now it's time to hit it up with some of this we're gonna try to explain how I plan to cut this up this here is a profile of a lower kitchen cabinet not to scale the total height is thirty four and a half the front to back is twenty three and a quarter when you put your three-quarter inch face frame on that makes it 24 inches if we have this section here thirty and a half inches in this section down here four inches that gives us our thirty four and a half inches now it's very common to cut this this shape out for your your end pieces it's also very common to just make this 30 and a half by twenty three and a half inch box and then make another little box for your base this way here creates less waste and that's why I'm going to make this specific cabinet this way in the future since this is part of a full kitchen I may just show you how I cut out the whole side profile and make a cabinet that way this first one we're going like this we're gonna make cross cuts thirty and a half thirty and a half thirty and a half that will leave us with four and a half inches left over we only need four so this half-inch is going to be the thickness of the saw blade when we make one two and three cuts we'll have a little bit extra my saw blade is is it's a thin curved blade so it's not going to remove that much material but will be within this 0.5 this half-inch to account for the saw blade thickness when using this track saw you make sure you have it out on the right side of the line you're cutting on the right side [Music] typically when you buy a saw the factory blade that comes on it is pretty cheap and you always upgrade we wanted to show you how how good the cut is with the factory blade right as it came out of the box these are all my 30 and a half's now they're gonna get cut to 23 and a quarter so that when I screw on a three quarter inch face frame the depth is twenty four inches these six pieces of plywood are all exactly the same they're perfect I'm only gonna deal with two of these so I'm gonna put the other four in the other room this stage in the game you have to decide which method you're gonna use to build these cabinets traditionally you use either a rabbit or a dado you glue it and then staple it new method you don't have to do this you don't have to do this you just have to drill pocket holes with your pocket hole jig and you would have a screw several screws that go in like that and then you're gonna have a few pieces in the back and you will have a back panel also a quarter-inch back panel which method would you use rabbits dedos pocket holes the standard heights for a kitchen base cabinet is thirty four and a half inches these here our standard kitchen cabinets that I took out of a house in there now in my workshop so this is kind of a good way to demonstrate my next cups the the cabinet base that this is going to sit on has to be reduced in size by the depth of this that's front apron here which is ten inches so try to visualize that this here this apron is going to be down here so I'm going to cut these sides down ten inches so what I got here is the bottom half inch the back half inch three-quarter inch side recorder inside it's gonna make the main box so what you're gonna see now I got some wood over there I'm gonna make another little box that's smaller it goes underneath it basically the carcass is complete I have all my pocket holes marked out kind of held it together said okay this is where the pocket holes need to go have everything set up for half inch so I'm gonna drill the bottom pocket holes through the bottom the back pocket holes through the back and I will switch it the setting the drill bit and the jig the three-quarter inch and I have to drill pocket holes on the outside that in the future will be screwing the face frame onto the box [Music] [Music] you get the attachment that vacuums [Music] [Music] there it is the carcass now there will be a face frame that goes around here that will give extra strength to the front part of this but that's how it goes it's it's proud of the actual cabinets probably bring this out a good bit you have a whole bunch of room to work with on the side here this this much room to work with with three-quarter inch face frame and then you got your thickness of your doors so this will probably go out a whole nother inch and the countertop sits on here there's a lot of room along the back for your faucet hole to go in and you'll get to see this come together so I gotta call it a night go inside and eat some dinner here's the big test to see if I did all my measurements correctly and I swear you cannot get closer to thirty four and a half inches than that say on this side", "INSZ5ADdDfE": "we're taking a look at the sea2summit kitchen sink this is a lightweight durable and really simple tool that allows you to be more comfortable in the backcountry sometimes when you're camping and backpacking you would like to have something that you can wash your dishes and this makes it the perfect companion because it packs down to be nice and small it comes with a included stuff sack and you can even attach this to the outside of your backpack by this last strap here so that if it's wet you don't have to store it inside of your pack what I love about this is we all know with the Leave No Trace principles that you shouldn't really take your dishes to a water source to wash them there and leave the residue in the water source in the stream and at a lake or river that you're camping around so this makes it a great tool for those Leave No Trace principles as we're looking at the construction here when it's full of water you can see that it's freestanding even though it's so packable and lightweight and pack down to be nice and small the sides here are nylon completely seam taped and completely waterproof so it is going to hold all of that water it's fine to use with hot water but they suggest putting cold water in first if you have extremely hot water on the inside it may do a little bit of damage to the seams into the coating so definitely only use warm water with this sink but you have a stiffened brim here on the top so it really holds its shape when it's got water in it you've got a couple different sizes I have the 10 liter size here but depending on your adventure you can choose the size that's best for you this size would be great for groups because you can wash a lot of things in it now as you can see you've got some nice carry handles on the side that makes it nice to move from one place to another and as you can see you can put definitely a couple items in there wash them out let so and then you can continue on your adventure it is the sea2summit kitchen-sink thanks for watching if you have additional questions about the gear you just

kitchen sink and to share some tips with you on how to organize this tough space so let's get started okay friends so let's tackle that place that gets a little grungy under our kitchen sinks is that area that it can become cluttered fast it's not attractive because of all the piping and the garbage disposal and all that stuff but it is a way to make it function and beautiful at the same time now one thing that i need to do is re-line because it's it's getting a little yucky under there so i'm going to re-line i've showed you this in my haul video that i'll link below earlier this week and one thing that i do recommend for under the counter if you can is one of these racks here and many of you have gotten this over the years from my previous you started my previous under the cabinet video which i'll link that below so you can kind of see my setup before if anyone has um not seen that but it has that drawer function which is nice but i'm taking this one out and i'm reuse this in another part of the home because i found these in target and i'll link these in the description box below also but i loved it it's white it matches my kitchen it will brighten the area i'm refreshing under here for the spring it also had a variety of accessories that also complemented it and as you can see under the sink you have to kind of plan it out so when you organize i don't recommend just going buying bins and baskets and then coming home and saying okay i'm going to organize under the kitchen sink you want to take your measurements you want to look at kind of a diagram for under your sink and when i do that i find that i'm more successful when i'm organizing within a space so the first thing we got to do friends is we got to get it cleaned and realigned i'm going to use the rest of this caldera i'm trying to use this bottle up and so i'm going to use this to give it a nice wipe down under here and it's really going to make it smell fresh and yummy under here and so it can be even difficult cleaning with the piping and things like that but where there's a wheel friends there is a way and you can see i have a lot of low pipes so it's really hard because it just blocks a good part of real estate for storing under here and i understand that the purpose a lot of times is to hide off the piping but we still are going to maximize this space so basically i'm just going to line under here and cut it to fit and then this is going to one protect the bottom of my cabinet so sometimes i like to line especially the bottom cabinets in my kitchen i always like to line those and then that is also going to give me a nice fresh look in the space because it needed it and again under that kitchen cabinet for spring cleaning that is one of the places that you definitely want on your list and i tell you it feels so good when you have this space functioning and it's a space that we use every day because a lot of times this is where you're storing all of your products when you're cleaning your kitchen this is where you store your scrubbers your kitchen towels all kinds of things so i want to show you how to beautifully store it and how to make it function for you easy to get to your things and maximize that space so when i look under my kitchen cabinet i see a l shape i see a big open space on the right side and then i see a l in the front i see a line in the front so that makes a l shape for me so i know that that's the space i'm going to use all the others all the other space is taken up mostly by that kind of component with the pl of the plumbing and all of that so that is the the space that i have is the space that i'm focusing on so they had the bigger drawer here at target also and again i'll link all of these below that i got from target in the description box if you if you want to check them out but this right here has a larger drawer which i said this is perfect for like my kitchen towels and things like that so i knew i wanted that the wonderful thing that i did like about these were that they were stackable and so i could build on so before i went to the store i measured to make sure that i knew what type of system i needed as far as height and width and so the the smaller drawers were perfect because it would help me be able to build different categories so i knew the first drawer i thought would be good for towels the second drawer i knew could be good for my um dish liquid and then i said the top one could be great for like um you know like my dish gloss and things like that so i think this is going to work out perfectly i just got to turn it the right way so i can open my drawers but it gives me a little drawer system under here it maximizes the space and it really i think it's going to work great now you see i have that little slim space available to me that is valuable real estate so i needed to figure out how i wanted to use that and i really friends didn't have to figure it out i already knew because if you watch my previous video of under my cabinet sync from several years ago you kind of know the system that i use under here to maximize space and it's these containers here the only difference that is from my last video or the last time i shared it with you is the color of the top i think i had like a turquoise or teal color lid but this will help me maximize the space here i use these all over because they are stackable they are small but efficient and i love them so this was another rack that i found in that collection at target and i thought this would be perfect to give me that tiered not tiered but more of a stackable um option on the other side it's narrow which will allow me to maximize that space and also i could think about using it horizontally or vertically so that's the great thing it makes me so that over the years if i need to change out or change it around i could turn it horizontally it would still fit and i could turn it vertically and it could still fit and that's not the case with a lot of organizational items because of that pipe so not many things are going to fit where that pipe is so this i liked i thought that this could really work and it gives me two shelves there within my under the counter because i have a few goals here one is to maximize the space and two is to hide the piping that for me i don't want to open my cabinet and see all those piping that drives me crazy sometimes i just don't like that so i wanted to really just really make it beautiful but it has to function perfectly for me so for me friends when i'm organizing the space it's about measuring assessing getting all that first then it's about cleaning it out which you guys have seen both of those are checked off the list and now that i have my kind of tools i'm arranging them within the cabinet because i need to make sure that everything is looking like i planned it out and so i put everything in there empty so i can take a look at it before i fill it up and make sure that the arrangement works for me make sure that i feel like it's going to function simply and that i've executed my design the way my organizational design the way i want it to look and way the way i want it to function so once i take the look of it empty then i'm ready to start filling up and finishing off the project so i have all of my items laid out of what's going to go under the sink and this is the time to do that assessment and make sure that you refresh you know especially this spring you know get those grungy sponges out of there and refresh with new ones making sure that you have the tools that you realistically use under your sink and then think about the season add some fresh touches for the spring such as scents in your dish liquid your dishwashing liquid your dishwashing tabs your hand soaps and things like that so that's what i did now i got these pads here these cleaning pads from one of my subscribers from germany she sent these all the way from germany i think she has an etsy store where she sells them so i'm going to link them down below but she says these are great because they after they dry things they don't stink so i was like that that was all sold for that so i'm going to put these under my sink and i may cut them down so that i can really just use maximize them so i was excited about getting these another thing that is new that i added to my collection was these clean kitchen candles and i love these because it smells like lemon and you guys know how much in my kitchen i love the scent of lemon because in when you put lemon and use lemon with your kitchen it helps get rid of those food odors so you know i like the lemon essential oils you know if i can use linen um kind of cleaning products so these smell like such a yummy clean lemon so i am excited about these so i stocked up on these and i see i've seen them before but i never jumped on them but now i have and then i also picked up some new hand soap which this i looked online was pretty pricey online but i went to marshalls and found it and i think i paid all of three or four dollars for it so i felt like i got a great deal so i loaded up on the hand wash for the kitchen so i got new products that i felt were spring i love that they had the little bumble bee on it um i grabbed some of my new sponges that i had got from the grove and of course i have i keep my essential oils in here and i also keep a tea tree oil because this is great for cleaning your baking sheets and getting sometimes you have that grunge on it tea tree oil oil can really help with that so that's all of the products that i have in here plus my dishwashing tabs and kind of my dish thing you know things to clean the dishwasher and things like that so now that i've assessed and i have all of the things here it's time to pack it up so that i can put it under the sink now one good thing about me using these containers also for my things it really helps keep things clean because they're all contained in their little space it really helps them stay fresh and free from the debris and dust and all of that so i find that it's easier to maintain so not only do they stack and they're very good storage for under the sink they really help you with the cleaning portion of it keeping it maintained so basically i've already identified what each container is going to be for i'm putting my sponges in one i put my essential oils in one and another thing about it is it helps corral things so like these tabs here are what i use to clean the dishwasher they're not dishwasher tabs per say for cleaning your dishes but they're more for cleaning the machine so i have those in a smaller container because i don't have to label it i know the small container we know that those are not for washing dishes but for cleaning the dishwasher and then the larger container here we know that the bulky container is our everyday dishwashing tabs so that's you know important to know and so i replaced the little side basket here where i keep my um sponge that's where i kind of throw it when i'm done with it my sponge and my scrubber here and so what's great about this is that it just matches with everything else and so now it's about just loading everything in i've identified the space i made sure that it's stocked up these are my dishwashing liquids and you'll notice i love different scents and the packaging for a lot of things can be distracting and produce clutter and it just that for me i don't like so i find a way when i have things that i love to use but i don't love the packaging and i can't change it i find a way to position them so that they're not distractive to the whole overall plan so this drawer is perfect for my supply of dishwashing liquids i have what i want but when you look over there it's not distracting the packaging is not distracting and so then i'm going to just load in this side and you see how that just fills that in perfectly i can see what i have i can easily get to what i have and i don't have to see all of those that plumbing in the back and friends why it's always important for me to beautify my organization such as making sure i don't see the plumbing is because when i have a beautiful space whether it's in the open or closed off it inspires me to keep it that way so when i open this cabinet and i see everything has a place i see that it's really neat i am encouraged to keep it that way my family's encouraged to keep it that way rather if i open it it's all kind of bottles everywhere i'm gonna think let me just throw it anywhere it's just thrown anywhere so that's why it's important for me to make sure that every corner has a plan and his beauty beautifully executed so that it encourages us to keep it that way and we can clearly see here like right now i'm all about blocking out spaces there's no way to throw any kind of bottle in here because there is it's all taken up with the organization so when we have say some new essential oils you have to put it into place because there's nowhere else to put it so if you live in a family it's good to block out with your organization so that they are kind of forced to put things back in their place because there's no room to just throw it in there so the key thing that i'm trying to say here with that is when you're organizing the space think about the maintenance portion of it you know like when i look into the cabinet here i know that now we know where everything goes we're not going to just throw anything anywhere because we can't it it's just not you're not there's no room or no place to do it so you know of course when you're working out your plans think about how are you and your family going to maintain it is this going to be one that's easy to maintain or am i creating a system that it's going to look pretty today and it's going to look crazy tomorrow and you don't want that so i think that's why it's important before you just run out to target or anywhere and buy items is to really think out the organization for your space because if you look at my previous um under the cabinet video you will notice that my system has not really changed now aesthetically it looks different it looks fresh it refreshed and that's what i want but the system works for me so i'm not going to change my system because i have found a workable system under my kitchen sink but every couple years i will come in and i'll refresh it such as i did today maybe putting the new canisters and changing the color and changing the products to be fresher but those are inexpensive ways to really do that so i am excited that it is refreshed i hope you all have enjoyed i will see you at the next video and this is nikki saying goodbye you",

kitchen and it has a plug drain as you can see a few things to consider when you're going to clear the drain if it's not working at all as far as flowing I know some people use drain on that type of stuff if you're going to try any chemicals and I'm not a chemical fan at all but if you're going to try any chemicals I personally would use use them if the drain was flowing slowly there's no sense in working at the drain for a while then saying okay I'm going to go buy some chemicals put it down the drain and if it doesn't work you're going to have to take the drain apart down below and have to handle the chemicals so the last resort as far as I'm concerned is scalpels for clearing a drain sorrowful to the environment and yourself now as far as plungers go this style plunger is for toilet you can see the horn on it here and it fits right into the bowl the toys it will also collapse inside there and it can be used for a sink but I kind of like keeping my plungers separate when I have for a toilet use it on toilets one for sinks and basins just a half cup and that's all you need now to clear this drain with a double sink you have to put your plug in the basket strainer which I've done over there and it's just a simple matter of holding down on that while you're plunging with the other hand so let's see what we can do here that's why now some people say pull up there's lies your work on the dream back and forth sooner or later it's going to go I'm just doing this was trying to show trying to show most important person and then folding pull the plug on because you want you want the pressure the plunge of the force on the the pipe itself and most of the time the trap is where the problem is I know depending on the grade of the pipes or whatever and on the grade of the pipe you can end up if your plate on your kitchen sink isn't properly graded a quarter of an inch per foot you're going to end up with trouble so that's something keep in mind but get a half cup this is only a three dollar plunger get a half cup and it's good to go as far as a usage for your sinks and basins anyway I hope that helps people out and enjoy your day", "DV7Tas_wPVg": "[Music] how

of the sea2summit kitchen sink now this is the 20 liter variant I picked this up about three years ago so I've been using this for quite some time and I bought it because I wanted something to be able to you know wash dishes wash clothes you know stuff of that nature and so I just wanted something simple and packable and they do make this in a 5 10 and 20 liter version I got the 20 liter coz when I was looking at him it didn't seem like the 5 and 10 liter had a large enough opening so it would have been hard to wash dishes and stuff inside of it but it just it seemed interesting I figured I'd go ahead and pick it up I've never done a review on this I've meant to for a while but I never seem to get around to it so I'm gonna go ahead and do that for you guys right now so when you first get it is gonna be in this round container and I've already taken it out so I can go ahead and show you everything more quickly but it's going to come in this round container it is a a cloth the exact same as the sink itself the inside is waterproofed with the same material at the bottom here they have a drain hole and two carabiner straps that are rubber on either side and on the back they have a straps that you can stick your backpack straps through here like your your your compression straps and things through here and just have this on your on the outside of your pack so it doesn't take up any extra space now it does weigh about 4 ounces so I wouldn't call it ultralight but I also wouldn't call it you know heavy is one of those things where you kind of have to make the decision for yourself whether you want to pick that up or you know use something else now they do make an ultra ultra light version which is called the sea2summit kitchen-sink ultra SIL which I will hopefully have a review for soon for you guys that is like this big and weighs about an ounce it's not as durable as this one is but it does work for people who want to carry something like that and but also want to remain absolutely ultralight so now that we've gotten that out of the way let me go ahead and do the review of the actual sink itself okay so this is not small you know I got a big head and you know it's got plenty of room for you to stick your hand in there and do the you know wash your pots pans dishes and clothes if you want to and basically it's made out of a nylon material a woven nylon it is double stitched I don't know how well you're gonna see it all the seams are double stitched let's see if I can block out my face here come on focus there we go well this seams are double stitched and on the inside they are all taped before they put in the actual waterproof coating so essentially it's it's double sealed on the seams you've got the taping and waterproofing that they normally do plus the actual waterproofing that the bucket itself contains now the waterproofing is black they only carry it in black so you're not gonna you know get clear or anything like that but so far like I said I've had this for three years it's been pretty much gone with me on every single camping trip everywhere I've gone that I've needed to bring something like this it's gone with me I actually consider it a vital piece of equipment because I found the so many uses for this not only do you wash your dishes wash them you know all that kind of stuff in it your clothes and things but it's also great as just a general bucket I've used this just to bring water back to the campsite to filter on the site instead of having to you know filter it down at the water source usually to carry water to put out fires you know to put up campfire the only thing that I haven't used this for is as an actual carrying container for like firewood which I wouldn't do because it is you know it is nylon it is a good durable material but at the same time even just a little pinprick hole going through that that waterproofing layer could end up causing it to leak so my recommendation would be to use it for water and nothing else I've heard about people trying to use it for stuff and saying hey it works for this and that and in all honesty you know if you want to test it that that's on you guys but I would not do anything but water in here now as far as the construction goes and I'll show you that here in just a minute when I fill it up with water it has two ways that this stays up on its own it is self standing as soon as it's full of water the larger size you you purchase the more water you're gonna have to use to get it to that freestanding point so with this one at 75% full it will free stand and you know be usable so you don't have to put the whole twenty liters but you had to fill it up three-quarters of the way so in this particular one it's about fifteen liters and the the bottom here bulges out so the bottom is wider than the lid or the top here and the top actually has a nice thick piece of wire that runs all the way around on the inside so it gives it some rigidity when it's when it's up you know to help keep everything together so far I haven't had it fall over a leak on me the design is really really good even on uneven surfaces I've never had this thing like tip and spill all the water out of it so I've been really happy with it up till now like I said I've had it for about three years one thing this is a perfect time to show you it's been really rainy so I've got my tarp up and trying to shoot videos for you guys cuz I haven't been able to do it because the weather has not been working so well if you you know if you guys watch The Weather Channel I live in South Carolina and it is nothing but rain rain rain rain rain so and I apologize that my videos haven't been coming out a lot but you know I've been trying to do the best I can so right here is a perfect example you see how this area here is all wet now the exterior material will change colors when it gets wet because the material itself isn't waterproof but once you have water in here the water does not leak out through the bottom so even if the exterior shell is wet don't worry about it it doesn't mean is leaking I thought that myself the first couple of times I used it and I realized no it's just the material on the outside getting wet it's not actually anything on the leaking but uh let's see one last thing I wanted to show you guys is it does have two carrying handles here in here the carrying handles are embroidered on here and then the tab actually holds them on is also sewn so it is really really durable I've had this thing at 20 liters and like this carried it back to camp no problems at all the strapping hasn't come any you know hasn't come loose in any way everything still feels like new so far I have not been able to say that anything on here durability wise is an issue so with the way it is now I'm definitely gonna recommend it but let me go ahead and show you what it looks like full so you guys can get an idea for the size like I said this is 20 litres so I'll give you guys an idea for the size and show you what it looks like absolutely you know filled with with the whole 20 litres so I will be right back I'll go ahead and get that done for you and we'll go ahead and finish up the review get it back and welcome back right here we have 20 litres of water in here as you can see it is completely freestanding even if I try to lift up one side of the other because the way it's built it tries to hold the water inside so it doesn't know you kind of pretty much have to try to make it spill in order to make this thing actually fall over as you can see the the edges here are actually wider or not out I wouldn't say wider but the side here is wider than the the opening so it gives it a nice wide base which makes it a lot more stable now as you saw just a second ago if you do push down the side too much it will cause it to spill over so that's one of the reasons I wanted a 20 litre bucket because I wanted to have enough room in the center here to do my washing without banging into the sides all the time because any kind of self standing bucket tends to have that problem where you wash your dishes in it and you bang into the sides and you dump all the water out so I wanted one to head a hole big enough for me to actually work in without banging into the all the time now like I said this has the wire in it and as you can see it keeps everything nice and stable in the rim you know it keeps the shape of the bucket a lot better than you would normally find in a standard kind of sink type thing camping seat sink so let me go ahead and just lift this up for you really quick so that's what its gonna look like if you get you know if you carry it like I said there's 20 litres in here and if you carry it in one hand like this even with 20 litres you there's still enough room that you're not gonna spill the water out so you can fill it up all the way take it to your campsite let it go and there you go you have your your sink with all the water that you're gonna be neat you no need but like I said I've used this as a bucket I've used this for pretty much everything that revolves carrying water to and from camp washing stuff like its intended purpose carrying water to put out fires carrying water for sterilizing pretty much anything that I might need now it does have the black interior and one thing that I found that sea2summit doesn't advertise is if you leave this out in the Sun for a couple of hours you'll actually get some nice warm water in here now this is only about five gallons now like I said 20 liters which equals out to about five gallons worth of water but you can actually get some pretty nice warm water in this particular sink so for example let's say you have a camp shower one thing that I've done is to leave this out in the Sun along with my solar shower and let both of these heat up because the solar shower is only what was it a 10 liters I think so that gives me 30 liters of warm water so I can take my shower my wife can take her shower someone else can take their shower and it frees up a lot of time so instead of having to do one person and let it cool off you know let more warm up you can have more than one showers worth of water all warming up at the same time but that's I mean that's pretty much when I review I've had it for three years it's held up beautifully I used all the time I haven't had any problems with it so ultimately I think that's the definition of success so I think I'm gonna leave it there I mean in my opinion it's worth the money now it is a little expensive it is sea2summit I think I paid about $30 for it but for an item like this that's actually pretty decent that's not too bad but there you have it there's my review I'm gonna give it five out of five still it is absolutely fantastic piece of equipment I so use all the time but there you have it thank you guys for watching as always don't forget to hit like and subscribe and check

steps the other day about shining the sink was that if it just didn't get shiny enough to use a little bit of car wax I am actually using cleaner wax before i go any much further letting it set for a few minutes but i figured my sink is stainless steel the faucet itself is chrome and i'm going to use car wax on it so i actually use to clean my sink I used John Deere slick loss which is for automobiles and tractors and RVs and stuff to clean it and also used the detailer lustra door on the chrome which gave it this nice clean Sparkle and then I washed it and rinsed it really well and I have put a little bit of wax on it here too to bring the shrine up a little bit and the reason I'm telling you all is I've already actually done some of the wax and it was quite disturbing what I discovered so here's my clean cloth about to go down to you know wipe off some of the wax and like I said this is also a cleaner wax oh it does kind of get out any of that Dorothy you might not be seeing or which you don't feel like you're seeing but what's really there yeah so that is you know a rather clean looking think it was a clean-looking st. to start with and so it was a little disturbing I had already done like I said some of the wax and yeah it's a little disturbing to realize that my sink was not as clean as I thought it was okay that for those of you who might have thought it was a little strange i was using car wax on my sink look look how nice and clean and shiny it is and it's very smooth sure that you can kind of see in a reflection this is an older think that's pretty scratched up but I can't even feel the scratches in the sink it just feels all smooth and polished and something that's pretty cool is and get it show you the water let me see if I can get a little bit more water to come out of here helps flashing everything there we go just like when the rain hits your car after it's been waxed the water beads right up and wipes away pretty easy and just dry it right up of course now my thinks dripping huh there we go makes it real easy to just clean the water right out so maybe this will help keep my clean sink shiny in 2012", "kvLwTCYxsJk": "Oh my name is gray Yule from American Standard I want to discuss how to choose a kitchen sink based on the type of material and the faucet that you're installing there are two types of kitchen sink installations the first and most common is a drop-in kitchen sink it goes into the top of the countertop surface and then the faucet mounts on the sink deck the other type is under mount this is a cleaner look but it requires the countertop surface to be either granted or solid surface material so you get a clean edge and then the faucet gets mounted into the countertop itself many people like the look and durability of stainless steel the thicker the metal the more the sink will resist dents over the life of the sink now the way you judge the thickness is called gauge the lower the gauge number like 18 the thicker the metal the higher the gauge number like 22 the thinner the metal if you'd like a durable colored sink pick something that has a glass porcelain enamel finish like cast iron there are other types of sinks available made out of fine fire clay and a resin composite material be sure to know what kind of faucets you're installing the sink will need to have the exact number of holes required to make that faucet installation your kitchen sinks an important part of your home it's worth the time to choose the right one", "OuXGgTn6AKM": "I welcome back everybody to my channel so today I'm going to show you how to unclog a kitchen sink drain so I've been waiting for the opportunity to share this with you so finally actually my sinks been acting up and I'm going to unclog it for you and a lot of times you're gonna use a plunger or if you have you know snake auger or whatever on hand you know in your workshop or whatever then you get you're all set but if you want to try this simple step first you might not need to lug that equipment upstairs or wherever so what I do is to just take a plastic bottle and the first thing I do is throw it up [Music] you're gonna want to throw it off and actually I have a tool which you shoot the water down the drain and called a kinetic water hammer but I just came up with this idea and it it actually does the same exact thing the piece of equipment that I have is almost a thousand dollars so you know you this thing here actually is going to give you almost the same effect so you can use this kind of bottle or one with the wider mouth works good for like a bathtub or a bathroom sink but this will work great in a kitchen for a kitchen sink drain so let me show you so you fill it up and you just get it over your drain like so and as you can see it's stopped up here and you just press down pretty hard and it's going to shoot all the water down the drain and most likely clear it for you so let's try and see what happens okay then you can hold the end and just spring it back up like this and try it again you can hear it shooting the water downstream that's one bottle that we used you can do is fill it back up and shoot it down the drain again you take another bottle since that one's kind of squat fill it up again it's already going down I'm gonna give it one more sip shot with this dump it get it ready and then press down just fill it up I like to try to fill it with some hot water and it's already it's already gone down let's try it again it cleared whatever was in there give it another shot okay pretty much blast it right down put it worked in most cases I'm not gonna say he's gonna work in every single case because you could have you know something down the drain or scouring pads or they're stucked in there or whatever [Music] [Music] then you can just take your brayer just keep shooting it down the drain also now this went this drain went from a complete stoppage to a functioning from functioning drain so let's just have a look at that again [Music] so that's working great now so if you ever get in a pinch and you don't have any equipment or even just a simple plunger just take a water bottle fill it invert it and press down evenly on top and you'll be able to most likely flush out that drain so I hope this was helpful please click the like button and

mendes asked congratulations dave i ran across your video on choosing a sync great information so here i am i love the look of nickel sinks you know that look of quality often found in genteel homes of days gone by my husband the man who watches the budget will not like me venturing in this direction my question will a nickel sink hold up to daily wear i have passed by a video that suggests that copper will come through in time what would be the composition of a quality nickel sink thank you p.s hubby does the dishes and i do the sink polishing well debbie we're gonna get into your question right now [Music] make sure you stay tuned to the end for an update on the stenega virginia house welcome back remodelites to another episode of quick tip tuesday where i dive into your questions comments and concerns if you're new here my name is dave with remodel media and my mission in life is to eliminate regret and i do that by bringing you the latest tips tricks and products for your home remodel so if you're new here make sure to hit that subscribe button and the bell for notifications so you never miss an episode now debbie your question is rather open-ended but i'll try and address it completely so debbie to start with we're going to address first some vocabulary and then we're going to get into some tips so debbie you mentioned genteel design for folks who might not be familiar with that think of something from maybe the early 1900s the late 1800s think antebellum south plantations think frilly curtains and something that might be considered even like a high-end rustic one and you're gonna start to form an idea of what that genteel design means and when you're talking about nickel i'm assuming that you're talking about brushed nickel brushed nickel being the most common finish that you will see in kitchen sinks and faucets brushed nickel is a way of plating a metal so it looks like stainless steel now typically what comes to my mind when somebody brings this up is some sort of a hammered nickel or a hammered stainless sink and i want to go over some options with you right now now certainly the first and probably the most expensive option is going to be from a company called native trails this sink is going to be a copper with a brushed nickel plating meaning that since it is copper it can turn green around the drain and you're right it is possible with enough time the copper will start to show through however that is definitely a very long time for that probably the most common sink is going to be the farmhouse 30 in brush nickel which has an msrp of 39.98 however you can pick it up on amazon for 29.90 us dollars at the time of this report however many customers tend to tell me that native trails prices tend to be outside their budget range for these purposes i like to bring out brands like thompson traders an american brand that specializes in copper very much like native trails does however their prices tend to be a lot more reasonable they also have a hammered stainless which you can pick this up for a little over a thousand us dollars and hammered stainless can be a great alternative to hammered copper with a brushed nickel plating not only is it the finish going to last a lot longer but also the price is going to be a lot lower i hope that information helps you out go ahead and let me know in the comments below what kind of sink do you have what do you wish you had if you could replace your kitchen sink would you replace it with copper as always there will be links down below for the products that we discussed today let me know if you have any questions i just want to record a quick update as well for you folks who are following along on the stenega virginia remodel road trip saga as you may know

"9VYShZ-W4z4": "hello I am kami from the blog tidbits with the rise of our options there seems to be a great debate on kitchen sinks which is better a single basin or a double basin sink now of course it comes down to personal preference but I'm here today to tell you the five reasons I adore my large single basin sink [Music] I've always been a double basin kind of gal mostly because that's what was in all the houses that we've owned and I just grew up that way you watched in one side rinsed in the other if they got filled with dirty dishes you just took them out and proceeded to rinse and wash the dishes I really knew nothing else now it wasn't until we remodeled our RV that I actually tried a large single basin sink it was this super durable blanco silgranit sink it made sense to get the biggest sink as we could for that small space to accommodate as much stashing in a washing area as possible we even bathed a little one in there now what I didn't expect was to discover how much I loved it when it came time to piss pick a sink for our new pole barn home I knew I wanted a large single basin sink so here are the reasons that I love it first of all this big beautiful sink is a show stopper and medley a beautiful sink is what drew me to this 36 inch blanco fire clay apron front sink in the first place I think it's stunning and absolutely beautiful I love the clean lines the texture of the polished fire clay and the simple nature of the design in truth as a blogger and a designer this was pretty important for me it fits the kitchen so well and I'm just imagining all the lovely flower sink shops I can get and how perfect a little towel looks draped over the front but of course something as important as the kitchen sink we can't rely on looks alone so let's talk about how it functions from day to day so the second reason I love my large single basin sink is how well it hides and stashes the dirty dishes now I'm a busy work from home on a four and I can't possibly keep up with dishes all day every day but I don't necessarily like to leave them stacked all over the countertops at all times until I can get to them now I am sure each family is different but my husband grew up and they stack the dishes inside the sink when I grew up we always put dirty dishes to the side on the countertop no as you can imagine we have some disagreements for what is the best method my biggest beef with stacking dishes inside the sink is that you can't even get to your sink to wash the dishes or if you need to fill the basin up with soap you have to remove all those yucky dishes that you just tossed in there or if you need to strain or rinse some produce you have all those dirty slamming dishes in the way but I don't like them covering the countertop either so what's the gal to do now with this little plastic tub and the large single basement sink I have found the best of both worlds dirty dishes get crowded inside this tub that just sits perfectly to the side of arsing I can even cancel them between with this made to fit cutting board when I have it out there is plenty of room left in this big seam to rinse to strain and to use this sink while those dirty dishes actually sit in there now if I need more sink space I simply remove the tub and just did it on the countertop a lot easier than removing all your dirty dishes now typically the majority of our dirty dishes sit nice and tidy inside this tub until they're ready to be loaded in the dishwasher or to be hand-washed quickly right inside that tub now I find this method than a double basin because I can move it out of the way we need it and can quickly dump or drain the water and it does a much better job corralling the small dirty dishes if I'm actually craving a completely perfect thing I'll just take this tub and tuck it in the cupboard underneath the sink but for the most part it just lives right here okay the third reason I love this big stink it easily washes big pots and pans sometimes you find yourself with large sheet pans or stock pots or even multiple pots and pans that need to soak and be scrubbed having two smaller faces makes this task a bit tricky as you have to kind of tip and rotate them but having a single large Basin sink makes this task so much easier I can fit multiple dirty pans in there to be scrubbed I can lay sheet pans all the way flat down and let them soak if I need to and it's especially nice when I have my biggest heavy cast-iron pan I can just lay it down flat and scrub it now this is such a nice perk of the large single basin that I really don't think I could ever go back reason number four there is room for multitasking so what if I have dirty dishes in my tub large pans that need to soak and say steamed veggies that need to drain and guess what you can do all of that at once nine times out of ten my big single basin is multitasking for me which is a beautiful thing it is large enough to handle all of the needs of a very busy kitchen I'm often soaking heavily coated dishes and hand washing at the same time this is something that I could never do with my smaller double basin sinks and I was constantly moving around those dirty yucky dishes then there are the added fits of sink accessories that come with this big stink like be able to use the made to fit cutting board surface right inside the sink and drying a few dishes in the sink with this made to fit drying the rack okay reason number five you can conserve water soap and time no in truth I thought a large single basin would actually use way more soap and water I thought this would be the major downside now if you're used to filling up your sink with soapy water to do any hand washing like I was you can imagine that feeling this large Basin with soap and water would take a lot of soap and water and then it would get really murky and you would have to drain it and fill it again but I have discovered that I rarely use the same like that anymore and it's a beautiful thing once I fill out the dishwasher then there are the larger dishes that are left to be hand washed now rather than filling up the entire sink with water and soap I simply add a small amount of water to the larger pots and pans a had a dab of soap give it a quick scrub and rinse it off if that soapy water isn't too soiled I'll actually just pour it into the next pan and reuse it or I will add a small amount of water and soap just to the plastic tub and hand wash as many dishes as I can right inside of there do a quick rinse and leave it up to dry and if I need fresh water I can quickly just dump and add a bit of soap and water again I've been amazed to find out how this makes dishes go quicker and I use less water and soap than I ever have before so there you have it those are my five reasons I love my single Basin sink now like I mentioned before this topic is definitely a personal preference kind of thing and I'd love to hear your thoughts did I perhaps open your eyes to the possibilities of something that you would have never considered before or maybe I am missing the biggest perks of a double basin either way I'd love to carry on the conversation with you so feel free to leave any comments below I'll leave links to the Blanco sink and faucet that we have and I'll also direct you to my post and video all about these lovely DIY but your black countertops that we made with the stone tap that's underneath the faucet finally I know someone will ask how I keep my large fire clay single Basin sink clean now that is a whole other topic that I

from having to pull the entire sink up and we don't want a big bead of caulk left here because it tends to attract dirt and stuff gets stuck to it so we're going to take our tube of caulk cut the angle on it i like just a nice slight almost a 45 angle off there and you don't want to remove too much so too much caulk comes out but we'll just put it right in here hold a little bit of an angle and apply just a nice thin bead of caulk through here now we're going to take our finger kind of smash it down in through there to remove all that excess caulk i actually picked a caulk that dries clear on here because i want to make sure that you don't see it all the time just make sure you work it in there really well remove all the excess caulk i'm joshua clement flighty contractors and we just discussed how to caulk and seal your kitchen sink on laminate countertop thanks for watching and good luck with this project", "4OiQ0T1NcYU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] baking soda [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you friends you", "maRsAPZRzJg": "Kitchen sink mold removal. Let us show\nyou a few steps. Hey guys, Jim here with the twin home\nexperts today we're doing another kitchen sink mold removal job. We get\nquestions all the time how do I identify if there is mold underneath the kitchen\nsink? Well, in this case, you can see clear evidence of massive water damage and\nmold that is actually on the drywall as well as on the bottom of this cabinet. So\none of the things that we get question all the time is can I use bleach/ Can I\nuse white vinegar, baking soda? None of those work. They don't get rid of the\nactual root of the mold. The mold that's embedded inside the organic materials\nsuch as drywall and wood. You want to use a very aggressive antimicrobial. And when\nyou're using an antimicrobial like this they have to use protective equipment\nsuch as rubber gloves, Tyvek suits, and a mask. Let me show you what our product\ndoes underneath the kitchen cabinet. So we want to go ahead and let that sit\nas you can see here it's starting to eat away the biofilm. So we let this sit here\nand a good anti microbial will react this way. So we're gonna go ahead and\nshow you the next shot here. Okay guys so now we've let that sit for about I don't\nknow forty seconds a minute. Take your rag here and it should just wipe off\nhere like this. Okay so you want to do this a couple\ndifferent times you want to do this a couple times but you can see just even\nthe first wipe down when a good antimicrobial will do to get rid of mold\non drywall. All right, so what's that first wipe down is done we're gonna go\nahead and spray it again. Now one of the things to keep in mind when you're\nidentifying mold and treating mold underneath the kitchen sink is when you\nhave material like this that's compromised it's gonna have to be cut\nout bagged and disposed. The other thing to keep in mind when you're doing\nkitchen sink mold remediation as you build a critical barrier like we've done\nhere. What this does is it just creates a working space so mold spores do not\nescape and go into the other parts of the property. The other thing to keep in\nmind is an air scrubber. This air scrubber has a HEPA filtration so any\nmold that's cross contaminating into the earth our air scrubber is going to pick\nit up and take it out that window there, okay. So we're going to go ahead and\ncontinue on here. Okay guys so one of the things when you're identifying mold is\nyou've got to make sure that all leaks, all water sources have been identified.\nOne of the biggest things here is faucets and the top of granite. Look for\nareas around the sink that caused and have any breaches because water dumps\nvery slowly over a long period of time. So side sprays, soap dispensers, faucets,\ncome down here, pea traps, water lines. These are all areas of concern that\ncause the most destruction to a kitchen cabinet.\nSo keep in mind when you're treating the mold that's one thing but taking care of\nthe actual problem that's creating the mold is your biggest source and that is\nthe water. if you've got to stop all water sources.\nOne of the key factors of when you're dealing with this type of kitchen sink\nmold is you waterproof the bottom and put a water alarm. So that way in the\nfuture if you ever do have a leak you're gonna be alerted. Alright folks you're\nprobably wondering what does kitchen sink black mold removal costs? Well that\nall depends you know if you hire a company that's going to be doing it from\nA to Z meaning do the mold removal along with putting the kitchen cabinet right\nback and waterproofing everything. Mold removal for kitchen sink can cost\nanywhere from about as low as about $700 and as high as about $4,000. Most people\nspend around $1,500 to $2,000. So that will give you a little bit of an insight on\nwhat it cost to remove mold. Well folks hopefully this gave you an idea how to remove\nmold from your kitchen sink as always thanks for watching.

sea2summit 10 liter kitchen sink no straight off the bat little bit of disclosure here I've been using one of these since about 2011 in Kenya and as a soup a bit of kit so all you'll get from me today is absolutely 100% bias and there's no reason to be otherwise because as a Kraken bit of kit we also have one to give away to one of you lucky people so what's the rest of the video and then join us over in the discussion forum let's have a little chat about that sort of stuff so what is it well fairly straightforward it's a stuff pack holding a portable water carrier looking in the stuff pack itself it's made of again the same material as the carrier itself 70d a 10,000 milliliter water head polyurethane basically meaning it's probably about three times the thickness of the human here which is about 20 Danny on the bottom here you can just see it has the drainage hole for any water that's left inside after you pack away as well as basic visual instructions about how to pack the cat away and we all love pictures it's a lot simpler for some of us also see to summer are quite an environmentally friendly company so on the front actually talks about how you can use the tenants and mess with the water bottle which they make sure you dispose of it at least 100 metres away from any natural water source to avoid pollution it's a nice lot of better of equal consciousness there on the back you've got your webbing strap that you can use to fix on your belt or on in a bit of kit it's not removable though it's stitched on police but that's good solid stitching not going to go anywhere so in terms of where you're actually on the strap this aren't I can't really think of many examples to be honest it's better off just stuffed in the bottom of our bag so let's have a look inside when you open up it's already compressed with them it's a simple keys I'm just giving it up over she coat to open up fully the black as the inside and that is the 10,000 milliliter what a head polyurethane coating that's governor at the water capabilities you've got two solid webbing handles here these are very well stitched on if you can just make it out there they are going nowhere and again I've used these routinely and repeatedly a full week as well as having them hung on things like branches etc they hold there's no ifs or buts about that you've got tips seams running along the inside again making sure the waters not going to escape out any of this stitching you just see that they are and because it's taped and not glued that means there's far less chance of wear and tear and again 2011 I've never yet encountered any issues with this sort of thing at all to fill it up actually there's a couple of ways you can either simply drag it through your water source to fill it up or because you've got such robust webbing handles what I've done in the past where I'm not being able to reach enter the water supply because it's been lowered down usually over a lot on bankermann good better paracord loops around and you simply drop it down like a bucket and so will pull it back up and this will hold and take the strain off both are fast flowing current with a way of water on it so filling up dead simple all you have to do is just get your possession grab on and drag it through and again not teaching it suck eggs but just make sure you've got a fast flowing and uncontaminated piece of water that's no good seeing oh the waters fast boy if there's a dead sheep 5e upstream from you and that's as easy as that no in terms of the actual amount of water I pulled out there I lost very little because of the stainless steel supporting ring that runs around outside because the base is greater than the neck the water really sets and balance is very well and there and you've got a huge amount of space to what clear as you can see with my hand on it and I have big manly hands again in Kenya for example when I first got hold of one of these it was used for everything utensils mess ten washing foot washing shaving used for cleaning the socks cleaning the skies and the thing and again because it can take detergent that was easy enough to give it a quick scrub out to make sure it was clean and safe to use again it's also very useful as a drinking it F for example you have one of the filter straws at a sort of water filtration system rather than having to work at the source of the water which may not be the easiest you can simply bag up bring it back and again the handles allow you to support on branches or whatever you might have so you can even keep off the ground gave you a bit more space at Ranger admin area it's a super bit of kit guys retails for twenty five pounds from sea2summit don't quote yuki and with the bank and the by what the empty is 134 grams although i have no idea how much it weighs when it's fou and it's available in a 10 liter option it works because it's simple it works because it's well designed and again 2011 till today the one I have is still going so there's no issues there with longevity once you finish with it he isn't with the spazio water and then simply shove it back in its stuff bag and they see looking for the instructions on this one and no I'll also admit that that wasn't the prettiest Park we have ever done just make sure you keep the event cleared as we also fighters might suppose run it through the water source once you're finished but the other advantage to this says with the stainless steel supporting ring I have literally four stand here oh bent twisted and that has never distorted the ring whenever sticking it back out the rain has been round has been stole and the supporting wrong still you can't even really damage it in that sense cracking better kept outdoors campsites even for your dog bore you note in a boat click your five phones sea2summit called it yuki guys short sharp and simple you can't see much more about it but the next time you go out unpacked your bag and somebody says hahaha your pros and about the kitchen sink you can go get it up here because they're as join us on the discussion forum folks and one of you one one maybe even this one because it's a bit bargain though haha as always folks in the comics question queries please do put them on the website and we'll see you next time take care", "wc-mSHqayKk": "all right how's it going everybody so what I wanted to do here was I want to just take a minute and do a quick review on the Zune 30-inch wide under mount or under counter mounted sink because I couldn't find a lot of reviews on YouTube it seemed like everything was some type of paid promotional review video or that robotic type boys that was just going over everything I just wanted to take a quick couple minutes here talk about this new sink that I got I had some new granite countertops put in I wanted to do a whole new sink setup as well we ended up going with a Kraus faucet here this is about 17 inches high from the base to the top of it I thought it might be a little bit big but it is not it's perfect it looks very nice and sleek and the only other hole I have cut in the granite right now is for the water faucet as well which is hooked up to a purifier right under the sink so the zoom sink that I went with it is the stainless steel version it is the 304 stainless steel does have the small rounded edges on the inside it's 10 inches deep it's actually about 11 and a quarter with the granite that I have let's see the granite that I've got right now is about an inch and a quarter deep so that's where that extra inch and a quarter comes from the soundproofing or sound isolation from the coating that they put in this zoom is actually very good and what I'll do is I'm gonna take the microphone here and I'm gonna get it as close as I can to the sink and just do some tapping so you can actually hear what I'm talking about in terms of that but it's really nice right now I've got the camera probably about five feet away from me so you don't hear any kind of dinging or hollow noise on the water sitting [Music] what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna put the camera nice and close I want you to just see how the sink looks nice and close-up it's about two weeks old now we have not done any type of cleaning to the stainless steel besides just normal soap and warm water since having it the bottom does already have a few minor scratches on it but that is what these grates that zoon provides are four so you can put all your dishes and everything on top of that and you not to do any washing directly on top of the bottom of the sink okay so this is just to give a little bit of a sound test of the inside of the zune sink that does have the great sound isolation i'll start by turning the water on water on now going from the screen to the spray you can hear it's nice solid no echoing whatsoever now for a little bit of a tap test [Music] another thing I'm going to show is I am gonna turn the disposal on right now it's an NSYNC Raider it does have the double grind it's supposed to be kind of middle-of-the-road in terms of sound but just to give you an idea of what that sounds like with this sink on the single drain I will turn that on right now get my water rolling not good one knows about water [Music] as you can tell it's pretty good with me disposal as well as I was mentioning I haven't done any actual cleaning of this besides some warm water and soap the great here is great in terms of keeping it from scratches there were some scratches already on the bottom here I think that happened from some of the installers when they were just doing some clean-up on it but you really do have to be careful at the end of the day though you got to expect scratches no matter the type of sink you have unless you're getting something like a cast-iron sink you're gonna get the scratches also I read some reviews they mentioned rusting on some of these distinct had such great reviews I have not seen anything in terms of rust yet we are not completely drying this sink out every time we're finished with it I try to just because I'm thinking of that rust but at the end of the day a 304 stainless steel material type sink should not rust if it is there's probably some type of defect or you're just doing something you shouldn't be doing but as I said I've had moisture I've had a damp I've had water drops all along the back and I have not had any type of rusting and it's been about two weeks overall I'm pretty happy with it and feel free to comment ask questions in the future here asking how its held up and I will make sure to reply one of the other neat things that came with this soon sink was the accessories so as I'd already mentioned I did purchase this through Amazon it came with a few extra accessories that I was not expecting it does have some mounting hardware which I did not need I had my sink shipped directly to my fabricator of the granite so that they could actually have a template which the sink does come with a template for the cutout they didn't mount the sink of course once they were at my property installing the granite but what was inside of it was this little rack here which is pretty neat they send you some metal polish we already have bartenders polish so that's what we'll be using when we clean ours actually that was for the stove to disregard that but this was a little bit extra I did not know that these were gonna be coming with it what's neat about these is they actually sit right on top of the sink so you have something extra in terms of draining some of the stuff you're cleaning so that did come with this as well there was no indication of that on the Amazon site so I thought that was a nice little extra perk also you get the sweet little canvas Zune bag actually that's not canvas but this is what had a lot of the accessories in it this is the actual sink drain strainer whatever you want to call it nice quality that matches the 304 stainless steel of the Xun sink it does have their branding on it right there which I'm not sure if you notice their branding is on the back of the sink as well but I did not use this since I had the InSinkErator disposal installed so this is just extra but it is a nice deep strain a little strainer insert and a cap to actually seal it if you want to add that water and let it build up in the sink overall pretty impressed with the packaging and everything that came with it I hope you guys thought that was useful and it'll help you in picking the under counter sink that you're looking for again mine was the 30 inch wide Xun I went between this one and the Kraus sink I was really torn between the two I did go into a couple of the big-box stores looked at their options in terms of price you just can't really beat the options that I did see on Amazon in terms of the free shipping and some of the extra accessories this great that they provided that I showed you that's something extra that some of these stores will charge you for I saw some even trying to charge 50 dollars for that and that's an included with this $210 that the zoom costs me through Amazon at the time of purchasing in August 2018 and again I hope this review just helps somebody out there even one person make a decision on going with a sink obviously I've only had this for about two weeks so is not an in-depth use review but it is a short-term review on what I feel the quality has been up to this point and so far I'm very happy and I give it two thumbs up", "QjwZxcsHsJo": "while a sink

"x2f7BnmJZ14": "hi guys hope you rot and welcome back today I'm sharing with you in details out an organization of underneath my kitchen sink now I did this about a year about family but you know the top four years you head on over and see how I did it however since then it has gone to pot I have recently done another declutter in my kitchen as well I've got two of those on my channel now and the ladies while I might receive the chaff wave I'm just waiting for some labels to arrive let me like the final like result and such but today I'm gonna work got under my kitchen sink I decided to leave that in a different video because I was waiting for builders to come and sort of issues on my kitchen sink and they basically wrecked it under there I'm going to show you what it looks like and it's pretty bad if you want to see me deep and organized underneath this thing then just keep watching okay are you ready for the cupboard of gym right now this is horrific I can't believe I'm showing this oh my golly gosh if you saw my cupboard last year you would have seen how organized this was I had like a plastic bag carrier down here I had different like hook things down here and the build is going underneath my sink what seven eight times in the past under a year have destroyed it so it needs to be organized it needs to be decluttered I'm gonna sort have some more storage boxes it just needs to be sorted last year you would have seen and I'll try and insert a shot if I can find one but this is organized with containers great containers that were labeled up to head like a dishwashing tablet a laundry one and another one which I can't remember but it was all labeled up however they were very big and very bulky oh I had a big laundry tin that was it they were very big and very bulky so I've gotten rid of those and I've stripped it back and I'm just gonna keep everything as minimal as possible I don't need a lot of cleaning products I don't use all of these cleaning products all at once there are a lot of just staple items in here that I use but it's just about being more effective with what I've got um I've never been into they're holding a million different cleaning products but each cleaning product does have its own use and ignore the drilling outside and so sorry they're very near done building where I am I'm hoping that in a few months time we will have a tranquility it's not me no more building noises but yeah I'm gonna get on I'm gonna declutter this and then take it all out give it a good clean this is obviously where they've replaced the bottom shelves I need to take away all of this blue film and he'll be all like a clean and then start organizing it and just so you're aware these are some of the bits I thought so I picked these up in home bargains but I believe PNM Selden asked exactly the same price so these like two on sounds and they're like okay no I'm having to use these for a few different bit but you'll see and then I did the same in my kitchen one I also picked up some of these table I had these ones left over my kitchen declutter I'm hoping there's going to be enough like just having these two and it's not that I mean these go out and repurchase more but we shall see if not I may just steal some from some other locations so I know how I want it organized and have none by somewhat a bit later on but yeah being good craft I can get this sorted I know that no prevention but thousands from from Ikea these ones are from my bargains of vnm and the white tubs are from Ikea super cheap and affordable okay let's get up to you [Music] all that I do is wait for you know I'm standing and I'm not breathing why can't you forget the brazen [Music] [Music] back to [Music] down okay so everything you've now made under here so now I'm just going to organize putting it back in in the most effective way I think I'm going to start by setting out some of the bits so gonna grab one of these containers I'm going to move my laundry tablet like right in there but a lot smaller and I don't need anything this big okay now I can get rid of that because I don't like the idea kids can reach so right now and then I'm also gonna grab another one for my dishwashers have it wherever they are [Applause] they're all in there now as well which is about already loving how much better look in another one of these for my dishwasher so I'm hoping all go in say [Applause] it's perfect and then lastly I've got my crystals as well I'm gonna pop some of my soda crystals in there okay so I'm happy with that nice neatly organized now as well so I've got some bids I just don't need any more this is - an old mop so that's no into recycling some of this job isn't over it goes out of date or not so I'm gonna have a look free now so this is my new flora bot it's not very easy Florrie I'm actually gonna get rid of a few of the Christmas vines I don't actually like any of the Christmas one so I think I'm just gonna throw all of those out and get rid of them because they're litter just storing in my cupboard and taking up a lot of space I can see I've got four at the moment if I just keep on doing I've got four more than by then I'm gonna get rid of those providing no more come and make their way out the woodwork all of my folklores sitting there which is bad because they can now go which is perfect so my bits lorries are all in there don't leave me with my last little bit now sorry so anyone wondering this is fabulous stuff it's not five I picked out a bargain and not a fan so don't waste your money on it we're gonna get rid of that hey I've got some so and there's nutria dog I know I want a pound I'm going to leave them up there I want to use those I've also got some colour captured so I've got dr. Beckmann and I've got seems like dialogue once but there's no need for two boxes sometimes we'll take them out and pop them into one box so I may end up having to do some these I think I still need some white one and organizing what I need to do is I think this is gonna be for Wyatt yes there's all my wives they can go in a Baskin go there like so I'm definitely gonna go and grab a white one of these for that but just for the time being so I know what I need then this is my laundry detergent so I always want that front and I always keep this little box here as well this is just got like a couple of my spare thing so I toothbrushes are always handy to go in there and I have like my little sonic cleaner as well back to those in there [Music] what [Music] now I've got things that are very like really orientated I don't use a lot my carpet French that one I don't use a lot I'm probably going to put them in like an order of like my favorite not sure like all of these just as must probably don't get rid of this plastic bottle I use it like a zoflora spray by Akshat break this is some glass ones I'm probably gonna get rid of that [Music] and then I'm gonna fill up my daily basket so it always like to put elbow grease in there I also like to have a disinfectant spray if this decimal one is perfect obviously I hope to have some polish a real spray is always good for like just your everyday basket that you need I am so like a fabric spray as well so pop that in then obviously I have gone back in I feel like I put it put it back in my window and glass sprayed with microwave like in this basket as well I don't need my stainless steel cleaners in there so they can go in there like so I also always have mine magic raises although I'm running low on though definitely got some more and then it's always good to have a bottle of bleach as well so I'll pop that in there and without hot some of these blue things in as well it's like although my little duster house my daddy basket and then a dead child spray as well that can go just there oh and actually I need one of these in here that was running really nice maybe it will stop it up there we go that's my daily basket bed and I feel like to have it make the most out of this if I probably could have done I'm not quite sure how it's going to work for space and only if I can get all my long new products in this one here let's have a look see I can do them and if it'll work baby cries I have quite a lot of laundry stuff let me fab if I could get it all in and then I know that it's like all organized together [Music] Oh in there like so [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so this is the final organization of under my kitchen sink there are a few a little bit as I still want to do so I want to change this to a white basket here and I'm gonna label up these baskets here here and then then ones there I'm also gonna label up these boxes and the ones that are towering in the bag and I'm also just basically gonna work through a lot of these products like I said I've got like three or four different like carpet freshers and obviously I'm just gonna work through like any spares that I've got I've got a lot of a Flores I will probably always have that many de Flores because that's just kind of my thing but then yeah I think there's if you have a products like I seem to have a lot of glass cleaners and air fresheners and things like that leeches and stuff like that so hopefully I can work through them I always like to have an array of sponges just so I've got them ready to use I go through these ones really quickly all the time as I find it they get really like main key and I like using them for things like out in the garden because they've really cheap to pick up then my microfiber cloths all packed neatly in here as well so yeah I'm really chuffed of how this is come out my little like grab basket for all my cleaning is down here as those all the bits that we need just to bring around the house with me if I know that I've got everything and there's other products in the bathrooms and stuff but yeah mine is changing a few little bits and like the baskets and stuff this is so much more all guys and I finally know where everything is again well guys I hope you've enjoyed watching me clean and declutter out underneath my kitchen sink if you have that I'd love for you to give me a thumbs up I'm also looking to detox out our wardrobes oh my gosh I'm absolutely dreading it if you want to see that video comment below letting me know obviously all together in a video and very shortly [Music]", "oaNGNcXlmWw": "[Music] hi guys I'm welcome to my channel my name is Debbie from mom and made easy' and today I'm going to show you what I have going on underneath my kitchen sink if you've watched some of my videos in the past you'll knows I'm a working mom of two kids so I have systems in place to help keep me organized keep the house clean and just keep things running smoothly so underneath my kitchen sink this is what it looks like and I only keep kitchen items under here and this white band is where I keep all of my yellow microfiber cloths if you've watched my videos in the past you'll know that yellow is what I use in the kitchen I keep my microfiber cloths color-coordinated so that I don't use bathroom in the kitchen kitchen in the bathroom and so on you get the idea I have my big jug of Dawn dish soap I got this big bad boy from Lowe's it's definitely gonna last me a while I actually like to buy a lot of my cleaning supplies from Lowe's because they have the large industrial size and commercial products that work really well at cleaning the house I also have a large size of kitchen hands out back here that I used to refill the pump on the counter that to you will last me a really long time and back in that corner you'll notice there's dead space which is totally okay with me I don't like filling every corner I only like to keep what I use and in the center here I have my cascade dish pods this large container again I picked up from Lowe's and I love using these cascade platinum dish pots because they have Dawn dish soap in them I like to keep a lot of dish pods on hands because we do run the dishwasher almost every night and behind the dish pods I keep some cascade platinum rinse aid if you don't like having spotty dishes I recommend you use this rinse aid and again nothing else tucked back there in the corner or behind the products you're only seeing the things that I use on a regular basis I guarantee if I was to put anything back there anyway it wouldn't get used because I would have a hard time reaching for it [Music] moving on to the front in this container here this clear long rectangular container I picked up from at home and I keep my everyday kitchen products in here it almost goes all the way to the back and like I said it holds everything perfectly I've got some dawn power wash in here if you haven't used this stuff you should it smells really good and I only use it when I have a couple of dishes in the sink that I just want to wash real quick and I don't want to make a whole sink full of dishwasher and then I have some mrs. Myers multi-surface honeysuckle spray that I like to use in the refrigerator but when I'm cleaning the kitchen table and then behind the mrs. Myers I have a set of gloves here some rubber gloves that I like to keep on hand and I only use these when I have my nails done and I don't want to ruin them but I haven't had them done for a while so these have just been kind of sitting back here I also keep my method daily granite cleaner I've got two bottles here because this one's getting ready to run out so I've got it back up there and I use this every single day to wipe down the granite countertops smells really good I picked this up for my local grocery store because it's actually cheaper there than on the Grove collaborative website I never like to put myself in the position of running out of my daily granite cleaners so I noticed I was a little low and I went ahead and grabbed another backup bottle and then back there I have a container of my favorite disinfecting wipes I've been holding on to this jug for a couple of weeks because I haven't been able to see any in store so I only use them when I absolutely need to [Music] and that is all the things that I have in this rectangular container very minimal but very easy to grab what I need when I need it so over on the side here you'll notice these three containers that I actually used to have in the pantry they have pop pop tops and like I said I usually keep them in the pantry until I no longer needed them so I found another purpose for them they work perfectly under the kitchen sink to hold all of my sponges to wash my dishes I love these scrub daddy sponges I always buy a multipack from Walmart and then on the second container I use these green and yellow sponges strictly for the kid I'm sorry not the kids that cats bowls these are super cheap and I only like to use them like I said on the cat's food bowls and then of course on the bottom my magic my mr. Clean Magic Erasers so that's all that I have in those containers they're things that I regularly use and back here tucked away is my products that I use when I do my monthly kitchen cleaning not much but that's all that I have there for that purpose and then that's everything that's everything that I have underneath the kitchen sink and the reason that I'm able to keep such a low inventory of things underneath the kitchen sink is because I've got an entire closet that holds all of my cleaning supplies and other cleaning products that I use around the house so I'm only able to keep here what I use for the kitchen and it works well it doesn't get cluttered I don't forget what I have from running low on something I can tell right away I hope this video gave you a little bit of inspiration to get underneath your kitchen sink and do a little bit of organizing simplifying if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and I hope to see you in the next one I [Music]",

beneath them and vapors of comets can go into the staff can go into the tap so what needs to do is as a cold case is when we cache you with more than water we need to wash everything and then leave it idle for 24 hours once that's complete we will take the spout we will upend it and then we will take morning water and we're going to pour the boiling water over the spout and this is the method for constantly that in a similar fashion the urn what we do is we run water for about 10 seconds and at the same time we are going to pour boiling water over this over this spout and this way we have

"9APipUX23jI": "hi there so here you see a nice kitchen sink this think is plastic kind of plastic it's definitely a main sink in the kitchen so some people must have put something hot and greasy in here and really rekted so my objective is to get this stuff off the sink I have tried this pad with Comet and that has not been successful so now I'm taking more drastic measures I have a brass brush stainless steel scotch brite which I watched somebody on YouTube use and somebody said oven cleaner might get off the grease so we're thinking drastic and if that's not enough I have this really really stiff wire brush I'm thinking with oven cleaner this should come off so let's commence and get busy and try this out see how it goes put the phone up here on a Ledge and now we can see that that one spot so I think I'll try the you Scott rates or stainless steel I actually picked up some other stuff too so probably the most conservative method would be to use this bar keeper's friend and the steel wool so let's see if that works it'll it I I doubt this is gonna get it off as I've tried I've tried to deal with this thing I've tried everything well not steal a little bit I've tried I've tried to scotch-brite past and it wasn't all that great so now I've never used this barkeeper stuff it looks like inside like a white polishing compound this is probably not strong enough in fact this thing is dry right now and if I put this stuff onto it it won't really bond with the oven cleaner so what I'm gonna do is gonna use the nuclear option and spray on some of this stuff Pynchon cool to get it off there we go this is a nuclear option this is supposedly a commercial oven cleaner I hate the stuff Wow oh this is gonna kill me open a window there here's the window open okay got the pad here here's the bad part okay so some youtuber goes use oven cleaner and this pad I saw this pad do some pretty good cleaning on a plastic sink so I can feel there's some pretty big scratches in here and that might have worked a little bit to get some of the grease off and this is pretty good it's not it's bad but it's not the worst stuff in the world all bad all right so this pad stainless steel pad is not having much of an effect now what if we try the brass brush and see how that works on this thing might be working a little bit but I don't really see me so I figured this might not work out too well so what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna spray on more oven cleaner I'm gonna put on some of this bar keeper's friend mix and match right there we go and now I'm gonna use the true nuclear option a super stiff macho killer wire brush this oughta scrape off everything in sight let's see how it works [Music] I figured a wire brush he's not gonna make this thinking worse than it is so what I see is there's some black stuff in the foam here which it's probably a good sign so maybe the oven cleaner and things wore barkeeper friend here on to that big mark do some more scrubbing just bad stuff there's a small scratch small problem right there too so I'm wondering if we can get that one off let's try some barkeep a strand on that one there it is try the small wire brush brass brush I can actually put my finger on that scratch and feel it's kind of deep it's with a plastic got damage on the sink so how are we doing there well look at that so it's still damaged but maybe maybe the color is white again so let's see how we do this it's no rinse this whole thing awesome I'm thinking that's a lot better it still has scratches where the pan or pot in there burned into it but it looks better when I scrubbed it with a wire brush so thinking we're still gonna scrub that a bit it's gonna try for this area here too and if that works out we'll try for this this dirty area here which is on the camera yet so I'm coming up on nine minutes I'm gonna stop this video and make a second one okay so hang on there", "p1KHpq8SJj8": "hi I'm Lisa yeah kiss microbiologist and the Consumer Products program at NSF international today I'm going to show you how to clean rubber mats in your kitchen sink you will need bleach and a clean dish cloth step 1 lay the mat in the sink with enough water to cover it step 2 add bleach use approximately one capful of bleach per gallon of water step 3 let sit for at least 30 minutes step 4 use a clean dish cloth to gently scrub away any particles that may have stuck on the mat step 5 remove and dry the mat step 6 drain and rinse the sink and place the mat back into the sink perform this procedure weekly as well as after any contamination from raw meat juices i'm lisa yeah cos and that's how you clean rubber mats from your kitchen sink", "-0amdOUVCcU": "hey good morning guys so my kitchen sink has gone extremely dirty and greasy because I haven't cleaned it for a few weeks and now I think it's a good time to show you guys how I clean the the sink as well as you know the stainless steel rack on top of the sick so if you look over here on the left side it looks super clean and on the other side super super nasty so it's a very very simple trick and you don't even need to use any horrible chemicals okay so all you need is a stainless steel wool those who are great compared to the steel wool the stainless steel wool never rusts so you can use it times after times up two times and you do not need any additional chemical but if you want to make sure the sink is super super clean use some degreaser because depending on what kind of stuff you cooking for example like we cook a lot of meat so it's pretty greasy use the degreaser is a much better option to make sure that you know your sink as well as the rack is super super clean okay so as you can see on the bottom side it's still pretty dirty on the on the bottom of the sink because I haven't cleaned that I mean it did this to show you guys how easy it is to clean the the owner side of the rack okay so I use hot water so I just let the hot water run for a little bit and then ideally I would use two hands to hold hold my sink head and then I can direct the location of the water so I'm gonna put the camera just on me on my little tripod really quick and then just gonna quickly show you guys how I do it okay so only once I left to go and I'm gonna remove the rack and then clean the bottom of the sink using just Stan's steel wool and it's really amazing the war is super cheap I'll post a link on Amazon that's where I bought it I bought a set comes with a few so I used one to cling some pots and pans and the other one I use a delicately dedicated to clean the kitchen sink so just a little bit of the hot water running because hot water helps to get the grease kind of soft you can just going different motions I know it's gonna be probably noisy so sorry about that the creepy thing is you don't even need to use a long force you're just lightly wipe it and then it comes off right away from the Sun and still round it's like super super easy and and you saw my previous videos I actually did a quick I guess quick tip on cleaning the grill rack which is exact same thing sound of Steel all I have to do is you know scrape off all the grease on the on the wreck on your grill and it's so that's good as you can see how fast it is [Music] likely clean the bottom side of the rack and then as you can see all the grease are gone and of course have hot water running helps to you know flush away the grease and that's really just as so pretty much already done I'm gonna just put the Wally all right take a closer look so check it out the rack is super super clean now super super clean compared to the other side which I did a few minutes ago yeah it's that easy so next step I'm pretty much just gonna remove the rack and as you can see the bottom of the sink is dirty and I'm gonna use the exact same method to clean the bottom of the sink okay so I'll be right back okay just have the bottom of the sink I left it clean sterling steel wool and if I lift this little drain it off you can see there are even a lot of grease surrounding this area again exact same method I use a little hot running water and I just start scraping the bottom of this thing and it's better to go with a grain of the bottom of the sink so it kind of looks nice after you've finished but you can do whatever you like just whichever easiest way is to clean the bottom of the sink you just do it and as I'm scrubbing it's already looking super super nice and again this area lots of grease just light scrub so again the purpose of the hot water is to help drain the grease away because the grease gets salty and it gets liquefied and then the hot water helps flush it away okay so it really helps a lot and Wow already super clean okay so last step this is pretty thirty-two and this is Dennis steel and again I'm just gonna back back it's pretty clean [Music] it's really magical all efficient the Sunnis steel who is pretty all right so now the whole thing is pretty much done and I can put my my wreck back on here as well and then we call it a day [Music] look at that all done in less than 10 minutes and if I'm not recording this video or you could finish it in probably five minutes so yeah magical stainless steel wool get it on Amazon and I'll post a link below and it works wonders and if you guys have any questions feel free to ask me in the comment

up to the countertop after you do that do your measurements there is another way that you can do it without even having to use a tape measure takes a little practice but it can be done a little quicker method I learned is used of speed square and push it up against the anchor points once you've squared your sink to the counter then you can just extend the lines out and draw them onto your countertop like this if you have finished countertop just use blue tape to draw on and still square it up to your counter using a hole saw as I am here leave your room in the corner so your saw blade won't cut into the area of the counter practice tinkling you can also use a jig saw to do this I prefer to use a circle saw it's much quicker and I can get the job done more efficiently you can see here at the end of the cut the my sadhas is cut into the area of the countertop it's not going to be covered be sure you always use a circle saw cut your corners on with a jig saw to prevent damaging it what I've done here is I've fastened a few by Ford's to the weights a part of the countertop this allows me to run my saw down it without having to deal with the lip on the counter if you don't do this the possibility of having this fall through when you're setting to damage your countertop to use is trying to build as you can see here that 2x4 held it in place and all I have to do is lift it off no damage to my counter and now I have the hole cut out next step is is to set the sink in it to fit it okay we've trialed fit our sink to the hole it all works squeeze your plumbers putty back and forth your hands to warm it up then begin to roll it out with gentle pressure until you get it about the size of a pencil any smaller than that you're not going to be doing yourself any justice and you'll end up having leaks and what you'll end up eventually ruining the countertop because of the particle board roll it out about the size of a pencil and then drop it in the little well that runs around the edge of the sink pushing it down occasionally will help it hold into place when you flip it over the warmer the putty the easier it works this happens to be a cold day that I'm doing this so the plumbers putty is a little bit on the tight side make sure that when you're applying your plumbers putty that you make sure that you extend it into all the corners out to the edge if you don't have it all the way out to the edge it's not going to seal and as I said the particle board will swell up damaging the countertop and actually raising your sink off of the countertop I'm going to do with a faucet install at the same time I'm sticking the sink in so I'm going to do is roll out some plumbers putty and stick on the bottom of the faucet base even though the manufacturer recommends you don't use it continually use plumbers buddy it's a better seal and it doesn't allow water to sit underneath of the faucet creating an odor that later on you'll end up having to fix because the residents complaining so use the plumbers putty just to be on the safe side it also keeps any water from leaking into the cabinet and damaging it last we want to do before you lock those down tight is to check to make sure that it's straight across this edge right here there's a little beep to our race spot that you want to make sure it sets on like that can you see that and then you can tighten these plastic next guy just like that while you're at it put your water supply lines on tighten these all the way up tight and they just give a good quarter turn that's all you need that won't leak if you look at the little white paper that's on here it says turn them ups tight and then one quarter turn that's all you need okay now we're going to drop the faucet in the sink in all at the same time like that once you get the sink set it set in you want to push it down a little bit to help squeeze out some of that plumber's putty when it's warm this is really easy but when it's cold like it isn't here today and the plumbers putty doesn't really want to squeeze out but you can get an idea what I'm talking about you can see how the plumbers putty is squeezing out of there snap-on makes a real nice little tools for adjusting carburetors it's a socket with a screwdriver in it there's two little index marks on the socket itself that tells you which way the blade is sitting inside that socket then all you have to do is line it up put it in the screw and tighten them up makes it much easier manufacturer gives you twelve anchors for a reason they want them on there to hold the sink securely into place it also helps squeeze out all this plumber's putty don't over tighten them because you'll actually end up damaging the rim of the sink only turn them up snug now that you have all the anchor points all pulled up snug scrape out the excess plumber's putty that is squeezed out as the room temperature changes in the continual pressure of those anchor clamps putty will continually squeeze out until all the pressure has been relieved around it so warn your residents this is going to happen once you've finished your install in the sink take a spray cleaner and clean up your mess you don't want the resident coming behind you and having to clean your messes up that you left for them that's good resident retention the resident should never ever have to clean up after a maintenance tech has gone in to do any kind of work you can hang door hangers on the doors and put candy bars in their bags but good resonant retention is good quality maintenance done each and every time so the resident knows nothing but it's fixed the first time and every time thank you you you", "TkRZ3dr_lMk": "hi this leg is handy man we got a problem with the sink it's clogged today we're going to show you how to run the snake and unplug it you got a standing water so that means any pipes underneath that's the same problem we're going to have to drain this water out of the sink

feet in there now we're going back all we got out is uh food particles and some sort of dirt in there nothing major blocking the pipe and you can see this pipe is greasy that's what most likely caused that clog because grease will especially in the cold temperatures or with the cold water will build up on the pipes it'll cause clog now we're gonna assemble all these pipes back together and check it out first thing we did we assembled the heat trap and we're gonna connect it to the wall out of it we're just doing everything we're not tightening anything up making everything loose so we can adjust it next thing we're going to do we're going to change this nut over here and put a new gasket we are sure the little piece i'm gonna have to cut this lip joint and cut it a little bit bigger we can always cut it a little more always clean it up nice because it's going to catch all the dirt going down the tray sometimes you have to reuse the old gasket if you don't have one if you do you can always put the teflon tape on it so this is not going to leak once again don't tighten it up too much not yet depressed next we're gonna connect the other sink on the stair piece this is the washer we're going to use we are cutting longer so we're going to mark it with a marker all the connections are made everything is good now i'm going to start tightening everything up it doesn't have to be tightened with range hand tight is good you can use channel locks to tighten up that metal style double check now we're ready to see any licks or for this matter if it drains now the moment of truth we're going to turn on hot water make sure all the grease and everything get dissolved in hot water and washed away hot water is not that hot but the good news is draining and we're going to leave it running for a little bit the best way to check if any of the connections are leaking put dry paper towel underneath and then fill up the sink with the hot water and once it's half full just let it drain and see if anything drips down though in our case everything is nice and dry that little inferno tells me that drain is not clogged anymore this is the sign of drainage on fire you can fill it up sink couple of times or let it run for a little while and make sure nothing is leaking down below and it drains fine and that concludes our video thank you for watching please subscribe to our

after every use with a dry clean cloth this will inhibit water spotting to protect your sink avoid cleaners like bleach scrub pads and steel wool which can dull or scratch the surface you can use mild non-abrasive cleaners like bonhomie Gordon's miracle shine Sud soft scrub or bar keeper's friend which can be found in any hardware or grocery store using grids that are especially made for your sink can also protect the finish stainless steel is a material that does scratch over time with use that's just part of its nature the scratches become part of the patina of the sink to minimize the appearance of scratches take the soft side of a sponge wet it thoroughly and apply a mild cleanser like bar keeper's friend to make a paste [Music] rub with the grain of the sink and cover the entire surface of the sink to blend the scratch into the patina going against the grain could ruin the finish of your sink rinse thoroughly after cleaning multicolored stains or residue on a sink are most commonly traced to minerals contained in your water or by salts from water softeners in most cases you can easily remove with a cleanser like bar keeper's friend rinse well and try the sink to see what happens stainless steel sinks don't rust but may appear to rust marks may be traced to one of three sources steel wool pads used for cleaning tin coated steel cans or cast iron pans left in the sink while wet or iron deposits that are found in water the rust stains are not part of the stainless steel they are simple deposits on the surface of the sink scrubbing the stains along the grain of the sink will almost immediately solve the problem for more information on how to care for stainless steel please visit blanco america.com you", "Tm1YicU9dxc": "it's been over a year since I purchased this Revati 32-inch undermount ledge sink and this will be a fairly comprehensive review of it both from an installation and use standpoint there are other Revati sinks like this so links will be in the description for all of these I do encourage you to go visit them and if you do decide to buy anything on Amazon then I get a small compensation in exchange for me sending traffic to Amazon they also offer in the same size an over mount sink and an apron front sink I decided to go with under mount simply because it would be super clean looking the drop in version would be sorry my daughter's learning to talk would be great for beginner installer but I'm a little bit more of a handy person so I decided to go with the underground you could also go with an apron front but that requires a little bit more planning and design and frankly I didn't have the time to figure that out when I was placing the order for my cabinets I would also encourage you to go with a single Bowl instead of a double bowl sink it's just so much nicer to have a large open work area and of course you can also get smaller ones too probably the utility upgrade is not as significant and I do believe they offer different sizes of this sink to such as I don't know 36 38 inch so if you wanted a really massive sink you could do that too but I didn't need a massive sink so I just went with a standard 32 inch sink that would fit in a standard 36 inch base cabinet it was a little bit tight but it worked I guess I'll first go over some of the accessories that came with it and how I use or don't use them here's the strainer basket that came with it you can see we don't use it for the sink itself we have used it a few times when we harvest some vegetables from the garden we will put them in here to rinse and drain but I noticed that the bottom just catches a lot of water so this isn't really like a useful accessory you could prop one end up and the water will drain out more easily then so I have done that it works okay for what it is not really a bonus in my opinion the other accessory that we have is a cutting board and I've used this a few times in here but really I use it almost in it around the right way I use it more as a traditional cutting board than as a sink dedicated cutting board because I'll put this back another cutting board what I will do is realize I put this in here when I was cleaning it I'll get it out just for demonstration purposes if I'm cleaning something really messy I'll put this rack out and then clean the cutting board like this you'll see in the video clip of me cleaning the sink that I use this a whole bunch I thought it was just gonna be kind of useless and barely ever used but I use this every single day and the cool thing is it keeps everything at basically at counter height so I'm not bending over and hurting my back to wash dishes in the bottom of the sink some people might say that this is a really deep sink and you're gonna hurt your back bending over but really I do most of my work here and this is just a collection bin for dirty dishes or if you're cooking you can put like a strainer on one side and have some other things on the other side and then your messy work surface is up here what you can also do is say you have a whole bunch of stuff in the sink that you don't wanna wash yet and the dishwashers running or full and you don't want to empty it or a spool and a needs run well you can wash like a cutting board or something up on here really easily without disturbing anything down there it just makes it really easy to do any sort of work on the sink it's like a multi-purpose surface I also thought that it would be maybe like a little bit weak because they're just stainless steel rods but it's flexible enough that it absorbs any impacts without actually bending a whole lot I mean permanently bending so all of these are still straight so that's that and I guess other accessories if you can call it an accessory is the strainer basket I think that this strainer basket is a little bit aggressive on straining and most of the time I just want to leave it out and anything that gets caught in there I'll just manually scoop out or I can use I prefer to use the handle this stick it in there grind it around and anything that's how mushy will go down through and anything that's not at the end then I'll pick it up and throw it in the trash manually so this aggressively strains things and then it gets clogged and then it doesn't drain so that's that's why I don't like this and then you stick it you pull it out it's full of stuff and you don't really want to carry it over to the trash can because it's dripping wet so you leave it to dry out and strain out there on the side while it's draining and then you have to deal with it later so I kind of just leave this out another accessory that came with it is the plug I use it basically only to clean as you'll see in the end of the use video it works fine it's a plug it plugs it I guess now I can go on to installation now when I installed this with my father we siliconed it up against this Corian surface and I've since learned that this Corian surface doesn't allow silicone to adhere to a too well so I put additional support underneath the sink no child lock I put additional support underneath the sink in the form of blocks that are screwed and pinned to the sides with screws that are just barely long enough to not protrude into the dishwasher cabinet on that side and the other cabinet that's on this side so it only goes through the single wall of this sink cabinet and then I have a thick piece of I think it's maple going across there with a shim on either end that holds the sink up against the counter top and those shims have force on them so that's actually holding it up pretty strong I would actually feel comfortable I'm 320 pounds right now I would feel comfortable standing in this sink I'm contemplating whether I should or not and I don't think I will but instead of 320 pounds you know you could put a a 40 pound dog in there will that be very messy or 25 pounds toddler would probably not be a problem this sink model is Revati rvh 8300 it's the 32 inch sink that fits in a 36 inch base cabinet very tightly on the edges here on the edges here you see where I had to cut out four clips to fit in that's only because of the construction of the cabinet and I don't remember if it came with clips you have to look at what's included I think I used clips that came with a countertop installation kit for Corian instead of what was supplied with this I think the clips that were supplied with this we're maybe a little bit thinner and then one of the thicker clips for the Quarian so that's not necessarily part of the review of the sink but a little bit just a little another problem that I had which was pretty easily fixed is I used plumbers putty around the sink drain which is typically how you're supposed to do them but I noticed after a few weeks that there was just tiny little drips coming down along the sink drain and a little bit pulling in the bottom of my cabinet so I figured well okay apparently I just need to redo it so I redid it and then it started leaking again so what I had to redo the third time was silicone it in place so if you're doing this you have to silicone it yourself this is a sink drain that comes with the sink so other sink drains might not have the same problem that this one did I just think it's odd that the drain that comes with the sink leaks with plumber's putty the problem with that is that the flames on this drain is flat well the sink itself is kind of like cone-shaped the flange on the sink so you put a flat thing on a curved flange and it's just you know it doesn't work but silicone I did that a while ago and there's no leaks whatsoever on any of this as for fit and finish it's still a little bit wet I haven't polished it or anything it's in very good shape I see no rust streaking so it's a very high quality stainless that's not been contaminated I've thrown some things in here fairly roughly and there's no dents anywhere because this is a far thicker steel than most other Steel's you would find in a kitchen sink especially at like a home store I think this was two or four gauges thicker than anything you could find in a home store the bottom is not dented either it's got a few like scratches but that's mostly from cleaning 99% of time we use this the bottom rack is in in fact I don't even really recall using it without the rack in in this Rack absorbs a lot of the impact from dishes so that would be a reason why the bottom is not at all dented another reason this rack here is nice surprisingly I wasn't expecting it as you can leave kind of a bunch of things in here and rinse stuff and the water will still go down so you can rinse out underneath things pretty easily so say you have a stinky bottle of formula you dump it in here and you can pull down your faucet here and rinse underneath all of the dishes that might be in here that are queued for the dishwasher a few other comments that are kind of tangential to this video this is a auxo soap dispenser I'll put a link to it in Amazon in the description and this is one of the ones that I found that actually works and it doesn't the tip doesn't clog up and then start squirting you in your belly so it's great you know we've tried like two or three different types of soap dispensers and this one just works great you can do it one-handed no problem the sink faucet here I don't even know what this is like a Delta or Moen I don't know but it's pull down faucet and that's fantastic for this sink although because of the way I have the plumbing below I can't make this pull out any further or it'll catch on things I just wish I was able to pull it out a little bit further to get these corners more perpendicular but right now I kind of have to spray at an angle so you can spray it with the aerated head and you can switch to a spray also so that's really convenient if you're looking to outfit a sink like this one of these types of faucets is fantastic we went with the one that has a single handle off to the side and we chose to space it further away because usually you're not trying to work at it right here next to it you're you know my shoulders are two feet apart so you're not going to want to reach into the middle here you want to reach out here where it's a comfortable width away if you're standing in the middle of the sink also yes it's 11 months I still don't have any window trim here or backsplash so make fun of me for that please in the comments you jeez what monkey put that on no wait it was me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]

know them snatch you like them snacks oh yeah feel like a little walk up alright come on push over but some jobs you do today you know I got work to do Oh so this is the second floor and it backs up here on the third floor runs yeah who cut it then we'll snake it yeah so this water on the floor here that's you don't know what that's from we'll wipe it off and then once we get it clear we'll run and see why it's leaking looks like it's leaking from the top there okay well that's probably a separate issue let's get this snake first and then we'll check it check the top okay you no problems a common drain if that feeds everything you know it comes up and feeds for a second and third and they're all white off as they go up so it's probably just a blockage on the I'm surprised that tried doing that season out the tolls probably all I think it's got a handyman that he would work with him and stuff 18 you don't grease down there at all the knowable yeah we'll get it we'll get it we just wanted to get some water in there so I can see when I get it clear you know grease too and way down in the basement this doesn't happen on the first wall - no they complain the bottom me any back up mo what the hell is that sick some kind of q-tip something I don't know what the hell it is mMmmm go anyway I saw what the hell that is try it again I don't know I got my whole 25 foot maybe I'll grease down inside there know if it's like a good big lease ball you can go right through it and come back with the snake you gotta do it a couple of times you know what I'm saying I got it I got it must have been like a grease ball there right there because it's going down now I'm giving it the douche giving the old douche now so it's just taking water oh yeah because then we'd have to do the old bail action it's going down now must be greased down in there you don't know maybe the person upstairs is dumping grease you don't know oh it's rentals it's a rental so what do they go for bacon grease potato chip never goes down the drain no good Stephanie yeah well we got it so well yeah that's the best way you get a coffee job and dump the grease in the coffee John let it congeal and just put the cover on it and then you're good for you know six months and then once it gets full you chuck it yeah that's a yes get it John's a good idea talking about the big coffee make sure it's a good

little pool hanging off the leaks all over the place I work but I won't replace it looks like it's a little dull all right I'm seeing weeks it was definitely leaking up top there but it's not anymore

away with Mr direct sinks and faucets the kitchen is one of the busiest rooms in the house and our kitchen sinks to see a lot of daily action even with regular upkeep it's possible that materials like true granite might get scuffed and appear dull today I'm going to give you some helpful tips on how to revive an older true granite sink and remove those unsightly scuff marks let's get started to tackle aged stains make a solution of one part bleach and 15 parts water let the bleach solution sit on the stain for an hour up to overnight rinse thoroughly and then dry now if you have a stain that an ordinary non abrasive cleaner or Lyman rust remover can't remove we recommend using a mr. Clean Magic Eraser to buff away stains and scuffs the magic eraser is a truly remarkable cleaning product for our true granite line of sinks never use abrasive cleaners steel wool undiluted bleach or ammonia based cleaners so to recap regularly clean your true granite sink with a mild cleaner if you have a stubborn stain try a mr. Clean Magic Eraser or a weak solution of bleach and water to revive your true Gannet seat and make it look like new again thanks for watching I'm Eric Dunaway with Mr guru [Music]", "vQSXG7D8Ag4": "adi wires around the globe I wanted to show you my method for measuring and cutting a butcher block countertop for this corner sink cabinet base for our kitchen now as you can see our kitchen is a work in progress we wanted to leave as much of it functional as possible while we're working on our kitchen because now we're a family of four and we need kitchen access at least some of it so anyway you can see that some of it is operational here so you're not going to see total perfection because I am a DIY er and some of this is being done while a functional kitchen is in place so what we're doing is we're working on the section here and you can see that I did some paintwork up there on the existing zee brick that brick came with the house wasn't our intention to put it in there it was the previous owners if it was up to us that never would have been installed but we had to work with what we had to work with so we just decided to paint it and then we're gonna paint all the bottom and upper cabinets this blue right here that we've already tested on one of the drawers so this cabinet you see here has been completed it just needs to be painted and I needed to build this cabinet out in our garage so I could measure off of it to build our corner unit right here so I completed this cabinet first I set it in place and then I started to build this corner unit off of it and the reason I did that was because there were a lot of complex pieces and parts for the corner unit I want to try to get in here and you can see there's 3/4 inch plywood for the bottom of this base that's cut in a diamond shape and it was a very complex set of cuts and measurements for this particular piece but as you can see it's all one piece so it'll support the weight of what will be a cast-iron sink resting on this unit eventually and that's you know got some weight well over 100 pounds so we wanted to make sure all of the pieces for this corner base unit can handle that cast-iron sink so and then I built on this base base frame after adding a 3/4 inch thick piece of plywood here the three-quarter inch plywood over on this other side is off the existing cabinet right here so this corner unit just you know plays off the existing cabinet right there and there's some mistakes that I made there's a sliver that I cut because I miss measured the right side of the floor piece I was off by about an inch but when you're looking at a six-sided piece I'm okay with that and there's a piece I'm gonna have to cut for this sliver down here this isn't a professional DIY video so hey mistakes were made anyway because of the complexity of this corner unit what I used as a template was regular old Christmas wrapping paper what I did was I just rolled out the wrapping paper on to where I want to place the butcher block and I rolled out about yeah about five feet in this direction and about three feet in this direction I have an 8 foot long piece of maple butcher block that I need to cut up and I need to get as much out of it as possible what I did was after I rolled it out and I cut it to width 25 inches to match the width of the butcher block I then taped it in place and then I drew out standard sized kitchen sink you can see it there 22 inches wide by 33 inches long that's pretty standard actually we already have the sink it's in our garage so I measured it up just to make sure that you know I wanted to compensate for the lips of the sink and I wanted to make sure that you know I've got enough room to work with it here so anyway I measured out the sink and I drew a pattern that is going to match how will place the sink and you can see this line here was the first line I made because I figured I was going to Center the sink off of the wall but if I do that I've got a plywood sheet right here that's gonna get in the way the sink now I still we'll bump up against it so I'm going to cut a little bit out here but didn't want to cut too much and same thing on this side this this you can probably see it right there little axe marks where the left side of the corner base is that's the 3/4 inch left side of the corner base and this will be actually where the butcher block itself hands so what I did was I took the 8 foot length that I know about and I measured off that piece wasn't fixed in place and that's why I bumped it out I didn't fix it in place by the way because I wanted to be able to get in here and work if I have to so that'll be fixed in place eventually anyway I measured it off right here 66 inches five-and-a-half feet that way I have an unbroken length of butcher block in this direction and then I measured off the remaining 30 inches two and a half feet to go from the center of where the sink will be to right about here so there's a there's going to be a seam here but it's over where the left side of the corner base is going to be all right so I wanted the seam to the left side of the left side to the left of the left side of the unit for added strength and then we've got a lot of real estate to cover in this direction so we'll get another 8-foot sheet of butcher block for this direction that's down the road anyway what I did then was I measured out the sink area and I need to be able to take some of this area which will be cut out for the sink and put it right here so as you can see I drew kind of a diagram I need about if I remember the measurement was roughly 20 21 inches give or take for the widest point here alright and that's going to be easily taken out of here because of course we've got 2 inches 22 inches here so I can take this semi triangular piece here and get it out of this area that's going to be coming out before we put in the the sink I'm also gonna have some real estate here that will be removed and I will use that for something I'm not sure what yet and you can say hey you know gee you could have moved these pieces down a little bit and just added a piece up here of butcher block for this area from this area that's coming out I decided not to do that because I only wanted one seam behind the sink otherwise I'd have two seams and I just figured fewer seams is better for strength but yeah I suppose you could take that approach and just add a secondary piece here but that was just a personal preference I want strength so there's going to be a fair amount of butcher block coming out of these areas that isn't used here that will have to be either scrapped or I'll use it for future projects but anyway once I get the butcher block cut I will be able to then place it and then start cutting around this area for the sink you okay so here we are I made the cuts at least the first round of cuts necessary to get these butcher block pieces in place and as you can see I got a little bit of a gap here but that's not a big deal because the sinks going to be coming up to about here I really only need to cut in cut out a wedge to fit in this gap right here and then I'll also cut another piece from this real estate that's coming out for the sink one of these pieces will give me what I need to take care of this because I decided after all I'm gonna bring this butcher block back to this wall area here I didn't think I was going to go that far back but now that I'm looking at the butcher block and it's gorgeous I want to see more butcher block so I'm gonna use real estate in here to take care of this gap back here now for this piece up here the two corner pieces that came off these large pieces here as it happens they match up perfectly because they were originally from you know this corner was over here and the other corner was over here and grain matches up so I'm just gonna glue these together and then I'm gonna have to trim things down a little bit so this piece fits after it's glued together to fit in here but once that's glued up I'm gonna then attach it to these sides right here and then I'll have a nice lip coming out over the corner of cabinet and the sink is gonna be right here so all of this real estate I'll be able to use for back here or other scrap projects whatever and then I've got my backsplash now none of this has been fastened down because I still gotta move things around a little bit and get everything just right so I'm probably going to trim down this backsplash back here to get it to fit under the zebra Krait there I cut this piece here and this is going to be fitted right back in this area here that's going to be cut down a little bit I'm gonna also have to narrow it down a little bit here but for the most part I've got things placed okay so I put blue tape around the border where the sink is going to be then I put a mark over here in this very far right corner where the backsplash is that's going to mark the end of the butcher-block countertop and backsplash here is two pencil marks I made make sure that the two pieces Center up nicely you okay we're making progress I the template that came with the sink to make the cuts one cut over here for the left side of the corner one cut over here for the roughly six foot or I should say five and a half foot side of the of the corner this template came with the sink I used it to trace a line or border around these two individual pieces of butcher block and I got the cavity that you see here I just taped it back in place just to verify that everything's kosher and then what I did is I used a piece of cardboard I just stole it from my my daughter's coloring books and I cut it in place to match the piece that I will need for this section down here and I already cut that I just used my table saw and I used a sixty tooth saw ten inch saw on my table saw to get nice fine cuts and that's important because this is going to be the visible edge when this is a place when all is said and done so as you can see it fits like glove right there alright and I wanted the grain to go exactly perpendicular to how the sink is going to be placed so that the grain really plays off nicely with each corner unit and it's a nice straight grain as you're looking at it and you can see how this visible edge it's a nice clean cut when you're using a table saw to make a cut like this you want to make sure that the piece goes through the table stall steadily if you stop for any length of time you're gonna have burn marks I suppose you could sand those off but it's just easier to just make a nice clean even cut I'm still gonna have to sand this down just a little bit because it's a little bit rough but it looks good and I'm happy with that back here I used I used a scrap piece of plywood that actually came off this diamond shape floor down here by my serendipity really it matches back here perfectly and so I just used that to create this piece of butcher block that will go back here and you can see same situation as the front piece the grain goes nice straight up and down actually it's exactly perpendicular to the grain for the other pieces so that'll that'll make a nice pattern and the way I'm going to fasten those in place will be with these zip bolts so I'm gonna have to drill some cavities on all of these butcher block pieces and use these as if bolts to secure everything so I'm going to do that next all right here's the cavity for the sink prior to placing the sink I had to cut two cavities here's one on the left side of the cabinet here's one on the right side of the cabinet these give clearance for the sink the sinks going to go down about 10 inches 910 inches or so and I wasn't 100% sure that I would have room for the sink so I cut these cavities out just to make sure that I've got room for the sink the sinks the actual working portion of the sink the tub itself is about 30 inches across and I've got a little less than 30 inches across this front side of the cavity so rather than take chances I figured out I better cut the cavities now before placing the sink because this sink is one heavy sucker and I didn't want to fool around with trying to place it and pull it out then cut cavities etc so anyway those are the cavities for the sink and now we're going to place the sink okay sinks in place I had help with that by the way don't try to put in a cast-iron sink by yourself you need at least an extra pair of hands to help you but anyway it's in place and now I'm just gonna hook up the drains and the faucets and

sinks and drains are one of the germiest places in most homes to disinfect the sink and drain fill the sink one quarter full with cool water and add two cups of household bleach let this solution stand for 15 minutes then open the stopper to allow the water to slowly drain wearing gloves carefully wash down the sides and bottom of the sink as the solution drains being careful not to splash the

for over 30 years the manufacturing process for us to produce one of these sink we take the quartz and which is the hardest part the granite and mix it with the composite materials helps bind all the granite together so Granite's made from 80 percent granite and 20 percent composite materials this end heated at a high temperature in a drum a compression molded to produce a sink with a wonderful natural stone feel and modern design therefore you get all the benefits as stone without the disadvantages now this is one of our white sinks that this thing is available in a wide variety of colors the surface is completely non-porous so just like when you wax your car the water will bead and run off as it hits the surface silgranit pura d'Or has a hygiene class shield against dirt bacteria which actually reduces bacterial growth by 98% general stains such as tea coffee or red wine they be far too easy for me to demonstrate so I'm going to use speed reduce now feet reduced touches anything can be a major issue so now while I wait for that to dry what else is absolutely dreadful at staining white surfaces curry paste now if this again touches anything can be an absolute nightmare so you're also going to get marks from cutlery pans things like that now I do apologize about the noise and this goes beyond the ecology you have any household sink but I just want to show you just how durable this surface is but now if I give that a rub with my finger you can see that the surface is actually stronger than the stainless steel fault all it's done is wear down the end of the fort now you're also going to get marks in your sink and pans and plates things like that and I wouldn't expect you to do this normal to remove all these stains all I'm going to use is a general cleaning agent such as sip and a cleaning pad [Music] as you can see it's extremely easy to remove things like curry paste and be reduced they just wash away really easily and even with the scratches from the pan and the thought just comes off really really easily so a granite is also a hundred percent non color fading even in direct sunlight and it's heat resistant up to two hundred and eighty degrees there you have it still granite made by Blanco", "ufr2hpkjsxU": "hi friends it is crystal and welcome back to my channel in today's video i am going to be sharing some cleaning as well as a little bit of organizing the cabinet below my kitchen sink has gotten way out of control so i'm hoping to get that taken care of today as well as some cleaning that just needs to get done around the house to get things started i am going to fold the load of laundry that i had washed the previous day it's basically a load of beach towels swimsuits anything from our little weekend getaway to the lake which we had so much fun it was so nice to get away a little hot but you know we made it work and it was just nice to enjoy some time as a family so mondays are all about catching up when we are gone so i'm going to tackle this laundry really quick as well as get a few more loads going for the day [Music] i'm hoping that you were able to watch my previous video which was a home tour and i shared this new kitchen table that we got you all this table has been amazing like it just feels so much more spacious in our kitchen now and it fits our family of six perfectly there's even probably room for one or two more chairs if we had some company over but we've been loving this table i will go ahead and link that video if you want to go back and watch our home tour where i talk about it just a little bit more [Music] [Music] do [Music] if you are new to my channel welcome i am so glad you are joining me for today's video my name is crystal obviously and i am a stay-at-home mother to four kids we live in the midwest and i share all kinds of different content on my channel some of my absolute favorite videos to share here are home decor related i am slowly making way through our home and updating it into more of a modern farmhouse style so i love those types also seasonal decor i share so many seasonal decor videos with lots of them coming very soon and then i also just really enjoy sharing our day in the life videos where i just walk you through record our days at home i would love if you hit that subscribe button and stuck around and joined our youtube family here before i started recording this morning i did put our sheets in the washing machine i will typically run them on the hot cycle with some tide detergent and some downy fabric softener which is like my favorite fabric softener it just smells so good and so now i'm just going to make our bed and i have to laugh because everyone who i watch making their bed on youtube make it look so graceful and easy that is not the case for me like i feel like it is just a struggle sometimes [Music] [Music] i always get lots of questions on the vacuum that i'm using this one is our upstairs vacuum it is a shark cordless and i absolutely love it it works so well it's just so nice where i can zoom from room to room and then there's also so there's a carpet setting as well as a hard floor setting so i will just switch it depending on which room i am in and it works so well and the battery really lasts like i can do the hole upstairs and then i will recharge it [Music] [Music] in my latest vlog i had shared that i had clipped these flowers from my little garden in the backyard and a lot of you said that i should remove the leaves part from the water so it didn't get all stinky and i kind of knew that but i don't know why i didn't do it so i'm just going to tackle that really quickly i'm just pulling off all of the leaves on the flowers and going to just add a couple of more from our yard this is kind of my first year ever really growing lots of flowers and it kind of inspired me i'm already thinking about next year and what i all want to plant but let me know in the comments below if you like to plant flowers or garden because i'm really thinking next year we're going to do a lot of that moving into our living room this space is like our hangout room like and you can tell like there's pillows and blankets thrown everywhere toys all over the floor i mean it's been a lot worse than this but um anyways i'm just going to go through and tidy everything up in here including the marble run which has like a billion [Music] pieces [Music] so [Music] the orange pillows on my couch are ones that i shared in my recent kirklands shop with me video i am obsessed with them i just love the color paired with the navy and it kind of got me thinking wondering if you all would like to see a video of me kind of decorating for a pre-fall like just adding hints of fall colors without going full out fall decor so let me know if that is something you are interested in [Music] one of my best kept cleaning secrets is my robot vacuum i love this thing i use it every single day it basically will clean our entire main floor area kitchen included but it will just zoom around so right now while it's cleaning in our living room i'm actually feeding the kids lunch i will usually get asked if it is worth it or if it actually cleans and the answer is it absolutely does pretty much any time i have it running when i open up the little like dust cubby i don't even know what you call that i should probably know but i do not whenever i open it it is usually full it's crazy how gross and how much it picks up [Music] [Music] i did place a target pickup order for a few organizational things that i will be sharing with you when i get to underneath the kitchen sink there and when i place that order i actually decided to also purchase this glass canister it is super cool it's actually pretty big and it has a wooden lid and i just was really drawn to it i thought it would look super cute on our kitchen counter next to all my wood cutting boards and then i could get rid of this red plastic thing of cookies you know it wasn't really doing me any favors so this canister is so much cuter to look at and it's also airtight which is a double bonus i think and i love it like it kind of inspires me now to always have some fresh baked cookies in our kitchen super cute i do have other canisters that i could use but they aren't clear and i feel like you need to see the cookies otherwise i kind of forget that they are there now on to the organization part of today's video this cabinet needs some help and i think i organized this a couple of years ago it's probably been longer than that here on my channel and just over time like things just get thrown in there and i'm finding that i have like cleaning products stashed in the back that i didn't know that i had and so i'm just repurchasing and i didn't need to and then also you can see this little like shelf liner is like completely falling off it's not attached anymore and it just you know it needs some organization desperately so what i'm going to do is just pull everything out and wipe it all down and only put in the things that i use on a daily basis so i really want to minimize it let me know if under your kitchen sink is as awkward as ours you can kind of see there's plumbing all over the place as well as our big garbage disposal under there as well it's just it's a really awkward space so we're gonna see what we can do today [Music] we do have the little backup pantry closet that i showed you in my home tour video but i basically store you know a lot of our extra food and drinks and small appliances and i also have a cleaning product shelf in there and so i do have some extra space in there to add some things and so what i'm doing right now is just going through everything that was under there and deciding if i could store it in the closet if it's a duplicate that kind of thing but it'll be nice to just pare down what i'm all trying to cram under our kitchen sink [Music] [Music] so gross in these baskets i don't think i've ever cleaned them out so that was really nice to get rid of those and then i'm pretty sure we don't need two watering cans in the cabinet [Music] this is everything i'm going to be taking out of the cabinet the cleaning products will go in our closet the watering crayon to the garage and then these baskets will probably get donated and some of those things will get tossed just because they're gross but i am getting rid of quite a bit of stuff so now it's time to kind of put everything back into the cabinet i'm going to start with this liner that i picked up from target it's actually pretty cool so it's not adhesive but it is kind of grippy on the bottom and it has i don't know i just think it'll work really well in this cabinet and so i'm right now i'm just laying it all out so i can cut the appropriate length of it and get started adding my organizers [Music] so [Music] this liner looks so much better that cabinet has been damaged over the years these are very old cabinets and so it's just nice to cover it up and have like a clean slate on the bottom we do have a fire extinguisher that we always keep under there and so i just left that kind of tucked it back where it's easy to grab and then i'm going to start with this little tiered organizer that i had in there before it's really the only thing i can find that fits with our garbage disposal right there and so we're just going to keep that as is and now i'm just going to play around with some organizers that i picked up from target leaving all of the tags on so i can make sure they fit before you know we take it off and i can't return them anymore i thought this one was pretty cool though so it's like a very slim basket basically where you can pull it out so i was thinking i could put like garbage bags in there and maybe like my dusters or something and it kind of fits under the piping there which is [Music] amazing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it is looking so much better already i have like certain places like i always have my dishwasher soap in that specific place on that stand so i you know there's certain things that maybe they would work in a different place but we're just so used to having them there so anyways tucking the last few products in and we're going to call it good now one little tip of advice if you are organizing a cabinet is to try to stick to the same color scheme it just makes things look so much more clean and cohesive and [Music] organized [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] as i am cleaning up from my organizing project i decided to try to use up what was left of the shelf liner in some of my other drawers in the kitchen so this one is our silverware drawer that we access you know all day every day and the tray kind of it slides around when you open the cabinet door all of the time it drives me crazy i don't know if i'm missing something or not but i'm hoping that this will solve the issue so i'm just going to use the same little gray liner in here and see if that helps out but let me know if you have any other easy fixes i've tried to like prop things in the back that we don't use but it still slides just that little bit to drive me a little bit crazy [Music] so [Music] [Music] so now i have this one completed and then i also went ahead and aligned the other drawer below i had just enough left to do this one also this one drives me crazy but that is going to be it for today's video we were able to tackle some organizing get things cleaned up as well as caught up on laundry it definitely feels so good if you enjoyed today's video it definitely hit that thumbs up button thank you so much for watching and i will see you in my next video bye guys [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "TOyhw69C_-I": "what's up y'all today i'm going to be showing you how you can transform this messy under sink area into a very neat and organized undersink storage solution on a budget so this video will be perfect for you if you are living in a small apartment or if you just have a small kitchen with an under sink area that is very difficult to organize and keep clutter free a good organizational system is very hard to find so keep watching to see what i did to manage all of the cleaning products and to get just everything under control and have it looking a little bit better than it looked before so if you want to see what i did and what products i use to get everything organized definitely keep watching the very first step whenever i'm reorganizing or decluttering or cleaning anything is to just clear everything out take everything out of the cupboard i'm taking all of these random products that i've got stored in here that i haven't used in months and just kind of setting them off to the [Music] side [Music] so [Music] while i was cleaning i noticed that the trash bins had actually gotten like disconnected from the rail so i fixed that and cleaned off the trash can [Music] [Music] now that i'm ready to start putting things back into the cupboard i wanted to use my label maker so that i could decant the dishwasher tablets so i'm just printing off a little label to go and stick on this glass jar this jar is just from ikea one that i had laying around and it's just so much easier to have things decanted so that you can easily access them but you'll see in the end exactly how i lay things out and exactly where i put everything it's always shocking to look at everything that was actually in the cupboard putting everything back in was a little bit of trial and error originally i was going to use these baskets that i got from poundland but i decided not to which again you'll see at the end of the video they just took up too much space and they weren't practical to get things in and out of as you can see this area under the sink is actually really really compact so you need something that does not have high edges so that you can pull things in and out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i ended up playing around with kind of different configurations putting different products to different baskets and i tried to find the system that was going to be the most user friendly so the reason i didn't use the baskets in the end like i mentioned is it just was not easy and kind of comfortable getting the things in and out of them and i knew that if i kept it like that it would just end up super messy all over again so the end kind of configuration of where i put the baskets and where i put all the products i've been using it now for a little over a week and it is still just as neat as the day i did the organization [Music] and here is the final result i'm so happy with how it turned out this was a very inexpensive way to completely transform and organize finally all of my cleaning products and everything that i need under my kitchen sink like i mentioned earlier it is still nice and tidy so that proves that this is a system that works from start to finish it only took me around an hour or an hour and a half to clear everything out clean the shelves and get everything nice and organized in terms of budget it cannot get any less expensive i got the clear containers that you see here from poundland so they were very inexpensive and the basket down below that is either from poundland or wilco but again very very inexpensive and most importantly it's a system where i can actually access the things that i have underneath my sink and bottles aren't getting knocked over when i try to take them out i use this antibacterial spray every single day multiple times a day the main thing i struggled with before was i couldn't access any of my things i couldn't reach anything and so i just didn't use it and it was a big jumbled mess as you can see now everything is very easy to access and to use the dishwasher tabs are probably the thing i use the second most after the antibacterial spray i don't keep my dish soap on the sink so i just decanted it into this little container popped a label on it and stuck it in the back i can access it easily if i need to but it doesn't need to be right in the front because these containers are super low i can just pop things straight back in no fuss as soon as i'm done with them so on this top shelf i've got the dish soap i've got the dishwasher salt and then i've got a ton of rinse aid this is just because my cupboard was not organized before so i bought more than i needed but the most important for this particular container is the dishwasher tabs because the dishwasher is just right here so i can pop a dishwasher tab from this container straight into the dishwasher no fuss super easy so that's it y'all thank you so much for watching today's video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe [Music] you", "dusQ283y280": "often we don't realize of how much of an importance of having an organized kitchen it will save you time less stress and it will

this pantry basket is from Target is narrow and sturdy perfect for keeping your cleaning supplies or random items last year I purchased these stacking bins with the clear lid to see what's inside and it's my absolute favorite bin for keeping our own collaborative replacement brushes and sponges and our oven cleaning supplies there's also a dry erase label area but I place peel-and-stick letters online and you can get them from any craft store also at Target these stackable slim storage containers you may have seen my video of me using them to store my food prep I got another set to use under the sink to store other contents like my Magic Erasers I just cut them into quarters and place them inside stop digging and try spinning this is crazy Susan it's a two-tier crazy citizen by utopia that's adjustable in the center that lets you choose between 5 6 or 7 inches clearance height from the second tier I'm using mine to place my mrs. Meyer soap and hand lotions underneath crazy Susan are my garbage bags and I place them inside this container and it's from Ikea again using peel and stick labels that you can get from any craft store our stainless steel wipes are kept inside of a cleaner storage bin and I love this brand they even have electronic wipes as well below that are my mopping cloths and I usually purchase them from TJ Maxx but only three ninety-nine like I said earlier habits evolve and so does my love for this over-the-door paper towel holder with wooden peg a rod that serves double duty of accommodating oversized paper towels and kitchen towels I've changed up the workflow around our kitchen sink area and added this kitchen sink utility rack the rack is expandable with non-slip handles on the end that has a coating on it to keep the rack in place it has a dishcloth rail to hang your dish cloths to dry the top of the rack we use after having a cup of coffee or a snack and just rinsed and placed a cup or spoon on top to dry it which is better than letting it sit in the sink this cup is great for soaking utensils before they go into the dishwasher and it's dishwasher safe here's another quick tip for

today I'm going to show you how to clean this farmhouse thing especially if you got scratches it so I renovated our kitchen absolutely had to have a farmhouse sink I was determined that I would love it forever and I did until it started developing dark scratches from my cast-iron pans well today I'm going to show you how to virtually eliminate get rid of or make invisible those scratches in your cast-iron sinks porcelain sinks whatever to make your sink look new again we're going to start by cleaning it you can use dish soap or your favorite cleanser and a sponge for a more eco-friendly cleaner put a drop of dish soap and baking soda on your sponge and scrub your sink then add a little bit of vinegar and rinse it all down the drain your cast iron sink should be clean now but you might still have some scratches or marks on the surface that's okay because it's time to break out the Kohler cast iron sink cleaner this is miracle in a bottle pour a small amount directly onto the marks and discoloration use a clean dry paper towel to buff the cleanser into the scratches rinse the sink with water and look the marks disappeared any true scratches won't come out but they will visually disappear this is the cleaner that was recommended by our kitchen designer when we bought our sink I'll leave a link to it in the description below honestly if I didn't know about this cleaner I would have been disappointed with our farmhouse sink a long time ago because it does get a fair amount of scratches from cast-iron pots and pans but with regular use of the cast-iron sink

it's really really bad no I have a that's what that looks like well maybe not she's still not waking that's good it's good a patch number hasn't fixed that one get there it worked", "HFldvbYiP8o": "all right so I want to share with you guys this little trick that I found out actually sometime last year but I I've been on YouTube and searched all over the internet and I haven't found anybody else talking about this I thought I'd share it with you because it's a handy little way to clean your stainless-steel kitchen sinks and it's probably the easiest way to clean your stainless steel kitchen sinks but anyway here is my stainless steel kitchen sink and honestly I'm not sure why they call it stainless steel because it does stain and as you can see it looks horrible and it really doesn't take long for your stainless steel sink to look that way so anyway on here's what happened sometime last year I had one of my drains clogged up and it was pretty bad it was clogged up bad but I went out and bought some of this Drano max jail and really the reason that I bought the max jail was because I thought okay well it's it's thicker and as far as I'm concerned when it comes to unclog in your drain you want something thick that's going to slowly creep into your drains and it's going to kind of hang out there for a while you don't want something just a running liquid it's just going to pass right through and not do its job or not do what you want it to do so so I poured this in the drain and it actually backed up to right above or just around the outside of the drain and it just kind of set there for a while well anyway I just left it for probably an hour and then when I came back after that hour just to check and see what was going on with my clog of course the clog was was taken care of it was all good but the coolest part that I noticed was that where this drain of max gel had set backed up around this the rim of this drain that that whole area right there was just super super clean I mean it was just sparkling clean I mean it looked almost better than it did brand-new so that gave me an idea so I went out and bought another bottle of this Drano Max Jail and what I did was I just plugged the drains poured about half the bottle in each side and then what I do is I take just this brush here and you're not even scrubbing and that's the brilliant part is because before I've cleaned my sinks and I've used all kinds of different chemicals and cleaners and I've used brillo pads and brushes and I've scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed and none of that really got my sinks clean and the cool part is that with this is I can just pour it in the sink let it sit for about an hour come back and and just rinse it out and my sink looks absolutely beautiful what you're going to see here in a minute anyway this brush mmm the purpose in this brush is not to actually scrub the sink but just to kind of work the Drano max jail around the sink so that you can get it up on the walls of the sink and and and that's all you're doing you're not really scrubbing so anyway here's what we're going to do I'm going to plug the drains so that the so that the Drano will hold in place and we're just going to pour and I'm going to kind of just do this for about half the bottle on that side and about half the bottle with the other half of the bottle on this side okay now like said you're gonna take your brush and really just kind of work the Drano up along the walls of your sink as you can see I'm really not not even scrubbing you don't really have to scrub it all all are you doing really just pulling it up getting it up on the walls of your sink and just cover everything up whale and that's why I like this the drain of gel max because it's so thick that when you when you put your brush in it it'll actually stick in your brush man you can see how it's almost like glue and as you work it up onto the walls of the sink it'll actually stay there he'll run down some but it'll it'll stay there for the most part and you can even see while you're while you're brushing it now you can actually see the dirt of the grime and everything is already dissolving just this quickly all right so just make sure you got it all covered well and now I'm just going to let that sit I mean you you can already see a little bit of difference in the sink right now it works really quickly but anyway I'm going to let this sit for about an hour and when I come back all I'm going to do is just brush it one more time and then I'm going to rinse it out and you're going to see the the amazing difference so we'll be right back alright so it's been about an hour and like I said I haven't done anything to it and I haven't touched it I've done absolutely nothing I've just let it sit and so what I'm going to do now you see it's got kind of a haze on it what I'm gonna do now is just take my brush and I'm not even scrubbing just going to take your brush you just kind of just kind of rub that down just lightly you know time and I want to have it appears on camera but like I said I'm uh I'm not even scrubbing I'm just just lightly brushing it I'm not really applying any any pressure to it at all all right and now what I'm going to do um you might want to use a spoon or something I'm not wearing gloves so let me use a spoon just kind of reach in and pop your drain loose well maybe I need a bigger spoon so let's try that yeah here we go all right got the drain loose all right now in the cool part about this is that you may even have a clog that's building up and not even know it but hey you just took care of it cuz right now you've got Drano going down you're down your sink so now what I'm gonna do is just turn the water on hot and I'm just going to rinse rinse it out really good and you may already be able to tell I mean it's a world of difference already and I not even wipe it down yet you I'll let your water get good and hot just continue spraying with the water build up get hot and I don't know that that really makes a difference as far as cleaning your sinks but I know that the instructions for the Drano max is to rinse with hot water so that probably makes a big difference as it's going down your drain so I recommend just use hot water all right so as you can see a major difference already and I'm not really even done yet I still need to wipe it out then rinse my brush off real good all right so now all I'm gonna do is just take some paper towels and I'm just going to wipe it down you may have to go over it two or three times just make sure you get it all up and I'm not even scrubbing in this process either really I'm just wiping it that's it and I'm using paper towels you can use the dish rag or just whatever you prefer I like to use a paper towel because there is a drainer still on the detail on the rag or whatever you're using so these paper towel because I can just throw it away all right so still got a little foam on the sink so what I'm gonna do now is just kind of maybe rinse it down one more time you you all right then I'm gonna wipe it out wipe it out one more time she'll be about good to go now all right and

kitchen sink so if you're getting some odor coming from the drain even when you're not running the water this might be the culprit it's an inexpensive fix and worth trying before calling a plumbing professional some of the things you're going to need to do this include a towel a good light and a bucket and also the J Bend piece so let's get started to do this I'm using AJ Bend with captured nut this came from Lowe's it was 329 so it's a very inexpensive piece and there are a few different types of J bends so you want to be sure to get the one that you need this one with the captured nut means that it has this piece here ready to receive the other pipe standard pipes under kitchen sinks are an inch and a half but also again make sure that that is what you need especially if you're in an older house alright so already to do this we're just going to unscrew from two places the front and the back and make sure you're holding this pipe as level as possible because there is water in here if you ever drop a ring down the sink or anything else turn the water off right away and then come to this piece because this is probably where you're going to find it if you're going to find it so I'm holding this as level as possible and as you can see there's some water starting to drip alright so that's off I'm gonna hold that real level because I don't know if you can see that but there is water in there and that's when we use the bucket pour that out you can throw the old piece in the bucket and get your new piece out you'll start on the front but before you tighten this one tighten the one in the back because that will determine the height out here so we're going to screw that on and then we'll come back to the front tighten the both and you're all done that's all there is to it if you find you're still getting some odor you might check if you have other pieces like this one there might be some gunk or build up in there and you can change that one as well otherwise you're all set you've officially changed the J vent under your kitchen sink and hopefully that will aid with some of the smell thanks for watching and have a great day", "AdmI3PFHnHM": "[Music] hi there today

today I'm going to be reviewing a product that we've been travelling in for the last 18 months and we have found extremely useful and that is the Sita Summit kitchen sink and you might think it's a bit strange that we're traveling with a kitchen sink but we find this to be a really really useful product for washing your cutlery and dishes as an eco-friendly way when you're camping but also it's a great way to do your hand washing in while while you're traveling which has been perfect for us through many many countries okay so I'm going to take you through some of the features now of this and I'll open up so it comes in its own little carry pouch which as you can see from the size and this is a 10 liter one and it also comes in five liters and 20 litres it's pretty it's a pretty good size it's about the size of your hands so it doesn't really take that much room up in your backpack or your suitcase or anything so you take it out of its pouch and I'm just going to open it up now this is this size and that one of the features is is it's got fully taped seams so that means when you fill it up it's not going to leak or throughout the campsite or in your hotel room or anything like that if you aren't going to be washing your clothes it also has a stainless steel stiffening ring around the top which means that when you do fill it up completely with water the ten liters or the 20 liters it's not going to overflow or it's not going to be unstable and you can actually move it around quite easily it's also fine to use with detergent and hot water which makes it perfect especially if you're washing clothes because sometimes having hot water to wash your clothes in is just that little bit better so there's some of the features that makes this really really handy as well as the the woven the woven handles on the side so I'm just going to try and open it up now this is about the size of the 10 liter one and when it when it's full with water just get that touch bigger so it's perfect for washing or washing your cutlery or your clothes now while I think this product is really really fantastic and great to use there was one features I think it did leave out and I think could be implemented maybe in future designs and that is having an actual strap to hold both of the handles as you can see we've actually added this to our so it doesn't come with various strap at all and we've attached it to either handle on either side because we feel especially when it's full with 10 liters or even the 20 liters of water when you're carrying it it can become quite hard to balance and it becomes really really heavy so and when you're moving it from one spot to the other you feel like it's it's not going to be that stable and just by having this strap on it it makes it a lot more easier to move per maneuver around wherever you need to put it so that's the only really downside I think that there is of this kitchen sink other than that it's a great product so in the future it would be great if see to summer maybe did add a full stroke or even one that you can detach and attach if you need it but I think it's definitely needed so it since I've said to you that we do our hand washing in our kitchen sink I thought I'd take you through and show you exactly how great and easy it is to do some hand washing while you're traveling so I've now taken extra bathroom the kitchen sink and I've got filling up with some detergent and I've got hot water this time so good when you're filling it up and using the children trainees biodegradable or eco-friendly dispersion so you're helping the environment I'm just letting that feel that's almost filtered ten liters and I just couldn't fit of hand-washing to do some delicate some socks so that's that's just going to go in here it's also the kitchen seems really good for when you need to give you clothes or some certain items a really good soak and you don't want to take them to do one to get done at a laundromat or something like that while you're traveling so it's another great thing that these kitchen sinks really good for so my kitchen sink filled now put my items in keep them a bit of a hand wash always good all at least so as well whenever we do our hand washing while we're traveling we always let their items soak to give them that extra bit of a clean and hot water is always good for that too once I'm giving them a bit of a wash now I put a manoeuvred out of the sinkage can be a little bit tricky to make sure you know filling in for water so I've got it here as you can see it's staying pretty sturdy because of the middle that's at the top and now I'm just going to put it somewhere else so I can use the sink later on and that is my kitchen sink doing your hand washing so overall I think the cedar Summit kitchen sink is perfect addition for any travelers backpack because like I've said earlier on it's perfect with your camping to be able to wash your dishes and your cutlery and also if you're traveling it's great to do some hand washing in if you can't plug up a sink or you just want to do some quick hand washing it's perfect for that so I think it's a great addition to any travelers backpack especially because of the size that packs down to it's so small it takes hardly up any room in your backpack and it's just excellent to use when you're traveling", "B4wLBEVVlKU":

under your kitchen sink to look like this to this well i'm going to show you how today i always feel like under the kitchen sink is just a lost everything gets stuck in there and it's dark and one of the first things i wanted to do when i was decided to organize under my sink was to add lighting so these are sensor lighting and i'll put the link in my show notes one thing i want to point out about these under the counter lights is that they're led they're rechargeable and they fix very easily they have a sticky back and then this is magnetic this sticks to the magnetic and then this is the sensor and it could be easier i'm going to put a link to these lights in my show notes so you know exactly what these are and where you can find them i also want to point out that this lazy susan is amazing i swear by putting lazy susan's in everything that i organize whether it's a linen closet a spice cabinet and under the sink i put all of this cleaners that i use most regularly on there and it's just a space saver it's easy to grab and go and it's just a no-brainer in my book another little tip i want to share with you is this is a plate shelf that you can get at any home goods store and it just is a space saver also i put the cleaners on there that i don't use as often and i also put my sos pads in a glass container here and look at all this space that i have under here for more storage when i need it it's just perfect it doubles your space it doubles your storage and in my book that is a win i'm not a big fan of having paper towels out on the counter but putting the paper towel holder right here on the on the cupboard door is just easy breezy just as a small little short screw is all it takes on here and they go in very easily thank you so much for following along i hope that you enjoyed all of these under the counter organizational tips i brooke fedigan at farmhouse1820 subscribe here to get all of my tips and [Music] ideas", "e3lUZEm-nlc": "today I'm going to be giving you a closer look at this new kitchen sink and microwave fried kitchen facelift this is mayor product reviews my husband and I have always wanted to redo our kitchen for some big reasons like it feels like a condo sized kitchen dropped inside a large kitchen so let me tell you what I mean by that we've got this dining room area in front of a window and then we've got this l-shaped kitchen you have to walk into that's pretty narrow where all the appliances and things and cupboards aren't in there and then behind that we've got like a dance studio that could be a whole sitting room or a dining room area so with all that space the kitchen area where the covers and appliances are it's just really cut off so it gets kind of crowded and uncomfortable when you've got two or three people back there trying to assist in cooking a meal say at Thanksgiving or when I'm trying to make dinner and my kids are running out trying to grab things just kind of gets in the way well the project that we want to do there is a little bit pricey and we're not quite ready for that financially or for all the chaos of having our lives uprooted by our kitchen being redone but this month we decided to give our kitchen a little stainless steel facelift it was easily within our budget to replace two appliances and really made a difference in the look of our kitchen so little backstory about our house when we purchased our house the previous owners had all white appliances which isn't really our thing we like stainless steel and black but we decided there were all kind of older appliances so we're gonna replace them over time so the one appliance in the kitchen that we needed to bring in when we bought the house was a fridge so we got a black fridge that we placed in there and we moved it in the spring and then come the full time we waited for Black Friday deals and we decided that first Black Friday that we're going to replace the dishwasher and the of so we had a white dishwasher that was really an older model it had prongs that were broken off it needed replaced in our previous home we had just replaced the dishwasher so I came from this brand new awesome efficient dishwasher to a really old dishwasher and it was insanely loud I could hear it running when I was in my bedroom on the other side of the house so that was a must that was on our list to replace first thing so we put in a newer lacan stainless steel dishwasher that looks nice and ran so much better also our oven was a white oven and the door had some kind of problems as needing to be replaced and we got one that had different features that we wanted in our oven so replace that that same year so now we had a black fridge a stainless steel in black oven and a stainless steel and black dishwasher and things were kind of matching more but we had a couple of standouts that didn't quite fit in like our over the range microwave oven was white and looked a little weird with everything but it was still working and functional and then our sink was a white sink that's just split in the middle and not very deep but it was really similar to the things that I had before so I wasn't too frustrated or annoyed with it but for my birthday this year I found this beautiful single stainless steel sink that was really deep in just one big unit and had a lot of features that I really loved and for my birthday my husband surprised me by buying me that sink from Costco and it was awesome it's kind of funny because my uncle came over and said did you ever think when you were a kid that someday for your birthday you would be asking for a kitchen sink know when you're a kid that's not the kind of present you want but in your 30s you're like what do you want for your birthday I want a really large deep functional kitchen sink which shows you how much time I spend in the kitchen sink even when you're not cooking when you have kids you just generate dishes you can walk away no one's been in there no one's even and there's dishes so anyway I've got a larger storage space for all those dishes to land now rather than on my countertop so let me just show you this kitchen sinks you can see what's coming before we get into the other part of the kitchen makeover this is a sink from Kohler and it's a cater kitchen sink kit I got this whole thing from Costco which was a screaming deal I'll go into that more later also I'm gonna show you that kitchen sink really shortly also while we were placing the kitchen sink it happened to be Black Friday and my husband found a stainless steel microwave that would actually match with everything in our kitchen and he had been looking for years trying to replace that but it was kind of hard I was like you know we really don't need another microwave this microwave is still working just fine well there were a lot of features that I didn't realize how inefficiently it was working until we replaced it with this microwave that you'll see in a second not only does it look I can't believe how much better it looks to have a matching microwave in there but also it has other features and I find that it is defrosting cooking and doing everything with my food so much more evenly that I just didn't even realize that our older model microwave wasn't performing quite as well so this microwave is just a game changer for the face of the kitchen and you work so much better this is the over range microwave that we went with from LG I'll have links to this in my comments below and it's got sensor cook technology which actually works so well even just the sensor for reheating your plate of food does so perfectly and for popping popcorn I'm finding like maybe five kernels just usually I have like half a bag of kernels at the end but this Pop's really thoroughly anyway I digress let's show you before and after before mismatched microwave doesn't quite work in between looking sad and on a place without a microwave there and ah matching microwave it's so beautiful I cannot even believe how much of a difference this makes having a matching microwave and our old microwave went on to serve a family who could use it so it's just a win-win this really is easy clean it wipes clean so easily I love it now onto the sink portion of this kitchen facelift our sink for a long time sat in this box right here best sigh at the couch and my dog made it her own personal chew toy so she had practically eaten half at the top of the box by the time we got started this was just her at the beginning but she was chewing on it from quite some time because it was actually a big project to get the sink replaced would me this kind of time consuming was that we are going from a sink with two drains to a sink with a single drain so we had to have the garbage disposal moved to the center and we had to rework all of the plumbing in there to just have a single drain it's before and after time here's our before white sink and our after look how big and large and deep that is we don't even have the faucet on but it looks amazing let's talk for a minute about the accessories that come with this sink it from Costco which was a huge savings it comes with these two eight trays this larger one and then a smaller one which I love it makes everything so nice in the kitchen you also have the catch-all tray at the bottom and a cutting board that fits right into the sink it has grooves in it so it actually sits inside of your sink and you can slide it around from location to keep low key in the sink and it just makes everything really easy to dice things up wash our cutting board and set it out to dry this think really makes me feel efficient you can just put that cutting board right there in the sink I like to use the long white basket to put all my fruits and vegetables and things in there and you can wash it and let it drain right there and then lime chopping things up I just scoop the waste right into a small white basket and it makes it so easy when I'm done I just pick that up take it to the trash can and throw it away I'm one that likes to have a little bin or container nearby so while I'm creating a mess of things that need to go in the trash can I like to put it directly into something and then take it and throw it away so I feel like this is really convenient for me to cut up fruit fresh fruits and vegetables and then just take that waste throw it away and it's so easy to wash everything down to it's just right there and it for me it just makes me feel efficient it feels like it's easy to take care of things I just simply need to wash things out let them rinse and hang there wash that cutting board and put it away and I'm done I'll be attaching in the comments below a link to Kohler sink so you can find it like this I definitely recommend watching for sales and sink kits that you can find at Costco cuz I'm going to show you how much money I saved with all of this so the accessories that I'm showing here that comes with it the colander set the sink rack and this cutting board those three things alone total two hundred fifty eight dollars if you're gonna buy those separately I got my whole sink it for $249.99 it was originally two ninety-nine ninety-nine but they had a fifty dollar sale and I'm sorry that you missed the sale it was a good buy I really loved the tray that sits in here as well so if you've got mess all that food and stuff goes underneath that tray to the bottom of the sink as you can see here and then with the tray anything just sits on top of it so if I'm straining something or doing whatever I don't feel like the things that I sit in the sink are like sitting into the mess and the food and then you just lift that up and clean underneath so I actually really like that and it also makes less of a clatter sound because you're not hearing the base of the sink make noise every time you put something in it of course naturally you would expect your sink to be filled with dishes following any type of meal I do love the huge sink size with this I always felt like there's wasted space with two separate sinks and I really do my main washing just with one side so now I feel like I'm utilizing that entire space it's much deeper than my old sink so all of my dishes and pots and pans after a meal can sit in there until I've got time to sort them out and it does encourage me to get to my dishes faster after a meal because I like my beautiful sink to look beautiful and empty at all times sometimes you don't need an entire remodel to feel better about the space you can just kind of look at it see what would fit in there better I just feel like the kitchen is so much more cohesive now that everything matches and there's so many things about my sink that are just way more functional where I find it easier to do the dishes so I'm always looking for way to make things easier and more efficient so I don't feel burdened by things that I need to do and I don't feel like I need to pile all the dishes because I don't have time for it I just want to clear them out of there and keep this ink really clean and nice and move on about my day you can find this particular microwave and if you're interested on Amazon I've got a link in the write up below I'll also have a link to the accessories for this particular sink so if they work in the sink that you have now you can buy all of those on the Kohler website and this particular sink you can search first things like this on Kohler or you can wait for different things to be available on Costco like I did while this didn't change the space problem of my kitchen area sometimes a little bit of difference and change and matching a little bit more can make the space feel totally better and more functional so if you can't quite do that huge renovation perhaps you need just a little bit of a facelift a little bit of a change even just adding knobs and handles to your cabinets can make such a huge difference in the kitchen thanks so much for joining me here today at mayor product reviews this is kind of a different video for me more of a large project rather than a

I have several different types of supplies here.\nI have an old tooth brush, baking soda, which I'm going to use today, a brush, might not\nneed the brush, and then a sponge that has a double sided scrubber. What you want to\ndo first is you want to totally wet your sink so the soda will stick on the bottom and the\nsides. And then you want to just sprinkle all over sides and bottom, and if I was doing\nthis at home, I would leave it for a little bit and let the soda kind of set. But for\nthe purposes of needing to do this now, I'm going to go on and just use my scrubbing side,\nand just get the soda, get both sides really well. Now, while that sets, you might want\nto go around the, where the drains are, the little crevasis, where the dirt can get in\nwith your toothbrush. Go around and clean that really well, and then come back with\nwarm water, and rinse your sink out, whoops, really well, and then buff, and you have a\nvery clean kitchen sink.

a deal you know so you just got to put it around this top part here right around the seal of the uh right around the where it's going to seal to the to the sink here so i've got to stretch it a little bit farther you just gotta go a little bit longer this is cat his name's hunter he's a big boy he's super sweet though he's like the neighborhood cat everyone's fed him at one point or another big orange orange and white tabby huh hunter alrighty so you just want to put it around like that so that it touches and like i said it's gonna you're gonna have some extra it's gonna squeeze out once you tighten it down as long as you tighten it down properly [Music] see just like that just put it right in there like that you can push down alrighty so now we have to go back down under the sink i actually have to cut a new piece of pipe um for right here it's a lot shorter than the old pipe was gonna be that that was there so uh gotta cut that so that way there we can get a the right piece of pipe in there um so that it's not too too big of a difference and we'll attach it and then slide it down through the top before we attach it together uh because everything's hard piped in here so it's not like i can just take it apart and um put it back in there the way that it is so we'll get that done um so now i gotta push this back up i shouldn't have pushed it down first um i should put this part on first and then give it give it the cut that it's gonna need at least there's no garbage disposal here that would have been a pain in the neck but it's not rocket science as long as everything's tight and there's no leaks then we're uh we'll be good you know but gotta give some props to those female drain cleaners and female plumbers out there that's for sure we'll give you all a shout out because uh there's not too many of us actually out in the field so to those of you that are good work keep it up so you just need a small piece here a tiny little piece of pipe here we go i'm going to cut a little just a little section here literally the smallest piece of pipe that possibly can is probably going to be about there so go a little longer because it can fit it's okay if it's down inside that pipe a little bit it'd just be a pain to get in there that's all be easier if i had a something that i could cut this on so i'm not worried about cutting the floor i guess i could use something else to cut it with but so does those work deeper the pipe i'm just going to use the other the nut that she had existing because there's nothing wrong with that one i just literally had to change out the basket strainer and we'll tighten everything down make sure there's no leaks and uh we should be good to go so it's gonna be a tight fit i mean see i'm getting that other pipe in there that tiny piece that i cut gotta get that that in there and then get the two nuts on there gotta use some finesse man gotta use something else let's get it on the pipe there we go now we'll fit this right up in there and down in the pipe there we go see a little bit of finesse does its job every time just hand tighten this on there hand tighten this i gotta tighten up up here some more i always forget which way to go bob laughs at me every time and then yells at me and says why do you tie your lefty loosey and it doesn't work in my brain when you got adhd and a million other things on your mind the last thing you really care about is right a titty lefty lucy as long as i don't break anything i'm fine get some channel locks tighten that down use these channel locks they have like little they're smaller and they're lighter kind of makes it a little easier and it's just going to tighten down the basket strainer up on the top there's no words on it so i'm not worried about it being straight i mean it needs to be centered obviously but it is it's centered up there good so i'm not not worried about that like i said as long as you tighten it down squeeze out some of that plumber's putty tighten it down squeeze out some of the plumber's putty you know get the job done and then after this i gotta go and do a kitchen sink line and sneak that out get them draining lady called this morning saying that she clogged her kitchen sink over the next town over from us maybe about a 10-minute drive not not too too far not bad go over there get her draining come home we'll call it a day hopefully alrighty that's nice and tight down here we'll come up here take a look see see how it squeezed out all that uh extra plumber's putty that i was telling everybody about well you just gotta go like that it comes right off cleans right up nothing to worry about peel all that out you know get all that extra plumber's putty out and put that right back in your little container and she should be good but we're gonna test it we always test even if we're just doing drain cleaning and we have to pull things apart we always test it um so she got a uh a new stopper with this one so we'll put in the new stopper and test the sink pull her up make sure she's not draining it make sure she's not leaking down here start the cleanup process while we're waiting fill her up fill her up fill her up all righty take care of all our trash clean up the floor we don't like to leave messes where we go you know see we don't like to leave these messes a lot of people don't care some people some people just don't care and they just they'll leave the mess you know but alrighty let's shut that off and see if we got any leaks down there ready here we go ready pull the plug let's see you", "_y2exrQsZpQ": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to our Channel and if you're a new here welcome we are more than happy and drill to have you here so if you're anything like me and you have a white porcelain sink you'd love to see it when it's nice and sparkling white but the reality of the situation is is it doesn't normally look like that does it so that's what I'm going to show you today is how to make it look brand spanking new and beautiful like always that way stays that way at least until you get it dirty again but yeah just one very simple product you can use to make a look bring shining and spanking new and if you guys are new to our channel welcome and just wanted to give a little introduction for you guys we do clean with me videos we also do shopping videos and we have twin daughters plus a two month old newborn so you can check out some of our vlogs on our channels so don't forget to check that out and also I'm going to link a video very similar to this one where we did Griesa fied our entire kitchen was and with one product and it worked like a charm I'll leave the link for that down below and there should be one also up at the top alright guys so let's get started so here's the product that we're going to be using is called bar keeper's friend and to be honest I've always seen this next to like the Ajax that you end up buying on for cleaning but I always thought it was just another form of Ajax but I was completely wrong it is actually meant for cleaning porcelain sinks and also cook hardware like pots and pans and such like that so I decided to pick this one up and as you see I have used it pretty fair whole amount and decided to use it for a porcelain sink to see how it comes out and it was the best decision I have made at recent date so this is what my sink looks like now and I know it looks really scummy and really gross but if you guys also have a white personal in sink you know this is pretty much how it gets after like a couple of uses to be honest there's all sorts of marks and stuff on it as you can see here and also on the top right corner so scratch marks and everything from the pots and pans that you put in here and just splatter because obviously splatter happens so I'm not sure how to get this looking brand-new and remove all of that scummy part around the ring as well or using just that one product so let's get started okay so let's start out right here on this top corner so all I'm going to use is a sponge and I'm going to run some water joy just to rinse it make sure that you get any pieces of food that are left over out of the sink and that's pretty much it and then you're just going to sprinkle some of the bar keeper's friend you can sprinkle either everywhere or just on your sponge is up to you and just as a quick note it does recommend that you only leave it on for about a minute no more than that so you're just going to use your sponge or a wet rag or anything to go ahead and sprinkle it all over the place and rub it in and like I said don't leave it in for more than a minute and honestly you don't even need to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now I just pointed the finishing touches on everything spring everything down making everything look nice and shiny and pretty Auto surrounding areas in the hardware and here is the finishing look [Music] all

rich insights I'm Don rich the chief of investments for esoterica Capital Management now the reason for this special edition is that we have just seen a tremendous amount of activity in recent days that we need to pick through and the reason for this is because the markets are nervous right how nervous are they well tomorrow one of my father's favorite expressions the markets are about as nervous as an old boy with diarrhea they feel the sneeze coming on all right now that's nervous and we are seeing that in the axes to day we are we seeing some actions today in on Friday all right I'm going to hit that the the big one on Friday course was the fiscal action was the government and the I walked through the details of that in a follow-up video but the the main action was the president declared a national state of emergency due to the corona virus oh say so what well that frees up about forty to fifty billion dollars that he could spend immediately he could spend it very quickly without the approval largely with that without the approval of Congress he can essentially spend it however he wants hopefully it's effective but it does free up some immediate money very quickly alright so that was one thing I'm Freddie now today Sunday afternoon we saw the Fed make an emergency rate cut right it's unusual for the Fed to have emergency meetings right we've seen two now in the last two weeks remember two weeks ago the Fed at an emergency rate move up and they cut rates fifty basis points or a half a percent and today what they do today well there's three prongs what they did today they lowered interest rates 100 basis points all right so that takes us down to effectively zero the Fed Funds rate of interest is effectively zero now I told you last week this was coming you remember go back and look at the video I told you this was coming and here it is it's called zerk zero interest rate policy we're here alright so that's the first thing zero interest rates the second thing they did is is they lowered the rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed all right this is not the Fed Funds rate this is the rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed it's something called the discount window now historically the problem with the discount window is it has a stigma right nobody wants to go to the discount window because it sort of has a smell of death right if you go there you're in trouble that's what the market's perceiving if you go to the discount window the perception is you are in trouble right they much banks would much rather find funding in the marketplace not to have to go to the Fed Nass board but again the second thing they did today was lower that discount rate to 25 basis points a quarter of a percent are effectively zero now but you know what I I told you you know it still has a smell and smell of fear smell of death to it so what you're probably gonna see tomorrow is they're gonna try to remove the stigma from this discount window all right how do they remove the stigma well I imagine this is already all taking place behind the scenes it's all being coordinated the way to remove this stigma is you're going to see all the big banks right all the marquee names go to the discount window and all borrow at the same time probably the same amount even all right I'm talking about Bank of America Goldman Sachs JP Morgan read the whole list they're all gonna go there once most likely in an orchestrated manner of course they'll never say that to the world but the idea is to get them to all go there and to remove the stigma and again if banks can borrow from discount window for zero then the idea is hopefully that they'll look start loaning out more to those that need it in response to the corona difficulties now why is this important right why is this important because the Fed doesn't have authorization to enact direct lending programs like they did in 2008 think of the programs like the tarp and and and other programs the the targeted lending programs has to be approved by Congress and they were given Authority in 2008 surprisingly they weren't even given Authority initially it was the second and third time they went to Congress before was approved but they don't have that authority today so they're hoping the banks start doing this in lieu of them all right so I said the kids that think they are all in they used all their tools that they have available they used them today all right so the first thing was a lowered rates 100 basis points the discount window right effectively took that interest rate to zero as well trying to get the banks and again you're going to see a follow-up to that to try to remove the stigma that now the third thing they did is they also announced the quantitative easing program right 700 billion dollars not a too small amount right you said I should do some good maybe that'll help well the big advantage to quantitate it easy is the Fed can buy long-term interest rates which pushes down the rate on those long-term bonds pushes down long-term interest rates right makes her mortgage rates cheaper makes long-term borrowing cheaper but long-term interest rates are already really low right they've fallen off a cliff they're below 1% so the quantitative easing aspect of this as far as lowering long-term interest rates is not going to have much effect but remember again we talked about tennis in the last week's video the quantitative easing program can buy anything that's government and shirt right that's their handcuff to do that that government guarantee so that means that they can buy Treasury bonds and they can buy mortgage-backed securities that are backed that are insured by the government so even though the quantitative easing expansion shouldn't have much effect on interest rates it will also allow them to buy mortgage-backed securities right some 200 or 250 of the 700 billion dollars is going to be spent on mortgages right and there's some dislocations going on in the mortgage market the secondary market of mortgages is gummed up a bit right now so that should free that up all right so what's all this mean all right oh and in the forget to what all this means let's address the question why why send the afternoon this this smells of fear right this does not look good well remember last Thursday in the thirsty video we told you to expect to relief rally right and the reasons were twofold one we were terribly oversold and second there was all kinds of rumblings that we this major fiscal stimulus plan was coming trump was a president Trump was dropping hints speaker Pelosi was discussing and so forth so the Markel was giddy about what they thought a big stimulus plan was coming well if you stayed around and watched the news announcements Friday afternoon you know they didn't materialize the fiscal the stimulus plan and in a follow-up video I'm gonna go through the the components of this stimulus plan but they really don't have any meaningful effect at least I don't expect you're gonna have a meaningful effect so why did the Fed move Sunday afternoon because the run-up on Friday was least new in part due to the anticipation of this great package we were supposed to get Freddie afternoon Friday evening it didn't show up all right so the president and the Fed and everyone was probably concerned that we were looking at some markets that we're gonna be seriously down tomorrow and they wanted to get out in front of that so that's the reason my gues getting purely purely Mike my guess as to why they did this on Sunday afternoon but it does smell of desperation okay now what does all this mean going forward well unfortunately it's it's in a near term it's not likely to have any effect right what good are these lower interest rates hell they could give me airline tickets I'm not gonna fly the restaurants you can call me tell me if you get your your fat by 10 here I'll give you free food I'm not going into the restaurants I'm not gotten going to movie theaters I'm not going to country music concerts right and there's a lot of people still feel like me have my beliefs as far as that's concerned alright so none of the packages that were announced by the President or by the Fed today target the problem areas they're not going to help our airline industry the restaurant industry right the movie so you know whether we've got all the schools closed we got the the world is coming to a halt here for eight to ten weeks it looks like so I don't think it's going to have any meaningful effect alright but the there's a silver lining here what they're trying to do is twofold they're trying to keep the health crisis from evolving into a financial crisis all right the health crisis is definitely going to have an economic implication now we all hope that we go down the path that we're seeing in China right things appear to be getting better in China so that means 8 to 10 weeks of this isolated environment schools close restaurants clothes right everything's close 8 to 10 weeks of this will get in front of the virus right that's what it looks like is happening in in China now Europe's just at the peak of the pain right now and they're eight to ten week process they're at the peak of the pain now we haven't even started we haven't even started the pain yet so our eight to ten week process hadn't even started but there's no doubt that the health crisis is going to have an economic impact because again we're talking two to three months of largely no economic activity alright so the idea of today's axes is to break the health crisis from evolving into a financial crisis and my guess is it may have done that or at least started to do that the second reason for debate today's actions is that the Fed used all the ammo they have all right they went all in so if the Fed wants to do further actions they're going to have to get congressional approval and it's most likely going to be easier for them to get that approval once they've already exhausted all the bolts they have so that's my guess for justifying what we've seen this afternoon now will it have any effect on markets again my guess is where the volatility is going to continue the volatility is going to continue because the spending programs the stimulus programs that we've seen so far really are not targeting the problem areas that I can tell it as near as I can tell they may have some benefits further down the road but the immediate problems remain unchanged so that's my take on things so you just experienced the rich insight I hope you enjoyed it we'll talk again soon thank you", "Fh1wYUujeMU": "hi friends and welcome back to my channel today we're going to be doing an underneath the kitchen sink organization video i was able to clean up and transform the space with storage bins that i either already had or that came from the dollar tree so if you'd like to see how it turned out please keep watching so these are the bins that i used i didn't use all of them these are just the options that i had some of them i already had all the pink ones i just recently bought at the dollar tree so they were only a dollar a piece and the ones that i ended up using for underneath the sink worked out really great so i started out by taking everything out from underneath the sink and wiping everything down so i could see what all i had before i started putting everything in the bins and back underneath the sink [Music] [Music] i'm a very indecisive person so i had a hard time deciding what i actually wanted to go into these bins and i wish i had bought more because they worked really great for all of the different sized bottles [Music] [Applause] [Music] so so so i haven't purchased anything from grove in a while but i had one of their metal tins underneath the sink already so i'm just washing it out so that way i can use it to hold on to some dish towels and my sponges [Music] that's [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] i originally bought this little container to use underneath my bathroom sink to store jewelry but i decided instead of having this entire bag of oils underneath the sink i would just take out the ones that i use most often in my diffuser and store them in these little drawers to keep it more organized [Music] now and now everything is clean and organized and much easier to find i hope that you enjoyed this video and will consider subscribing to my channel and give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and would like to see more until next time thanks for watching", "U-0DuzQpPC4": "a little whiter what that thing's almost right yeah she's not with me she's fine one of the people not so once a lot of the dogs

yesterday Wow great response since all that came about we're back in the house I guess I really never left the house but I'm in the house I have listed my son in this video thank you for holding it on the GoPro and showing everybody what we can do with another great Flitz product I'm gonna show you today I don't know if you guys got a honey-do list I do this is probably the worst time my entire life of things I cannot say that I cannot do because I'm stuck here I have to do this stuff guys I'm sure you're with me on this and maybe vice versa ladies anyways enough of me rambling here let's polish house you see me talking about this in the past great for a lot of different finishes but in our house we have a porcelain sink this works for stainless steel sinks and other things as well but you get your pots and pans obviously your cast iron all your different metal finishes and when it ends up happening is you get these lines in here zoom in on that boy see if you can get that okay hope you guys can see that anyways we get these marks in here we also got some staining in here quick product take a little bit your Flitz polish and I'm just grabbing a napkin here from the kitchen take a little bit of this and just start putting it on the area just rub it in real lightly I don't know if you can make it out those black marks and that's staining it's going all the way just that quick flip your paper towel over keep on buffing it off and within seconds it just removed all those black lines those marks from the pots and pans that were in there also I don't know if you can make it out again we're using a GoPro here not a lot of technology right now it'll brighten up the finish for you too and bring it back out to new so just a quick little easy helpful hint with the Flitz polish one other thing I'll just let you know too if you do have some really really stubborn stains grab yourself like a like a white scotch brite pad or this is what they call a four OTT steel wall which is I when you go onto the stores I know hardware stores are open right now so you can pick it up there it's four zeros in a row it's like a number sign in four zeros in a row this if you've got some really really stubborn stains use this that will scrub but it's not going to scratch or damage anything for you so there's my little tip for the day with the Flitz polish cleaning up and restore in your sink thanks so much for checking out the video and if this one goes well stay tuned there'll be many more coming your way [Music]", "gcNQzk7ZwTs": "hey folks that fix it guy here and a little while back i was over at my friend's house i did a basket strainer replacement for him i'll put a link in the description box below you guys can check that out if you'd like but he said he's got something funky going on with it so i'm gonna take you through my troubleshooting journey today and i'm gonna show you this weird thing that i found so come along let's get to fixing [Music] okay so the first thing you're gonna notice in the sink is that check that out they've got a rubber band that is the way that they're keeping this up he said man we have to keep this up or else when you use this as the strainer itself and you run water through it eventually this thing closes and stops up i said there is no way dude like i have this at home i don't see how it would do that but i said okay so what we're going to do is we're actually going to pop this rubber band off we're going to put this back down in here and we're just going to fill it up okay so um we've got this filled up about a third of the way and what we're gonna do is we're just gonna pop this twist and seal let's just zoom in and you just turn it counterclockwise to open it up and we'll just open it the whole way so so you wonder so we ran it one time and look at that it seems totally fine right seems totally fine now let's just leave it like this start running it and just see what happens we run it like this we run it for a while so let's fill it again let's just dump it right here and see what we got leave the water running we're just trying to do some different tests with it see what we can get out of it i mean it seems to be [Music] draining pretty good right i'm not seeing any kind of issue with this yeah i'm not seeing anything [Music] so okay so i think i found the issue if this thing gets bumped just the littlest bit you can watch it move it's actually closing right now and then it starts to fill up so weird so i mean i guess if you get a bunch of debris i guess if you would get some food or something stuck in there it would eventually just shut and then it starts filling up that is weird and it's just the littlest nuisance right man so weird and then all of a sudden it's closed and your sink is filling up with water well i think he has made it effective part because that does not make any sense to me at all yeah you're not going to want to sit there and try to figure out exactly where it is and you just watch it it's like slowly turning as the water goes down there and eventually it's just gonna stop up it's so weird okay if i'm annoyed at doing this for like an hour trying to get this thing to do its thing in a perfect little storm then i know somebody else's these guys obviously were they put a rubber band on it it was a good little fix right they shouldn't have to

one-week hiatus I need a little bit of a mental break to be honest it's been a crazy time these past couple of months so I've been silent on Instagram and here on YouTube but I feel better refreshed I spent a lot of family time and just relaxing and not worrying about any type of work and no housework did we do although we have a lot of renovations still to do a lot of unpacking to do and kind of just push it to the side and we enjoy time with each other so today is going to be an exciting video because I'm going to share with you guys some tips and tricks on how to pick the perfect farmhouse sink and make sure you stay tuned to the end because I will also be doing a little kitchen sneak peek we are not 100% done but almost there so from the last time I showed it to you there have been plenty of changes that I make safe to share with you guys I'll have an overall tour so you can see what everything looks like judging by my last house update by the comments you guys are just as obsessed with my farmhouse sink as I am I'm going to be including some before shot so you can see what the kitchen was like before huge huge transformation that's literally an understatement and you'll see what it was before the sad excuse of the sink that used to be there as well as the kitchen that we totally designed and it did ourselves this whole house was DIY no exaggeration and honestly it took me probably four months of research I was up to like 1:00 in the morning seeing what would be the perfect sink for me narrowed it down to the sink ology bradstreet white fire clay sink I love it you guys I reached out to sink ology once an hour down the one that I thought would be perfect to me they were so kind as to send one ounce means I am going to be narrowing it down to the top three things that helped me decide which I hope also helps those of you that are in the market for a new sink and that is going to be durability cost and of course aesthetic so without further ado let's get right into today's video [Music] the first thing in deciding when it comes to picking up the farmhouse think that's going to work for you is actually going to be durability I have a toddler so that was really important for me we planned how many more kids so I knew I wanted something that was going to look beautiful but it also needed to last around my toddler it's gonna be throwing Forks in there or plastic cups and then you need to make sure that it was going to be something that I don't have to stress about and worry if she's going to be ruining it or someone that's using my sink like my husband's usually not the most careful in there so what I loved about this farmhouse think it is a fire clay sink so there is absolutely guaranteed you guys no chipping no scratching and no staining you don't know what a big deal that is for me I not only get to have a beautiful apron-front farmhouse think but I don't have to deal with the stress of worrying about it getting ruined and how you have some like extensive care routine so always make sure depending on the lifestyle that you have that is going to be suited for your lifestyle and if farmhouse think if white isn't your particular thing sing ecology does have a wide array of options different sizes drop ins copper sinks so tons of things for you guys to choose from so that's what I really loved about it I knew I wanted a farmhouse sink but I was worried honestly when I first started looking into them they're going to be something that lasts for me so this one you do not need to worry about any of those things and as I mentioned a write on their website you can see it is a guarantee that is not going to chip stain or anything like that now on to the second thing that's really important when I was researching for my perfect farmhouse sink was cost cost can be extremely expensive when I first looked into them I honestly almost opted out of getting a farmhouse sink because I felt like it just was not in our budget they were just way too expensive I wanted something that was going to look beautiful I have always dreams of having a farmhouse sink but I didn't want to be out of budget since we're renovating an entire house things were quickly adding up so this one retails for only $4.99 which if you guys have been in the market and have done a little bit of research on your own I'm sure you seeing that this is a very affordable option you can easily find the psychology farmhouse things right on homedepot.com so they're easy to shop which I loved you can see all the options that they have different sizes to see if it's going to work for you and you know I'm always about beauty on a budget so I love finding options that I can have in my home that are going to be beautiful but I either need to get a sale on it or it needs to be marked at a really great price for me to logically feel like it's a good option to be able to place in my home so I want something that's going to last me of course and then be in a very budget-friendly price point with families it's great to have a nice deep sink like this so if it's at a price point where you can definitely afford it then I think it works out for everyone you got to have something you love at a price you can afford the final thing is going to be aesthetic the number one mistake I hear people say is I love a farmhouse sink but I don't have farmhouse style now that is absolutely wrong you do not need to have a farmhouse kitchen to have a farmhouse sink my kitchen once you guys see it in just a bit when I show you the tour it is very glam modern all white has pops of gold in it very glamorous large pendant lighting in gold I have in there and my farmhouse thing still goes it's all white it has the apron front which I personally wanted but if that's not something that you feel like goes with your taste but you do want something deep you can go for ones that are drop-ins they also have copper ones which all my gosh when I saw them they are so beautiful gorgeous gorgeous copper sinks in different styles so if that goes for more your taste if you have like a Mediterranean type of Flair you can definitely do something like that this is like dark cabinetry I think it would look absolutely beautiful so don't ever feel like you can't go at the farmhouse thing because you don't have farmhouse style you of course want to make sure it goes with the aesthetic and the whole design and layout of your kitchen because it is going to be a focal point mine is a 30-inch farmhouse sink so it works perfectly I feel like the size the depth everything just works great for our lifestyle or family and it definitely goes with the whole aesthetic of my kitchen which you guys will see compare it to other front cross sinks I love that the front of it is very classic and simple so I feel like that's why very versatile and able to go with a lot of different looks whether you have a transitional style a modern style you can definitely incorporate it in and it'll still look really beautiful so always keep that in mind and look at your various options don't be so that reminded when you're doing your research and it literally is my dream sing and my dream kitchen so I'm not talking I'm sure you guys are ready to see the sneak peek so we'll head on downstairs I'll be flipping the camera around so you can see all the kitchen and let them right guys so we are now downstairs this is an overview of the kitchen just looking back into like this little hallway behind at my couch area so we have all of our pendant lights fully up then we put the hardware in for over here these are actually cabinets that open up so we're able to have storage like that we are missing one they send us one large instead of one small so here I've just kind of been storing some of Milla's toys this way those are out of the way since we have an overabundance of storage in this kitchen which is really great this is what our countertop looks like it is a quartz for those of you are getting a lot of questions on it it is from the reliance brand and the color is called Lincoln so if you can see there's very minimal veining which is what I wanted and the veining is almost like a grays it's not a gray it's a little bit of beige upholstery twith the backsplash this is what the hardware looks like I decided to go with these larger ones for all of the uppers so as you can see there as well as the drawers that we did and this gap right here's her microwave which if you can see is right over there on the countertop for now because Mike still has to do a couple of like wiring for it to go in its actual place it shouldn't bother me having a huge microwave there but probably this week we'll be tackling that and then here is our backsplash I absolutely love it we have not yet routed so it's not yet complete he just went ahead and installed this entire back wall so far and then we still have to do this piece over here so this I want to say this whole section took him two full days because if you can see I'd wanted a herringbone pattern that is a lot more labor of love and takes a lot more time but it is a marble 3x6 honed I know the polish marvel would be like easier to clean and whatnot but I personally love like the honed matte finish same thing the backsplash and this particular marble that I selected it is I believe I can't remember the exact name from now but when I do my full kitchen reveal and everything is 100% done I'll of course be telling you where everything is from the name the brand's the colors of everything in case any of you are interested I know a few of you said you're going to be doing some remodels and you would love to know so this same thing is like a grayish type of marble so it goes really nicely along with the gold hardware since that is warmer I wanted to pull some warmth into the countertops with this veining here and then we can actually add this hole right here is for a pot filler a gold pot filler that I ordered I can't wait to put that in because same thing that's gonna bring a pop of gold to the background like on this end my sliding doors right here out to my backyard and then this is my 18 inch floor-to-ceiling pantry then we have all these drawer cabinets art besides my pendant lights are definitely in my farmhouse sink you guys can see how nice it looks especially with the gold handle here when I'm washing dishes we have already had a tons of guests over in our house I've just been able to be here washing dishes and everything like that while still chatting with my guests everyone that comes over they love this feature as well just because I don't feel like I'm separated I can get the dishes wash I don't put it off so I could chat with my guests I can tackle both at once so that's always great this is the little sneak peek of what the kitchen looks like so far like I said we still have to add the microwave where it's supposed to be finish up the backsplash add the pot filler and then a couple of more details and decorating it all and then it will be complete and ready for the reveal but I feel like this is a pretty good idea to tell you guys and show you what it's looking like I know you've been excited to see so be sure to thumbs up this video if you guys enjoyed it subscribe to my channel so you don't miss out on any other future videos and I will talk to you guys all in my next one bye you you", "yKPD6qMBlcI": "some people make a paste using the baking soda and dawn and I just put a plug the plug that comes with the sink I just put it in there instead of using a separate bowl to do that so I'm going to use some dawn and then you can use more or less depending on if it's still dirty or not I don't measure it out I just put this stuff in there I'm going to use just a little scrubby like this I get inform the dollar store three of them for buck I'm a sink I always get these little streaks of dirt or grease whatever it is and it doesn't come off by itself with just open water when I went in and cleaning the dishes and stuff like that I can't get it off so if you use this picture on there it comes right off here's another one [Music] about 30 minutes later the mixture is not as bubbly as it was before and you can give it a once-over if you want to with the scrubby and then we're just gonna drain it and see how it looks after I rinsed it really good and wiped it down with a dishcloth of course it's clean and then afterwards to shine all the fixtures I just used some vinegar on a paper towel that I pulled it up just wouldn't shine everything give it a nice rub there the vinegar doesn't stink it neutralizes and it gets rid of any odors and I think that looks much better than it did at first [Music]", "A2bytHLuBwo": "okay in this video I'm going to show you how to clean your stainless steel sink with um some steel wool and you can use like still old some soap or you can use like an SMS or a brillo pad when you use a billow pad and what happens with stainless steel sinks over time is that they get all grungy looking to get stained and um if you use like it that's almost paddle get like all the stain mocks out of it and I like it nice and shiny again so you want to do pick it up SourceFed go circular motions and scrub all the grime and everything free you think it'll come up pretty easy we'll take all that long to do you can see all the steam stuff that come out its stainless steel sinks that moonshine tobacco's also this works pretty good okay I go like circular motions go around the drain get all the stuff around the Drano this is get gone nice and shiny down in here the pretty old thing six-five old to go water to it and get the sides you can see how everything comes on pretty easy boy run in and you can kind of focus so going to it you can even go up here get all this later shined up Hey all the steams and grime out of it and get a little shiny we've done take the water wash it all down the always anxiety to think you know for your brand-new stainless-steel thing again if that goes in - by any means is quite old actually looking great by a scrubbing add a little bit of still warm so it brings a fan light back of it take a cause if you want you let it dry by itself well if you want you can take a cloth to and wipe it all down and if you have missed a spike you can kind of just repeat the process on the spot that you missed and now you can see how nice and shiny I think is once again it was a really grungy looking before and that got all the stains out it looks great nice and shiny", "No3kSIydKKM": "Robert: hi I'm Robert this is Sep welcome back to\nanother episode of question and answers with Sarto the topic of the day is the\ndifference is between undermount and topmount sinks Sep: so the difference is pretty straightforward traditionally again you always had top\nmount sinks and that's where the flange of the sinks actually went up over the\ncounter top whether it was laminate granite or quartz and so on and what you had is\nyou just kind of have this lip of the sink that set on top of the countertop\nand it takes up a lot of space on the countertop and it gets in the way when\nyou're trying to clean stuff off now we have and it's been around for a while\nthe undermount sink and thats where the sink is actually fastened to the underside of\nthe countertop with different types of brackets systems which have really been\nperfected over the last few years and what that gives you when you\nunder mount the sink is you don't have that lip going around the top of the\ncountertop and so there's no obstruction you can wipe your countertop off\nstraight into your sink and there's not a lip to clean around and the big thing\nis it gives you so much more countertop room especially the sinks that had that really\nwide flange in the back where the faucets went through you eliminate that and a\nfaucet mounts straight to the countertop so you've gained all that room you have\na lot more room behind the sink and it's easier to clean around you get more\ncountertop space but you also get more sink because you don't have to\nuse up space with the flange you can actually take up a little more\nspace to the actual sink so the advantages are just I mean honestly we\nprobably do two top mount sinks a year and it's I mean very very odd\napplications everyone that's under mount it's a really really clean look and it\njust it works way better in the kitchen Robert: so the reason you would see that in\nold kitchens that topmount sink is because they really hadn't perfected that mounting\nsystem yet is that why? Sep: yeah so when they were starting to move\nfrom the top mount to an undermount sink the mounting systems weren't they\nweren't perfected correct and so undermount sink at first Kind of got a bad\nreputation because you they were kind of in a half done manner mounted and then a\nyear two years down the road they would sometimes you know separate from the\nstone and that gave a little bit of a bad reputation that's been in the past\nnow for probably ten years the mountings really been perfected and there's a\nspecific silicon or glue you use in between the sink flange and the granite\nor the quartz countertop and it just I mean it will go years probably a lifetime\nwithout having any issues Robert: so it seems like most of the customers these days\nare choosing that undermount  sink also because they're you know they're they're\ngoing in they're picking out their stones spending a lot of money on their\nkitchen and aesthetically the whole thing has a better cleaner look to it Sep: oh yeah definitely I mean you see more of the countertop you don't see you know maybe\nyou didn't get the color of your sink dead-on with your design but it doesn't\nmatter because what you see is mostly the countertop you don't see this big\nugly flange sticking up over the countertop Robert: okay there you have it\nanother episode of question answers with Sarto: feel

supplies for the kitchen and the living room I'm going to show you a super cheap way to organize I purchased everything today for around $20 but you can use whatever kind of bins you've got lying around the house it does not have to be anything fancy because nobody but you is really ever going to see this cabinet everything I purchased for the space was from an art but you can find containers and baskets at places like Target TJ Maxx and home goods for a very affordable price before we get started I just want to welcome all of you guys that are new to my channel I post a lot of cleaning and organizing videos as well as some beauty and lifestyle if you'll enjoy it please consider hitting the red subscribe button so you can join this fun community I have started you can expect a new video every Monday and Thursday and I'm always open to new suggestions so please leave me a comment down below with any video ideas that you may have [Music] [Applause] now back to the cleaning and organizing I'm just gonna start by removing everything from the inside of the cabinet as some of you may know Marshall and I are currently renting an apartment so it's kind of frustrating when I want to do all of these home improvements and they just can't because we're under contract I cannot wait to just have my own space so we can really make it our own this space has not been cleaned out in a while so I'm just gonna first use my mrs. meyer's multipurpose spray to wipe it all down and then go in with the Clorox bleach ready to really get it clean as you can see under the sink the bottom board has warped it was like that when we moved in and we just have been dealing it the best we can but I'm so ready to get this space updated Marshall and I picked up these two boards from Menards they were super inexpensive I think around maybe seven or eight dollars apiece so I really don't care if they get ruined I'm going to fit these two boards in here as best I can just to kind of make it more level as you can see they don't fit in here perfectly but that's fine with me I may end up pushing them together and have the gap on the outside but for now I think we'll just work with this [Music] I also picked up this cute hanging shelf for Menards for around four dollars because we live in an apartment I'm not going to screw this into the wood so I also picked up some command hooks that will serve the purpose I'm going to store things like my drain plug along with my mr. clean pads here for easy access [Music] [Applause] [Music] here I'm just gonna try to figure out where everything fits best one upgrade I am super excited about is putting my dishwasher tablets into a clear container for easy access and I just think it looks so much better next I have two bins that I'm going to use to store stuff the gray one I've had since we moved in and the white one I picked up at Menards today for around $2 after looking at what I have I decided to put the main cleaning products I use pretty much daily in the wipe in and then everything else in the large crepe in this way I have easy access to the products I used most [Music] I'm extremely happy with how this turned out it makes me so excited to start cleaning because everything is now organized and so easy to get to I just want to thank you all so much for watching don't forget to hit the red subscribe button down below for more weekly videos and I will see you all very soon bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "AEmlHdJPsb0": "due to popular demand we are back with the dinosaurs will and Ralph we're going to start calling this the Dino series and will and Ralph want to kind of tell you some helpful hints around the home especially a new home and we're going to kind of think of things and talk about things that you might experience in a new home and new construction in the first year or two or three that you're living in it so today Ralph here had an idea that he wanted to talk about and bring to your attention it has to do here in the kitchen matter of fact Ralph's want to talk to you about the kitchen faucet so how many of you have bought a new home moved in and within you know a month or two or maybe a few months or so you notice all of a sudden the pressure that I had at the beginning when a person moved in at my sink has just kind of turned into this little drizzle it's a little bit deflating isn't it well we're going to show you quickly how to take care of it if you have experienced that then what you're going to need to do is pull out your faucet trick of the trade helpful hint grab a pin or a pencil or something to shove up in here so the counter balance doesn't pull this line back up in through the faucet and down into the bottom where you have to fish it back out after you detach the head or the nozzle here so what has happened is in new construction you have new plumbing lines that are put into the home and oftentimes there's dirt and stuff in a new development that gets in those lines during construction and the first few days and months as water runs to those lines it's going to flush out sound little maybe some small sand or some dirt or some mud that gets in that line and where does all that wind up well it winds up right here in the head of this faucet and it will slow it down they can do it it to your bathroom faucets and your kitchen sink mostly your kitchen sink because you're going to tend to use this over all more than you do in your bathrooms and the bathrooms just when you're getting ready brushing your teeth but think about how often you turn on your kitchen sink faucet so if you've experienced that low-pressure just to show you again you can kind of see it's a little deflating it's not much pressure at all it's about the size of a pencil stream and it just not pressurize at all pull the nozzle out put your pencil in here so you don't lose your line and then right here you're gonna see a connector it's going to be threaded so just like you don't screw screw just unscrew that and it's going to pop out and then inside here it's going to be your head bring this up here for you to see and oh yep if you look in there see if I can make that work for you if you look in there you might be able to see some of the dirt and stuff that's in laying up in there blocking is a little screen in there and it's it's a filter and it has caught all that mud dirt and sand in there so what you want to do is just turn this back one kind of low fill this out kind of wash it out tap it on the bottom of the sink look in there make sure you got it good and clean and then just want to screw that right back on the exact same way you took it off make sure this parts clean this will stuff it in there screw it down and turn it on and now you have a fully functional operational high pressurized kitchen sink faucet again guys have you found this helpful leave a comment below if you have an idea for other things that

Patterson with Home Repair\nTutor, and in this video, I\u2019m going to show you how to clean a garbage disposal. So if\nyou\u2019re running into the problem of stinky sink drains in your kitchen\u2014you think it\u2019s\ncoming from your garbage disposal\u2014check out this video. It could help you out immensely.\nSo let\u2019s get to it. The first method that we\u2019re going to be\nusing to clean your garbage disposal is going to use lemons. So take a lemon and cut it\nin half, like I did here. And then cut it in half again. So you\u2019re going to have a\nwhole bunch of half-moon shaped pieces of lemon.\nAnd I like to deseed it. I know that it sounds funny because we\u2019re using a garbage disposal,\nbut I don\u2019t want any extra stress put on the disposal. And honestly, I really use it\nother than for like very minor food stuffs. Then turn on the water after you stuff the\nlemons down in the garbage disposal. Turn it on, and run it for a good minute. That\nway you\u2019ll clean out the disposal and get it smelling good.\nThe second method we\u2019re going to be using is with Heinz vinegar. Now I\u2019m from Pittsburg\u2014you\nmay know that\u2014so I like using Heinz Cleaning Vinegar and freezing or making vinegar ice\ncubes. You can do this in your ice cube tray, just make sure that nobody uses them because\nthat would be a bad surprise. Stuff the ice cubes down into the garbage disposal and run\nit. Again, turn on the hot water first, and then run the garbage disposal for a good minute,\nand that\u2019ll clean it out really nicely. The third method we\u2019re going to use involves\nbacking soda. So this is just pure baking soda that you probably have in your kitchen\nfor cooking. Measure out about a \u00bd cup, and stuff the baking soda down into the garbage\ndisposal, and let it sit there for about 1 hour. So again, push it down with the spoon,\nand let it sit there for 1 hour to absorb all of the nastiness, all the  yucky\nsmell. And then what you can do is add about 1 cup of vinegar. So you\u2019re going to pour\nthat vinegar down to the drain. You\u2019re going to create this lava effect because when the\nbaking soda and the vinegar combine, there\u2019s a chemical reaction. It\u2019s pretty harmless,\nbut rinse out the garbage disposal. Run it for another minute, and you\u2019re good to go.\nThat\u2019s another way to clean your garbage disposal.\nThe final method of cleaning the disposal involves 20 Mule Team Borax. So this is a\nnatural laundry cleaner, and they even outline on the box how to clean your garbage disposal\nusing the Borax. Grab a tablespoon\u2014so just 1 tablespoon\u2014and\nyou\u2019re going to add about 2-3 tablespoons of the Borax to the garbage disposal. And\nyou\u2019re going to let it sit in the garbage disposal for about 15 minutes. Again, you\u2019ll\nhave to push it down with a spoon. And the Borax will work just like the baking soda\ndid. The only difference is you definitely want to use warm water per the directions.\nSo clean out your sink, and then turn on the garbage disposal; you\u2019re done.\nAll right. There you have it. Those are several ways that you can clean your garbage disposal.\nI hope this video helped you out.

Louis and a lot of the times we use a lock had been allowed down here at school I really would recommend you talking to them about all your vanilla needs they make over 300 different types of vanilla extracts they've got powders they've got seeds they've got beans Lochhead of vanilla calm LOC h h EA d Lochhead vanilla calm thank you for your episode sponsorship we find ourselves here at the wash-up area here at scoop school which is probably very similar to a lot of different wash up areas that you would have in your icecream stores your commissary kitchens and so forth one of the things that you're going to come across particularly when you start the process of very regular ice cream production and look you can be using a batch freezer you can use a custom machine you can use a soft-serve machine you're going to have the same issue is that at the end of the day you're going to get a bucket and you're basically going to clean your ice cream machine out and pour that bucket of water dairy mix soft-serve mix whatever it is down the sink you know two things are going to happen if you really leave these sinks or this process unremedied the first of which is you're going to start to get a smell now some local health department's building apartments I want every single ice cream shop in or restaurant to have a grease trap there might be one that's sitting somewhat temporary under the sink here it might be built into the ground but there are some health departments that don't require a grease trap and I don't know what's better or not but i one thing i will tell you was that the more dairy product you put down your drains the more chance there is to have that kind of dairy odor in your kitchen and heaven forbid permeating through your store so that's one problem when you're putting a lot of dairy product down the drain you can get some of that rotting dairy smell that stuff to use back up out of the drain and not only just that the sink drain here could be your floor drains as well the second is that believe it or not the amount of calcium that you have in your ice cream products particularly if you're taking a mix out of a machine and pouring it down the sink the amount of calcium buildup in these PVC pipes can be quite dramatic I remember at one of our stores in Australia one of the girls was pushing a cart and hit one of our PVC pipes was about this round and lo and behold when we went to have it repaired and I broke it off to kind of repair it I noticed that there was such a buildup of calcium and fat in the PVC pipe that the pipe that was should have been this round on the inside was basically this round on the inside there was barely any product getting down to the drain so what was recommended to me by the plumber who helped me fix it up was basically take parts bleach water you don't need a lot it can be diluted but you want to take some hot bleach water and turn it around and pour it down the sink at the end of every night or every shift so what happens is that you're getting some hot water that's cleansing out the fat content that might be building in your pipes and you're also kind of clearing out that smell now no one wants to have an ice-cream shop that smells like a hospital either so don't go crazy with the bleach but I'll tell you right now that if you've never had the issue how to you that's great get ahead of the 8-ball and start at the end of every shift taking maybe a gallon or so of hot water as hot as your tap scan or faucets can pump it out put some bleach in there and pour it down each of those drains it'll keep them clear of residue you'll keep them clear of smell and if you do have a problem right now that may resolve some of it you may have built up in your drain so thick that you may not be able to actually remedy that you'll have to change those drains out or the pipes out at least but look it's it's well worth doing again if you don't have the problem it get ahead of the 8-ball end of the evening put it on your close-up checklist nice big gallon jug of hot bleach water down each of the drains and if you've got dipper wells that are connected to your dipping cabinet again anything where you're putting potential ice cream or dairy product even if it's diluted by water down the drain needs to have some hot bleach water down there as well look I'm no plumber so if you really want some expert opinion go and talk to your plumber but it's worked for me for about twenty years anyway that's it for this episode nice and easy nice easy tip I thank you again to our episode sponsor which is Lochhead vanilla and if you have any questions quandary Zoar concerns about the ice cream business jump online scoops cool calm and we'll talk to you in the next episode you",

cultured marble top and we have got a porcelain undermount sink here this one is made in Germany that's nice it has a built in overflow so there's really nothing to be concerned about here you just need to know which way to install it so when you have a nice deep well like that on one side and shallow and the other I always install the shallow part towards you that way it facilitates washing your hands most faucets drain the water right in the back of the sink so all you need to do step one a couple of quick measurements that you need to do measure the depth of your cabinet to the underside of the countertop in this case it's a little bit more than 16 in the quarter so because we're going to use shims for installing we'll just go with 16 and a quarter it's nice and easy this is 7 and 3/4 there we go so we do the math I'm just gonna take myself an 8 inch piece of wood I cut in advance just to save us some time the idea here is simple I hold the sink in place I apply my my adhesive which is a silicone now this this is a new flex brand silicone smells like vinegar when it smells like vinegar you know what's going to work really well that's an important key so then basically you put the silicone on you pull the sink up by the drain into position and you just wedge the piece of wood underneath and then use the shims to make it nice and firm and then tap it with the hammer and that will force the sink up nice and level all the way around under compression so in a perfect world that works really easy so let's get our sink in place here [Music] okay so we're just going to apply our silicon really not too liberally but a quarter inch bead all the way around you want enough that it bonds but not so much that you're wiping out all the silicon for an hour and getting it all over yourself like I said this is the good stuff and if you get it on your clothes you're not getting it [Music] you just want to be careful make sure that your beat is nice and continuous because it's not just an adhesive it is also a sealer make sure that water is not going to get in the cabinet and the secret to this to keep him clean have toilet paper handy all right so now I'm gonna grab this lift it into position [Music] [Music] come on baby how are you very there we go now when that starts to make good contact [Music] go yes I'm just jamming them in there manipulating the front and the back side of the hole to tilt it and squeeze it in place okay so that's not gonna fall out so now that you get up here you can kind of manipulate this into place so you don't have any of the corner sticking out make sure that the gaps are consistent all the way around okay we're gonna take a minute here went off the extra really one wipe discard don't try to be cheap with this because it oh yeah end up getting it all over yourself so basically it's installed now silicon bin it's in the right position we've got the brace and some shims but we want to add more compression so this is the point where we get a little bit tricky with this I'm going to add one more shim in here just a little bit of a hammer oh yeah that lifted it right into position real good well this is awesome having all this light with max here today I've never seen anything like this in my life the bottom this medicine cabinet actually isn't very strong it's only about a quarter-inch piece of plywood and so this is a bit of a tricky scenario the only other way that you could do this is you can do it from on top you can put a piece of 2x4 across with a hole drilled here and you can buy at the store a threaded rod about a half an inch and you can get galvanized bolts for the half-inch rod and then what you do is you put a little piece of wood underneath with a hole in it as well you slide it over the rod you tighten the nut on and then from the top you'll lift the sink into place and you can thread the rod and use a wrench to put the compression that's another way to do it this is just really quick and simple remember if you want to learn more just subscribe to our channel Auto I design and build here on YouTube [Music]", "gutZr2NsIR4": "[Music] lavender [Music] done

underneath your kitchen sink you're gonna find two of these these are what are called angle stops these are the valve that turns the water on and off to your kitchen faucet a lot of times the water coming in there'll be sediment there'll be corrosion there'll be rust that'll get caught up inside of here and it will actually create a blockage which will give you low pressure into your kitchen sink the best thing you can do actually there's a couple things you can do you can go to the main and turn off your water completely and you need to undo this thing and this is just a basic wrench and unscrew it and it comes right off and what you want to do is you want to open up the valve and you just want to check and look for any type of blockage or damage or anything of that sort and quite honestly these things are like between five and seven dollars very inexpensive to replace and as long as you got it off you got your water off you know just go down to your plumbing supply house your local hardware store or your local Home Center and just pick up a couple more there's a hot and there's a cold and the best thing you can do is just replace these things and this should take care of your low-pressure problem to your kitchen faucet if you find that after replacing these things you're still getting a low pressure that would be the best time to get a licensed plumber to come out and do a real troubleshooting scenario so he can find out what exactly the problem is but as far as dealing with these that is the best way to deal with it and to check it out make sure there's no damage corrosion or blockage in it and that should take care of that problem for these things", "1Lk-WIvS-lA": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel so in today's video we're going to be doing a organizational video so i'm actually going to be organizing under the kitchen sink um everything is in this place um everything is shoved in cabinets it's not organized at all so we're going to go ahead and do that very quickly a lot of the items that i have under the sink are actually things that i've already had aside from two containers that i bought from the container store um but i'll leave everything linked in the description box if you're interested if you want to use the same things that i did you can purchase them i'll put a link so that way you can go and do that um other than that i suggest just using what you have and what you know whatever you have around the house you definitely don't have to go out and buy new things um but anyway so we're just gonna jump right into it i'm gonna show you kind of a before and after and hopefully you like it if you do just give me a thumbs up and i'll see you on the next video bye all right so as you can see this is what i'm working with it's definitely a hot mess down here i definitely have to tidy this up so we're gonna get right into it alright so the first thing that we're going to be doing is actually just taking everything out of the cabinet and basically just go through my whole stack and make sure that things that i don't need anything that is empty is just out [Applause] [Music] like a body of water all right so here i'm just taking the time to basically just wipe down the cabinet make sure that it's not dirty before i go and place all the items back in there [Music] so right now i'm just going to put everything back into the cabinet i'm actually going to go through these clear containers that i have and just make sure that anything that is empty or that i don't use i'm just going to either throw away or put somewhere else for the most part all these cleaners i do use on a daily basis there's a few in here that i really don't use every single day but i'll go ahead and explain that towards the end of the video basically what i use everything for [Music] hello uh [Music] so right now you're just gonna see me put everything into these clear containers that i got from the container store um i'm just taking the time to do that um it just looks less bulkier in in the cabinet and as you can see i'm struggling a bit because i do have an injury on my thumb um so don't mind that you know [Music] so one of the last things that i'm doing here is actually taking this little cube that i got at the container store i actually found this over in the office section and i'm just going to be adding some of these command strips that i just got from the store and then i'm just actually going to just be kind of gluing this over on the cabinet that you see over to the right and that's just going to hold some brushes [Music] it you was [Music] all right so this is pretty much what i came up with um a lot of the things that are in here i've already owned so i pretty much just use what i had i just had to kind of tidy up in here everything was kind of just shoved in here i hadn't really like organized it so these containers are actually from the container store um i think they're meant for refrigerators i think for the freezer but i just use them to put all the cleaning products in here i put the ones in the front that i use the most which is um i really like the mrs meyers this one is actually a kind of an accident discovery someone actually left this behind my mom works in a hotel and someone left it behind and she brought it home and i started cleaning with it and i really liked it i've used mrs meyers before but i've never used a lavender and for whatever reason i have really been gravitating to lavender recently i feel like that's kind of like my signature scent for the house now um and then right over here i just have the apple cider scent this is the one that i use during the fall i haven't used it as much so i really need to use it because i probably want to be using the christmas one pretty soon and then right over here i just have kind of like a disinfectant cleaner so i pretty much use this on a daily basis now and then just my glass cleaner and then everything else is kind of miscellaneous like back here i just have lysol i have this disinfectant spray from 7th generation which i really love but i haven't been able to find it since the whole pandemic started this is my favorite disinfectant spray um but like i mentioned since the whole uh pandemic i haven't been able to find it um there's still a little bit left so i'm kind of just holding on to it and then back there i just have other cleaners like here i just have white vinegar or yes white vinegar and then i have my stainless steel cleaner um i have this folix which i actually like for couches um and then i just have like a bug insect spray which um the house where we just moved in we're kind of out in the middle of nowhere so we had a lot of spiders um so i haven't had to use it yet but i have killed spiders i just haven't used that just yet and then back here i just have this method wood cleaner this one's actually my favorite um as you can tell i've used it a lot um and i like the smell the almond smell that's actually one of my favorite smells if you don't know if you never use the lotions from l'occitane um they have this almond cream and like body wash that smells like almonds and that's like my favorite so i think i always gravitate this because of the smell and then here i just have this bar keeper's friend which honestly i haven't used it much i used it in the town townhome when i lived in a town home to clean the oven um i liked it but i think i liked um just the baking soda with vinegar better and then i just have a duster and then i have rain eggs which is actually what i use on my shower and then i just have a clorox which i like to use that in the toilet bowls and then right over here i just have my kitchen bags i mean nothing special that's just what it is um right over here like i mentioned these i already had these i actually did buy um i bought these from the container store and they're just the oxo the containers that have the pop uh what's like the pops i don't even know what they're called pop sockets i don't know but anyways um so here i just keep the dishwasher tabs i did go ahead and add a uh label uh that way i know what it is and the only reason the reason that i added a label was because these this dishwasher packs that i buy from seventh generation are the same color as the clorox packs um so i actually use these clorox tabs for um i can't speak right now for um what is this called you know what i'm talking about so anyways i use these for um for the sink and and i put them in here and i did put a label because they are like the same color and i don't want to put a clorox pack in the dishwasher which i have actually done that before so that's why i went ahead and added a label and then right over here i have these containers these are actually from ikea i've had these for a long time and in here i'm just keeping sponges so right here i just keep these uh scrubbing like the foil sponges and then just the regular sponges that i use on a daily basis i get these from target and then i have these that i actually use on the oven um so i don't use those very often that's why i keep them in here and then right at the bottom there i have magic erasers and then i just have another one of these little um like one things for the duster for the swiffer um so it's just an extra but i do use these a lot for the bathroom especially so i just keep them in there and they're stacked and they're kind of out of the way i could probably even put these on top of this if i really wanted to and then i have more space to put something here i can't really put anything back here because of all the like the tubes and everything so there's limited space back in the very corner i just have a big thing of dawn that i bought at home depot a while ago when the whole pandemic started i couldn't find any soap of any sort so i just happened to be at home depot that that time and i found that big thing of dawn so i actually just bought it and i've been keeping it back there um like i said i haven't used it much but i actually use it to wash my makeup brushes and then i use it on a daily basis just on time time because it is antibacterial so i like to use that for certain things but i prefer to have them kind of just stacked next to it i don't really need them on top but like i said if i need more space i can definitely put them on top of here and then i can have more space here um and then right over here i actually added this little like i don't even know what this is called like a little cube or some sort i actually got this from the container store it was actually in the office section i don't even know why i went over there to look at something uh so in here i'm really just keeping this little brush that i used to scrub things with um and this is from what brand this is a full circle i really like these brushes they actually have one for like the dishes and i just like the look of it in the aesthetic like i like the color so it's not too flashy like the ones you get from like the grocery store they're like lime green and stuff um and then right in here i just have the this that goes in the sink um and then there's like some magnets or whatever but that's really all i'm keeping in here i'm not keeping anything i could probably keep a toothbrush like sometimes for cleaning i like to clean and like little crevices i can just keep that in here and it works fine i probably don't want to slam that door too much because i did put like little command strips on it um so but it looks like it's pretty sturdy so hopefully it holds i guess i'll let you know but this is pretty much what i came up with i didn't put any of the plastic on the bottom of the of the cabinet because i like to slide these around but if you just want something that kind of stays that stays there all the time then i would suggest putting um some type of plastic underneath it because um sometimes when water falls it kind of does so maybe i will put one i don't know yet but for right now i don't need a liner i kind of like it without the liner but that's just a preference if you do like it then so let me know how you organize your sink like mine is pretty straightforward i didn't do anything too fancy like i said i have so many tubes that didn't really allow me to do too much in here um so this is what i came up with um leave some comments down below and let me know if this was helpful for you and i will see you on the next video", "0Z5e73Tayds": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music]", "Q74w1QRZlW8": "Hi there! I'm Jeff with Home Repair Tutor. And in this quick video I'm going to show\nyou how to clean a sink, specifically a stainless steel sink like this one here, and get it\nfrom looking nasty to looking amazingly clean in a few simple easy steps. So let's get started. I think you're going to like this tutorial. My product of choice for cleaning a kitchen\nsink is Comet, specifically a scratch free formulation. So I like Comet with bleach. Before I use it, I rinse off all surfaces\nof the sink\u2014rinse your sink down thoroughly\u2014then sprinkle the Comet onto the surface on both\nthe left and right sides. And what we're going to do is use a dishwashing\nsponge, like this one here. Moisten it and then create a paste with the\nComet. That paste is going to be wiped or rubbed\nall over the surfaces of the sink, including the strainers and down into the sink drain,\nbecause what that paste is going to do is disinfect the sink for you. So, again, get the strainer nice and soaked\nbecause that's where a lot of grime and guck collect. Let the Comet sit for 10 minutes so it'll\ndo its job of disinfecting. Then you can wipe down the faucet itself. Now, for really bad mineral deposits, I like\nto use cleaning vinegar, 'cause as you can see here, you get a lot of mineral deposits\non the base of the faucet. So saturate some standard paper towels with\nthe vinegar, and place the towels around the base of the faucet. I had to use two towels and let those sit\nfor 10 minutes. And what that'll do is break down the mineral\ndeposits for you. The next step is to take out the plug that\ncovers the set screw to the faucet. Clean that out thoroughly using a toothbrush. Here's the magical tool that helps me clean\nmy sink thoroughly. It's called The Grout Grime Buster 3000; you\ncan make it yourself\u2014one of my fans taught me how to make it. You simply plug it into your drill. And what you do is, with your drill set on\nlow or whatever setting works best, you simply power it on and let the little cleaning brush\non the end of the Grime Buster do all the work for you. It can reach down into the crevices that you\ncan't reach with the standard sponge. So clean the strainer, clean down in the sink. After using this little brush, my sink looks\nawesome\u2014and it takes very little effort. So, again, clean the left and the right strainers\nas well as down into the disposal. And getting down into those flaps is so hard\nto clean; but with the Grime Buster, it's easy. Then thoroughly rinse off your sink as well\nas the faucet because you don't want any of the Comet to streak your great cleaning job. So again, thoroughly clean off the surfaces. Take the paper towels with the vinegar; take\nthem off the faucet, and clean the faucet down with those, too. Use a magic eraser to remove any of the remaining\nwater spots. Rub the magic eraser on the sink and the faucet. And then, you can take a microfiber cloth\nand buff all the surfaces. This is the final step that really, really\nmakes the faucet and the sink shine. Some people use olive oil for this, but I\njust use the cloth. Replace the plug for the set screw, and you're\ndone. Take a look at the difference between the\nstrainer\u2014well, you'll have to watch the beginning of the video, but the strainer looks\nawesome. The disposal side looks great, too. And here's the drain. It's phenomenally clean after the Grime Buster. Here's the base of my faucet\u2014no more mineral\ndeposits\u2014nice and shiny. And the final product: I know that you can\nget this result, too, if you use all these steps. I'm absolutely sure of that. Pretty simple, right? And the results are amazing. It's not you're using a ton of different chemicals,\nnor should it really take you a ton of time to accomplish this. I mean, my sink doesn't look absolutely perfect,\nbut the deal is this: if you have company coming over and you only have maybe 10 minutes,\nthis is something to try out because I think it'll help you with getting your sink amazingly\nclean.

Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the\nnext video.", "56nWLIS2j_8": "I figured I'd give a review of this sink which my father and I installed in my house that I'm working on this sink is made by Revati ruv api it's an RV H 8300 you can see that right there it's a 32 inch sink in a 36 inch sink base I bought this with my own money I do have a link to it in the description down below the link is an affiliate link just as a full disclosure it's a 16-gauge sink which is thicker than anything you would find at Lowe's or Home Depot besides their grain it sinks and whatnot so it's it's pretty nice it doesn't it doesn't bring it all it's pretty well dead and there's deadening material on the other side of the walls too and the cool thing about this sink is it has a Ledge on the back and the front and this is where you can put accessories accessories like a drain rack accessories like a cutting board which is really nice if you're doing something like chicken or fish and you don't want it to get on their countertop anything that splashes over will just it'll be in the sink accessories like this drain bin which I haven't used yet and I don't know what I'll use it for we'll figure that out later and accessories like well whatever you want this is a pretty big cutting board you could cut it down so that it fits in here and then you could cut a circle in the middle and in that circle you could put like a bowl and that'd be nice like if you're doing chicken you're gonna have two of those set up you can have your batter on one side your dredge on the other and right into the deep fryer so you're not actually making any mess any chicken mess on the countertop all the mess stays in the sink and you can get creative and do other things with that too it also comes with this rack on the bottom which is nice because it keeps all of your stuff from both denting the bottom and just resting in water which could be an issue for you because it doesn't drain out very quickly it's not very steep bottoms but I haven't found that to be an issue personally like your sponge won't be sitting in water it can dry out and it came with a drain and it comes with this little food matter bin which is great because any food matter that you get into the sink you can just take this out throw it away and then put it back in instead of using your finger down there to macerate the food down through the drain and the stopper works great it doesn't leak what else if you're using this to wash dishes which isn't really its main use case like we're going to be using in conjunction with a dishwasher you could use this just as spot cleaning or food prep or if you wanted to do like washing in one side and rinsing in the other and then putting in the drying rack you can just get bins like this and that becomes your wash bin and you can get another for a rinse bin so that's not an issue with this full-size sink now what's really cool about this sink is Lowe's or Home Depot you would get a sink that for like a hundred bucks that's two Bowl and you'd be putting in a cutting board and to be hanging out the side because it doesn't fit well in this case even with a massive cutting board this is the largest cutting board that I own it fits right in there so you can wash that without it spraying out of the sink anywhere you can wash large things without it springing out of the sink very easily in conjunction with a taller gooseneck like this that's about all I have to say for it right now be expecting a review in a month and a year to make sure I still like it but as for now I appreciate those likes comments and subscribes and I'll see you around", "E7rwAV35E84": "today we're I'm going to show you how I take care of my sink I have a big black granite sink that after time gets a white haze over it I googled and searched and watched youtube videos on how to take care of this and eventually I found what works for me so here's my sink big black granite sink and I don't know if you can see they see that white haze there I also have well water but I don't have bad well water it's drinkable and and it tastes okay but every few weeks I get this white haze in this black sink that just at first it drove me crazy I felt terrible because I didn't when I first put it in my husband put it in it was bright shiny and beautiful and then it turned into something I didn't I hate and I didn't I didn't like it so I found this stone cleaner you can see it Cllr stone cleaner that works really really good for me so first I spray this stone cleaner on I got it from Amazon I'll link it below if you want to buy it you can but I'll spray this on I've already done this but I'll show you edit and it phones it has a white phone to it and then I scrub it I'll scrub it really good with this stuff first and it seems to work it seems to work real well for me so I believe me I tried a lot of products until I found this and I'm real happy with this what are they next is I get some paper towels I have paper towels up here and I make sure that the sink is really dry I'll dry this thing really really good with the paper towels and that is very shiny and if you could see this the drain if you want to see how I clean this drain I didn't clean that side see how that's kind of I don't know if you that I forgot to clean the back of it but it's not shiny and it don't so that side if you want to see how I got that so clean and shiny really really easy all week I'll link that video I'll link that video at the end of these videos so what are you next is I get coconut oil see I have coconut oil here the sink is stone of course it's stone granite and so it's porous so you need to treat it with I use coconut oil you can use olive oil I actually tried using Pam spray with olive oil once and that made it really sticky so don't do that so I just use plain oh so what I do with the olive oil now normally it's warm here so normally the olive oil is not rough like this it's warm here so what I'll do is just kind of dump it in and just rub it all over the entire surface of the sink you know I make sure to get like up here around the faucets I'm gonna round the faucets there usually I usually save the part I've learned I saved the part that is in front of me for last because I lean in the olive oil and I really don't want to have to lean into the olive oil but I you could see I just just rub it on just keep it on there alright so now I have the coconut oil just on there I just gooped it all over make sure you get the edges of your sink get everywhere you can kind of see it in there but I've gifted all over the sink I usually let it sit for 10-15 minutes unless I forget about it it'll sit longer and it's just my husband and I in the house so where they were the only ones that used to say my husband and I so I'll forget that I put it on there and it'll sit there just for quite a while anyway just leave it sit there for a while and then ten minutes or so just get a paper towel and buff it off that's all you have to do just kind of rub the excess off you'll see different spots have a little more excess than others just rub it out just being my husband here so the sink doesn't get used a lot you know it's just the two of us so for me this will probably last about three weeks the shine will stay on there about three weeks for you you might have to do it more depending on what type of water you have and how many people are living in your house and the products I use I'll link below I got this from Amazon the Stone cleaner and this is just regular coconut oil I'll link those below so yeah I hope this helps you I hope this helps you because I know I searched for a very long very very long time how to clean this darn sink all right well if you like like subscribe and come back for more videos who knows what I'm going to film next", "LDbC6wdVc3I": "hi I'm Annette Hayward I'm Radio 5 Live's cleaning expert and

of the few places I use it it tells you on the back all these different areas you can use it in and all this good stuff but uh the truth is I've got about five or six different things in my house including the shower including the bathtub and especially the sink right here we kind of have that leftover food where it's kind of almost a stain or just kind of like I don't know working its way into the sink and this stuff does a really really nice job let's take a look at some of this gross this I was having a tough time there's a little bit of stain here some of this food is kind of

I hope you appreciate the product review check out the description below and you can check these out for yourself we'll see you next time bye for now", "5w9kx7mq8nE": "today it's going to be a very exciting day because we're finally going to install our kitchen sink you see that we have the opening cut out it's all ready to go so let's get installing the new sink now our cutout has been confusing a few people because you can see it spans right over that drawer base and that's because we bought this stainless steel drain board sink guys we look so long for the perfect sink for this kitchen we knew it had to have a drain board I know I wanted to stainless steel and I wanted something that was gonna look cool clean modern but you guys know that we're doing this on a budget we don't want to spend a fortune on the sink and a lot of sinks out there but the drain board were two thousand dollars I was shocked by the prices now some of you from overseas might be surprised by this because drain board sinks are really common where you are but in the USA not many people have them at all they're really hard to find really rare so what my search to find an affordable high quality product I ran into this sink made by by I never heard the brand before but I checked out their website really awesome products high quality stuff and I was I was just in love with it you guys are gonna ask this sink cost $400 it seems like a lot but compared to 2000 this was a steal so I'm happy about that so let me flip it over get it ready we're gonna get it installed now I want to point out that we're not being sponsored by this we bought the sink with our own money and this is just our own words our own feelings but I really love this sink the quality I want to mention is a handmade sink really thick stainless steel I was just so impressed with everything about it that I can't help but share it with you guys the one thing some of you might remember is that the sink came with these clips and these clips really confused me because I didn't understand how they work because of this piece of metal sticking up and you see they don't clip on here but I wasn't too concerned about it because they were big enough for our countertop depth anyway so I kind of put them aside I ordered some new clips we'll talk about those in a minute but this is the crazy part the company who made the sink saw that video and they've reached out to me personally and explained that this tab sticking up is actually made for thicker countertops and what you do is you just bend it over and make another hook like this to reach that deeper countertop yep so actually these what have worked fine for us they even sent me a picture so that was really awesome of them to go out of their way to explain the clips to me I had no idea and I guess now that I know it's pretty obvious and believe it or not a few of you guys suggested that too to just bend over that metal town well that's exactly what that's for but since I already ordered them I do have these other clips too this is a different type of clip and I actually think I'm gonna use these simply spent money on them and I think they're gonna work better for us anyway so with these new Clips I'm gonna use you just swivel them out of the way when they clip right on like that and actually I'm gonna like these a little better because I can clip them on right now put them out of the way after the sink is in I'll just flip them over the counter and tighten them down I'm gonna put a spine bead of silicone because the sink has a flat lip you got to put in a few clips that I couldn't put on earlier see you can see the clips in here now we're gonna flip them down then just flip down and we'll just tighten them up and these screws [Music] that is looking so good it's all done you don't need to tighten up those clips like crazy don't over kill them and break them just tighten it up until they're snug to the counter now that this is in I'm gonna go ahead and just put a fine beat right around the edge here this is just for my own personal preference that's done I gotta clean up some of the mess around the edges but I'm really to dry for a little bit first silicon is always a disaster for me but I did the best I could okay I'm gonna get the drain hooked up now so I bought a trap and I cut it to length I already measured it out just so in that it would line up under my drain opening I already installed the basket should have showed that part but it was pretty basic just setting in the sink with the gaskets above and below tightening that nut down now I'm going to be taking this is called a tail piece it's just a pipe again I cut this to length to fit from the basket to the drain right there whenever you put in this piece on the top another one back to back this is kind of like a puzzle and then this little gasket on here it's a taper facing down put it right in there just tighten it up and then there was a rubber gasket it sits right on top of this tail piece so the drain is done nothing to that and now the faucet now we wanted our faucet to match the sink we picked up a bi faucet so it's a matching set and we chose this one look how sleek this is so this faucet has a cool little o-ring on the bottom that'll seal it looks pretty easy to install all right Bob I want you to hold this faucet just like this [Music] [Music] [Music] we'll be done [Music] well that was a really easy install and look how sharp that looks goes really well with the sink and it's super sleek I love how it's just a smooth body really easy really smooth looking oh I never showed you guys the basket in here this count comes with the sink it's really cool it's just that's deploy and then in here it comes with this really deep kind of catch basket and then the normal sink drain down that way and that's kind of neat I've never seen one like that before [Music] cut the air out of all that feels so good to finally be done with this job faucet looks awesome it does pull out right here you know so you can do that thing it's really snug helping with o-rings I like that I just liked how clean the faucet was it's very smooth easy to keep clean now we've had some questions by the dishwasher because we didn't install one either a new kitchen a lot of people install dishwashers we just don't use them we don't care for them we feel like they just kind of take up a lot of space and break easy we don't see the point no we don't have a lot of dishes and we like to wash our dishes by hand so to make up for that since we don't have a dishwasher we wanted to make sure that our sink could handle washing dishes easily to make the job easy for us that's why we decided to get a nice large sink with the drain board that's gonna make washing and drying dishes so much easier and not only that but the drain board was a must-have feature I think if you have a butcher block countertop because the last thing you want to do is send a bunch of wet dishes on your countertop and I know you can get those plastic trays and everything but it doesn't that just work so much better and prevent water from getting on the wood so since the sink is done I'm going to show you some of the accessories that we want to go with it it's really cool first thing I'm going to show you is destroying rec this one's a little small but I picked it small intentionally so that it could fit sideways on there and not take a lot of room at the silverware tray or basket so for basket on the side I really like this we can just put our dishes in here as we wash them sit them there drinks right in so convenient so we got this and this is really neat because not only can it go there but it has these pullout sides and you can actually put it right here in the sink you see that so if you need extra space if you want to go double duty you've got some big stuff up here you can put this over here I really like that that's a cool feature now I just found that an Amazon that didn't come with a sink so that was my own find but I did pick up some extra some extras that go with the sink specifically first one is this cutting board which i think is pretty neat I'll tell you what I didn't like about it though it comes pre finished with a hard like a polyurethane finish and I'm not a fan of that I just want a natural cutting board that I can oil but as far as durable cutting boards go this one's pretty neat and it's actually not to fit so you can see it won't fall away but you can have some extra work top area at the very least extra work top is always handy we could slide it all the way to the end all the way to this end anywhere in between you can say yeah that's pretty cool to have that extra work top I almost forgot to show this this actually came with the sink so this did not cost any extra it comes with the sink and it goes right down to the bottom and it has rubber bumpers on it all the way around rubber feet on it and this is really cool because really you can pull stuff on it to dry to drain off but also it can just stay in there and protect your sink from getting all scratched up because this thing is gonna scratch it's stainless steel you got pots and pans in there and dishes rub it around this is actually going to protect it so that's a really cool feature comes with the sink this is cool this is the first time I've opened this this is stainless steel it's a colander basically I know it's not a very large ones they have two sizes they have a big one and a small one I picked a small one because we never really make anything big so this is convenient it has kind of plastic feet on the sides so that you can also dump your pasta in there to drain it off or put some veggies in there to rinse some cleaning some fruits and veggies off let them drain in there I thought that was gonna be a really handy feature so I picked that up as well so there it is I don't I don't have anything else to share on this project you can see it's like fully featured lots of options you can put with it I'm just so thrilled with the sink I'm so excited to have this I love it I've been waiting four months to install this thing and to top it off on top of everything else the customer service for the buy has been awesome I mean I really mean that it sounds like I'm doing a sponsored video here they've given me nothing I bought everything with my own money but literally every question I've asked every concern I've had any problems I run into they've been right there answering my emails quickly just so supportive so easy to talk to I love that I love when a company is has great customer service so for this price for all the options and the styles and they have other things too I just I think everything is awesome looks good I'm happy with it now I got one more surprise for you guys before we go and that's another faucet this is a popular faucet now I've never installed one of these before but I definitely wanted to try one in this house and you'll see why a pot filler faucet is basically a faucet that you put on a wall come out of the wall like this and basically you could just fill pots at your stove you'll see this and some of the fancier houses and the faucet just extends to wherever you need it like that it's usually how you see them used we're doing things a little bit differently you can see we don't have a spout for this too but for a long time many of you guys have noticed this hole in our wall and you've asked what is for it I keep saying that's for a future project the future project is here and that's where our pot filler is going to be installed and that's gonna be a little weird for you guys if you're gonna say why are you doing that some of you might get it let me get installed and then I'll show you why no this is just an inexpensive popular faucet that I bought off Amazon and don't remember the brain the brand but we'll try to put a link if you want to check it out it's pretty cool stainless steel looks very well-made it comes with these rings to attach to the wall and basically this is a cover to hide the screws this is what we're gonna attach first there's a allen screw on the bottom and there's a groove on the bottom of the faucet so what that's going to do is this is going to attach to the wall and then after this is attached we put this in here we're gonna thread it in you'll see what it threads into but then after it threads in it'll be like this in the wall will tighten up that Allen screw and that locks it in so we can't twist and become loose now I picked up this it's a pipe nipple think it's an inch and a half or so and I'm gonna be putting that into a drop of your elbow that I have installed in the wall previously so I'm putting my blocking for my drop elbow for the pot filler and what I did was I ripped these two chunks of wood right here so that I'd be able to put some more wood on the face and this is gonna be flush with my studs and this is gonna be a mounting block for me to attach my pot filler to after the drywall is up so I kind of have a sandwich here of wood this is going in the middle like that if that makes any sense there's probably other ways to do it this is just the way that seemed to make sense for me so let me get this screwed on got my elbows screwed on tight the short cab and the screws work really good inside this wall I had a water line come up the wall go to a drop your elbow attached to a piece of wood and now you might be able to see that there's some wood inside here I also framed in a piece of wood across the stud thing so that there was solid blocking behind this wall that was all three quarter inch wood back here and that is going to be handy for me to screw into to give this a nice solid hold let me just this is temporary I'm not doing this permanently I just want to mark these holes where they're gonna be [Music] [Music] [Music] thank that's done alright that install actually went pretty easily it wasn't too bad at all I decided to use pipe thread sealant instead of teflon tape I have a really bad time with teflon tape but I experienced a high rate of leaks with that with this stuff is really reliable and whenever I use pipe ceiling like this I don't think I've ever had a week so I decided to go with that because it's in the wall this is actually pretty scary for me because I can't see if it's leaking I can't see inside the ball so I just wanted to make sure it was sealed as I could so I put a lot of - sealant on it and then I tightened it down really good I probably went to where it felt good and then I went around a whole nother turn just to be extra tiny I'm gonna put those out and wrenches right in this drawer so it's always there in case you need it now let me just clean up the mess I'm gonna go down in the crawlspace turn on the water make sure there's no leaks I'll show you why we put a pot filler right here you see it kind of has this double handle thing that's really handy because then you don't accidentally turn it on it's got two vowels to control you can't just turn on one your football and not to get to the point why did we put a pot filler up high on our wall where it's potentially gonna create a disaster it's because of this this is our perky water filter system it's time for cleaning so let me clean it and then I'll explain [Applause] look how rusty from our water that just builds up down there like slime but it's good that means it's taking it out of the water [Music] [Music] so there it is with our water filter which we use for drinking water I give that thing a deep cleaning I really needed it we haven't been able to wash it very well because we didn't have a proper sink it was so awesome being able to wash that in the sink and really get a good thorough cleaning so not only is this thing going to make our lives so much easier but the faucet is also going to make our lives easier because we used to have to carry pots of water from the bathroom to the filter to dump them in the top what you do is you fill this top compartment with water and then it slowly grab the feeds through the filters down into the bottom part where you dispense the water so you'd have to fill it up fill it up we go through a lot of water it was a pain and even though now we have a sink it would be easier to fill it in the kitchen you can't imagine like Ashley for example she really struggles to get the pots of water up high enough to dunk them in and it's slow you got to keep doing it over and over this thing home cycle for gallons and water more so we decided to install the pot filler in the wall and I know that's crazy to do something so permanent for something like this but this has become such a big part of her life that we thought it was worth doing so now all we have to do is take the lid off bring the pot filler over and [Music] Wow cuz that's not hard and you see him from their tomato stuff I can see you gonna take a bath in the sink here was so fun today it's actually pretty nice do I go pull the siding off no so this was a really big progress week for us we got the stove top we got the rangehood both working installed that's really good we got the sink in that's like really cool we're both like loving this thing we're so happy we chose this yeah we just like to give like credit where credit is due and this sink is awesome the company's been awesome can't say enough good things about it perky you can hear it clunking away the water's coming down drip by drip in the pot filler that's gonna be really awesome no more using a pot you hated doing that yeah so I think we gutted our kitchen at the end of September 2019 so it's been like six months or more without a sink without a proper stove yeah it's pretty insane we're very adaptable people though so we we were okay with it it's not that much of a struggle in fact one of the big things that helped a lot we talked about washing dishes in our bathtub and we did do that sometimes but we actually kind of started washing them in our bathroom sink we were hesitant about that at first because we don't want to beat up our sink but some of you guys might remember we put a kitchen faucet on our bathroom sink and it swivels so you can move it out of your way have more room and stuff like that it's been actually really not too bad to wash dishes in there the only thing hard about it is how small a bowl is yeah and this thing is a beast look at this we're gonna feel spoiled using this thing mm-hmm so that's all no more surprises today we're happy that these jobs are getting done and we have a sink again so as always we really appreciate you guys watching we hope you guys enjoyed the video we'll have another one coming soon so until next time take care bye you", "bnPAH1komW8": "[Music] sometimes notice smells coming into your home so your sink or maybe your shower drain and this is not random because the pipeline that connects to the sewer from your drain is not one-way so for this reason you're going to get noxious odors in your home randomly and the reason for this is very simple the odor is coming because the water trap and your sink or your system is dried up underneath any sink in your home you should notice a u-shaped bend in the pipe which is the water trap of the p-trap this exists to create a water barrier between your home and the smells from the pipe in the sewer below when the trap is filled with water right here the smell from the sewer system won't come through your sink if you don't use this sink for a little while the water that's supposed to be in the trap will evaporate out so there's no barrier for the odor sometimes all you have to do is run the water for a few moments so the trap can fill this is the problem most of the time so luckily it's a very easy fix if you find that your trap water is evaporating too often and running the sink water doesn't solve the problem you can install this trap primer from soot chief this trap primer automatically replenishes water to the drain traps to prevent sewer gases and smells from coming into your home and it's very simple it looks like this it's an easy install if that doesn't fix your problem then you probably a biofilm built up inside your drain pipe which is pretty easy to get out all you need is a flexible drain pipe and a mixture of 50% water and 50% bleach and it's going to get it out of there so it's a pretty simple problem with a simple solution if

commercial construction company in Garner Ville New York and this is how to work a snake for a clog in a sink it's kind of a loaded question to be honest with you I would personally take the you know pipes apart if I could the snakes pretty hard to manage if you can imagine like working through this configuration and then in and out you know most often the the sediment that forms a clog is in the actual pea trap here which really should be removed and taken off cleaned with sediment and then reinstalled another reason why I really wouldn't use a snake is if not so much on the plastic but where you have metals and there's a possibility of a corrosion the snake could very well go through the pipe and you know you'd have to replace it anyway so you're almost saving a step if you study the pipe you see that there's some corrosion in it you might want to avoid that or especially avoid chemicals at that point because if you pour the chemicals down a corroded pipe they're just going to eat through the very thin layers of the pipe and then get all over your you know your cabinetry their cost if they could do your harm get on your arms and cause burns and stuff so I'm going to walk you through or using a snake but I really wouldn't do it on our double sink I've determined which side the p-trap is under or at least the closest route to the p-trap which is most likely where the clog is coming from I'm going to insert the auger in the center of the drain rotate it counterclockwise and we'll loosen the auger give myself a little more slack tighten the auger push the auger down the drain and I'm going to keep rotating clockwise pushing the auger down as its traveling it only has to go short distance to get through the trap but another thing that happens very often is that you get a clog at the drain vent pipe area I'll pull it straight out and hopefully but at that point even gone through the clog and it's entangled on the auger Teta counterclockwise to get it out so once we're done snaking the pipe you want to run some hot water through it to make sure that it flushes the pipes you can also apply a combination of baking soda salt and water to help dissolve the rest of the residual dirt and debris that's in there and this was how to work a snake for a clog in a sink this is nickel Sorachi the home source guy president known of source development inc a residential

what it's looking like underneath without the liner because we're waiting for this to dry properly are you fixing things oh yeah more like scratching the paint off so hey fam sarah here welcome back to our channel so today's video is another exciting one because it is actually coordinating with our declutter series i've got some packages that just came in the mail and inside them holes so an organization system for underneath my sink in the kitchen i bought two of them because i basically want to kind of test them out first to see how they work one um for my kitchen sink and one for my master bathroom because the good lord knows underneath there needs some help so let's see how this works guys oh two came in the box so this is what the product is guys this is what the product is it's called simple houseware under sink two-tier expandable shelf that's what it looks like it's designed to kind of go around your pipe so let's see how easy this is oh and i got two of them as i said let's see if it's easy to assemble [Music] [Music] i've recruited help i mean i haven't started but i figured the man will be better off doing this section okay we're just trying to determine if we're supposed to build it underneath the sink or outside um [Music] you guys what the heck was this for like i don't even know why it was underneath there um i just want to point out underneath our sink we have a carburetor and i noticed that um people had them as well when they installed the unit so that was cool [Music] you want to drink of your coffee [Music] are you helping zoe she's so guys i'm not going to show the whole process of of building this it is pretty simple um right you'd say it's pretty simple pretty simple yeah it's just basically the two ends just connect whatever you want to connect and i guess according to the number of shelves you want to create and position and the way you want to position your shelves underneath the sink but while these guys are doing this i'm going to be on the hunt for some containers it's going to have to come down here so it will go all the way across and then you can put this yeah but you know i mean like you won't be able to put shelves up here that's okay there are four shelves you put the shelves wherever you want to right and also you can see if you can skip the carburetor so you just play around with it and see which one you prefer i i think you should maybe because this is gonna have a shelf right this bottom yeah should the other shelf go here how many oh you can put is there are there that many rods i think there are four right okay guys so you saw the before and this is the after this is the aft this is the after of our kitchen cabinet we stored our dish extra dish detergent over there our cleaning product will comment anyways we we have lots of other cleaning agent inside of our laundry room but this is what we have here for now we have our comment i'm going to look for a better storage for this so it can go like in a bin on top of this area um and then we've got what's this uh you know jet dry as well as sanitizer and i have just some extra sponges back there just because there's extra space back there so we're trying to utilize it we still had room for our fire extinguisher and mind you we also have a giant carburetor so for this thing to fit so well underneath is pretty amazing um we we have this here but we're going to replace it with the um with the liner that we bought we just kind of we didn't go and find it yet it's downstairs and oh we also have garbage bags back there so i think it's working out really well i'm very very pleased and we're gonna put the other one up for our bathroom like i said this shelf was 28 you guys i'm i'm very very pleased with it overall and i definitely would recommend it i'm gonna do the same thing for my bathroom and i guess i'll take you guys on a journey for that as well we'll see how we'll see when i get to it bye sally say bye bye what are you doing down here i'm just screwing oh jones is not speak properly are you fixing things oh yeah more like scratching the paint off flashing the finger that's that that's squashing the pink off the paint okay show me what you're doing down here what what is what's that that you're doing let me see what do you look i want to see what you're fixing go ahead i'm fixing this you're fixing what how about you fix our sink it's too strong yeah i tried to fix it and the epoxy fell apart so i have one more idea that i'm going to try no no no no no no it's home renovation 2021. don't lie no are we redoing the kitchen no more is that a question he tries me that's the running joke in here i remember when we first moved into this house and i was like i want to change the kitchen and this guy's like oh no the kitchen's great just because it has granite counters mind you these granite counters are like as old as me oh okay these grand calendars are old and they just need to go the whole kitchen needs to go the cupboards the counter everything and now he's starting to realize that for himself but they hide the dirt so well that's not funny that's gross nobody trying to eat dirt you guys for a hint of reality it's the next it's the next day and our water line for our refrigerator um is leaking but the funny thing is that's coming back to remove the cardboard lining as i told you guys originally because it was only in there temporarily because we couldn't find our liners and then i encountered a big leakage yeah but while we're dealing with this matter we've got um mrs clean over here yes very nice well done good catch oh oh look she's popping by tomorrow yeah it would have been what you doing oh oh i love the the leg movement check check it out y'all check it out okay so anyways guys a little update on underneath our sink area it is the water line it's the water line from our fridge that kind of um that's leaking and so let me turn it off for the current moment and then i guess we're gonna he needs to pick something up to repair it so no water from our fridge which was the highlight or ice or ice which was the highlight of why we got this fridge oh my goodness so yeah so that's what's up we do up don't touch that mama so that's what it's looking like underneath without the liner because we're waiting for this to dry but yeah that's the final product and

When your garbage disposal clogs, don\u2019t\nrush out and call a plumber. There may be simple methods for dealing with\nthe problem. You will need A flashlight An extraction tool\nAn Allen wrench A broom handle (optional) A wooden spoon (optional) and a replacement\ngarbage disposal unit (optional). Step 1. Locate and press the disposal\u2019s reset button. Often, a disposal that's overloaded will trigger\nthe unit to shut down. Step 2. Turn off the electrical power to the disposal\nunit at your main electrical panel. Or, if you can easily access the power source\nto the disposal, unplug it. Step 3. Examine the disposal unit with a flashlight\nand search for the object that might have caused the unit to clog. Step 4. Remove the object with an extraction tool\nsuch as pliers or tweezers. Step 5. Spin the disposal\u2019s grinding unit with an\nAllen wrench in the hexagon-shaped slot in the underside of the disposal. Insert a broom handle or wooden spoon into\nthe disposal chamber and push it back and forth against the grinding arms. Step 6. Remove any loose material in the disposal,\nturn on the power, and attempt to operate the disposal with the water running. Don\u2019t unbolt the screw in the center of\nthe disposal chamber. The center bolt holds the unit together. Step 7. If the clogging object cannot be cleared with\nthese techniques, you may have to replace the unit. Did you know Did you know?

channel i'm here to motivate you and to give you everything that i know that i've learned throughout the years so today we are cleaning one of the messiest places i know in a lot of people's homes under the sink as you can see this is a mess i have all of these items even some of them are stacked on top of each other i have them on top of a towel it gets messier every time just to be able to pick something out of it so i have today this waterproof mat so no more towel i actually got this from amazon and it is specifically made for under the sink in case there's some kind of a leak or something like that let's hope not but if there is then this is waterproof which is really nice you can see this is the bottom so nothing can penetrate through it so i'm going to be measuring this out i'm actually going to attempt first to use a black sharpie because i feel since this is like a dark gray black i might actually see the sharpie on it and it wouldn't be as noticeable is if i drew a line with the chalk marker and didn't correctly you know follow the line so try this first if not this under the sink two-tier expandable shelf i got this from amazon as well so if you're interested in getting something like this you'll see the link down below this video and you can get them for yourself you can actually measure the shelves according to where your pipes are i do have to put this together i'm gonna have my husband do it to make it easier for me uh yeah i'll show you how it turns out and um we'll go ahead and get started with it all right [Music] [Music] so i told you guys in my last video that i was going to let you know how the myers cleaning products were i had ordered grove and i was super excited about it and i absolutely love this stuff by the way i'm going to use it to clean out the bottom but whenever you spray it it smells like a spa it smells so good it makes you actually not mind cleaning like i actually enjoy it because i spray it and it's just you know and i feel like i'm doing good because i'm recycling and it's non-chemical but this stuff is amazing i got peppermint for the winter season and it's really good guys really really good [Music] oh my goodness this is some serious uh material oh there it goes i'm gonna cut it slightly longer because i can always make it shorter but i can't put the material back so i'm going to just make it a little bit large oh wait hmm i'm gonna have to go back through and fix that i don't know what that's about apparently i marked the pole but i'm confused as to why i did it the way i did it it's weird anyway we'll see that's just one spot to fix so not anything too serious [Music] shape [Music] [Music] you [Music] was afraid [Music] there's nobody out there [Music] you and me [Music] you [Music] is

first of all it totally depends on what type of copper sink you have where it was made and how it was made let's start with the imports because they're the most commonly found on the Internet many of them have lacquered finishes which means you can't use any abrasives you have to be very careful about dropping the tencel's inside the sink you cannot use bleach inside the safe bleach will harm the lacquer so basically it's a relatively delicate finish designed sadly not to last to many years once you have broken through the lacquer which very likely will occur there's really nothing you could do to repair the same so these are very fragile sinks and require a tremendous amount of upkeep many will in their use and care tell you that you should dry the sink after every use and wax it regularly the second type of imported sink as no lacquer and in many cases an artificial finish meaning it's not the natural color of copper when it ages the natural color of copper when it ages should be obvious it's the color of an old penny that's the color that copper wants to change to so if your sink is not in that color range if it's darker red or as black on it etc which many of the imports do again it is a very delicate finish you can't use abrasives you shouldn't use anything with any acids in it most foods contain acid meaning you can't leave them in the bottom of the sink for any period of time most of these manufacturers again will tell you that you need to rinse and dry out your sink after every use once you cut through the unnatural color you will likely get a coloration based on how you've done this ranging anywhere from a light brown to a pinkish color which is the color of polished copper in any case they will darken back up in those areas to a caramel brown which is the color of an old penny which will likely not match the original color of the sink so you'll have areas of the sink that look like the original color and then areas that look like the color of an old penny lastly there's arsenic made right here in the US in Orlando Florida by red cow we use only a household vinegar to age the interior of our scents that after several coats and a fair amount of time turns the color of an old penny hence the use of care is simple no drying out after it's been used there's no issue about putting anything inside the sink in terms of acid based products you can use abrasives on the inside of the safe and basically the only thing that will happen is you will remove the patina for a very short amount of time it will come back and blend in with the rest of the colors of the sink and look just like it did when you bought it so it is a lifetime product we are the only manufacturer that has a lifetime transferable warranty most if you look and you really should have a one-year warranty also when you're looking at copper since look at their use and care the vast majority will tell you that you have to wax the sink or you have to dry it after every use so my best thought to you is is do your homework if you're looking for a copper sink read the use and care read the warranty take a look at where they're made in many cases the online companies hide with your mate or give deceptive information for example one website refers to their sins as mexican-style copper sinks but they're coming out of China you have to ask lastly I get a lot of questions about what my sink turned green absolutely not it takes years and years and years for copper to turn green and when it's used in a sink environment you're constantly washing off the top layer of the patina which is the part that would eventually after years turn green so your sink will stay that caramel brown indefinitely it's a lifetime product so I hope you've learned something

from one piece of metal and then hand hammered by skilled artisans so that means that each sink is unique and artistically crafted they also feature what's known as a patina or the oxidation process that copper undergoes when it's exposed to the air the patina is live so it will continuously darken over time think of it like an older penny what's great about the hammered finish and patina is that they work together to help hide any small scratches that might occur over time on top of that our copper sinks are quiet and fully insulated with padding if your washing dishes are running the water you won't hear any clanking or a tinny sound from the running faucet the padding also prevents the buildup of condensation underneath the sink in the cabinetry each mr direct copper kitchen sink is

also I will say it's made of material of like composite I think it's right I bought it online I put I really want a white sink but I now really regret about these purchased because they think stains a lot so if you have a ceramic thing it's so much easier to clean you just wipe it it was just maybe scrub it with some normal solution maybe baking soda and that's it they think needs extra work so usually it will be like stain from tea or coffee like some kind of innocent stains but they stay there and also if you counted how many stay of stains I said you're gonna have price now I'm gonna show you how I clean it just using one product yeah you agree and it's no scrubbing so easy let's look this is the thing it's got some bits of food little bit of coffee and these kind of black stains from heavy objects it's got quite a difficult to clean the name of the sink is Reggie Noakes or you know I think as French I don't know how to pronounce it but this yellow stain the mold from the water round and honest seeing on sink area and on the windowsill we're gonna try to clean it first I'm just using hot water and a scrubbing part and cleaning away just food residue a little bit of fat and stuff to prepping for cleaning my sink you can totally skip this step again I'll show you that stains then not too coming away from just normal scrubbing and here we go using just normal bleach here's the cheap bleach yeah I'm just using this silicon pad it is so much easier to put the product on the sink with the silicon pad so it's not soaking all the product in and the second thing my second little thing you can see is another option what you can do you can just fill the hot water and put a liquid of disinfectant which you can buy in a baby section to disinfect baby bottles you just fill it up pour a cup full of this liquid in and just forget about it for five minutes five minutes later you can see I didn't scrub anything it just kind of wiping there's no strong movement say it's no part I don't put any power into that to scrub and five minutes later you have nicely beautiful white sink [Music] now I'm just cleaning or bleach away put a little bit more on the windowsill they CA was so wet and we had so many kind of mold around the house and bleached worked really well for cleaning that even I really really don't like bleach smell that make me feel nauseous but I use it sometimes to clean really bad mood and it works well the stains also clean with bleach or disinfectant liquid is working really well for that he is the final result you can see more went away left a little bit staying mold on the windowsill but the ants good [Music]", "0Ohf6t7BYgU": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so in this video i'm going to be decluttering and organizing underneath the kitchen sink i have some old shower caddies and then i bought some command hooks that i'm going to be using for storage on the doors so i can store some of my smaller items such as my sponges and my dish pods for the dishwasher alright guys so let's get right into it [Music] [Applause] i'm running out of time every day goes by so fast and every moment counts baby i don't wanna miss a thing we can sleep under the stars we can sleep under the stars or hang out in hotel bars driving somewhere in your car we can't sleep under the stars we can sleep under the stars under the stars [Music] we can do what we like like [Music] we can do what we like baby let's make the most of this night come on baby take my hand and we don't need to do the things we don't want to do we can't sleep under the stars or hang [Music] we [Music] so i've definitely been meaning to go through my kitchen sink now for a while i have old product that i don't even use down here anymore so i'm just decluttering and getting rid of that and then all these cloths here they all don't need to be in this bin i have some kitchen towels for hand towels that are in here that really shouldn't be in here and um some of these clothes i don't even use so i am repurposing them and giving them to my husband for his garage and for things that he's going to be doing outside so there's definitely going to be a lot less cloths in this bin at the end we can sleep under the stars we can sleep under the stars or hang out in hotel bars driving somewhere in your car we can sleep under the stars we can sleep under the stars so i had already tried this on the other door so i knew how to show you guys how i did it so all i did was i took the caddy i popped the suction cups off that would originally hold on to the tub and i just used those holes and kind of just eyeballed where i wanted the caddy to sit on the door you know making sure it's gonna close without any problems and not hit anything you know as it's closed so i just put the caddy up there and use the holes put a little pencil mark in it so i knew right where to hang those hooks [Music] [Music] so since i have a garbage disposal i had to use a shorter bin on this side but it still works out because i just store all the taller things around my garbage disposal and i'm still able to use a bin in this area and then i'm just kind of organizing things in the relative that i use them you know the things i use more often up close and um then since i have a little bit of storage space in between the two black bins i am using this little teal container to store some products as well [Music] [Music] [Music] they don't know so i love this idea with my dish pods they don't dry out so i don't have to worry about having a lid on them i'm not sure if others do and that's why they put them in containers underneath their sink but i just wanted something simple and i like this idea that it's just smooth i can open the door grab a dish pod and load the dishwasher up and then i also can see how many dishpods i have left before i need to order more if you are looking for similar bins like the black bins i'm using underneath my sink you can find them at walmart or target and then home goods always has containers like the teal ones that you can use as well and the shower caddies are a couple years old but target has some similar ones that you can use in the same way if you don't want to you know spend the money on a plastic caddy you can also just use some baskets from the dollar tree and use them in the same way with the hooks [Music] so as you can see the after looks so much better it's definitely way more organized and functional at this point so guys i hope this has given you some motivation to declutter a space of yours and i hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you like content just like this and i will see you soon [Music] don't you worry you'll find someone someone who", "0h1CXIiYCJ0": "I've got a Han stainless steel sink this is the model Zr 0:06 it's a 60-40 basin so we'll see what the box contains so right on top of the box they pack the template which you can use for the cutout if you need to do so on the countertop underneath the template we've got some styrofoam packaging on top underneath the piece of styrofoam there's a cloth bag that the sink is wrapped in which protects it from any scratches or harm or anything after pulling the the sink in its bag out of the package you have the two bottom protective grates and the kitchen sink strainers as well as any hardware clips and things along that line and then here is the bag again that contains the sink so we'll go ahead and unpack it out here in just a moment here's the bottom of the sink looks like it's sprayed with the sound deadening insulation or whatever they use to keep the sink quiet as well as the the pads at the bottom here that will help dead and any sound and also they're included on the top here too two pads on each side so it'll just help keep the same more quiet then around the the actual sink side this is the sink itself smaller side 40-percent the larger side the 60% creased on the bottom to help drainage so on a nice nice finish overall in the in the box that says sink accessory is the clips for the bottom of the sink to mount it to the underside of the counter as well as the anchors there's also a box that has the stainless steel care kit which inside has the lotion or product that cleans shines and protects and a looks like a microfiber cloth as well as some gloves in the strainer boxes looks like there's two different types of strainers from what I can tell this one has the basket type that goes into the I think you have to push it down to get it to seal this one here has the sealing type stainless steel lid and a basket that you can lift out for the strainer but if you have a garbage disposal you'd use the hardware that's supplied with that other than the protective layer bottoms here that's the contents of the whole box", "T6PhyEsIc_0": "hey guys and welcome back to life love and endless laundry thanks so much for coming by so today I am going to be working on the cabinet underneath my kitchen sink because it's kind of become a disaster and a collector for all my cleaning products and I just wanted to organize it a little bit and toss out the stuff that I don't use anymore and just clean it up so then it's a little bit more user friendly so I'm gonna start off by showing you the mess that it is right now and then take everything out sort it go through it clean up the cabinet underneath and hopefully organize it a little bit better so I just picked up a few cheap things for now to keep it organized just to see if it works because I didn't want to go out and buy expensive like containers and stuff because I really don't know I've tried to clean this and organize it many times so like I said I didn't want to waste money on containers and stuff that weren't going to work for us so I'm starting by taking everything out and then just piling it up on the counter so that I could go through it and get rid of what I don't use anymore or you know empty bottles and yeah and I also wanted to clean up the cabinet and underneath because it looked like maybe there were some spills and probably a few leaks so my goal is to go through the rooms that need to be decluttered and finally get them in like an organized state where everything has a place and things aren't easy to find things are easy to be put away you know stuff like that so I'm starting small so that so that I can get this done and then hopefully motivate myself and get the ball rolling to tackle the larger projects like after this is going to be my linen closet alright so I got a few things to organize the cabinets nothing huge yet because I didn't know you know what like how many bins and stuff I needed so I'll just show you the small little haul that I got I got this I just got this from the Dollar Tree this is for you know the bottom part of the cabinet so that it's easy to wipe up and if there's any you know spills or anything or water leakage it'll catch on that first hopefully and then I was out of dish soap so I got some dish soap some sponges magic erasers but those are the off-brand and they work just as well in my opinion and they're cheaper I got this to hold I have a bigger one of these it's to clean out like the water bottles and stuff and I never like to lay them down flat I want them to like drip dry and then this is one I got from Goodwill not too long ago these I thought were super cute I got from the Dollar Tree I just thought they would be perfect to hold sponges or whatever rags I got this for some of the cleaners and this I was hoping for that really pretty blueish green color but my Dollar Tree was out of them and this is from Dollar Tree this is from these are from Dollar Tree this and this are from Walmart they were 55 each like I said I didn't want to go crazy getting stuff to organize my cabinets until I knew pretty much what all I needed so let's get started I'm gonna start by cleaning out the bottom as you can tell there's some spills and then we'll get to it I hope I'm not the only one who has a gross covered underneath their sink if I am then please look away now cuz it's pretty gross under you but I like to show you guys up close because sometimes I feel like the camera doesn't pick up all the dust and dirt and everything that I'm cleaning up and it I don't want it to look like I'm cleaning and clean house because that's definitely not the case and I wanted to use something like this instead of like the mrs. Meyers multi-purpose cleaner just cuz I don't know what spilled in there and you know I'd rather really clean it up I never use this stuff before hopefully it works sound pretty good I just needed it you know it's done I didn't need it to cover the whole thing I just wanted it mainly where we mainly where we've gotten the drips before and where I keep most of the cleaners most of the spray cleaners anyway I know this is probably not everybody's problem but I had I have a deer and rabbits that eat my hostas in my front yard every time every year and it's right when they become like super full and really pretty and everything and then the next morning I'll wake up and they've chewed them down to the ground and I tried everything that's why I had like that because I tried different Pinterest recipes and stuff like that and to spray on the plants to keep it so the deer didn't go after them but they still did but with this this stuff is amazing and I've had it for a couple years and it's like down to here and I just spray it and it's supposed to last a couple months and then you know if you have a good rain or something then go ahead and spray your hostas with it after the rain but this stuff is amazing the stuff I'm not a huge fan of so I'm just gonna get rid of it this stuff we use around the house so that no little bugs or anything get inside in the summer well spring mostly you guys all know that and one of this stuff and this is a full one this one's almost empty love this stuff these aren't many like go cheese right here and the degreaser that is for the carpets this I just keep under the sink because I like to add this to boiling water and along with some like lime peels and vanilla and what else oh and cinnamon and it makes your house smell really good without spraying all the chemicals that's just to clean like your TVs and stuff this is awesome to forgettings stickers and grease and gum and stuff you know out of fabric and all that or off of if you reuse bottles it gets the labels and stuff off really easily this helps great stuff off pans few of those so I would love to know what products that you guys use you know for cleaning the house and stuff which ones are your favorites for certain jobs you know like dusty mirrors degreasers that kind of thing I've really fallen in love with Magic Eraser light lately I think they do an awesome job with not a lot of scrubbing power behind it [Music] I would like to know what kind of plan do you guys use or put in place to tackle the organizing and decluttering or even to just keep on top of it because I find I just it's not something I like to do so I put it off a lot and I just I really want to stay motivated and keep on top of things so that I can get the rooms just like I said more in an organized state so everything has its place but so far I really like how this kind of turned out I used I put the stuff in front that I used that I use almost daily and then the cleaners that I use less often behind it in that little purple container and these containers that I got from Grove collaborative I'm going to put in each of our bathrooms that way I can put the bathroom cleaners into those containers and keep them under the cabinets in our bathroom just to keep them out of this cabinet and also just so that they're in the room that I need them in so I'd like a hook here for you know like a washcloth that I'm using throughout the day and then I can toss in laundry when I'm done and also like a bag here that I can store like rags and stuff that I've used throughout the day and just dump them all into the wash you know at the end of the day and wash them I don't know just a thought but I want to get a couple of hooks there and also maybe one on this side for gloves now I have a hard time finding gloves because I have to use non latex because I'm allergic to latex alright guys thanks so much for watching and don't forget to subscribe and click the notification Bell and click all that way you are notified of any videos that I put up or any content that I put out there thanks so much guys I really appreciate all of you and don't forget my next decluttering video will

under sink kitchen cabinet it is really quite the mess I'm embarrassed to say that I have not touched it probably since we moved into this house so it is long overdue and lately I really been in the mood to get areas of my house organized and I thought that possibly I would do a series of videos on organization so let me know if that's something that you guys would be interested in let me know in the comments below or give this video a thumbs up I'd love to hear from you guys but first things first let's let me show you the mess that is underneath my sink okay so here is the mess or disaster I should say as you can see there's no rhyme or reason absolutely no organization in here everything is just kind of thrown in here and whenever I need to reach something as in the very back I end up knocking everything in front over like a domino effect it's just a mess so what I'm gonna do is pull everything out of here and weed through what I want to keep first what I want to get rid of and then try to come up with some type of organization system for this space here are the bins and baskets I plan to use to store and organize all of my cleaning supplies this stack of baskets I purchased from home goods and I don't plan to use all of these baskets for this cupboard whatever I don't use I can use in one of my other cupboards or closets but I thought these were really reasonably priced that these two were $12.99 for the set of two and they're really quite large I like the size of them and then these mesh wire baskets were $7.99 and they're really large these ones are 15 inches by 13 and I really like the look of it and then finally I purchased this little shelf from the Dollar Tree for a dollar and this basket here for a dollar also from the Dollar Tree so first things first I'm just going to pull everything out of the cabinet and put it up on my island that way I can see everything I have and it will just be a lot easier to weed through and pick and choose the items I plan to keep [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so now that everything is out of this cupboard and the cupboards nice and empty I'm going to go ahead and clean the base of the cupboard because there is some residue on the bottom here obviously some products had spilled so I'm going to clean that up and then I plan to put this vinyl on the base just to protect it from any future spills [Music] [Music] [Music] and with you okay so now that the cabinet is nice and clean and I've sorted through all of my cleaning supplies I'm then gonna organize the supplies into the bins that I purchased and I forgot to mention a couple other items that I purchased to organize this cupboard and that would be this basket here which is another mesh wire basket and this was from home goods it's $6.99 for this and then it also went up to my local grocery store and purchased a tension rod because I've seen on Pinterest some organization pictures that have used these tension rods for the under sink cabinet and I thought it would be it I thought was a really good idea and so I thought I would give it a try so yeah we'll see how this works out so I'm just gonna go ahead and sort all of this stuff into these bins [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I'm really happy with how it turned out you gotta admit it looks a lot better than it did before I really liked the addition of this tension rod I can use this to hang my dish towels and just cleaning products that I use frequently and want to be able to access like instantly I love the look of these mesh wire bins and I just put my most frequent cleaning products that I use in the front of the bends and then the cleaning products I used least are in the back this narrow bin I have my sponges and my dish soaps as well as my Swiffer duster refills that I use frequently and then I love this little shelf it just adds even more storage to this space because I'm able to put these disinfectant wipes on top of my dishwasher pods and finally I have this little wire wastebasket which I will use for my pop cans I probably put like a plastic bag in here though but yeah this will be a nice storage for the pop cans until I take them up to the store to return which I'm so bad about keeping up with that we have bags in the garage right now that I need to take back to the store but I'm really happy with how this turned out and now I'm so motivated to go and organize other areas of my house [Music] so that's it guys I hope that you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up and hopefully it has motivated you to organize a cabinet in your house and if it did please let me know in the comments below I love hearing from you guys and I just want to let

So I'm assuming that that is working. So let's get some lime juice out there. Get some more.. I've got some spots I want to get around the fixture. So I'm going to see the toothbrush Now we're just going to run some warm water and and rinse it all down and see if it made a difference Well there you have it, I hope on the video you can tell a difference because I can tell a difference I don't know if it's so clean because of the lime and baking soda or because I spent like 15 minutes like scrubbing this thing either way It definitely seemed to help.

a copper sink is the fact that it's somewhat fragile although you're putting on a good protective coating generally over time it's going to get worn away to some degree so you have to take some precautions when you're when you have a copper sink and one of those precautions is the water that you use it may have a lot of calcium in it and it may have a lot of other minerals in it so saline so you might want to consider maintenance on it quite frequently and some of the things that you might use is your toothpaste your to toothpaste has a phosphoric sometimes so you have to and hydrogen peroxide it always has generally if it's going to have any whitener in it it's got to have hydrogen peroxide in it and plus it's a paste which means they have to have a filler in that filler sometimes could be pumice or some kind of an abrasion material some kind of a sandy material so when you're using either toothpaste this new whitener that you a lot of people are buying today has a lot of things in it that are going to take the patina away so these are going to abrade the patina over time you can see here in the bottom of the sink where over time this is what would have happened it starts to abrade the bottom as as all of those chemicals are going down into it one of the things you need to do is always have your water running when you're washing your mouth out after you've used toothpaste the whitener or or some kind of like Listerine for gargling you know for breath so those are things to really consider also what you're going to clean your copper sink with is really important you want to very mild detergent you don't want some of something like this which has phosphoric acid in it this is a tile cleaner but you might decide you're going to use it on your copper sink be very careful what you use read the label first before you decide to do it here's another one this has bleach now we're going to get ready to actually bring this surface back to the patina that's on here by the way this patina is a ferric nitrate patina and it was put on hot so they heated up the peened copper and then they sprayed on their ferric nitrate maybe ferric nitrate ferric chloride which we sell on here but you cannot heat up your sink because it's already installed so now you're going to have to go back and do kind of a faux finish you're going to put something on there it's going to sort of duplicate the color that's already there and then after that we'll seal it okay so all your sinks come sealed but some of the sealers are better than others if they just used a straight lacquer it's probably not going to last too long if they used a two-part epoxy urethane or something like that a urethane resin it probably last a lot longer so now we're you've got it cleaned so we're ready now to put on our now you have to consider that when you do this you're going to have to let this sink sit for about 12 hours before you can put on your seal coat and then you're going to have to let it sit another six hours before you can actually use it because the patina it takes a while for the patina to bite into the metal this is a patina we're going to use this is our deep brown patina from sculpt Nouveau and these are little stippling brushes sponge pressures now the Betina is only going to take where it's exposed copper where the patina is still there it's not going to do too much to that because it probably has a protective coating over it hopefully you can see this one is already starting to work you might have to stipple it two or three times so I might come back in an hour and redo this again now remember it's only going to take where you've got clean exposed copper where you've got the patina and you've got to protect you coating over it it's not going to take and so eventually what we'll do is we'll make it all look the same that's going good okay okay this is about 10-12 minutes and you can see that the patina is starting to take and you're starting to get some of the Browns and blacks as you have all over the piece here the base is coming nicely too so it's looking very good once you've got the color you like or even close to it because you can kind of come back in now with a sponge which you're going to need to do anyway to neutralize you've got to neutralize this patina now so once it's done we're going to have to come back in here and neutralize with a sponge with water before we decide on putting our top coat on and that's probably about the only thing I can think of that would happen would be that you if you did not neutralize this patina and you put on a top coat you can maybe get a whitey film because you didn't number one another thing that's helpful to would be would be to take a hair dryer you can do that even though it's it's a sink you know install you can take a hair dryer and warm this up just a little bit that also will accelerate the patina you could actually take a hair dryer and accelerate this patina little bit just by putting a little bit of warm water on I mean warm air onto it also warm air or water either one would open up the pores of the metal and it tends to cause it to bite better because as it opens up this patina kind of locks in a little more and when it cools down it it kind of closes down on the patina okay once you've got the patina that you like color wise and you can look at it and see if you like it or you're even close then you're going to want to neutralize it so first you probably want to neutralize it with water and so you would just Pat it over by the way these are facial sponges you can buy at the drugstore they're really nice for doing little delicate work so what I'm going to do here is kind of neutralize what I've done so tell me if I like it or not and I'll let this dry again you could use a hairdryer if you wanted to let this dry and see if you like it if it's going to you can always pull this back a little bit with some for art steel wool to but you have to be very careful how you're doing it particularly in the beginning if you are thinking well this black is too dark I don't think I really want that and you want to pull it off you could do it before out steel now but I would probably wait for one day what that does is lock the Betina more into the metal and therefore when you put the steel wool on it's not likely to take it back to what it was in the beginning I'm going to bring in just a little bit of steel wool and and then I'm going to take it back just a little bit okay water a little bit not too bad I'm pretty good I'm pulling off just a little bit okay now we're going to let this dry and I'm going to put on a solvent thinner that's to clean it off make sure there's no water on there and then we'll do our final step so now the patina is done and you can see it's matched up pretty good all over you can see it's kind of a little dull in this area here that's because this area here has a seal coat on it and this doesn't have anything yet so once we put our coatings on it our lacquers this whole color will come to the other color that's here the other thing is when you steel we'll remember I used a little bit of stool make sure you blow all that steel wool out of there because if that gets trapped underneath the lacquer there's a chance you're going to have little squiggles of rust so make sure you get all of that steel wool little particles that come off of the steel wool pad then I'm going to warm up this for babies so also hopefully below ah remember you could have used this before you put the patina on and if you did that warmed it up then you would the patina would accelerate quicker this is the lacquer that we're going to use this happens to be a what we call our patina stain so it's our clear guard lacquer with our dot solvent dye in it and it's really nice and we made it very light M that means it's it's not very strong so that you could put it on over and over again and build up color if you wanted to let this dry and you'll notice it all looks about the same can't tell what we do now if you didn't want any of this little black area if you notice there are some blacks that's because the patina is pretty strong you can dilute the patina 50% and again that will make it it'll take longer to get to the color but you'll have more control over what color you get after we've put the patina stain on Brown then we're going to put a coat of clear guard lacquer over the top of that we'll just make that whole area a little bit stronger because abrasion is going to come in it eventually and it's going to get a wore down over time but this will help stop that", "KeU7jm7SMrk": "[Music] hi guys my name is abdullah surprise hope you all doing good uh you might be wondering that why i'm at this spot the washroom right now and you might be wondering that why didn't i why did i put the pants up like this let me tell you why so my mom had a problem for two weeks that our bathtub is actually clogged and she tried couple of things but it didn't work then i asked my friend you know who google and a short couple of videos when i saw it then i learned the method of unclocking the bathtub so um it's actually sunnah to um help uh it's actually so not to do the chores by ourselves and i'm really i'm i'm feeling very happy that i'm helping my parents out and this is

thought that i should actually share this video because some of the homes like they have a problem for the clocking the backup you know that's why i thought to share this video i actually tried it before too once now i'm gonna i thought to share it so that's why so the materials i'll tell you what we need so we need baking soda which all homes have because we need this for baking and also a vinegar we all have that in home and so first of all we put three quarters of baking soda in a cup and then uh then we put it at the bathtub the sink we put it like really lightly and softly and then we put vinegar once we put that then we wait for 15 minutes and then we put boiling water very hot boiling water once once we uh put that then we uh on the uh then we on the pipe so all the water the hot water then all comes down and then we have to wait i'll show you right now how it does let me just open this so here i'll get this so right now you see this is the bathtub and this is the sink right now so i'm gonna put baking soda here you see i'm putting right here over here in the sink i have to like click inside have to do it fully once we do that then we put vinegar i have to put it really i'm gonna put some more oh now i'm gonna stab it a lot of them right i have to stop it a lot of times so it goes inside i'm gonna put some more it's stuck inside yeah i think it's gone just do it with my hand yeah i think that's yeah so i filled it i'm just have to start this okay so now i'm gonna put vinegar so i'm just putting it so right now i'm just gonna put it very carefully and it's just over here so it's just putting inside here and yeah that's how much i put now i'm just gonna go to the bathtub and very carefully i'm going to put this at the baking soda see the chemical reaction it's happening it happens can you see it's really cool isn't it wow looks really cool we have to we have to leave this for 15 minutes and then we have to put boiling water yeah i'll just put it all so now we have to wait for 15 minutes and then we put boiling water and then it's done 15 minutes break is over so now i'm going to put a boiling water in the sink over here boiling water hot

your kitchen sink now most places this is perfectly legal okay as long as you're using latex paint okay now first thing to do is turn on the water kind of lukewarm you take that brush and start cleaning out the inside of that cutting pot get the majority of that paint wiped off of there you're not going to get it all off of there then dump it out now fill the bucket up with some water start taking those bristles really kind of jamming it down against the bottom of the bucket alright that's how you're going to start working the paint out from the base of the bristles and that's the hardest place to get it out of so just start jamming it down there in the water work it around roll a little fresh water in there okay now this brush is maybe halfway clean alright now it's time to take the wire brush give it a good wire brushing all around the edges get all the paint that's goofed up right in there now this one's not too bad sometimes they can get really goopy in there all right now you can see there's some old paint there from some paint job a long time ago that's on the very outside of the bristles that's not down there in the base and sometimes you'll just have a little residue left over from job to job but as long as not down in the base of the brush it's going to be ready to use again once you're done with the wire brush there's another hit now it's about time to give this bucket one final rinse and set it over here on a rag I'll let that dry for a couple days that paint will dry out and it'll be I use again now we're going to get this brush really clean a pack now what you do is just run it under the water just like that and keep squeezing it just like that okay you need to keep doing this until the water running down that handle is clear because that will mean that the base of the bristles is cleaning and that's what you need if you leave the paint in there it will ruin your brush okay so this brush is looking pretty clean now what I'm going to do now is spin it out and you can buy a brush spinner if you want you can just take it and go like that now the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my brush comb and you get those bristles nice and straight and then I'm going to go put this brush back in its cardboard case I'm going to hang it from a pegboard in the garage let it dry and it'll be ready to go the next time I'm doing a paint job", "jZ0KV6Pe66g": "today we are installing a vintage sink into a rebuilt countertop we're going to do after we get the sink into the counter with some help on this thing you want

Dina Raquel I'd like to talk to you a little bit about the history of the kitchen sink well none of us are old enough to remember I think but the original kitchen sink was basically a farm saying it was hung on the wall and the height was adjusted to the height of the user may men years ago in mass production came into play and some Brainiac I'm sure it was a man decided that kitchen cabinets should be 36 inches tall well back then most women were well under five foot five and found that the standard height for kitchen cabinets was so far too high our current generation is tall enough to find a 36-inch countertop quite comfortable but in that process sinks evolved the original set in kitchen sink was basically a large single bowl sink and as things progressed and people demanded more a double bowl sink was infected you washed on one side rinsed on the other keep in mind only the wealthy had double both sexes as things progressed dishwasher was invented and the folks that manufactured and designed sex looked at the dishwasher I thought whom this double sent doesn't quite make sense anymore so let's make one bowl larger than the other and the other smaller we can put the garbage disposal in the small one and use the large one to wash in well honestly folks that is the most ridiculous thought that I've ever heard of think about if you watch all of the things in the dishwasher that will fit and the only things that you watching the sink of too large for the dishwasher they're not going to fit anybody's doable say I don't care how large the bowls are in my opinion double bowl sinks became obsolete with the invention of the dishwasher or at least a dishwasher that worked as well as today's dishwashers and let me go through the process that I believe most people would use with a raquel sing we like using large single bowl sinks with right rear or left rear drains now that's key now think about how you do dishes now I guarantee if you using a large pot or a pan or a cookie sheet anything that's relatively large you can't sit in the bottom of your current safe so you pick it up with one hand and you spin it around and you watch with the other and then you try rinsing it while you're spinning it the sink or the the item that you're washing is half in and half outside of the same actually doesn't work all that well a Rick Allison those items place it flat in the bottom of the same it will not cover up the drain and it allows you to use two hands while you're cleaning and scrubbing and it allows you to keep the item inside the sink while you are rinsing it off so you don't get spray all over the countertop the sinks that have rear center drains are just as difficult to use as a center drain st. as soon as you put anything large inside that safe you're covering up the drain it makes absolutely no sense that with center drain or a rear center drain in the same that should have been obsolete fifty years ago it makes no sense now those of you are skeptical and I'll bet most of you are you're probably thinking well how do I wash my dishes and set them off in the other sent to dry or drip dry simple all you do is buy an inexpensive drain rack at something like a linens and things set it on the left side of the sink inside the sink you watch on the right the garbage disposals in the right rear none of the water is going to get on the items that you set off in the left side of the same the big advantage is if you want to watch a big pot or a pan or a platter you can remove that drain rack and you have the full bottom of the sink to work in you can't do that with a double bowls in now some of you like to soak things on occasion or if you have fresh vegetables you want to put them in in a sink to rinse them off and swirl them around in the water topper where buy a piece of Tupperware that's large enough to fit on the left side of your sink use it on those rare occasions that you need to soak things and then stick it under the sink cabinet when you're not using it at least you're not paralyzed the rest of the time when using the sink with a divider that gets in the way of everything now Raquel steaks are custom and that means that we adjust the depth of the sink to your height the location of the dream to your handedness if you're right-handed I guarantee you when you scrape dishes you'll pick up the dish with your left hand and scrape with your right hand and if you look at the motion the natural ergonomic direction is the right rear of your safe there's a small side benefit to that as well if you look at the direction that you're holding the plate when you're scraping to the right rear it faces that corner so if you're spraying the the plate to rinse it off the spray isn't going to hit you as it would if you had a center drain and you're spraying sideways the spray ricochets off the dish and gets on you I know that's happened to you so i invite you to give us a call we've got i love to talk about 60

though is in the cleaning process and there are known chemicals or products that can damage this fine delicate finish this delicate finish we referred to as a patina can vary between Browns all the way up into dark or into black coloration this patina is very fragile to misuse of chemicals or also food products so lemon juice will damage this patina or lemon wedges also cleaning products that contain ammonia and Ajax or other kinds of harsh cleansers even the green green pad also the whitening toothpaste that we are using more now the residue from the whitening toothpaste if dripped into the copper will make a bright spot in the copper restore it yourself products has come up now with a do-it-yourself patina repair kit which will restore the beautiful patina that you purchased for the original product and this is a very simple the easy to use product this contains specialized patina restoral formulation also an abrasive pad for scraping and scuffing the damaged area we also have a complete instructional kit in the package let's see how easy this is to work first we take our little scuffing pad which is a light abrasive pad in this case we have a nice patina here but we're going to damage it on purpose to show how this product works what you're going to do is you're just going to scratch it out here as though this was a damaged surface make it somewhat irregular now again this can be caused by improper cleaning and maintenance or just by a chemical that may have been put onto this surface so we need to do then is to scratch some some metal so the chemical reaction will occur what you're going to need to supply in this kit is a hairdryer your your personal hairdryer it's quite ample you're going to put on a high setting what we're going to do then is we have an ampule we take one of our ampules we have a little button right here in our ampule little flapper valve we're going to depress this flapper valve which is going to allow the solution to go down into the foam head and now we want to saturate the foam head get some of the liquid down into it by pulsating the the ampule we're going to turn our hairdryer on and what we're going to do is we're going to focus our hairdryer on to this copper spot or damaged area that we've scuffed let us sit on there for about 5-10 seconds until it warms up and then we're going to apply the blotter which holds the chemical and we're going to then build up and rotate heat plot heat blotter heat until we get the coloration that we prefer let's see how that works and what we're doing here is building up a color let's turn this off and look now how it's looking the intent here is not to necessarily perfectly match the surrounding but to obviously remove the bright spot that has occurred through the damage and to accelerate the coloration to return and due to the fact this is an irregular patina it's a very natural earthy patina no two areas are ever the same so whatever results you come up with our ideal it's perfect now if ice did this a little too much and I wanted to lighten that patina down a little bit I can actually scuff off some of this and bring up some of the brown real light scuff you actually bring it back to a little bit of more of a brown color it's less of a black okay what we're going to do now is take some water this chemical will continue to be active until we neutralize it with water so you're going to just put some water on with the towel from a water source obviously your sink would be a good water source this will neutralize the acid so will can discontinue changing color on you we want to get all the residue off now we're going to do ideally purchased in the process here are some wax at your dealer this is a wax for copper it's a copper enhancer and this little discoloration will go away with the wax as I apply it this is a brown colored wax the best time to apply this wax is when this surface is hot still from the heater now what you're also going to do is you're going to do this and let it sit for a little while and build up with colored wax usually you let it sit about 20-30 minutes and you will come back and you'll buff this so if we leave that for about twenty or thirty minutes and come back they will develop a nice firm covering for this area for those of you who have stainless steel products throughout your house including sinks appliances and barbecue grills restore it yourself brings scratch be gone for repairing scratches stains rust scratch and discoloration from brush stainless steel appliance and surfaces look to our other videos on scratch repair using scratch begun now that we've had a few moments to let this surface dry and the wax to dry this is what we looked at and this is our final finish to this copper restore process it's protected with wax so you'll help to protect the area that you repaired it's always good to monthly use waxes using a wax that is proprietary for copper on this sink to keep these surfaces at their Ultimo", "ILJC39JrAtA": "hello welcome back to home fix my name is Loretta this channel talks about all things in and around the home and sometimes outside of the home but today we're talking

can just find what I need at a moment's notice it's just taking me too long it's just driving me nuts so what I'm gonna do is go ahead and get everything cleared away cleaned up and I'm gonna be using

looks like after I've removed everything wiped it down really good and laid down new contact paper on the base of the sink cabinet base now we're ready to return everything back into its place you want to talk about solving a problem on home fix we talk about solutions to problems common problems around the home and one of them is trying to get to things way back here in the back and you can't get it you lose it you buy extra because you didn't know you had it this is a two-piece shelving system I just purchased from HSN it comes preassembled basically it's a set that includes access for items that pulls forward if widens it narrows depending on your access needs and it's secure so there's two bars one bar here in the front one bar in the back that goes horizontally I secured it with a 3m tape that comes with this and you put the tape underneath the bars or you can screw it in and the screws come with it but I chose to go with the the tape and this is going to be so nice for me now pulling out my pots and utensils can't wait to get to using this so here is the space adjacent to the under sink section I have my two pullout drawers here that are this is just gonna be so nice in here are some tools I have down size and when it comes to the amount of items I have I decluttered throwing out things that I don't need I don't use I haven't used them in a while goodbye so there's more tools there in that box underneath here are two large Tupperware boxes that I use quite often and then here are more tools and then my ninja food II top for certain functions that that is necessary here is a push light I purchased this from Dollar Tree so that's nice to help illuminate the space and I'm really liking this so far this has really simplified things for me well you just can't get better than having a nice affordable under cabinet makeover and that's what I got here so as I had stated most of these things came from Dollar Tree so it's very affordable I'm to the 3m hook there actually it's not a hook it's a clip and it's holding my gloves so a nice way to showcase that and keep them out of the way on the door there on the right I'm using a soap holder as a sponge holder and I took out the little suction cups because they don't really hold well in general they don't for me and I put hooks instead so in the cabinet I have separated everything out I can see everything I don't have to dig there on the right I added another push light a deodorizer as well to help keep the space fresh it's nice because in that dish there that round white dish up front that holds brillo pads and also dishwashing soap I like that I have the sponges up front because that's frequently what you you replace often and use often there on the left is a nice little handle to hold my little items that I use most often so that would be like the window cleaner and multi-purpose spray things like that so yeah that that little container there is holding the brillo pad and the dishwashing squares I just like how the the larger items are all over to the right and around the back so that's the bulk items there up top are my magic erasers underneath that are trash bags and then underneath that additional cleaning solution items like and comment now check me out in the next couple days because I will be uploading a few Valentine DIYs very very cool DIYs so make sure you

minute to do it you need three really easy to find simple painting supplies everyday dish soap antibacterial wipes and Barkeeper's Friend which is the magic ingredients I love this stuff this is not sponsored I'm not being paid to say this might use Barkeeper's Friend almost every day clean something if you don't have this in your house you need to have this in your house it works on pocket pans it works on bathtubs it works um same source stainless steel appliances let's get started so just to be really scientific about it I'm gonna actually use the stopwatch on my phone to time how long it takes me I'm pretty sure it takes about a minute but let's let's prove or disprove that so start all right take your just up to a generous world around the sink grab your bar keeper's friend sprinkle that around so generous application of our first press then grab your antibacterial light and start scrubbing out the sink it helps actually have a little bit of water in there too well according to my very scientific timing this simply a minute so I was a little bit off in my in my estimation I guess it takes closer to two minutes though I was chattering a little bit while I was cleaning it it probably usually takes me about a minute and a half so we could say it takes about two minutes takes up one minute either way it's really quick it's really easy I think it's really important to keep your sink thing especially if you wash you can't wash any dishes in there I really like to know that it satisfies so I'm not washing my dishes in the nasty germy thing so how does things like this even if you don't have a sink like this give this a try it's so quick it's so easy it makes a huge difference and I love the way a really clean shiny sink looks in a kitchen it's kind of an easy easy upgrade without a lot of work thank you so much for joining me today", "Lah72JlYPq0": "this welcome back to country maintenance well had a clogged kitchen sink drain here and this is where these most often clogged up is at the tea it actually gets a bit smaller at that point and it's usually potato peels and carrots that have like a tougher material it's harder for them to pass past this point but it also happens with rice or anything that anyone feeds the monster too quickly I sometimes get away with a little bit of stuff if it's done really slowly but that being said it's better to just throw things away but the real point in this video is the pressure test you know it's one thing to fix it and unclog it but what's horrible is if you fix it and clogged it only to have a leak you didn't realize now here's regular pressure running some water through and you'll see nothing showed up now if you look real close you might see a little bit of something on the side there but nothing really showing up here's reamping most of the water and so even that's putting some you know water flow through there but nothing funny shut up turn it off and now I'll show you the pressure test that's when I'm gonna struggle but what you want to do is put the plug in and fill it up aways then pull your plug and turn the disposal on this will force the water through much faster put it under a little bit of pressure and usually that'll make the tiniest leaks show up there goes probably caught I said that backwards you want to turn the switch on and pull them oh yeah Magali tighten it up and will reset and this one I wanted to make sure the beveled washer that the pipe wasn't cut too short sometimes if the pipe is cut too short the beveled washer can push off inside that wasn't the case on this one this one was fine just got a nice straight shot going in you don't want to over tighten these either these are all hand tightened and hand loosened and the plumbing can actually crack if you over tighten it so it's better to check it and test it and then tighten as needed so here goes beginning pulling it that's in it still got a tiny little leak tighten it by hand and I'll test it again again it's better to test the system test it this way and then tighten it as needed so that you don't practice the plumbing or break the plumbing you know one mistake people make with plumbing is thinking they really have to wrench things down and really tighten things down not the case at all the right amount of force to get the job done without breaking anything thanks for watching come few minutes over now that's the value of the pressure test and can prevent a lot of property damage right now you see why it's so important look at this and it doesn't hurt to test the other side in similar fashion but on that side you won't be able to run the disposer to just fill it with water and then pull the plug plug it in fill it with some water pull the plug at least give it some pressure to test the other side for the garbage disposal side pressure test one two three make any little tiny leaks show up right away prevent property damage and have people happier with your repairs I give you a letter the week", "fJmCRpFfzKQ": "[Music] six six hi guys my name is nidhi and welcome to my channel today i'll show you how i declutter and organize my under the sink area as you can see this is the place where i keep all my cleaning essentials and with time it does get messy and really cluttered so today i'll declutter this area give it a good vibe and then organize it back again so that it becomes easy for me [Music] my idea of decluttering is first remove everything inside the cabinet so i'll remove all the items one by one and also remove the sheet which i have laid down as it has become a little wet and dirty as well so i'll remove the sheet and i'll put a new sheet in it [Music] [Music] this area does gets dirty so i am spraying my degreaser all the places and i will give it a good scrub and then i will wipe it all so everything the sink and the walls and everything i'm just cleaning [Music] six six when it comes to sheet it has become dirty it might not be visible but yes it gets wet and the area below is also dirty so i'll give it a good vibe now these are the stains which doesn't go but i'll try my best to scrub and remove it but still some remains and that's the reason i put a sheet below so that it looks beautiful when i organize my cabinet again now this is the sheet i'm talking about it is the non sleepable mat and it kind of absorbs water as well so these are really cute and easily available everywhere i purchased it from day to day but it's also available on amazon i'll put down the link below so once you put it it really looks beautiful and because of its anti-slippable the products also stay where they are and they do not trip over each other [Music] this isn't a sticky mat so i have placed it with the help of cello tape so that it remains in its place [Music] [Music] so now i will group everything together so that it becomes easier for me to place it back so what i will do is i'll start with the laundry part this uh i mean i have grouped it together this other toilet cleaning stuff this is dishwashing liquid with the sponges different types of this is again the laundry part which i was talking about and the red basket which i will use for storing all the items back in the organized manner [Music] as you can see i am using the red basket to store items which i use on daily basis which consists of my doll and my laundry items and gif and glass cleaner so these are the stuff which i use every day and that also two to three times a day so this gets really messy and those things i put it in red basket so that it remains organized all the time and the stuff which i'm not using on daily basis i'm just putting it uh as it is in the counter and it won't be touch every day so it won't get messy again quickly so this is the way i am organizing my cabinet and it will remain good for at least a month i think so for the doors what i am doing is i am using this kind of storage box where i can use all my sponges for a quick use it really becomes easy when i place it on the door so that the extra stuff remains back side but the one which i want to use will always remain on the door so well this is how i'm sorted at least for three months at least till the time i do not buy new supplies especially the red basket which i have made is for my daily supplies so the other items remain untouched and that's why it remains organized for a longer period of time one more thing which i want to add is that it remains organized because i put a child lock on this cabinet so that my children not open it and did not mess up this area and this is the rubber band with which i secure my cabinet so that it doesn't open and they cannot destroy it well so this was the last hack which i shared with you guys now i hope you liked

about the easy steps for installing a new kitchen sink as you can see we've removed an old sink and so our cutout is already in place but before we get started these are the tools that you'll need a Philips head screwdriver and an adjustable wrench now it's very important before you begin the project that you open the carton and inspect the sink for any damage or dents that occurred in shipping begin by evenly placing all the mounting clips around the underside of the sink the easiest way to install a kitchen sink is to amount the faucet and the strainer drains while the sink is out and on top now lower the sink into place in the cutout from the underside rotate the clip into position and tighten the screws using the Philips head screwdriver next connect the p-trap to the tailpiece and the drain outlet once the faucets hooked up turn on the water supplies a check for any leaks now our project is all complete your kitchen sink is a busy place in your home so a new sink will make any task that much easier", "rD81O2WB7Kw": "[Music] hey guys i hope you're having a wonderful day so today is a video that i need to do out of necessity and i mean my counters aren't looking amazing right now but i do have places for everything on my counter currently what i don't have places for is everything that's in here i don't have it organized it's super cluttered and i think this is gonna be a really satisfying declutter slash organized under the sink because i'm gonna get rid of so much stuff because right now in my head there's a cute baby behind me but right now in my head there's only 15 items that i can like think of that should be under here that i like actually want to be under there this is the start of my kitchen organization videos and i will be doing a lot of these over the next month because i mean i'm going to be posting a video almost every day if not every day and i'm really excited to get my kitchen organized so this one i need to start with because of how terrible it is and what's nice about this is that it's going to be a really inexpensive way to redo it because i'm just gonna be getting rid of a lot of stuff and i only bought one thing and this it's a bag organizer or like a bag storage for like grocery bags and this is gonna go on the inside of the door or on the inside of the cabinet i haven't decided yet but that's the only thing i bought and this is from ikea for like three dollars say hi baby say hi good job hi hi okay are you saying hi you ready it is so bad i haven't gotten down on this level since we've moved in basically and i'm just like looking at all this stuff it's giving me a little bit of anxiety like why is there a wash rag in there i mean that's not a bad idea to have some wash rags under the sink the biggest thing is all of these bags so that's why i waited like i was gonna do this video like two weeks ago so i'm gonna take everything out and we're gonna start um putting like items together and taking out all the ones that i am not planning on keeping at least not in here there are gonna be some things that i probably will keep like some cleaning supplies but i'll put them in the bathrooms where i would want them because right now they're not even being used they're not usable because i can't get to them so let's pull everything out oh goodness i'm running out of that i'm gonna need some more of that good to know and the tiniest little bit of dish soap like this can go with the dog stuff i'm gonna start putting these in here for now and i'm only gonna keep what fits in here like i'll pack them down but i'm only gonna keep what fits in here and then i'm gonna take the rest to like walmart for their recycling that they can do [Music] okay so this is something that i honestly don't even know if i'm going to keep because i got this from the dollar store so like the dollar tree and i got this probably when we first moved but i have a different glass cleaner that i like so much better this is like dishwashing liquid that i've had forever and it's gone so why have i kept this that's a good question all right so i filled this up can you tell and this is all i'm gonna keep of these bags because that's all that fits in here i'm gonna keep these ones and i'm gonna recycle the rest so that's still a lot of freaking bags [Music] some paper towels so i just had a doordash delivery and no it's not food i do kind of wish it was though because food is delicious so i had a doordash delivery and it was for something we ordered on walmart.com and we've had two of these now so far it's kind of interesting to have doordash deliver products but they're just christmas presents for people so that's what we've been doing is ordering christmas presents i mean obviously so let's get back to this but i just thought that was really interesting so this is where i keep all my cleaning products and i have a lot of extra stuff like like this i guess i could throw that in one of the bathrooms but i have like sprays and stuff for the bathrooms i don't know i have some ajax which i should use to clean my sink so i'm gonna keep that but like i haven't been able to get to it um some duster i think that that's gone so i'm gonna throw that away it's an oven cleaner cleaning paste from norway an empty thing of mr clean pads like why would i need that so i have some scoring pads and a couple cleaners in there and there will be a couple more but i feel like it's already starting to look better probably because everything's out of it this isn't the best system just because of how big it is compared to how much room i have under my sink with the disposal and the plumbing so i might need to find something that's better than that some carpet cleaner probably need to use this at some point i think all we have is bags back there so i'm just gonna pull those out and throw them with all the other bags but i'm going to use this rag and just clean it out really quick and yeah which is always necessary when you're cleaning stuff but this is the thing that i'm like well will it fit will it not so let's see so it doesn't fit under there very easily and it won't really fit on this side either so i think i'm gonna have to find something better it's not gonna help having this bucket if i can't get it in and out you know do you want my phone will that make you happy cool all right this little thing is for my steam mop and i do want to keep it but i just i don't know if i need it in the most accessible place but kind of still accessible let's play around with this for a minute [Music] i have this dollar tree bin that i was planning on using for my pantry but i think i'm gonna have extras so i'm just gonna use this for my garbage bag so that they fit really good like look how good that looks with that like that looks really good right so just me i might use some more of these i have more of them so i might use more of them look how perfectly that fits okay cool okay i'm not going to let you see that i'm going to move those over just a little bit and see if i can fit that there [Music] maybe i think we're good so i'm going to show you the reveal in a second all right so i'm done and it didn't take very long i would say probably about 20 minutes but i could be wrong who knows editing lindsay tell me how long it takes um so this is the end product three two [Music] one [Music] oh my gosh that's so much better i think it looks really good but let's take you through so you can see what my thought process was okay so i have my whole bag tower right here and i know it's not like the prettiest thing but it is functional so i'm gonna see if it fits for what i'm doing because it has these little stickies on the back but i don't want to stick them on there until i know that's where i want it so i'm doing this as like a little trial run so then back there i have my little extra drying rack which i really like but i don't want to have out all the time so it has a home which is awesome and then right here i have my dish soap and my garbage bag so they're easily accessible but they're not like you don't have to dig through a box for them they're easy and you can see exactly what you're looking for and then over here i have my dishwashing gloves and just a few things in here like my little thing for my steam mop and then this is all my cleaning products that i use or plan to use this one i haven't used yet but i plan on using it on my sink and then back here if you can see that just back there there's a couple of things that we don't use every day but i'm planning on keeping so it's just some carpet cleaner and some all-purpose cleaner concentrates so this is my under the sink organization and i know that it's not like the most exciting thing but i am getting rid of this mini garbage bag so that's like as tight as i can get that and i'm taking out this bin and this is what i used to have all my um garbage bags in but obviously it overflowed and these are some things that i'm going to be taking to the bathrooms this goes in our dog bin like our drawer where all our dog stuff goes and then there's a bunch of recycling stuff like boxes and then some stuff to throw away i have garbage i have these which i guess i could throw in here in that bin that has a little extra room and then some stuff to wash and put in my other linen closet so i'm going to be throwing all of this away and recycling the container and if this is recyclable yep this is recyclable to anything that's recyclable i'm gonna try and recycle he was getting kind of sad in his chair so i'm really excited about this because i think it's gonna be really nice [Music] yeah thanks so much for watching this video and i hope i gave you some inspiration to kind of get your house a little organized and decluttered because having extra stuff really is very frustrating so i would definitely definitely say to try and organize your house a little bit with less stuff in it decluttering is completely worth it and i have been trying to do so the last few months and it's gonna take a long time the stuff you have really affects your attitude and everything so i'm gonna get

Stephanie Robinson today I want to talk to you about how to fix your stinky disposal so it's very common and I get asked by moms all the time how do I get rid of that smell at my kitchen sink and it's almost always that your disposal is dirty but seriously how do you clean a garbage disposal so want to start off by explaining to you quickly how it works so you understand the method behind my madness so this is a garbage disposal and a lot of people think that your garbage disposal inside horror films have helped with this looks like a blender it doesn't there's actually no blades inside this at all it's two compartments so this is the top compartment and inside here the walls of it looks a lot like a cheese grater and that catches food grinds it up and makes it small and there's plates between the two compartments that's spin and there what's kicking that food up onto those cheese grater blades and once it's soft enough wet enough it falls through those plates through here and comes out the side into your drain line so knowing that there's no blades in here that kind of thing but food gets stuck I mean have you cleaned a cheese grater it's it's not easy right so all that stuff is in here and that's where that smell is coming from but this doesn't come apart there's no way to take a part of disposal and clean it but you can outsmart it so one of the ways I recommend doing that is with a ton of ice so you're going to need three things for this project a ton of ice some citrus juice I love lemon juice I just think it smells good and salt and the process is gonna work where you're going to run cold water down your disposal we want to make your disposal as cold as possible and the science behind this is we want to get all the food particles that are in that disposal really really cold so they become hard and not soft anymore and they're gonna fly off of there and go down the dream so that's where the salt comes in salt is part of that science project that makes things colder faster which is a great tip for how to cool your beer quicker you want to have a ton of ice on hand this might not even be enough depending on how big your sink is if you don't have a ton of ice you want to have that salt on hand and you want to have that lemon juice so as that cold waters running you're going to dump all that ice into the sink at once with that salt with that lemon juice and you're going to put it down to your disposal as quickly as you can but not with your hands I want you to make sure that you have something that's safe that's gonna push it you know down make sure you have a cloth on your hands something like that so you make sure you don't accidentally put your hands down the disposal trying to push all those ice cubes in there so you want to get it as fast as possible and even after you hear all that ice done you may think of margarita I'm thinking margarita but when that ice is done you still want to leave that water running for a good solid 30 seconds on cold we want to make sure all of that stuff is been flushed out of there and pushed out into the drain system so if it does still smell weird after that there's a couple more tips so manufacturers will often recommend putting citrus down your disposal and this is a good idea unless you do it wrong if you do it wrong you're gonna create a stoppage so what you want to do is whatever citrus that you choose you want to cut this up into really small pieces and the idea behind this is that all of the citrus peels and things are supposed to be strong enough to help kick out that debris that gets caught in that cheese grater like surface but if you don't cut this up small enough the drain line behind your disposal won't be able to handle it and citrus rinds are pretty tough and it can create a stoppage so you want to make sure that you're cutting this into at least eight pieces and you're only putting one piece down your disposal at a time but you want to make sure you're following disposal protocol which how you use your disposal is first you're gonna make sure cold run cold running water is going and second you're going to make sure your disposal is before you put anything down it then you're gonna feed this in in small pieces and you're gonna let go through that whole process and you're gonna let that water continue to run for a solid 10 seconds after the citrus has gone through it and this is to protect your drain line after the disposal something else that really stinks on a disposal is actually that splash guard so the splash guard is the black piece you can't see here okay don't take a partner disposal at home but this some of them actually come off but the splash guard is this black piece that you see and most people think that that's actually to protect your disposal from things falling down it not even close if it was it would not have lost so many spoons down there what it is is a splash guard so instead of stopping things from going down it's stopping things from coming up so imagine a blender without the lid on it goes everywhere that's the same thing that happens here but what that means is that the surface underneath here is disgusting it's disgusting so if you're fortunate enough to have a disposal where that comes out of course you can clean it and mine comes out I actually toss it in the dishwasher every week on Friday but if yours doesn't come out you can still clean it but there's some guidelines I'm gonna give you one is to go under your sink and make sure your disposal is unplucked you never know what's going to happen and it's better to be safe than sorry according to every horror film I've seen with a disposal involved so you want to make sure it's unplugged it's not just the switch off and you want to have a very heavy-duty towel not a sponge to clean underneath there and I say not a sponge or anything small like that because you can lose the sponge inside the disposal dropping it you want to have something where you have a good grip because you're gonna be grabbing and twisting underneath there and doing your very best to clean it and you want to have a high quality dish soap to do that dish soap is great for cutting through food and grease and sludge that's what it's designed to do which is exactly what the build-up is under that splashguard so if those three things didn't fix your smell and 99% of the time it does it's an indication that there's actually another plumbing problem involved and you'll want to get a licensed contractor to come out they're like Robins plumbing and see what's going on it can be an issue with your vent you suction all kinds of sciency things and so definitely if these tips didn't work there's a problem but otherwise it's just maintenance at your sink and it's easily handled at home on your own so if this didn't fix it definitely give us a call at six two three four eight six four six five seven or you can reach us on our website at robbins plumbing comm and schedule a service call for a technician to come out and see what's going on but I hope this works and it's something that I recommend that you do quarterly to just maintain and keep your seeing smelling fresh and keeping it clean so it's not always such a tough job so have a great day I hope this helped [Music] [Applause]", "cMHsbWv54Zw": "most of our

organizing up under our kitchen sink it has been in this dysfunction for a couple of years and somehow i have become okay with the dysfunction of this but i decided that in 2021 that i was not going to be okay with this anymore and so today i finally decided to go ahead and declutter and organize it and this is one of those spaces that i find that i go in pretty much every day to either get cleaning products or garbage bags so it's a very commonly used area but i just never got around to organizing it today i finally decided to take action and organize underneath the kitchen sink so i hope you enjoy decluttering and organizing with me [Music] come [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] kid [Applause] i'll need [Music] [Music] [Music] on the way down [Music] get off the ground i need a place i need a change i'm [Music] [Applause] i haven't seen them in a long time [Music] so the under the sink organizer turned out to be exactly what i needed to store all of the items that i decided to keep because it has an adjustable height and length which is really good because there are pipes up under the sink and so you can adjust it for whatever size you need i i haven't since yet

went ahead and cleaned underneath my sink as best I could and I just kind of straighten it up a little bit I took all the buckets out and cleaned under the buckets cleaned all like the that somehow like I don't know leaks out of the bottles and I want to show you guys how I have it organized most of this stuff is from the Dollar Tree from last year's um you know however you know season or so they put out new bins and this was um my you know my favorite this is so beautiful this looks like something you would get from Target they don't have it anymore unfortunately but they do have a very similar stuff just with different types of patterns I personally don't like the patterns this year I don't like the like circles and stuff but either way you can recreate this same thing very simply easily and affordably from the Dollar Tree over here we just have to command hooks one has our latex gloves and they're just being hung up with a binder clip that also is green and I have this little dustpan which I use for like bugs and stuff for a dollar it's cute and it does come in handy even though it isn't the most practical thing then we have these big containers that are also from the Dollar Tree for one dollar each I love them because they're really sturdy I think that their look they would look really cute to hold shoes and beach toys in a child's room in a closet I love them but we're using them in here this hat this is all of our like cleaning supplies our mop stuff our Lysol I have a big thing of vinegar in the back and then in that other kit white lidded container I have some vinegar and water left over from dying Easter eggs that I've been using that's what I usually choose to clean with I don't use a lot of this stuff unless I have to but only moved in my my dad actually spent the whole first week cleaning this house after we bought it so we have a lot of cleaning supplies left over and I just corralled them in here and I'm slowly using them up I don't really I'm not a big fan of the chemicals okay so over here we have our garbage bags we have big ones and we have small ones and they're just in this really cute little container from the Dollar Tree I got this I don't know what this is called but you can find them for organizing like plates and stuff in your cabinets I threw them in here so that this could be more like drawers I could just easily pull them out and I think it kind of like pumps it up a notch it just looks a little bit classier than if the garbage garbage bag bin was just sitting on top it just looks just so much nicer in a little bit like higher-class it needs two bins also from the Dollar Tree the labels are from Dollar Tree - they're the clear binder labels I believe I've used these all over the house and I love them they're really really sticky one has magic erasers in it which we just cut up those are from the Dollar Tree they work fine and then we just have sponges also from the Dollar Tree okay I'm gonna take this all out so you guys can see everything and then behind here we have another one of those bins and I have all my backup cleaning supplies this usually has dish rags or cleaning rags but they're all in the wash right now and then I have steel wool and um there's called brillo pad not even sure so I have some other cleaning supplies all the lids are down at the bottom so I can easily just reach in and grab I have all my um leftover or back up my sleeve is filthy I have a home light of it backup scrubs and stuff so they're all in the same pattern I only have a couple left so I'm so bummed that they don't make them anymore and then I had just some extra clips back there all of that stuff is from the Dollar Tree so put that all back and I love that everything is color-coordinated I just wish that we would bring this back this is my favorite pad and I think it's like I said so gorgeous it looks like you came from Target in the back we have extra paper towels and then I have this cereal container that was also something my mom had given me from her house and I didn't really want to use it for cereal so we use it for plastic bags that we get from you know Walmart Dollar Tree and we use these for Marco's diapers and I also bring my lunch which I just find it easier than lugging a big lunch box so we use these regularly and it makes it really easy just to reach in and grab them if you put them in one by one then come out nice just like a tissue then I have another box down here in that same pattern and I leave my my homemade cleaner and my print rag in there for cleaning so everything I can just reach down here and grab it I don't want to think much about it and then I did just do dishes so this area is not the cleanest but I just have well it's not presentable I have my current stuff that I'm using to clean right here in a mason jar I have my little Pyrex container here with our soaps and all that stuff and that's just how I organize everything down here I think it's really pleasing to the eye I think it's really easy to find everything when mom comes over if she needs to find something everything's in plain sight and it was really affordable I didn't spend much at all just for the containers and a couple of the little accessories that I would have bought anyways so that's how I organize under the sink if you guys have any suggestions on what I could put over here I really would like to hang stuff on the back of the cabinets but I don't know I don't know what else I'm missing we don't have a dishwasher so we don't have any of those kind of accessories but I hope you guys enjoy let me know how you guys organize this tricky space and I will see you in the next video", "P2fsdKpEsms": "whenever you're washing dishes and start noticing that water in the sink is backing up that means that the drain is probably clogged this problem will most likely happen to someone who isn't careful and doesn't take the most basic precautions most of the time the backup happens due to a buildup of fat in the pipes when we rinse fat down the drain it's normally liquid that ends up congealing and blocking pipes pieces of food can also pile up where the pipes curves and keep the water from flowing so what do you do when this happens do you call a plumber or buy a chemical product to unclog your sink most people probably don't know that these products contain harmful substances that can cause skin irritations and respiratory problems in today's video we're going to show you a cheap natural alternative to unclog your kitchen sink all you need is hot water and salt here's how pull half a cup of salt down your drain and wait for it to drain down then boil 2 liters of water and turn off the stove as soon as the water starts bubbling pour the water down the drain slowly the hot water will melt the fat built up within the pipes after the water you boiled has all gone down the drain run some more hot water from the faucet just to make sure the salts rough texture will aid in removing any leftover fat you can also substitute the salt for dish detergent in that case boil the water as you did before and mix in a few spoonfuls of detergent pour the soapy water down the drain slowly the detergent will help dissolve any fat melted by the water and your pipes should work good as new feel free to rinse and repeat this process as it is not harmful or damaging like chemical solutions if the buildup is being caused by pieces of food your best option is to use a plunger and unclog it try that after pouring boiling hot water down your drain

"HnbXe5baCEI": "everybody potato this is my brand-new Signature Series workstation Thanks it is hammered stainless rustic back finish the moon water stone 5500 in brushed nickel and I'd like to demonstrate how this all works first of all this is my normal set up over here I just move this over here and do whatever I need to do let's just say that I'm cleaning something out is out of the way take this put it down in the bottom wash over here set things off over here if you notice my sponge caddy almost always stays in the sink like this it's virtually never in the way and this will sit right on top of it [Music] you say prepare meal put your food here and you can rip it off you notice [Music] don't spray on the countertop which your boot off chopped up chop scoop into your bowl and take this to where you're going to be cooking that's double for Thanksgiving now use this beautiful black walnut cutting board put the turkey on here carve it for these things will be here in the cutting over here and I have a big plate in here that I can take all the good stuff put it in there and again everything's going it's a brand new accessory called edible gray or shop foreman came up with this idea and basically drop this state of things and it becomes a secondary bowl and we plug in the bottom just plug this up and then good we start going up your string now you've got a double thing so if you've got those small items that you need to soak we think you've got a whole bunch of forks and knives or whatever you want to soak for a while because throw them in there stay with vegetables so if you've got vegetables check this out [Music] listen Sally died here so now you can put your vegetables in the strainer and once this gets full take a minute pretty big bowl dimensioning this is possibly 12 inches wide for about 16 1/2 inches front to back and we've got a way to lift this up if we get up under here all the way across on the front we're back with this up and if course this will also fit over here [Music] you can let these sit dry but this is you the ability is basically seeking a single stick and turning it into a double bowl string in just a few seconds I know if you're going to be able to hear this or check this out your that you don't hear anything sound at all you just hear water that's how well insulated our stainless steel things are believe it or not our copper sinks without any sound insulation are this quiet as well let's do the metal here we go we've got water in here now the fries got vegetables in there to get traffic for really wake them up really good probably fill the water off before that one is right there take them over here little just I pull the flood and just a second you're back to a single thing one thing I want to show you about the water so far it is the straight man question be that targeted you can ripped off the stake really five then I could be chasing pees around there for a half an hour I can do with the time there's a real white spring doesn't really push me around if you've got hot Japan you can really work them out easily sits a great closet this is perfectly counterbalance things wherever you put it get it up to the plate and it's locked in not going to fall down [Music] you [Music]", "38MtCMCNs0g": "how in the world did I get here I was trying to unclog the kitchen sink inside then this laundry sink outside decided to join the party unbelievable what's up everyone handyman double-oh-seven here and today we're going to cover why a sink drain gets clogged up how to prevent it from happening and more importantly I'm gonna show you four ways how to unclog it at the end of this video you'll have a sink that can drink up a river like this one that's right [Music] whenever you're washing over your sink and you notice that water is backing up that instant drinks probably clogged but what causes this when we wash dishes it's not just water that moves down the drain along with it our fat grease on oil it may be liquid at first but when it gets colder it ends up when dealing or solidifying and blocking your pipes pieces of food like vegetable fruit peel rice bits of pasta and also pile up where the pipes curved and keep water from flowing wait is that my wedding ring yeah how many of you had their ring slip off due to soapy hands and fingers while washing the dishes so the best way really to prevent clogging is actually using the sink drain cover it has tiny holes to allow liquid to pass through but screen small pieces of food jewelry and even toys so after washing take it out and dump what it has collected in the trash this way you'll be sure that these solids don't end up stopped in your pipes and don't worry I got my wedding ring back but if you're past prevention and you now do have a clogged drain and most likely widely watching this video don't worry I got four methods for you to try the first method is to pour 1/2 a cup of rock salt into your sink drain immediately followed by 2 liters of boiling water the combination of the salts rough texture and the heat of the water will help dissolve any leftover fat you can also substitute the salt with detergent since detergent has degreasing properties but in my case I already tried that in my drain romaine even after waiting for half an hour so I now need to resort to other methods the second method is opening your sinks p-trap which is a pipe fitting under the sink that looks like well the letter P this piece shape is designed to trap a certain amount of water within its curve which blocks any foul odor from the sewer flowing back up your sink thus it's called a p-trap now sometimes gunk grease and heavy solids pile up and also get trapped in this well P trap the good news is it does have a cap which you can remove specifically for emergencies like this so grab a bucket or a basin and slide it directly below and at the center of the cap because water will pour out the moment you open this up unscrew the cap counterclockwise my hand but if it is too tight you can use an adjustable wrench [Music] once water coming all the way up from the sink drains down inspect a vision for gunk and solids also pull out the rubber gasket and the cap itself and set them aside now rinse the p-trap some more by turning on the faucet and letting more water pass through then screw the cap back on clockwise nice and tight and that's tested water will drain this time around when I observe the water collected in the basin it was relatively clear no signs of solids or gunk or any sediment Lori told me the p-trap is clean so yeah as expected water is still not draining properly this means that the clog isn't anywhere between the sink drain here and a p-trap below most likely the clog is somewhere past the p-trap and this is a good opportunity to show you method 3 and method 3 involves using a plumber snake or drain snake this is a device used specifically to dislodge clubs in plumbing the plumbers snake is often reserved for difficult clogs it is a long slender flexible coiled metal wire with a broader gap between the coils at a terminal end you turn a crank to rotate it as it moves through the pipe if the clog is caused by a dense but shred herbal obstacle the snake might break it up enough to enable flow is small likely construction might be snagged or corkscrewed enabling us to pull it away as it rotates it also fails against the interior walls of the pipe scraping off minerals and oil so as you can see this is already the second time I'm inserting the snake the first time I did get some gunk out but I didn't think it was significant enough to actually block the drain pipe also for some reason I could not drill it in more than halfway as if the tip was bumping against the pipe intersection okay I'm able to insert it all the way this time and I'm hoping I reach the plug and either push it out or snag it by the corkscrew tip all right time to pull this out now it's a bit hard to pull did I get stuck okay it's getting easier to pull out for a moment there I thought a snake got tangled by the way you should not use narrow snakes in large drain pipes for example if your snake has a 1/4 inch cable you should never use it in a drain with a hole more than two inches otherwise there's a huge chance it will tangle on itself ok this time it looks like I've snagged a bigger piece of gum but will it be enough to create a water passage let's cover our p-trap and find out shall we and water still doesn't drain out at all and we're running out of methods well I've got one last option for you the plunger the cup is pushed down against the drain opening either pressing hard into the drain to force near in or pushing down until the rubber cup is flattened and then pulling out right in a vacuum that attracts material the bigger the cup the better and more powerful the vacuum ha and look how the water drains out almost instantly but it did feel a little too instant and too easy I have a bad feeling about this let's take a closer look so I'm right outside and down here is our drain outlet where water from the kitchen sink should have come out but nothing came out here recently even if we did see water drained down from the sink after using the plunger if the water didn't drain out here where did it go yep there it went and then some hits our outdoor sink which is back to back with the kitchen sink inside so how did I ever get here well I just remember that this sink and the kitchen sink inside are connected meaning they actually share the same drain pipe the temps below in essence our setup is similar to a dual sink the only difference is that one sink the some sink is inside and the other one is here outside so I've reduced the water here and have been added with the plunger for a while now but still nothing is going out the drain below and it doesn't feel like there's enough vacuum being created by the plunger until they made the connection that the outdoor sink and the kitchen sink are connected yeah and in order for me to create a strong enough vacuum one sink drain must be sealed shut so back in this kitchen sink I use its drain cover to seal it just push down and twist then add some water to check if the cover has created the watertight seal okay let me take a closer look before I go back to the outdoor sink good now back to the spout door same push and pull hard a few times now including the resistance I was looking for and look how that water drops instantly in those last few pulls I felt something gave in like whatever was clogging the pipes finally broke free and I can see a few solid stuff flowing out the drain making their journey towards the sewer good riddance let's put this kitchen sink drain to the test all right water is draining rapidly and I'm not seeing even a second of build-up at all straight in straight out and even the outer sink is draining beautifully in the drain outlet taking all the water out with no problem and those are the methods to unclog a sink drain and you don't necessarily have to do them in the order that I did just try whatever is most convenient or practical for you first this is handyman double-oh-seven thanks for watching [Music]", "k5dwxfduI_A": "hello guys welcome back to my channel and if you are new here thank you so much for watching today I'm gonna be showing you a quick and efficient way to organize your kitchen sink cabinet if you are like me and you have never done this before so as you can see my kitchen sink cupboard is a mess it's one of those jobs that I keep saying that I will do but I never get around to doing it so first things first I'm going to clear everything out of this cupboard [Music] [Music] oh my goodness I cannot believe I have finally cleared out this kitchen cabinet to clean the shelves I'm gonna use this beauty right here it's by fabulosa and it's a lemon sherbet Center disinfectant spray it smells so fresh and so clean it's really good cleaning product because it has no harsh chemicals and it's cruelty free and vegan friendly I've got this from the range and it cost just one pound so here is everything that I've got out of my kitchen sink cabinet and I'm gonna sort through this by throwing out anything that I don't want and they're making piles of what I do want and then put them in sections [Music] [Music] now everything is neatly organized into sections I'm gonna put the products into these cute little baskets that I got from the range I got four large and four medium they are sold separately so the larger ones are $1.99 each and the medium are 149 each they did have other colors there but I just wanted to keep them white so it looked nice and clean and now using my sections I'm going to add everything into the baskets I'm starting to add the sponges to the baskets some of these sponges were just lying around in the kitchen cabinet but then I found a whole brand new pack of sponges which really felt great to find it's kind of like when you find money in your pocket I recently changed all my prostitutes in microfiber ones as I've just realized how good they are I use them for everything around the house I use them for washing up for cleaning surfaces polishing dust in that are so versatile and I'm really get all the dirt out of everything is so much easier than using cloths I actually got mine from Aldi and I also bought a pack of ten of them from bnm they were two pounds fifty they were quite good bargain I thought and I also fought if I rolled them up and put them into this basket it will look a lot neater and also easier to find I found that I had a few little fiddly things that I didn't quite know what to do with so I put them all in a ziploc bag so they can stay safe and in one place and I can find them much easier now I'm starting to put everything away so it's nice and neat I'm using these large baskets and I'm putting them in the bottom shelf because there's a lot more room down there and I have to say it's so much easier by having these large baskets then having everything just flying around everywhere then I'm going in with the medium-size baskets and it I'm just filling everything else up anything that I had left over I'm just putting it into the kitchen tablet and it was just so much easier to even look at I'm just loving this so much so this is the before of my kitchen sink cupboard and now the big reveal here is the after I'm loving this so much I think it's just going to be so much easier just to pull something out from here instead of having to with all of that mess that was there before it's nice it's quick it was easy and it's now so efficient I'm so pleased with the way that this has turned out so I hope you

and to all the returning subscribers thank you very much for coming back thank you family for joining me today what i used to scrub the sink after applying it all over the scene this is what i used to scrub this you want to use something that's a little bit soft inside and then a little bit um a little bit hard outside there so let me go ahead and show you guys the thing how it looks like right now and then i will show you guys this thing after i have washed it and how it looks after i've washed it all right so finally this is how the sink looks like it's a double sink so this is how it looks like right now it's been about um two weeks seeing oh about a month since i last washed it using those products okay so this is how it looks right now and so i'm gonna show you guys what it looks like after we wash it okay guys all right all right guys so we're going to go ahead and pour the the product in the sink every way that you want to scrub okay guys so that's the product in the sink that i just poured this this container is already finished because i've been using this one for a while so i'm going to go ahead and throw this container away and this is another new one that is still full this is the sponge that we're going to be using it's very soft in the inside but the outside is a little bit rough um so that's what we're going to be using to scrub the sink okay guys so so we're going to add some more on the sides here like this okay and then guys we're gonna start scrubbing now remember do not add water at this stage just crop [Music] so you guys as i was saying you act more of this product as needed okay as you go along washing you add more of the product as as you need and remember at this stage you don't add water because if you add water it's like you're diluting it and if you're not gonna get the the results that um you're actually looking for so after you wash the sink to your satisfaction or you think that it's um to the point where it's clean then what you want to do is you want to be introducing water gradually okay like this you see the inside yeah introduce your water like this guys i'm already seeing some changes like anyway i expected it because i've used this product several times so this is how it looks like like as you can see how brown when we started washing this product was cream white or white or something like that but as you can see what is coming as you keep scrubbing is brownish that means it is the sink that is the brown the brown stains on the sink is it's been washed off okay guys do the same for the other thing guys like i said before you do when you're doing this you want to do it with some pressure that way you're applying enough um sauce as you scrub to get the brownness from the sink out we're almost done here guys so i'll show you the results of what the sink look like it looks like let's just i'll really show you guys what it looks like before we started washing oh guys i'm really really impressed you can't fail me anyways like i said i've used this product several times and that's why i'm recommending it disclaimer guys they are not paying me to do this i just found a product that works very well for me and maybe this can help you because before i found this product i was actually searching what i could clean my sink with guys as you can see if you look very well you see we don't have to do very well anyways you see how shiny the sink is now versus what it was there's something about warm water when you're doing this it's recommended to use warm water oh my god this thing is so clean now so i'm gonna dry it now we can actually see it's really spatting [Music] so i'm drying off all the water from the sink and voila so you guys to just to show you that this product is very very effective can you see how the water stays on this on the or inside on the sink now it's like if you pour water in the sink this is what you get see the water rolls into it it doesn't actually stay like i mean it forms um is it just a little crystals or whatever but yeah this is the result of the um positive effect of that product okay guys it's a very good product so if you've been looking for a product um to clean your sink and you don't know exactly what to use a product that's going to bring the shine back in your sink like a brand new thing then guys this is the product okay this is the product right

i'm so excited to get this done every time i grab a cleaning product from here something else falls over and i was over it i just want to make this space more functional for my family so if you have been enjoying these type of videos of my recent home projects make sure you're subscribed below my channel has been growing daily and i wanted to express how grateful i am for my new subscribers if you are new to my channel please comment below and say hi as i always say i truly appreciate all of the positivity the supportive comments and the love if you want to get to know me a little bit better follow my instagram i usually post daily on there about my lifestyle my upcoming videos will consist of more home organizing and improving so stay tuned [Music] so i did want to show you all the products that i planned on using so first i have this shelf liner from marshalls that i got on clearance for 4.50 which i didn't end up using later in the video but you'll see that then i have these two jars from ross for 2.99 each so i did have these jars in my last video which was the pantry organization so these are the jars that i had left over that i didn't use and then i also found these black pull out drawers from ross for 12.99 each i absolutely fell in love when i saw these because you can store so much in these with less space and then lastly i have these fridge and freezer containers it's a set of three for 12.99 from tj maxx so i know this is not a fridge video but um you can still use these as storage so let's get to it [Music] with you sometimes sometimes you go too far [Music] okay y'all so i have kinda mapped everything out um that was under the sink um so i have a lot of stuff and i'll probably need some more like organizers which i have i just wanted to kind of keep those for other projects in the house but i might have to dig into that um because this is a lot of stuff so like i said when you declutter and kind of organize things you kind of see what you have so i know that i don't need to buy any more cleaner for a little bit this is still kind of half full um this is pine salt and this is um fabuloso uh let's see i have wipes um weymon stuff stuff for the sink and the drain um a lot of like the scrubbers carpet freshener trash bags um so we'll see how all of this [Music] fits but you you want the whole world cool down sometimes i wanna give all of me sometimes i wanna scream oh my god you got me in so much trouble now now sometimes i just wanna tell you to stop so you don't go and break my heart i'm so confused can't let you go [Music] wake up sunshine leave your troubles far behind it's a new day [Music] don't take our chances [Music] dreams come true dreams come true [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] is [Music] you're ah best friend didn't care about the rules good on the weekends i'll be in fools drifting to deep space so brave and so stupid just like the movies [Music] you and me so clueless [Music] we were in [Music] think it will be [Music] today [Music] all right charles i believe i am finished i will give you some up close shots but i'll just kind of show you everything that i have so i absolutely love this thing from ross that was 12.99 the pull out thing so as you can see i was only able to use one just with like the pipes and stuff i wasn't able to put two in here but the other one i'll probably use for our linen closet so that is the next project but in my first one i just have everything that i use on a dairy my 409 my pond saw fabuloso trash bags lysol spray and some wipes back there i had to put it at the top and then at the bottom since there's not a lot of lint space i did put um like our scrubbers and things some baking soda and like the fridge and freezer freshener things in the first jar i did put some gloves in there for cleaning the second one is some dishwasher pods which we don't use a lot we don't really use our dishwasher i like to wash everything by hand um but if we do i know sometimes my husband like to throw a couple of dishes in there we have the pods and then in that third drawer um is the i think some matches that was already in here so i just kind of wipe the jar down and put that behind the other two jars and the first pull out thing so like i said these are really uh the fridge and freezer kind of organizers but who said that you can't use them for under the sink so on the first one i have just like our stoppers and then i believe like some drain cleaner things like that and then i have our um detergent uh not detergent do you do they call it detergent just so whatever um so i have those two right there and then i think i have some barbecue cleaner for my husband's grill um all of our wayman products so i have each one granted in stone the cooktop stainless steel and the leather one and then let's see what's this oh i believe that's some oven cleaner and then right here i do have our furniture polish so everything in our house is basically um kind of like the wood type so i do keep this on hand i'm always using this i think i have another one in the linen closet but this is definitely easy to grab so i have that one first and then i have a couple of the carpet fresheners so i think before i started the video um these are all in the back and i would just go to the store and buy more but now that i can see that i have three bottles of it then i don't need to buy any more so that's the best thing about organizing is that you can see what you have like i don't need some dish soap for a while i have two bottles and then i have one um up there by the sink when i wash dishes and then in the back i just have some bleach which i always keep on hand and then i think some dishwasher gel like i said we don't use our dishwasher a lot so that's in the bag but everything that i need is easily accessible which i love these are pull out they don't like get caught by the thing i believe you can still close yes you can still close the cabinet door and you can just pull it out grab what you need and then pull it back in and it's not it doesn't get jammed it's very like a smooth um pull so yeah i believe i am done i love the look and this is very functional for me and my husband we're the only ones here of course but um definitely easy to grab and just get what you need i'm almost out of this so um i'll probably use these two for now and then just replace this bottle but yeah i love it guys oh baby baby good at thinking out loud [Music] dancing in your head the devil on your [Music] shoulders don't you look at me like that when you wave my heart like that like you're feeling [Music] that sorry sorry", "Mr5nKl1ltfY": "hi everyone welcome to my channel if you're new here my name is

take everything out up underneath the kitchen sink to see what exactly I'm working with as far as soaps and sprays and all of that underneath this kitchen sink has definitely seen better days but I'm going to work with what I have and see if I can transform underneath the sink and make it just look easy on the eyes as well as easy access to soaps and sprays and I'm gonna go and take these baskets out so that I can take them outside to clean them they were way too dirty and rusty to clean in my kitchen sink so I'll just go ahead and take those outside [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I couldn't find the attachment to get a really good water pressure but I used what I had my thumb and it worked so I'm gonna go ahead and just clean these off and let them air dry outside since it's pretty nice out and I'm going to go back inside and work on organizing everything that I have from under the sink already you're a rebel and get it into travel you're kind of like a fire like a fire like a fire I'm predictable so original you will never backing down backing down down [Music] so dangerous I get this rush when I'm with you I go all in [Music] that's the way we keep our high movin like a hurricane [Music] [Music] now I had this vinyl paper just handy I didn't call it and buy it but you can they have so many different options and colors and patterns and everything if you just want plain this is kind of like a marble looking vinyl paper and I hit this have a sticky back is that super sticky but it wasn't sticking to the bottom of my sink and it might have been because I did clean it but maybe not cleaning it well enough it just wasn't sticking very well but it did lay very nice so I just went ahead and went with it but if you gave the surface a really good clean it might even stick really well okay these are the items that I have to work with for organizing underneath my kitchen sink and I got this little shower rod from Walmart it was just a few dollars and these I got from home goods they range from $2.99 to just 399 it wasn't too bad and they have just about every shape container color so if you're picky about colors or shapes just many choices that you have [Music] one kind of ignorant you don't care what people say people say people say I'm going crazy for your baby you know you making me feel asleep dangerous I guess I go all in true [Music] so we keep our high Joe ever since ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this was just an extra step that I did you don't have to spray paint if you have wire bins underneath your sink like I said if he lives up close you'd see there was like rusting and everything and I didn't have white I had every paint but white but I did have this heirloom white it's a satin finish it I didn't need to put a extra finishing coat on there so I'm gonna go ahead and just spray these let them dry and then bring them back inside [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] and just like my refrigerator I love to combine any soaps I have especially if ones are almost out but not quite I'll go ahead and just transfer whatever I can into a new bottle and then use the remaining stuff you know as soon as possible just so I don't have multiple bottles laying around [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and I don't know if you have a bunch of spray bottles but this shower rod thing comes in handy I found that idea on Pinterest and it's just a lifesaver especially if you have a lot of bottles I'm sure I have more throughout the house that I need to grab and I can throw up there but it definitely makes difference and I recommend it [Music] [Music] thank you so much for watching I really hope that you enjoyed this under my

working for me and i want to show you the progress of my organization now what i did was i took the bottles that i have my cleaning solutions in i took the coogies off of them and their uh rags and i washed them so i will be putting the coogies back on the bottles and organizing what is a little messed up under the sink so i'm gonna stop talking and just let you watch me organize [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now here is the finished product under the sink it works for me only thing is that the back of the wall is not painted like it should be and i'm not buying no white paint to finish it that's how i was when i got it but the only thing under here was something spilled so i cleaned it out and cleaned up the spill and put the things back in their proper places this system works for me i can reach in and pull out the spray bottles pull them out their towels that goes with them are in the bin with them the washer dishwasher pallets are right there everything is in its place and this system that i set up really really works so let me know down below what you think of my system under my sink i would love to read your comments and trying to find ways to make things simpler and easier for you is something you should strive for less stress when you know where everything is every item has a place that's my philosophy [Music] [Music] if you want to keep watching more check out these videos i have listed here in the end screen and you'll be blessed", "Kq6a4vQRkK8": "Hey so I usually don't like making videos like this but after researching how to get a clog out of the kitchen sink and watching other videos and ever really thought that my problem would be what it is so has my kitchen sink it's just after any one it so clearly we just check the see you trap down there you just take this out make sure nothing's clogging it um that didn't work so we use the plunger I have like a little sink plunger sorry if this video is terrible just use like a little sink plunger trying to get the problem out that didn't work then what we did was we checked our air vent to see if there's a clog in that so you get like a $300 extension ladder get up on the roof check your air vent it's on the roof if there's a clog things won't dream that was clear so um you know after that happened I went out real late one night and went to Lowe's and got like a hand-cranked like auger snake thing to try and like sneak out change this thing back in there to try and take out whatever the problem was that didn't work so after all that we called a plumber out that's going to cost you an arm and leg and I don't really like having other people mess with my house so call the plumber around they check it out that didn't work so it works temporarily he went in there is like this machine auger and was able to temporarily relieve the problem but two days later my sink clogged up again and I'm like come on you know like it's dirty I don't want to do this it's stressful you know you work full-time so I call them back and they're like well we can have him you know snake it again but that didn't work so I'm not spending more money to do that again so we plunge it we do all these things that it was like during overnight really slowly but then it was fab during just a mess so I'm going to show you what the outcome is because um you shouldn't really expect it sigh anniversary weekend of my husband's in the crawlspace right now six evening this is what we found when he finally went into the cross beast and ripped out our pipe it's completely clogged you can see like a really tiny hole or the other was yep all that grease and stuff from the previous owners because you know I'm vegan so I don't put grease down my frickin kitchen sink the a-looking pipe it weighs like 15 pounds completely called holding I'm cautious okay you clear everything up it'll start draining you can so we're replacing the pipe and you know I would just recommend don't let a plumber waste your money and use a logger there's like I guess pressure washers you can clean all that stuff out with everything are using an auger make sure they have a camera on it so they make sure they got the whole problem there's a word I want to tell you but I didn't think we'd be ripping out a 22 foot pipe of our cross face so I hope this helped somebody just you know before you call a plumber make sure they have all the equipment to do it you know we're not getting our money back that up because they said they fix the problem and they did not but you know the guy was like oh I don't have millions of dollars for a camera and all that fancy stuff I'm like page 105 dollars an hour I'm pretty sure you could get a camera for the end of your auger but you didn't and so I don't know but anyway little Tommy steam called and we're ripping out a 22 foot pipe so it's below grease so don't put grease down your sink don't put food and all that other stuff I have like these mush things to catch everything and of course I don't eat grease or anything like that so it's not like an issue but you know people that we got the house from obviously does so anyway I hope this helped again you know plumbers that has a camera or use like some sort of like water thing to clear it out like pressurized water we didn't have any of that plumber we call it obviously wasn't a very good plumber my mistake we'll call them again but now we're ripping out a 22-foot pipe for a kitchen sink that like would drain off and on so I hope this helps don't want to scare anybody it could just be a minor little clog or your you trap to be trained but again you know if you try everything and it doesn't work check your pipes down the crawlspace when we went down there to look it was actually kind of like the pipe was almost fagging so you know it was heady and as soon as we like cut the one end of it not we my husband cut the one end of it you just see like all this crap come out and then the whole pipe was just full of that so whatever little snake they put in there cleared like this much and you know there's this much stuff in there and of course once you start running the water all those little particles fall off again and you know you have your problem again sorry sorry I'm rambling I'm really nice really not right now and hopefully we'll get it fixed and it's helped somebody so good luck your sinks not draining it's not the end of the world don't get too stressed just check out all your options don't waste your money calling somebody if they don't have everything to fix your problem and you know just check your you trap try and plunge it check your air vent and then you know go in your crawlspace or basement or wherever stupid pipes you're sagging if they're heavy if they feel like they might just really be backed up and then maybe cut into it and look in there and then you know that's easy enough patch and then hopefully you won't have to replace like 20 feet of piping or if you do call a plumber because you don't have all these tools definitely make sure they have all the tools that you need I'm Homer didn't so we spent an armored leg and they didn't fix the problem so again thanks for watching sorry which time I hope this helped somebody bye", "AfECvdgzmds": "hi everyone I'm Andrew from worth every cent cleaning and

something every day we're going to be installing this but more importantly we're gonna be installing this so here's what's been going on this little cap has been loose since we moved in here about a year ago that's how lazy I am so today we're going to be replacing it with one of these soap dispensers and a future install we'll be doing the whole faucet system step one make sure there are no dirty dishes in the way the next thing we need to do is find out what's holding this on it looks like it's just unthreading two hours later let's see what was on the other half of that looks like this so it turns out it acts just like a normal pole you have a flat washer that gets pressed up against the surface the bolt slides through there and then this nut screws on from the bottom until it can lock it on top in between like basically we're just putting the same thing back in except now it has a reservoir instructions only does here's the faucet miscellaneous hardware well we'll save that for another episode you have the reservoir which threads into the bottom you have the locking nut the suction tube the rubber gasket and a foam gasket the foam gasket goes on so that it can now make the seal once we attach it but first we want to prep this area we want to make sure it's as flat and clean as possible if you have some stubborn residue a flat razor will take care of that right away all we're looking for is a good seal so the top half separates from the bottom half like so next you can place this in on this end we need to take the lock nut and the gasket and marry them to the underside now all we need to do is thread both pieces together it helps if you have someone up top holding it from spinning we're not looking to crush both ends just to make them watertight now we can thread the bottle into the bottom now we can fill our reservoir with soap I'm not a smart man anywho uh guys everywhere that's okay yeah everything's fine everything's fine yeah yeah it's fine she'll be fine it's fine it's fine just gonna work right there you gonna say it works I told you Megan I told you it would work now all we have left to do is to clean the sink again thanks for watching do something every day see on the next episode", "42gmfKn9lXE": "all right so i'm gonna share with you how i clean my sink this might be one of those really weird videos where you didn't think you needed to watch until you watched it and you're like oh my gosh this happened to me i don't think i watched a video but i remember hearing someone talk about it on youtube like probably like i don't know years ago so i remember watching someone and they were talking about cleaning out their sink and i think they said they used fly lady i've never like researched her stuff or looked up that information i just kind of follow along with i can't remember who it was that did this video but it was such a long time ago when youtube changes so much so i can't give credit to where i got it from but i know that they got it from like the fly lady so i'm not necessarily using like her technique to the way that she would do it so if you want to see how she does it you can go and check hers out but the one thing i got from it was bleach and soaking your sink so what i do and i don't do this often i know a lot of people are going to freak out when you see how much water i'm using but i literally do this like not even once a month like it's just when i think about it and i'm like oh my sink looks so gross so i mean you might not be able to tell because you're in the video but my sink like right around here gets nasty in there gets super nasty for me i have an under mounted sink i don't know what these are really called but this stuff gets super gross all around here and around those edges so normally when i wash dishes i just finished so you can see these are just all wet so i'm letting them dry i still have soap in here so after i wash i usually just wipe this all down and then rinse it off that's what i normally do now when i want to clean my sink this is what i do i'm going to fill both sides up with hot water and then i'm gonna pour a little bit of bleach in each side and i'm gonna let them sit for like an hour it is now 6 31 and then afterwards i will drain the water rinse it out and then sometimes it depends on how it looks but i usually do scrub it with something so usually i'll just shake in some baking soda and vinegar and dawn and then i just use my sponge and i scrub everything down and then rinse it out you can also use like bar keepers friends sos pads whatever kind of cleaner that you normally clean with i got this stuff off of amazon i clean my other sink in the laundry room i'm gonna try to insert that video in here to show how nice and like good this stuff worked so i'll put that video in after this uh clip and then you can see this stuff um it's on amazon i saw it on tiktok it's just this pink stuff it smells like i i the smell is familiar like a cleaning product familiar um it's probably like sos i mean maybe even smells like sos pads i don't know but i guess it's from the uk because there's a little flag on there anyway so i'm gonna fill this up then i'm gonna let it sit for an hour drain it scrub it and then it'll be nice and clean [Music] all right there she goes we're gonna let it sit for about an hour it doesn't have to be anything specific i did while i was sitting here use my little brush and scrubbed right here just dipped it in the water you can already see the stuff floating and i got right there and you can see the stuff right there for me they can get stuff can get under there oh that's did y'all see that so gross okay so i'm gonna let it sit and then i'll clean this and oh it's gonna look so pretty only a mom or a wife or a woman would say this about a sink all right so it's been here for about an hour not exact i usually use like a knife or a fork or something to get these out but i have a little glove and i'm gonna let these drain and these will clean these as well help get those all cleaned up and so i'm gonna let this drain and then i am going to scrub the sink all right so this time i'm gonna use bar keepers friend just because i don't i know that everybody can access this at the store not everybody can get the stuff for the pink stuff or anything online um but i'm just gonna sprinkle on the bottom i'll probably put my glove back on so i don't get it on there i also use baking soda and vinegar i might do that on this side so you can see that it works just as good but i've got this right here and once i scrub it i just let it sit while i do the other side these are some weird gloves i got off [Music] amazon [Music] all right so i did this side with bart keeper's friend this side with baking soda i went and washed my hands off in the sink in the bathroom just so that i could let it sit for a minute but i'm just going to rinse this out it's already been deep clean sanitized with the bleach so now i'm just use the uh whatever cleaner i had to scrub it with and sometimes i'll throw my sponges in there or any kind of like scrubby things i use in the kitchen just because those things get super nasty i also put my sponges in the dishwasher in between like washing them in the the actual washing machine but this is a great way to clean your sponges as well all right so i'm going to rinse this off really good baking soda it can leave like a little residue on it do you see how shiny this is people come on i put those in the dishwasher if you have one it helps a lot can y'all tell i mean seriously i don't wipe out my sink normally but i'm just trying to show y'all how nice it looks and i do these kind of like upside down so that they can dry that way so that the little plug is not like down in there okay tell me that doesn't look amazing guys like this is a thing that you want to wake up to in the morning like the excitement is real people like the excitement from a clean sink i love it so i also i take um i'll probably do this overnight do you see this i will put vinegar in a little ziploc bag and then i'll put a hair tie around this and tie it right here and then let it soak and then i'll scrub it with like a scrubby brush get that all clean i probably have been smart to do it with my sink but you guys do this you'll love it it feels like i just got a brand new sink anyway so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up and let me know if you uh go and clean your sink i want to see it send me a picture [Music] bye you", "5AMTLNNvgA8": "welcome back to my channel so in today's video I am going to take you guys underneath my sink so I can show you guys what products I use and keep underneath my sink as well as my organization and where I got everything from it's super simple organization it's nothing too fancy it's nothing over-the-top it's just simple organization which actually keeps me sane so if you guys aren't interested just keep watching I'm just going to start at the st. really quick I just want to show you what it usually looks like up here and I just have soap in this little built-in soap dispenser which I actually really love to have I just have a hand lotion and that's pretty much the little sink little drawer right here just keeps the sponge that I'm currently using and the the reusable cloths that I use to you know wipe down the countertops and stuff this is a dish brush that I've recently bought and then sink the stop and I keep that stuff in here and I really love to have this right here because it keeps everything off of the sink off of the countertop these little things that they're sitting in are removable for cleaning so I really love having that so we're gonna move on from how I organize things underneath my sink okay so here is an open you underneath my sink in how I keep it organized I do feel under here every day it seems like all day long Amitha always reaching for something I need it to work but starting on the left-hand side I have this really cool hanging basket that just simply came on the door so in the basket I just use daily granite cleaner by Method I dish soap and then I have the all-purpose cleaner that I use all day long every day it's really easy to reach for and I just like having it there so that I could put more things underneath to see these three products right here are ones that I reach for more often then the ones that are in the back I had the hard work hardwood floor cleaner all three of these bottles are Bona which is just pretty much like hardwood floor cleaner and it polish and stuff like that so then I keep the Windex in the front Clorox wipes and behind that it's just like carpet and upholstery cleaner and then bar keeper's friend I got this shelter IKEA and I do think it's working a container I got from Walmart and it's rose gold I got it they have a few different colors they have it in gold silver white black teal I did get the rose gold and inside I just keep the refills for our flip mop which we use on our hardwood floors and so I really like these so you can actually use one side as a mop and you use it with that phone a cleaner and then the other side you use it for dusting and sweeping I just keep the refill in this little gold basket there just like that so that's this side of the cabinet so let's move on to the next side this container right here from Target and I got it just to hold my my dishwasher cleaning pods I can't find any more with the teal tops but we keep those in there right beside it these two containers came from the Container Store in the first drawer I just really keep these reusable cleaning cloths and I really really love these and they come with like a bunch in a pack and you can reuse them and reuse those in there and these are just two different brands that are in here and this sure I keep extra sponges that I like to use in here are just disposable gloves and then in the fat portion of this drawer which I really like this drawer because there's sections in here where I could actually separate everything so here in this back section I just keep like disposal cleaners and then electronic wipes because we do keep our computers and laptops iPads and everything down on this level so I keep that in here and then underneath that I have a flush deodorizer which you know you put it in your toilet and I have a cascade rinse aid which just cleans out your dishwasher and then on this side are pretty much just for dusting polishing like your wood furniture and stuff I have been using these underneath my sink for so many years it's crazy but I love these and then here is another shelf that I was talking to you about earlier that I got from Ikea and underneath here I had the same rose gold basket but I just am keeping my extra dish cloths which I probably should buy some new ones and then just like I'm dish towels that I Drive my dishes with and placing them with new ones because they're starting to get really raggedy and then in the corner here I just have my drying pad which I sometimes pull out but and then right here I just have a dish towel I forgot to tell you that I also keep our our Glade refills in here we really like to use the glade refills because I feel like those work better than the back and Body Works ones and they just seem like they last longer that is everything underneath my sink I hope this was helpful and if you wanted some simple ideas on how to organize underneath your seat I really like this setup it's been working for me for a long time not so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you did give it a thumbs up go ahead and click that subscribe button if you want to see more videos from

for the gas company I don't know if you know them Oh father used to tell us a Buddy Holly yeah Polly want a cracker yeah Haven put the nozzle on Oh Betty all right let's turn on the water and see what happens yeah that's always just wash it wash it right that's all no big deal I won't even charge you for that washer seeing it was yours things in shape guys it's probably the little faucet here look at that thing in water that thing sprays all over yeah this yep you need a new faucet yeah you're gonna need to get you move this thing and it sprays all over the place see it yeah yeah yeah that's bad who you want to tell your mother yeah my brother bro unless you want you to do is you're probably having me do it there's usually a washer on the top and it doesn't have a warship was the washer for that no no I never took that upon mmm-hmm she'd have a rubber washer on the top that's not even there yeah I would assume we should have a water to keep it from sprinkle another way that yeah it had a wash it would probably be fine kinda weird there's no washing I got a rubber washer over here let me stick that you stick that rubber washer and then see if that will jacks and then see if it works don't get lucky yeah well if not we'll put a new faucet you know fix it a moment to fix this stuff if I can yeah what's wrong we'll fix this stuff you can fix that problem get it done get it right get that thing in there I don't want off the try yeah that's the old reigns of the spraying out could be the orange this thing is just flippin jack just jacked this jacks [Music] I want to put a no faucet on it I'll put a new faucet on it for you with a sprayer that's the best way will change the faucet out for you you can't have it flipping leaking all over the place like that for a guy ridiculous anymore fixing it expanding them all wings on a little bit beacon would work put a new faucet on you change the faucet out all right my little camera just keep working on my stuff was just smoked try the new one out see what happens [Music] owner/operator oh it's the least it's not leaking all over the place like the other ones I wasn't my you gotta spray now and everything the other one cuz I've even had a spray no well no it didn't have it didn't come with it alright you see the port on the bottom doesn't have a port to hook it up oh yeah never eyes never came with it so they just left it hanging hanging all right so that's it a lot better than another one he had so successful", "HmeXNbtHfGI": "[Music] hey y'all hey today's video is some cleaning motivation for you guys and today i am going to be cleaning underneath my kitchen sink and as you can see it is a complete disaster i have a terrible problem not putting things back the way they were and this is the result it is just um it's a complete mess and i am completely responsible for it because i'm the only one that goes down here and i'm the only one that is not putting things back the way they are supposed to so today i'm going to be tackling this and i hope that it motivates you to do the same if this is also on your to-do list as far as 2021 goals for cleaning motivation so first things first the first thing that you should do anytime you are going to be planning on decluttering and organizing a space is remove everything just so you can have a clean slate if you watched my previous video i did my linen closet and i did the same thing i think everybody in a mama is probably hip to this by now but as you can see i'm just taking everything out and you can kind of gauge that i'm just a little bit all over the place as far as things that i'm keeping under this thing i am while i'm doing this taking uh taking stock of everything that i have under here i have several soaps i love soap and you know when you catch a good sale from bath body works you should just take advantage of it and as you can see i have done that but yeah i'm just ready to get this thing started i already have my contact paper down because i have done this process in the past and um yeah it worked out well in the beginning for a couple of months and then it all went to hell in a handbasket really quick but um the white baskets that you are going to see they are from ikea i got them on sale a long time ago when they were like a dollar in some change you should really check ikea for storage if you can have it delivered to your house that is a problem for me so that's why i haven't ordered from them as of late but um i'm also going to not be putting those dish towel racks or they're not dish towel racks my apologies um they're racks for your dishes like if i hand wash dishes i usually let them air dry on these wooden racks that i got from goodwill but i'm not gonna be putting them back down here because they're just taking up too much space and um it's just not working out anymore so yeah i'm just going to store them underneath my kitchen island as far as my bins i got these on sale from marshalls they were stackable so i got two of them i mean you can't beat it so that's what i did and i also have two lazy susans i shared them with um i shared them in a video my previous one i did uh like a day in the life and me and lucas made muffins so you guys have probably already seen these if you've seen that video and i'm just trying to arrange them appropriately just to see how everything is going to work out in my mind and i'm sure you all have done this as well you just move things around to you think that you've got something that you're gonna enjoy and this is what i came up with um we'll see how everything fits when i'm liking it as far as how it looks the setup looks like it's gonna be functional and that is what i'm looking for putting everything back in place is going to be some some more of a task and a journey but anyway i'm just going to start with my acrylic bins i i just really want to make sure that that is where i store like anything pertaining to my dishwasher my microfiber cloths are going to be there i am just trying to make that aesthetically pleasing to the eye because hopefully it'll make me want to keep everything neat and organized y'all i'm praying and hoping that this stays good and clean and neat for a long time to come uh as you can see right here i am going to be cutting my sponges in half i was previously storing them in this jar but i no longer want to do that so um yeah i just cut them in half because i have small hands and i just think that they last longer when you cut them in half you're not using as much product and yeah they're recyclable so sometimes i will throw them in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds before i discard them maybe two or three times and then i'll throw it away but yeah i'm just going to be putting everything back you're going to see me kind of make some decisions on where i want things to go and i'm just gonna play some music and let you guys watch me put everything back in there [Music] there will be a time when you and me finally can talk [Music] i pray you'll find a way to man you're [Music] you can show me a new place [Music] if see me again if you wanna see me [Music] so i won't speak right now cause the words will tear us apart [Music] i really wanted you guys to see the before just one more time so you can all appreciate the the effort and the work that i put into it because it's going to really motivate you to do the same because i'm sure you have another space in your home that looks just like this and you have been putting it off but this is what it looks like now and i am in love with it and you guys know i put a light down here because we live in south carolina and we experience hurricanes all the time this last year we were fortunate and we didn't have any but yeah sometimes the lights go out we lose power and i just want to be um proactive this year and as you can see the lazy susans i have the soaps i have my main use product and the bins that you see in the back they are just products that i'm not going to be using every day but they are completely accessible and that's what i love about it um clearly you can see what everything is and i'm just so in love with the after of it all um this thing was a process you guys know i have two kids i'm a stay-at-home mom my my baby was crying and i had to keep taking breaks but i got through it and you will too if you like this video give it a big thumbs up consider subscribing and i'll see you guys in my next video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "BpLWr_B1pwU": "hi everyone I'm Eric from sink seal and I'm here to introduce you to a new product we're very excited about this is the new universal two and one sink seal kitchen sink gasket we redesigned the shape of the typical sink seal by adding these control grooves in either side allowing the material to pull apart some sinks such as this style with this integrated new channel uses this type of a clip system to fasten the sink to the countertop has a recessed void here that needs to be filled in order to seal the perimeter of the sink the shape right out of the package is what you would use for this style sink you're going to peel back the two-sided tape this is going to sit right in here against that u channel you're just gonna wrap the perimeter of the sink install it clamp it down and it's done but there's other styles sinks other materials that just have a flat lip style like this with an integrated flange and that's where the sink itself wraps over to the underside as opposed to being cut off on the U channel style and for this obviously this particular shape is going to be much too tall once the sink is clamped in place and you're going to end up having a gap between the countertop and the sink so what we've done is we've designed the material to be able to separate from itself I just grabbed in each section here pulling it apart you want to pull this off the entire length in the top section is actually just going to get discarded you're not going to use that at all and what you're left with is a nice low profile and because of the closed cell material this is 100% waterproof will not crack shrink dry out and as you can see on the package here resist it's a household cleaner solvents grease and mold one package will seal a standard double sink the way this works you just want to cut one end at a 45-degree angle pair of scissors is all you need to do the job you want to peel back the liner and you can see on this sink I've already installed most of the clips I just want to show you how these go on there's these little holes that that tab snaps into you just push that into place and that's it this leaves you about a quarter-inch space between the clip and the edge of the sink simply start your sink seal 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch inside the edge pull the backing off as you move along and wrap this around the perimeter of the sink there's not a lot of meat in the corners so you just want to keep it as close to the edge as you can without it sticking out you continue to do that around the entire sink and then once you set this in place and you tighten down these clamps this is going to compress leaving virtually no gap between the countertop and the sink while still sealing from water penetrating underneath", "i13H_rCzyII": "[Music] hey everyone so today I thought I would do a really quick just $5 under our kitchen sink organization today it's in desperate need of it and so I thought I'd use these little containers that I got from my daughter tree hall the other day the glass jar I believe just came from a local thrift store the bins and the white baskets everything you were just $2 [Music] the little non-slip liner is actually already at the heaven above already having unhip so we actually bought our house late last year and we are just now starting to do some much assad's man projects around the house as we have the time and the organizing of the cabinets and comment plenty of things out I haven't really been a huge priority but I'm glad that I'm able to have some extra time now to kind of go through and clean everything out and it's also probably because I'm starting my own st phase a little bit early this time around [Music] my little ones had a ton of fun helping out they have they always enjoy cleaning stuff out did you never know what kind of treasures he might find in this case it is a couple empty spray bottles [Music] [Music] Oliver has always loved playing with my hair I think is the cutest thing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one of my favorite things to do with my new sponges when I get in is to actually cut them into fourths I always try to keep it clean sponge on the sink and it can be pretty expensive if you're always changing them out so I found if you use one and cut them up at last obviously four times this work [Music] [Music] I really like the size of them they actually fit really nicely in my hand for when we are washing the dishes and I don't feel as bad really not to replace it with a new one [Music] another thing to keep on hand too if you don't have storage space are just cleaning concentrates I always keep a handful of these I have the glass cleaner and an antibacterial line and they're really handy so I have a store a couple of smaller little spray bottles and then just keep this I also like to keep my Norwex frags in a separate place so I always put them under the sink as well I actually need to get some fresh 22nd in pretty well hurtin but I love these and we don't have to buy paper towels or anything when we have these bright for surfaces [Music] [Music]", "oV83LRh0FM8": "all right I just sprayed some super-clean on my sink cuz it was nasty this stuff is awesome so I just sprayed it on left it there for like five minutes and look so you see all these lines those were dirt stains and now I can just go [Music] [Music] I literally have not seen my sink that's awesome Wow I wish I was taking a picture before this is amazing well I was do that and literally we sprayed it on there left it there for like five minutes it was brown but that's the power super clean", "34QBJC1EFCI": "[Music] hey guys Andy with rock solid surfaces today I want to talk about kitchen sinks because I'm all about the sinks about the superior are we ready kitchen sinks is probably the most overlooked aspect of buying new countertops that we run into you're just not thinking about it today I want to talk about two different materials that are used in producing kitchen sinks today the first material is good old stainless steel stainless steel sinks are some of the most economical sinks you can buy don't be fooled some of them are chintzy pieces of crap they dress themselves up in fancy boxes with cursive labels then they sit on the shelves and they wait for you to walk by so they can whisper sweet nothings in your ear like a siren calling out to a lost sailor don't be a lost sailor buying the cheap undermount sink is just not worth it you're gonna fill this thing with a hundred pounds or more potatoes water babies so let's design this for success by starting out with a good quality stainless steel sink so here's a few things to look for when you're trying to select the perfect stainless steel sink number one size matters the gauge matters which is kind of the size the gauge is a measurement of how thick the metal was that was used to make the sink the thicker the metal the better the sink but just like golf or super-secret spy guns the smaller the number the better for comparison a 16 gauge sink is 25% thicker than an 18 gauge sink if you're shopping for sinks at a box store you're probably looking at 18 gauge sinks at rock solid surfaces we only order 16 gauge sinks next feature on a stainless steel sink sound dampeners sound dampeners are basically foam pads with a coating around the underside of the sink that helps get rid of that chintzy metal sound that cheaper sinks are gonna have so if your goal is to annoy your neighbors while they're watching jeopardy next door you're gonna want to skip this feature but if you're a considerate neighbor you want to flip that sink over before you buy it the last feature of stainless steel sinks is the wide variety of styles and sizes that are available stainless steel sinks gives you the ability to get a little creative maybe a little funky when you're doing your new kitchen so that's stainless steel in a nutshell next we're gonna cover composite sinks maybe you've never heard the term composite sink or maybe you've heard it but you really weren't sure what it was you will be enlightened today I'm gonna cover everything that you need to know about composite sinks first composite sinks are made from 80 percent natural stone that means they're hard real hard like his heart is being nice to your Uncle Frank at Thanksgiving hard number two they're the most scratch and stain resistant sink on the market today notice I didn't say proof because we still have to use common sense right but seriously these things can handle kitchen abuse like Chuck Norris can handle a rogue band of angry ninjas and lastly they come in a whole variety of colors from black to white and all the neutral earth tones in between you might say composite sinks are the n-double-a-cp of the sink world if you hate Trump buy a composite sink I know I said that was only going to talk about two kinds of sinks but there is one more kind of sink that I would like to cover dual mount Singh dual mouth sinks are designed to be used in a drop-in or an undermount application they call them dual mount but they're not my experience with dual mount sinks has been terrible they rarely fit into the base cabinet correctly they don't leave room to properly mount the sink and the way that they're shaped just doesn't lend itself to being mounted underneath the counter it's kind of like buying unisex underwear sure you can get them on but it's just not pleasant so the next time you see that awesome sink deal at Costco look away and keep walking to the next Chipotle hummus sample station if you have more questions about sinks come in we'll talk to you about it we have dozens and dozens of options available we can find the perfect sink to fit your perfect countertops in your perfect kitchen Andy with rock solid surfaces your countertop and sink expert about the best two things about the sink you just got me doing that really [Music]", "EyyYEJ1lCCo": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be showing you how to clean and organize under your sink in a really affordable and easy way everything I used I either already had or I got really really cheap and the whole project and entirety probably took me less than 30 minutes to do so this is an easy project that you can tackle this week to make yourself feel better and so hopefully this video will give you some motivation and some good ideas the clip that I'm going to show you in just a second of me actually cleaning and organizing I have long hair and it's because I had to film it last week after I filmed it last week I dropped my camera and broke it so I had to do this part later on after I got my new camera set that explains that so let's stop chit-chatting and get to organizing the first thing you're gonna want to do is get everything out from under your sink and wipe down the surface area I'm using mrs. Meyers lavender scent and when you are decluttering your cleaning supplies make sure you throw away all the stuff that you don't use anymore because it just takes up more room than it needs to I got this two-tier tray from Amazon I'll link it below and then this basket I'm using I got from Target and I already had that so I didn't have to spend more money on that it's just something I had lying around then I have these two jars I got from Dollar Tree I use it to organize my dish detergent and my sponges I really like the look of using this jars better than the bags that the dish detergent comes in because it just looks a lot more organized little to no time to put just transfer the disregarding it over into the jar I actually got really lucky when it comes to organizing because I got my ideas from Bree an occasional bits of three and I did it my other house so I kind of knew what I wanted and what worked for me to do it in this house so I just had to transfer it over but like anybody it just gets so messed up in a very short amount of time so I wanted to or go ahead and organize it before it get messed up again then I got this basket also from Dollar Tree I got Commun strips and I'm gonna put it on the side of the cabinet door and I'm gonna put instead of using cleaning laws I just haven't used latex gloves so that I can throw them away I put a box of latex gloves in there and the Swiffer WetJet pads I put in there as well the little caddy but you see rather teacher tray is what I use for everyday things so that it's easy for me just to take it out in from room to room [Applause] [Music] so this is the finished product I use the two-tiered shelf for things that I use the most often so the top shelf is my missus Myers and the Dom and then I use those every single night and then on the second shelf I have my dish detergent and sponges I'll also use every night and I put chocolate balls to aesthetically make it look nicer and then I have my daily cleaning caddy for weekly cleaning my cleaning supplies in the basket and then my Swiffer pads and latex gloves in the hanging basket I hope that you enjoy this video I hope that you find it helpful make sure you like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video bye guys [Applause] [Music]", "cCTupjSmdj4": "hi I'm Dorian Slade with Kailah copper the parent company of Mexican home march and copper restaurant tables copper sinks are very easy to maintain using my own soap when we clean our copper things we use dish soap and a soft sponge we never use harsh chemicals which can damage the patina nor do we use scratch pads or scour pads such as these because they can scratch the surface just a soft sponge and some dish soap I have it rinse it and you're done from time to time we will use a furniture polish to give it a nice luster and to protect the patina but this is not necessary every few months we may use a furniture wax paste wax like the Johnsons paste wax to further protect the patina over a longer period again the beauty of your copper sink protect it with smile soap and water thanks for joining us you can visit our websites at mexican home art comm or copper restaurant tables comm for more information you can contact us at eight six six two one six one five nine five", "lvUCp35a7vE": "copper sink repair in this video will show you how to take a copper sink and bring it back to life an important note is we want to turn the AC off especially if you will be working near one of those vents where it sucks the air in we don't want any of the clear coats we need to spray to get sucked in and then it just gets dispersed throughout the house so be wary of where you need to work and just make sure that we're not working near anything that's gonna help kind of move the clear coats or toners around the house first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna tape off this is a granite slab but we're gonna tape it off just so we don't have to worry about it especially when we get down to using the Brown patina saying I don't want to have to worry about getting overspray or anything like that especially with these handles as well just take a little bit of plastic and some tape close them up we're just sealing everything around the edge with blue tape but there's a lot of different ways you can mask this is just the easiest for us so now we're gonna take the sculpin the veil metal cleaner and we'll clean it up you can use dish soap that works pretty well as well alcohol works pretty well as as an isopropyl or denatured but I like the sculpting of elemental cleaner because it seems like it gets in a little bit more so in this we are actually going to be going down into the bare copper and I'm not getting a hundred percent of it off not trying to go down to perfect brand new shiny penny I'm just trying to get the majority of it off so we're gonna use the scotch brite pad and that's sculpting of a metal cleaner and just give it a good old scrub once you got it all nice and cleaned up you'll want to go in with water and neutralize the metal cleaner now you can go in with a second coat of metal cleaner if you feel like you need to if you just didn't pull enough off or anything if you've got a couple spots that are really irregular anything that really stands out I mean we've got some modeling here but anything that stands out drastically you may want to brighten up just a little bit more pull some more off it's not gonna hurt we're gonna we're gonna read tone this so there's two patinas that are my favorite for doing copper sinks this one we're using here is the darkening the traditional darkening and I really like this patina but it can often give kind of a greyish-brown on these copper sinks and it really depends on the chemical makeup of the sink that comes into play so we're gonna use a scotch brite pad and kind of get that smoothed out and what this does is you can see on the edge especially here where some areas are taking better than others and the scotch brite pad helps everything kind of even out so we pull off some of those higher areas we expose it to more fresh copper on the lighter areas and in theory it should all kind of come in then the same we're still gonna have some modeling and that's all fine but it should help everything get a little bit more on the even playing field now when we went and rinsed it the darkening depending on the chemical makeup of the sink can come off with a little bit more of a grayish Brown and that's fine we're gonna fix that in the later here but the move I'm gonna make now is I'm gonna come back in and after I do the touch-ups and everything I'm gonna come in with four watt steel wool and I like getting it a little bit what and the reason why I dried it first is I want to see everything so water can you can see it's a little darker and everything when you dry it we can see what we actually have so the fallouts steel wool is going to bring highlights out and kind of pull a little bit back and and help it kind of shine a little bit so the benefit of getting it what is it doesn't scratch as often so we can go in with scotch brite sand everything but they'll scratch a little bit more this fallouts steel wool and especially with the aid of using water as the lubricant really makes it nice and soft so I'm just going around the edges and kind of softening everything out bring a little bit more copper look through it especially on these leaves and everything making it look real nice another important note is these sinks are usually glued in so I'm gonna use a heat gun here to help make sure everything's nice and dry but make sure you don't overheat it we don't want to use anything with too much heat actually hairdryer works pretty well instead of the heat gun because he guns can get real hot if you're not careful so we don't want to loosen that adhesive at all so I'm just drying it out though you can just wait and then it's no problem with just waiting when we go to spray and aerosol make sure that you don't just go for it you can see I'm doing short burst because I'm a little afraid of kind of shooting in it's gonna bounce back at us so last thing we want to do is get this bathroom completely fogged up and then we have everything coated with a little bit of brown patina saying so you can see I've got cardboard and everything protecting the mirror and I'm just kind of doing short bursts and I come back and I do multiple coats but then we seal it with the clear guard now I'm gonna use the clear guard here and kind of get it nice coated I'm gonna do about three coats and then I'm gonna come back in a couple days and actually wax it now if this was in my house we'd be doing Everclear so it's Everclear is the stronger of the two clear coats but this is going into a rental house and unfortunately rentals are often not taken care of as well as they should be so we elected to do clear guard knowing that after the rental lease we will likely have to come in and fix it they're worried about going not going with Everclear even though it is stronger is if they do find a way to damage it it can make the whole process a little bit harder so something that I can take care of personally or you know you know they'll take care of ever clearer is the way to go but if this is a rental or you're a little worried about it maybe it's a work sink clear guards a good option just to make sure that you can go back and fix it a lot easier as you can see from our product list we have darkening and m38 at 50% and these were in two different parts of the house so we went and his did both of them with the Brown patina saying we got them coming out almost perfect so I normally would use the same one if they're next to each other but it worked out well in this case in sink one we have here we use the darkening like we did in the demonstration now since there's two sinks I didn't record the second one since it's the exact same process only we use the m38 in this one and while the Lighting's a little bit different in person they look spot-on and perfect Scholten the vogue products are all

called stainless steel when all it does is attract stain stick around and I'll show you how to get your stainless steel gorgeous hello metalheads it's Melissa maker here from clean my space and I have a question today from Danielle and Milton and Danielle asked me hey Melissa how do we clean stainless steel there are so many products out there and I hear different things from everybody what do I do Danielle that's a great question there are so many products out there it even makes my head spin there's also an ice cream truck outside my house right now so if you hear that creepy song it's not coming from my house it's coming from the truck have any change so first and foremost let's talk about what stainless steel is actually made out of stainless steel became hot and sexy not only because it looks great but because of its anti corrosive properties meaning it's quite durable and is a safe choice for food prep ever notice that a restaurant kitchen is full of stainless steel that's why stainless steel is made from chromium which explains why the stainless steel is actually stainless it forms a chromium oxide that creates a protective film on the seal that prevents sting and corrosion now that we've all been schooled in stainless steel here are my top five tips for stainless steel no nose number one don't use any abrasive sponges steel wool or cloths with debris stuck in them you can scratch the finish and repair is expensive timely and very annoying number two you cannot use chlorine bleach the stainless steel is sensitive to it and will damage the finish number three never clean in circles or against the grain you'll be cleaning forever and if you clean against the grain you could ruin the finish number four don't like dirt grime or cleaning solutions sit on the surface for too long it can ruin the finish get rid of all residue with a clean cloth ASAP finally number five don't expect this finish to shine perfectly by itself you need to get all of the cleaning product or dirt off the finish and then buff it dry with a clean cloth so let's get rid of these fingerprints and shine up this bridge there are a lot of ways to clean your stainless steel properly and there are a lot of products that you can spread your life savings on in order to get it clean but I'll just show you what I think works best here's the need to do your cleaning 2 microfiber cloths a wet one and dry when to buff dish soap which will add to some warm water olive oil but you can also use baby oil or vegetable oil in paper towel only a couple of sheets step 1 take your microfiber cloth run it under some water add a little bit of dish soap bring it out well step 2 take the same cloth rinse it under warm water again get all of the soap out and then you're going to wipe the fridge down once more just to get any of that extra cleaning product off so only water is on this cloth step three take your dry microfiber cloth and buff the appliance dry think of your microfiber cloth like an eraser get rid of all the extra strings that are on there if you do what I just said and do it with fervor you're going to get the frig preyed clean if you're still having
