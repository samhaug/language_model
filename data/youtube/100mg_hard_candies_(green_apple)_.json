{"OnmUvQFoJWE": "hi everyone so I'm going to be doing a review of the green apple medicated hard candies from cannabis no I'll just take the whole it's a hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video

we're gonna be looking at the third in our series of eight episodes on clays old-fashioned hard candy we looked at the horehound flavor and the anise flavor and today we're going to be looking at green apple flavor that's right old-fashioned hard candy and down here they've got some old blurbs here they say that now you can enjoy that old-fashioned apple flavor and a delicious hard candy try some today so that's what we're going to do and the way we're going to do it is we're gonna open this up give it a smell give it a taste and then I'll let you know what I think so without any further ado let's get on the test now you may notice that Thanksgiving and Christmas are approaching in a not so subtle way by all the carols everywhere that you hear and all the bad Christmas music that they pump into every possible place in your life so um these might be good for setting out and having your houseguests come by and sample them we'll find out my sniffers because tearing these bags is difficult and might lead to little green candies I'm assuming your green combatants all over the floor and they are greens you can see right here OOP just like on the outside of the bag here kind of a color coding thing let's get these two smell let's have a nice green apple smell to them very bright yep a little bit of bagging smell in there too just it smells like the bag this is what they look like up close and personal they got a little dusting of sugary stuff on there which helps the medicine go down I've heard so here we go mmm-hmm it's got a very clean bright sour green apple kind of flavor to it right on the money that sugary coating just gives it that little extra bit of oomph and awesomeness but you're gonna want from a hard candy coming Christmas or Thanksgiving or any time of the year actually because I know these are available year-round but just saying you know time of year we're in you might you know slide some out there and see who likes something who doesn't mm-hmm yep very good just a moment and we're back so with that being done yes quite good highly recommend if you like green apple flavors you're gonna like this clays old-fashioned hard candy green apple flavor is a winner so two and a half winners out of three they're on a roll let's see what they do for tomorrow's flavor which will be watermelon yeah watermelon flavored hard candies should be a

baking with saucy treats let's get to it [Music] before this video start let's hit that thumbs up and I'll get to subscribe okay just a few things you need before you get started for Court hi a couple of measuring cups what is phone another those phone the start temperate candy molds if you get the clear plastic the high candy will melt straight through so make sure it's this type of plastic I'll select they're two different types of loads parchment paper good for easy clean ups today I'll be making green apple infused candy so I chose Amsterdam apple liqueur then you'll need grain full color actually this is the gel type some people use a liquid depends on whatever works best for you okay then you'll need your apple flavor II this is by lorry and oils this kind is very strong so only a couple of drops you'll need then you have your candy thermometer it actually tells you on the side here which degree you need to have it at for like soft crack hard crack hard ball fudge chocolate sauces and also you need your corn syrup sugar powdered sugar this is good to coat the candy whistling don't stick [Applause] another measuring cup good support a hot candy in if you don't want to use one of the other ones then you also have a choice of this temper little cork up thing you can see that so you afford your high candy into here and it's temper so that it could be happy as you want it so you need 2 cups of sugar - two cups of sugar 2/3 of hornacek 3/4 of water ok so now you have your water and your sugar now you want to add your coarser 2/3 and just to get the rest of it out you

cap hello sweet candy at 1% yeah that's really all that you need the capela sweet candy kind of acts as the sweetener here I know it's got candy in the name but it's more of a sweetener that's geared towards Candy's capella green apple hard candy does a really good job and then of course the Fedora sour apple kind of bumps up that Apple but it's really just there for the sourness and then Anton Apple Vienna where it's just a really really good green apple I've got my Jenna RT ace in here on top of the slow by Cyclone moms added mouth-wateringly delicious it's just like one of those candies

review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are taking a look at a brand new product from a brand new company when we've never looked at before that is premium Cali dreams candy company they're a hundred and twenty milligram THC medical cannabis lozenge although I don't think it's a lozenge at all I think it is a caramel apple pop with 120 milligrams of THC big fan of the caramel apple pops it's a weird combination but the apple flavored lollipop with caramel on the outside it's great never had one with Whedon before especially one without 120 milligrams I picked this up for I believe 13 bucks at my dispensary although it was on a going out of we're no longer selling these soon to be illegal edible special for 50% off so I got it pretty cheap I'm excited to try it I always like different kinds of edibles and a caramel apple blowing pop sounds pretty good so for 13 bucks 120 milligrams is pretty good for that price especially for something that's not just a brownie or cookies something a little different like a lollipop like the packaging from the outside pretty basic stuff but uh but nice enough as is let's go ahead and shut up now and open it up and see what this bad boy tastes like and if this is the first time you're tuning into wheats the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat some number of this product well probably not gonna eat close to the whole thing because it's a big lollipop but I'm gonna eat some of it let you know do a taste test let you know how it tastes how it smells all that good stuff then I'll finish it off and for the most important part I'll come back in two hours to actually let you know how I am feeling guys because that is the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes alright so here is the pop here it's kind of smushed into this little container it's seems like it's gonna be hard to get out but let's give it a go okay came right out nothing to worry about so there it is there's the caramel apple what is this called again Cali dreams medical cannabis lozenge 120 milligrams handsome looking product give it a lick it's not bad no real cannabis taste can't detect any cannabis taste while just looking through it here I don't have the cojones to just bite straight into this but the taste at least so far pretty good if if it changes if there's something with a lollipop that's wrong or if the caramel eventually gets a weedy taste I'll be sure to let you know in the to our follow up but for now I quite like the taste of this one and like the funky style so guys I'm going to finish this off and then I will be back with you in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheat see you soon [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours here are the fruits of my labor the demolished remains of the Cali dreams 120 milligrams of THC caramel apple pop although that's what I'm calling it they call it a medical cannabis lozenge which it is not I liked it it's uh it's gotta be pretty high not not outrageously high not it's not super crazy effective it's not as good as a equivalently a good you know cookie or brownie it's not as good as like a hundred and fifty milligram Korova for example but I do like things that are a little bit different and I think this one's a little bit different it tasted good pretty much the whole way through the lollipop had a little bit of a Candace cannabis flavor but nothing too bad it was totally totally fine then at and you know was far from making me gag I said that's not the best descriptor but yeah it was pretty tasty the caramel was good I liked it it was a good way of getting THC and if you can find it 50% off like I did it's a hell of a deal at 13 bucks I still think it's not a bad price it is something that unlike a cookie or a brownie or rice krispies treat or whatever else you can't really split it being a lollipop so that might be you know something to strike against and you're gonna be taking this whole thing by yourself and you can't really save it for later either you can't really have half of it otherwise you just have a sticky mess so it's something you've got to commit to if that's you know what you're looking for for me it's a it's a middling endorsement for the Cali dreams hundred and twenty milligrams you see the dispensary near you and you're looking for something a little different a little outside the mold give it a try I think you'll be happy you did thanks so much for watching wheats guys that's going to do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace", "Le6Ox7avobQ": "[Music] hi everyone so today I'm gonna show you so I have these three that I got from Canada's mom that's grape flavored hundreds milligrams of THC this is the green apple same thing 100 grand 100 milligrams of THC and then this one is blue raspberry and 100 milligrams of THC so I'm gonna be doing a review today I'm gonna pick one and then I'll review that flavor and whatever and then so on I'll pick another day and I'll do you know grape and then the green apple so today I've decided to go with the the blue raspberry you get all of these a flavor at Canada's mo and I had a feeling that because it's summer and because it's hot I think all the cubes have stuck together so there's the top piece there's this yeah yeah doesn't have a smell but that's how they look so you get four cubes so I'm just gonna put it all in my mouth that's all because I can't even like it would be too hard to even try to break so if you're going to eat these individually they're 25 milligrams of THC per cube let's try I'm not really tasting the blue raspberry yet I'm tasting THC mm-hmm I could teach something but I don't know if it's the blue raspberry just like a little bit of a sweetness but um it's trying to cover the THC but it's not doing a very good job the THC I just coming out I just read in the back here they're from can occur concentrate so that's maybe that's who makes them and Canada does know sells them or I don't know I know that you get these at Ken abysmal they're slowly starting to break off the cubes but yeah I'm not uh not really I'm not really tasting the roster I taste something a little bit sweet but then like the THC is very overpowering I guess you could say so next five o'clock right now I'll come back when these kick in let you know what they're like once it's like usually they're pretty good I've never had a problem never ever had a problem with anything from Canada smell okay so I'm gonna let these dissolve come back when this is kicked in here it is again the medic medicated hard candies Canada's no I'll be back my kicks in okay so I'm back and this is kicked in [Music] what happened was okay so it started to kick in maybe a little bit after 6:00 and I thought well maybe like it's just like this is gonna be it type of thing so what happened was I rolled a joint and smoked it and if you want to see that part you'll have to see watch the video before this one because ed and I are but with making videos like on at the same time so that wasn't a very smart decision for me to smoke the joint but it's it's done stop it I can do now just like sit and wait it out so this is very good stuff I don't really feel like doing anything though like yeah I don't know we just don't feel like doing anything I'm very thirsty and there's no need to smoke a joint just maybe wait the extra five minutes cuz that's what I should have that's what I would have that's what I should have done is wait um maybe the extra five minutes and then I would have been like oh you know what I'm not gonna smoke this drink is here it comes but no there's another don't do what Donna does I'm just drinking coffee because it tastes good right now like it always tastes good but right now it tastes really good and um yeah go ahead go to cannabis mom and get those the hard candies all the packages over there darn it I should have grabbed it maybe I still will keep we'll hang on grab it and go back over there and show the I put my coffee down I don't think that's in the same place but okay this medicated hard candies getting my cannabis no they're good they're very good if you're just starting out then just try the one cube I don't I don't know don't do like more than one but one kit would be good um any any any um like any pains or anything I that I don't feel anything right now it feels good feels good and then at the same time like you don't feel like do anything either so you're not really enjoying it but you are in another way [Music] like I can talk about a lot of things but it probably has nothing to do like I fit you know what today was like the type of day that that like it's like and sort of like in the middle of August and [Music] it wasn't like too hot nor was it like to hold it was just like it was just right and I was just like I don't know like it reminded me of like when I was a kid and stuff that like those days those summer days like that like they were you know you'd be riding your bike or doing whatever like it was just uh it was just like a good day I can't remember those type of days and it was a good day and then at the same time I think like sometimes you get a couple like hot days in August and but then after that cuz like September's coming right and sometimes in September you get really really nice warm days which are okay but um the days like how today was like you know Falls coming and I love fall like I think it's like the best the best season out of all of them I just really love fall so that's what today and I don't know why I'm telling you this but yeah that's what that's what today was like it was like a perfect like temperature-wise day like at the same time like it when you're doing this it's very like real axing and stuff mm-hmm I'm not really hungry at all like it I'm not saying that I won't get hungry but uh hungry at all like so it doesn't really give you the munchies not not Radia way like it's um it's just about seven o'clock so yeah I'd say like the Munchie partly good I don't I don't feel hungry so my eyes feel very heavy though and yours you need a drink always cuz it really dries you out and what else I don't know I like the I like the edibles and then I like joints bonds are okay but like I think edibles are beta bowls and the joints so just are my thing I like to do that stuff because well the edibles like you just eat it and it it's a longer high so whatever reason that you're taking it for you you'll be good for a couple hours which why not and the joints well I just find those easier to inhale yeah I like to just smoke a joint it's okay and to do a bong thing like you're a bong toke I don't know what just I can't get it all in so like that's why they like I like the joints but like if I have to I can do the bong toes it just takes a little bit more or longer to the whole process type thing [Music] know what to say I can't know what to talk about I just don't know what to tell you guys like should I say this and I can probably know it's open I feel really good though this is this is a nice side this is a nice feeling I'm [Music] like I'm not paranoid like if somebody knocked on the door then I would be like oh [ __ ] even though there's nothing even to smell I would just be paranoid because how am I going to say to somebody like how am I even gonna talk to somebody because like my eyes you could just [ __ ] tell but you know you just know like I couldn't say oh no I have somebody's I don't want you I and I'd be like oh no like [ __ ] you can't even I can't even say that so yes if somebody was knocking at the door I I would get a little bit worried about that but otherwise it'll is like I wasn't that or whatever like I'm I'm okay I I just feel really good and relaxed and um it's just stuff that like if it makes you feel that relaxed that you kind of wish that you were sitting on a dock and just looking out there onto the water like you were just looking that's what or if you're like sitting on a dog and it was like either you know you were watching the Sun Rise or you know if you're watching inside today it's that kind of relaxing relaxed feeling and it goes well with coffee this this is what you feel and it feels like it feels like that except I'm not sitting on the dock watching the Sun set or rise up so but anyways that's what it makes you you feel like well sons like Hannah over there but it's not setting yet this I'll already be done this before it even said so those annoys I don't know if you can hear them you know those buzzing noises I think it's crickets or something or some type of insect you know that highlight noise that you hear but I remember I was a kid I don't know if you can hear her anyways as a kid because um like Killarney is not that big of a place so there's like lots of bush and stuff and and there's like little trails and stuff like that so like if you're out playing with your friends and then you guys decided to go on this trail and or go whatever into the long grass or whatever like stuff like that ain't always you'd get further out there and you can hear those buzzing those I don't know what insect that is and often sit like a cricket or oh I don't know what it is but so anyways when I hear that stuff that reminds you know I was a kid it's funny how like I don't know if it's like a 40 thing or it's gotta be maybe like 40 high and in your 40s or something and like when you think of like certain uh sound not yeah like sounds are like just certain things and you think like way but like when you were a kid and it seems like it was a long freaking time ago like it's not like you know when you know when you're 20 and you go yeah when I was a kid well when you that wasn't you know you're still kind of our kid at 20 but if 40s yeah it makes things seem a long time ago when maybe because if it is a long time ago or maybe because you just feel like that cuz like 40 years though that's that's pretty long I'm going to have to go make another coffee soon because I'm just about done this one and I need to like this bad has to be he liked me because I took everything off and washed it and [ __ ] I just don't feel like doing it no but it has to be done just like it just seems like it's gonna be a like a Wyatt like a couple minute job ooh yeah I was gonna turn into like this you know Ted minitor probably like 10 to 15 minutes to make this bad like that's I should have made it before or like while I was eating the edibles I should have made it then because they would have been done in a couple minutes now the only thing I have done is like I put the pillowcases on the on the pillows like the sheets and stuff are here but like the what is it like the mattress protector thing like I wash side and that's dried and everything else but hmm after you'll get that on the line on the clothesline so I was like go down and get that come back put that on and then put the sheets on and like and you gotta put like the blanket and comforter part so I'm really not looking forward to that but you know why I think um I I think I just need some more coffee and they need to just go sit down and you just think a little um I think that's it like I think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna enjoy it that's time I was you know worries about anything unless somebody knows so let's that's my review on it skid here's the package and get it at can abismo that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "vUtA3HafLNg": "hi today we're going to make some sour apple lollipops using two different types of citric acid one liquid form and one powder form I also am going to use two different types of molds I got these molds for Christmas this mold here is meant probably for chocolate but it worked for lollipops but the best way to make lollipops obviously is by using a lollipop mold that has a place for a stick so let's get started alright start with two cups of sugar 3/4 cup corn syrup 3/4 cup of water turn your heat on to a medium heat and stir this up until the sugar dissolves try to keep the sugar from collecting around the side wipe the sides down with the wet paper towel to keep it on sugar now let that boil until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit let a boil in the pot for about 20 minutes add about 10 drops of food coloring of your choice stir that in we want the water to evaporate now add the flavoring I'm using apple flavor one dram of apple flavor by Lorraine's oils and add a bout a tablespoon of this at a tablespoon of tart and sour I'm just gonna guess and you can purchase these at a cooking shop or probably on Amazon I don't know if that's going to make it sour enough so I did add some citric acid I've seen them do it on lofty pursuits so I'm gonna try it out but see it's not going to boil out so it won't burn I put lollipop sticks in these molds and these do not require in volley pop sticks so we're gonna see how that works pour them into your mold and take the stick and just twist it a little bit there you go all right the pot would be a mess so all you need to do is fill it with water and the water will break it down and clean it up all right it is possible to use these molds the only problem is you have to keep standing them up until the syrup is hard and there you have it some sour apple lollipops thank you thanks for watching", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "fX1Dq9T9pS8": "[Music] they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended he pours it on to a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background [Music] to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design [Music] once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite-sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an o avi and II a y/o and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops [Music] you", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every single week I'll put up some new recipes

you guys better hurry up hurry oh my god who are you gonna call uh i don't know candy busters yeah how come we didn't call ourselves the candy busters three sir let's buy a new uh it's my new sign all right it smells great it's not great i wonder how many people like watch one of our videos that we tell a bunch of jokes and then they watch the next video and we tell the same exact jokes like the same style of jokes i think that's the biggest you know people are always like when you start making bad jokes that's when your dad no when you start making the same dad jokes over and over again when i used to work at core uh and i was just a line worker i'd be working next you know i'd be the employees i was working next to were the same ones but the customers are coming in were always different but i always had like three jokes that i would tell people and the customers would love it and then like all my the employees yeah they'd just be like rolling their eyes like this one again i mean because you come up with some when you're working like retail and you're like at that register dealing with people all the time you come up with a couple of good ones but you see a thousand people today you're not gonna come up with that buddy yeah i remember the good old days well everybody wants to know by now we're not trying to act or anything yeah i'm i'm trying to break out man i'm trying to get that hollywood deal you know three years from now you'll see i'm gonna be the star of mission impossible 37. all right wow you guys lifted over that bag sometimes i think you could be a mission impossible yeah mission possible we were smart we put the bag over [Laughter] just saying i don't know i don't want us to forget to put it in who does that i'm not that you guys did that last night no no never you guys have never forgotten stuff no i always remember to not forget you tried to hit me you see that well i saw the cameras on so i didn't plus i don't want to hurt my hand anything two hours gotta be faster than that no not that fast push one around make me hmm you're the one who made me have candy this morning candy you got me all riled up okay we're going to make this a dark green well not dark but yeah mom should make it darker though a little darker okay she said don't put it in a spiral though oh okay can you just take that back out yeah cause uh this is this is what it came out last time it was really dark when you guys were pulling it out but then i think as it gets mixed with the white and also the caramel on the inside it gets lighter and lighter it's a symbol you know oh it's not a spiral okay so this is the universe oh wow the milky way yeah we live in the milky way universe we're in the middle are we i thought we were in the arm like an arm of the milky way you didn't even know we live on a piece of popcorn i thought we lived in a yellow i submarine we lived at the bottom of the sea bikini bottom yes bikini top there's no ritzy fish that live in bikini top there's no ritzy fish that live in bikini top i guess it makes sense that's called bikini bottom because at the bottom of the ocean oh yeah yeah it's true maybe it's under bikini at all how long did the last batch take that long that one these are all the notes these are top secret you're gonna tell everybody all their secrets you know yeah oh so people who are trying to do the recipe at home you said it's usually what a two to one ratio is sugar uh yeah it's uh yeah sugar corn syrup so which one's more sugar sugar twice as much sugar okay corn syrup it's just one sugar sugar is two so much what you make that's the part that always throws me is how much water you're supposed to put in yeah that part um because i'm like i know we put two quarts in two quarts two quarts for uh 21 pounds so you'd have to subtract that and uh just do math yeah you have to do something hire a math teacher to tell you how much to call up your local school hello school i'd like to talk to your math teacher please i'd like to talk to your manager about how much sugar i put in the candy okay so we gotta get the temperature in this oh there's three of them over here sure you guys are hoarding them [Music] is about the same yeah don't i shouldn't add it until it's uh 245 yeah that's when you put it on the table it's a 300. hmm this is sort of like what it's like to be like a condolence driver you just stand there all day a gondola driver i don't know what do you call them gondola driver they're essentially like taxis over there right very good like a train driver a plane driver a plane driver yeah yeah yeah we're like a bus driver i drive planes do you the i drive them in the sky on the cloud roads oh it looks kind of cold yeah hmm that looks cool looks like glass huh yeah it looks like stained glass you guys remember to grease the hook yeah is that what you were checking before you yeah i just didn't see like the lines from the towel so you think this will mix in the citric acid i don't even know if this is gonna mix this is really really really cold yeah oh really really really cold like there's just a lump in the middle of it oh yeah that's citric acid no just a lump of candy oh but yeah it should mix this if you guys didn't just find though yeah do you think you guys need to heat the table up more next time or do you know why i got so cold no i wasn't over there so i i don't know what it was do you have any theories dad it was cold like was the table too cold or something yeah oh you guys put in like new hotter water before the oh yeah i must have missed that a little chilly you guys are doing stuff right in front of me i don't even see it all we gotta do is turn the faucet on so it's easy to miss all right that's weird enough for me oh steve that's too dark just add a little more different green to it this time i don't remember how green it was last time dude do you think it's greener this time yeah yeah for sure yeah i guess it's still not going anywhere yeah so you have you guys found that the caramel is easier to put in the middle than peanut butter it doesn't ooze as much oh yeah these are the chocolate peanut butter caramel's awesome i still think we should try cottage cheese i think that more salad dressing we got a little bit of an overlap on the front pretty much tuck that under or something so that we don't have a bunch of empty pieces did you see us putting our phones into airplane mode yesterday uh did you see it you know what we did that right you know we're just like flying around your phone on airplane mode your phone's got a fan that'll be the next that'll be like the next big thing with phones phones also have fans they're very popular in the summer here's my summer phone my winter phone's got a heater on here [Music] yeah it looks greener so far but i mean there's no caramel mixture so we'll see we already got some caramel oh yeah i can see a little bit a little dark strip in the center the viewers can see that oh you can really see it come through a little bit more now that's quick yeah we didn't like what three or four yeah yeah the second second one had none the third one had like that [Music] because they're so cold [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] jinkies so right yeah definitely look a lot greener this time around so you'll be able to see uh which uh which batch you got it from at least these first two anyway look different i don't know what the next two will look the next three will look like the crystal ball a little foggy today that's why it's foggy we gotta get it fixed or something right the dirt from the crossroads yeah the frog crap the neck is smaller i'm hoping it doesn't how many pieces of ribbon candy do you think this whole basket no no never counted me i'd say so maybe even a baker's dozen oh yeah live straighten his aorta yeah so i've never counted it up before what do you think the number will be i really have like no destination at all so this is this is about you know a batch size um i'll guess 125. 21 pound batch carry the one 18 and a half pounds minus the three yeah yeah and don't forget uh sokatoa yeah some old pen caught another hand take notes away i don't remember an acronym foreign i never had schwab but i i think i remember i think i remember dylan miller just always saying like that for some reason and he said it was from schweinsteiger i remember trick dude yeah i feel like i can use names like dylan miller and it doesn't give anyone away because it's just like tim white yeah robert smith i don't think with a whole lot of bad news all right oh yeah 201. 199. wait max what did you say 180. i'm gonna guess 179. i said the satisfaction of being right it's great prize really do you though i remember when i was right good day they're moving these fingers got their bags packed these fingers are made for walking that's what they're doing [Music] yeah the color has really changed a lot i mean it's a little lighter it's still definitely darker though i think this is uh yeah i think it definitely looks better this match although when i when i look at it up here everything just looks white not pink yeah well you can't really well i mean yeah you can see the green but it's like more from the side that you can see or the green i mean not that you can really hear me that way i wonder how many people this video is all in the seat right now at least one uh i know i've seen tons of people saying like it's just the combination of the occasional voices with like the humming of a fan and like the methodical like flick of the scissors can you guys fall asleep if you don't hear like other people talking i i usually fall asleep to absolute silence i have a hard like uh cara will often have to wake up earlier with me you know to come into hercules so i'll have to turn my fan off so when she's getting ready for work she just wakes me up i don't know no noise at all i'm a very light sleeper so i like [Applause] and put the bed sheets on the bed while i was asleep what the heck [Music] yep what if it's less than 100 pieces i think we're good i don't know there's at least four more ribbons over here maybe even more than that yeah that's the one that like every time you ask so how many do you think they're left i'm like i don't know eight or nine and then we get like 25 80 or 90. does it ever feel like sometimes the ribbon candy just never going to end candy that never ends going on [Music] [Applause] i don't remember which song it was it was from the brack album on and we just started singing it forever just because and i think it says it's the song that never ends it's a looping song it's pretty loopy all right so when you were listening to the brack album were you ever like man this album is great huh [Music] well zorak is the mantis rack is an alien i think is the the person slash hero that keeps them in prison yeah okay wait what's the name of the dances zorax yeah have you ever seen the original space ghost cartoons the tv i turned it off oh i wrote it yeah i have no copyright strikes is there anything that you have to do differently with filled ribbon candy versus normal ribbon candy to make sure you get the the filling all the way through or you just kind of hope for the best there's no right so that's what i'm saying is there anything you have to do differently to make sure yeah you got to make it paper thin oh so you just have to make it thinner yeah then we're trying to like spread it out you got to make it paper thin this is thick yeah that's why we can ship it okay yeah the regular ribbon cane is so thin we can't shuffle it'll be tiny pieces i mean it breaks when we're trying to package it yeah yeah even this stuff off so you guys are just saying that was the last yeah you're on your best behavior all day i got to tell you i never held up my end of that morgan that was good for 10 minutes yes oh um 162 162 yeah did you say 150 at first or something no i said 125. you said 180. but you might have been closer i think then yeah i think so yeah cause you're like 20 off and i was like no i said 125. dad said 200. so i just took a little bit of waste out and then doubled it for the half pounders multiplied by like five pieces per day well congrats you win the satisfaction of being right right are you upset you have to go home now dad yeah i know all right so you're the stapler yeah my mom made mom custom made these yeah i like these colors i like the labels and the candy we're trying good kid looks good like you've done it before huh oh we haven't even done a taste test or anything no yeah we'll have to get back to a taste test we didn't we did it i'm not tired oh yeah all right so we're here for the taste test you want a piece now that i licked my fingers yeah we tried a piece this morning with no caramel in it because you know your parents but i was like i really want to try to count yeah it was even a little caramelly without it so try to keep it in my mouth as soon as i bit into it i got the green apple it's nice and like fruity is it slightly tart or sour the chart just comes in as soon as you start chewing it up um it almost changes it from like green apple almost being like kind of pie because yeah i hope they're not like getting a direct shot into mine that's really good it's pretty tart too yeah i just got a little bit in the back of my throat like and sweet so it's like sweet sour and buttery yeah it's hitting all the notes a little savory a little sour that's the sweetness from the green apple it's like you know classic green appley yeah that's pretty good i'm taking some scrap candy yeah from this bathroom for real oh yeah yeah first time ever it's good stuff i liked it eight point dude it's exactly right there right yep let's just confirm it over on this one oh double double sure double confirm double confirm double convert how many people are going to get that not that many yeah really people who i think are our age game see video games it blows my mind that halo is not like halo was like world changing yeah that's why i got an xbox i got an xbox one photo well you could've got an npc well i guess you could also have gotten halo on pc we were we were a mac family there's no pc's yeah we had lots of macs too much some would say so this is the eight ounce bags so eight ounces typically about four ribbon candies four and a half i'd say yeah probably on average but you know you definitely get you get three-piece ones you get ones with six pieces in it [Music] sometimes i feel like most of them are probably four and a half inch though did you kind of break your heart to have to bring pieces up like that not anymore you're stupid now you're like i got to go home sooner oh yeah it's just like you just have to do it yeah what's what's that term that you always use for the videos i don't know something oh yeah your babies oh yeah i was like that's not really the friendly stuff but yeah sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do is confront your babies what do you do with that bottle yeah give me that bible oh one sec i don't want to explain in the middle makes no sense okay so we just want the plastic since right now it's about as wide or wider than this we just wanted to make it thin enough that it you know it's about like that big so you just push the sides in where it completed kind of just fold over so it's about that thin fold it down twice pretty close to the candy and then you fold this over it along the line right there and you staple it twice between between letters try not to staple on the letters you can still read everything and it's tight there's not pieces floating around in there right that's about it just do that like 100 more times yep all right well have fun i will i always do as you can see i'm fading away i i need you guys to subscribe so i can get back here again i'm fading oh no [Music]", "TgNQ0-DeO8E": "hey guys look at me you're gonna balloon we

candy and they bought ice cream and soda fountain treats what they are\nknown for is a drink called the lime sour this is a drink that's made with\nshaved ice lime juice salt Sawada and salt if you'll notice there's no sugar\nin there and that's okay because this is meant to refresh and you get a sweet\ntaste anyway and I'll explain why a little later Anna works the soda\nfountain here at Chapman's drugs and she was nice enough to show us how to make\nthe lime sour optional virgins have a straight so this\ndrink and the salt are treat if you'll notice there was no sugar that went into\nthis this is just lime juice ice and seltzer water and it makes you feel\ncooler in the summer and that's because of the acid in the lime you see when\nyou're thirsty in the summer your mouth is dry and the high levels of acid in a\nlime drink or high acid drink makes your mouth salivate and that elevation makes\nyou seem instantly refreshed even though this drink is extremely sour and you can\ncounter the sour with some salt it's gonna make you feel cooler because now\nyour mouth isn't going to feel dry anymore and this is the trick of\nlemonade lime aid and the lime Rickey which is a fruit drink with a lime that\ngets an asset to it now if you also take a look at the phosphates now phosphates\nare common in soda fountains in the past you'd have a chocolate phosphate other\nphosphates it used the acid because the sugar in\nthe drink need your mouths dry out so it wasn't as refreshing so they pumped up\nthe acid level in the drink to give you a wet mouthfeel and then they pumped up\nmore sugar to counter the acid taste there's only one common phosphate around\nthat's Coca Cola if you look it still uses the phosphor the phosphoric acid in\nit and because of that it has a huge amount of sugar in it but it also no one\ntalks about has a huge amount of acid coca cola has about as much acid in it\nas standard vinegar does and that's because it needs that acid to make the\ndrink seem refreshing but here we can do it just with crushed ice lime juice a\nlittle salt and it's refreshing in hot weather and then it's strange even without sugar\nthe drink it becomes sweet Derrick Chapman the fourth-generation owner of\nChapman drugs tells us about it life's hours are sweet at some point so\nit's got so much salt in it about half way through the salt kind of disappeared\nit overwhelmed your mouth or something and it's almost just a sweet taste the\nlime sour just it's either a lover or hate so you'll find people that in the\nover 90 years they've been in hateful Georgia some things have stayed the same\nlike the soda fountain but the ice has not they used to have the ice delivered\nby the train that runs across the street seemingly on a daily basis Wow it is so\nthey would chop the blocks press the ice if you ever get a chance to visit\nChapman's pharmacy it's in hape Ville Georgia just south of Atlanta between\ni-75 and i-85 in a little wedge and there's more to see there too the dwarf\nhouse was here and that became chick-fil-a and they still operate on\nthe original location I guess this leaves the question how do\nwe get from a drink to hard candy and what we're going to do is we're going to\nuse it as their inspiration to capture the essence of the strength in hard\ncandy we've already heated the sugar to 310\ndegrees and we've already added the lime oil which is the flavoring for this\ncandy and now we're going to pour it on our candy cooling table to get it down\nto temperature the next step is we make it green with food coloring and we stir\nit in with our little wooden spoons and you'll see it boils so that's boiling\noff the water because the water is bad for candy it makes it sticky now for the\nmagic to take place first we add the citric acid this creates the sour we\nnext add baking soda now when the water in your mouth comes in contact with the\nbass King soda and the citric acid it will fizz and this will carbonate the\ncandy in your mouth so you'll get the soda sensation and lastly we're putting\nin salt that if I do it right will give you a salt finish on the flavor just\nlike a lime sour since the sugars been sitting on the\ncandy cooling table without moving it's uneven in temperature the top is hot the\nbottom is cool and we're gonna fold it and mix it all together usually when I'm\ndoing drops I mix the colorant in the pot but here I'm doing it on the table\nbecause I know I'm gonna have to pull this on the hook or the citric acid and\nthe baking soda isn't gonna blend evenly I'll blend all the color on the hook too\nif you'd like to try this candy for yourself you can order it at\nwww.pd.net we're making it sour with citric acid\nand we're adding baking soda but not enough to cancel out all of the sour to\ncreate carbonation in your mouth and then for a finish we're adding salt and\nthe salt is going to give you the same sensation sort of like you get for a\nmargarita we're gonna use this little press to make the candy into drops\nlittle round balls of sugar and sweetness and sour and salt and we're\ngonna do this just by running it through the press it's actually a lot harder\nthan it looks but I can't really explain why this press was originally made in\n1871 and was owned by John Mulaney company a candy company in Cincinnati\nthat was well known for their sweets all that's left is to separate these sheets\nof candy into individual pieces and you'll understand in a moment why they\ncall them drops thank you for watching we really do appreciate it and if you\nwant to get some of this candy and try it for yourself you can get it online at\nour website www.videoculinary.com us on facebook twitter or instagram and you\ncan come and visit us for yourself if you're in tallahassee

the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "Ie3PFYyg8ro": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds you might hear some noise behind me

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

and so you know what that means it means that I've gone out to my dispensary I picked up some edibles that are infused with cannabis that are industry available professional I suppose not homemade because that's what we're here to do today today I picked up Thank You Rex I picked up a little bag of saints and sinners and eaten most of this bag that's why the top is opened up I just want to talk about our package today some of our packaging sometimes they try to save money wherever they can these companies so the saints and sinners these are real generic white bag this back piece is just a sticker it has all of their flavors on here and the ingredients the front also is just a sticker it's just a sticker so they can put them on the ones and on this one you'll see that we have a hundred milligrams of THC new formula they saved this bag the candies inside are 10 ml are 100 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each and then they've where they put new formula is actually a sticker over 10 milligrams of CBD so these were originally what they call a one-to-one which is same parts THC to CBD but if you remember that I talked to you last week the more CBD that you take with your THC can lower the high or the psychoactive effect that's because the CBD attaches itself to the same receptors that THC uses so and THC can't go can't bind to a receptor that has CBD vice versa and let's talk about this not for kids stick or two there is a poison controlled number on here so it's not just not for kids but if you if you have a bad trip you can McCallum they'll tell you what to do which is gonna be lie down try to sleep have something to eat to have something to drink to this day yet no one has died as a direct result of cannabis there is no overdosing on cannabis you might feel weird you might feel like you're gonna die you might feel like you're gonna have to lie down I know for me when I get overloaded I get crazy inside I get real jittery and it's like it's kind of like having too much caffeine and here's what our candy looks like also these saints and sinners have decided to label the actual candy itself marijuana marijuana marijuana not for kids not for kids not for kids which is you know I mean it's okay but it really cuts into you discreetly get getting rid of these baggies you know you'd find these little baggies are you kidding me right now okay okay when I went rinsed it off this is the strawberry saints and sinners this is a pebbles this is my favorite candy this is a runner-up strawberry [Music] it's really good oh my god the strawberry sub it's so juicy much so juicing well alright well I saved two saints and sinners I do like the name the flavors really good you have the second one [Applause] well that's two down now set your timers and I'll see you in a couple hours let you know how I feel hi everybody we are back it's been a couple of hours and I'd say that they worked pretty good pretty good I'm not gonna complain about it I wanted to cover off on a couple of things that's good for me it's good for you and good for the companies that make these candies and these edible products first of all the name of this company is called evergreen herbal you can reach them on the web at their website at for evergreen herbal calm for evergreen herbal calm as I spell that our ingredients today are granulated sugar citric acid corn syrup coconut oil cannabis oil artificial color and artificial flavor that's not great although they are using neem oil for our pesticide which is nice 27 calories per candy seven point five grams of sugar I'm gonna tell you that these candies are pretty good I'm gonna give them on a scale of ten for flavor I give them an 8 a seven seven and a half let's give him a set of and a half for flavor and for efficacy [Music] let me give them a six they are not as potent as some of the other ones that I've had and I know that it seems strange that everything is supposed to have 10 milligrams of THC but you can't control the quality of the THC that is in the product so I don't know what they're using they don't tell me what strain they're using probably many but if you know this bag of candies compared to some other bags of candy this was only $12 pebbles run at 15 some of the other candies are going as high as you know sometimes $30 for 10 candies so for price I'm giving them eight for efficacy and giving them a six and for flavor at seven and a half so these are worth it get some lets see you next time oh but wait I had mentioned that we were gonna make some actual food I'm gonna start my Baker madness back at it so I've been sent some recipes by some of you guys which is really great I'm gonna I've got a I've got three people send me the same banana recipe so I'm gonna do that one so if you sent me the banana bread recipe we're gonna do that and I'm also I think the next thing I'm going to do is infused candied bacon not everybody can get candies at a dispensary I would say that almost everybody out there can find cannabis flower somewhere so we'll talk about that in the weeks coming up I love you guys thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next time on Baker madness [Music]",

thinking was it's gonna taste like Apple it tastes like a my eyes did not remember as a kid I mean they still exist but as a kid I've seen him a lot candy apples go to the bodega I'm from Jersey so every quarter was a corner store every corner bodega okay I went to the bodega and as a little kid I always seen them candy ass never got one I never really liked it matter of fact I don't even think I would've tried it as a kid I just wasn't into it I was like damn an apple covered weekend he and caramel and peanuts laughs not for me I think I tasted it one time I didn't bite into it I licked it cuz I was a little kid and I was scared such lifting they taste bad the toilet remembers the candy and the caramel taste fast-forward a thousand million years later now I'm a grown man I have not even a candy apple tasting this I would assume this is exactly what a candy apple tastes like for everyone out there whether you're grown up or you're a kid if you have an addiction to candy apples right here my friends this is what you're going to need the candy oops oh you're gonna need it it tastes exactly like it I know I know I know it's been a long time I know I only licked it one time but this is what it tastes like I promise you you know Andy does not lie try it out for yourself Cheers okay like I told you last time my stranger knew everybody's palate you know your tongue everybody's tongue is always gonna taste something different than person so just because I tell you I don't taste Atlas doesn't mean that you will not take that much me personally I taste caramel I taste I don't want to say it cherry well I taste some type of candy which you either outer shell and the layer of the Apple obviously I don't taste peanuts that would be kind of weird but yeah all I taste is caramel and candy the caramel is in stronger than the candy the candy the candy is a powerfully them but you taste the candy a lot too and that the caramel is is there it's very consistent I just really wish our technology was also here stick this in the camera and then you must put your lips on it actually hit it cuz I wish you guys forget this for those of you that have tried the candy apple then you probably know what I mean that it tastes like any other house caramel has a cherry candy space once again I'm sorry but I do not know the percentage of this but I do know all of crafte Candice's they it starts out like 70% and it goes up there's nothing lower than 7% from what I remember from what I've had nothing lower than 70% and everything is higher than 70% which is don't

this huckleberry hard candy by Bill ferns hard candy company so they actually reached out to me like two days ago and since I'm Sony with this I'm gonna just basically accommodate most most people who do reach out and ask me if I can review so the way I'm doing this as I had the blue raspberry one last night and that was kind of like on me so I don't like blue raspberry or like I don't like raspberry in general like at all so I don't know why I got blue raspberry but if you like raspberry the flavors really good if you don't don't buy it's not you're not gonna like it it's just got that like the raspberry sourness to it and I just like I said it's a personal it's a choice on the taste the hi itself though it was really like it if I was a new if I was a new smoker and I was just getting started this is a perfect way to like get your intro into edibles because one piece is going to be just enough to give you like the feeling that you're after the feeling that most people like associate with edibles but in a mild enough dose that you're still gonna be full control you're not gonna like pass out fall asleep you're not gonna you're not gonna have like a crazy freak out because you had one piece this is a 10 milligram piece of candy so it's not that big if you're more like if you're more of a daily like you smoke every day after works I think then you can go ahead and have two two or two three and then if you really really want to make sure that you're not gonna wake up at all then you brought out four to five but you know like I said it's everyone's personal choice with that I'm going to go ahead and pop this guy open they don't have this score marks which I don't like because I have to like cut it beforehand otherwise I don't like doing that so there's that when you open it at first Wow so here's my package and it's already open I was cool I don't know how that oh yeah it just wasn't sealed all the way that's awesome so yeah this is a huckleberry candy that's really good oh yeah so yeah I definitely shouldn't I got the blue raspberry if I would have got the huckleberry one I probably would eat both last night this is really really good you don't taste any of the marijuana at all yeah Naruto you get a little bit of the tickle that you get in the back of the throat whenever you have like a candy farm edible but that just comes with any of these really good like really really good oh my god yeah definitely if you go with this one the huckleberry if you're gonna buy them this is hands-down you're not gonna have no complaints yeah anyway man I'm really enjoying it so I got a bunch of stuff to finish I gotta go do a bunch of like cooking and a bunch of other stuff for the rest of the day alright so that was the huckleberry bill affords hard candy and yeah like I said this thing's delicious so if you guys get a chance definitely go pick some up and go", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "0IIHUYmS4pA": "[Music] we both do the wavy drop lean to the left do the wave eBook wavy book do the wavy drop means the left do the wavy book on camera but it's toxic me people but we've learned today you'll see a video in a minute orbit will lit up and everything proper video and you'll see the guys that we're getting it off basically so it's pretty right I'm just little knackered at the moment because I thought I forgot about doing this as always like busy doing other stuff and basically no we're just doing this is like I'm feeling it follow us free so we've just back with another review top 12 elite pass through oh yeah might as well get it done it was meant to come out today so come out tomorrow well yeah well it is tomorrow now in it so yeah tomorrow so it will be technically today in like technical terms so we've got selector bores and there's two point tip of wax in each one of these so basically these are pretty strong we were speaking about it but we speak I speak so much on messages so I can't really remember what we've done of how my brain just goes on but basically what we're going to do is munch these and let you know the flavor the smell and the buzz and the taste well that's the flavour and basically appearance is well the parents so their parents are these they're wonderful texture they're squidgy for they're not sticky the insights promised to keep that a proper don't see about proper Chinese literally properties and there's not much for all that leaks out on your fingers there's not only you do get a lot of oil comes back out but yeah these should be right so let's try these that's a kick up resin that's nice this one some Apple you can really taste the resin taste that's the after note but linger in and back of the throat the resin definitely get a sour apple get a brilliant strong Apple and the sourness goes in with the resin so it's pretty nice you can taste the resin a lot in this that's what I do you find with gummies well jellies these jellies what we call them gummy personalty the soxhlet don't know if anyone else call some gummies these one here parrots on the inside it's like a darker color and the sender then the outside because there's looks like a powdered sugar or something on the outside something to stop it being so oily and sticky that's both of them down the hatch overall appearance and flavor appearance is wonderful that little noise is looking jelly sweets I've seen in a long time I've had a few that just don't move do you ever think on the tunnel like if I buy it myself and I don't think is good enough it won't go on eternal but if someone like its kind enough to help me out with something I'm going to the review but truthfully tell the truth and it can't just say oh yeah it's amazing what a way for you know gotta tell the truth gotta know a truthful review okay no I mean why is it gonna be a ship in view at the end of the day if you carry on doing the same thing and just go in yes what wonderful was wonderful people's going to buy ship products and people's not going to know about it even the people are not getting rid of it you know that's the way it's gotta be you gotta do stuff properly what I had done a video in ages because something happened I will explain on another video as you could probably see I've got a scar on my head yeah it's not the most nicest thing that happened but we're still carrying on with the YouTube we're still doing stuff and like I said before we're a warrior or a warrior like a proper soldier huh and that's the way it goes me no stopping me the only way I'm going underneath or cremated I don't [ __ ] know what anyone decides after I'm gone that's their decision not mine you know unless I'm [ __ ] making myself but yeah that's another video total different video it it is quite upsetting there will be a lot of graphic pictures and stuff so if you're not home if you got a weak stomach and [ __ ] up and you don't like gory stuff don't look I don't watch the video don't check it out but we just would run belong a little bit just to make the video up as you always do because edible videos they don't really go the longest as the reviews but yeah appearance it gets a 10 out of 10 definitely a 10 out of 10 appearance the flavor I reckon there could be more apple flavoring a little bit more up of flavoring so not too much so I would say for flavor it gets eight 8/2 flavor because the resin overpowers the Apple so much you can't really taste the Apple there is a strong apple taste in between once it starts warming up but it's not that strong because the resin off takes it straight away so it's hard to explain but if you know if I and you tried them then you know that it takes over a little tap it just might be different types of resin has different like flavors don't think so if it's not got flavor in it you to the flavor out and it's just the resin there it's going to be stronger resin content and other plants so it's just all down to preference you know but I give it a 8 for flavor the smell on it it's amazing it's like a really like a pearly smile you've got a sweet sugary smile as well and you couldn't really smell the resin in it at all so no one would really know this but kind of is enough by the smoke as soon as he bit into it it was Noble so it's one of them ones but yeah it's a really nice thing for the smell I can't remember why I said if I said something before but for the smile I would say it gets a 9.5 because only because only because basically like I said with the Apple it'd be nicer to smile more Apple same as the taste nicer to taste more Apple but other than that it's literally a really nice smile taste and appearance in one yeah what we're gonna do is come back in about an hour's time maybe probably just just over our because we've had food it's really but had Artie you never think but it probably digested right now I don't know it's really slowly still digesting so we'll give it about hour and a half to two hours and we'll be back with you guys letting you guys know the buzz how we're feeling and everything like ins and outs of exactly how I feel anyways hope you enjoyed all of the latest videos we haven't got much strain reviews das been coming up now we're just getting back all into everything again we was just like trying to spend a bit of time at the family and try to just do different things and focus myself and it didn't work and well it did so and then I got [ __ ] over by some body you know but yeah basically there's gonna be a lot more reviews coming up now I'm focusing on my youtube focus on me and just shocking it when I Soph so yeah anyways see you guys in about two hours and related to know the bus and how it all goes peace guys say these guys went back and basically left it just a little bit over two hours feeling nice and mellow hi we are in Dublin and Kristen's Pistons we've got lower the different refuse and stuff like that another make you know was in some way tolerance levels are going to be very high at the moment so it's a big a difference if you are a beginner and you've got high tolerance you know but I am feeling quite high time for a beginner you'd be what to help you would be sleeping I nearly and nearly for what lying down I didn't when I stayed awake so that's why it's a little bit labor as you can see the eyes are puffy but my eyes they went [ __ ] they went red for a stage and I hardly get red are so that's when you know this is good material it's strong for me and if you're strong for me it's going to be strong for someone not don't use on every day I use it every day and I mean a lot of cannabis products just to calm down the anxiety etc if you wonder why the headphones on basically I'm playing xbox of normal but the Xbox controller Bobby got me Xbox on a ps4 I used to like this - but ps3 and ps4 [ __ ] up that's death but yeah I'm feeling quite nice and mellow and it's a steady where our first it it started creeping peaked off and now is slowly dropping back down so is it's nice there's no nice feeling but yeah why will recommend is trying some of the jelly sweets definitely you send the sticker anyway I made sure up a lot in the name was on the top of the sticker so you guys see all of that anyway but yeah thanks to the extractor person that gave me this and the person has got all the edibles I try Maroubra I love a size medium this is so they could just lit up but main things is the buzz I would rate it out of 10 personally me I would say Oh a 9.5 again is not 100% at the point that I would like but this is pretty good you know so it gets you on the shoulders it makes you feel a bit like what we had it as I would class you know when you've got different alcohol beverages and you've got different stages when you getting drunk basically this is more of a tipsy instead of being totally pissed or smashed like your face you know it's on the verge of getting to the point of near enough there but a tipsy feeling in stoned version this is a stoned tipsy feeling as I can explain it that's what I like it's bringing it a lack of comfort I like putting it to the equivalent is alcohol because at the end of the day it should be really alcohol kills more people and this doesn't so if it makes people more

everyone so I've done the lasagna video what you guys have already watched and I've decided to take to try these so the medicated hard candies strawberry-kiwi there are 30 milligrams per cube there's the cubes down there from can abysmal I'm not gonna be taking all four that's way too much THC for me I already have been doing long chokes and that was for my lasagna video if you want to see what was on yes oh that's made go back and watch that one okay so let's see how there there's two left for a rainy day okay so I'm waiting to taste the strawberry or the Kiwi an idea I taste THC tastes weed I don't know why I never taste the the flavoring I just taste the THC always the weed so I'll let these dissolve okay so it's eight thirty eight thirty six right now I'll time it again I will come back when I kicks in in between the next time I come on I'll have different clothes on that's just because I'm taking a shower um yeah I don't taste strawberry Kiwi I just don't but never a problem with cannabis Mo's any of anything of their stuff anything it's all been good so suck on these take a shower come back when this kicks in let you guys know how long it takes to kick in when I'm feeling and everything else okay so it's 953 right now and I took it at 836 so a little over an hour I started feeling this like a couple minutes ago it's it's good there's nothing wrong with it they could take a shower and whatever and that was but you're more like I'm not sleepy and I'm not hungry it's more like relaxed like it's just like such a it's such a good feeling like it's just and I even worried about anything like if you have stuff that you're worried about you wouldn't be worrying about right now cuz it just it's not there to worry about I feel happy but I feel happy cuz I'm relaxed um and I feel that really am i I don't know I'll come closer can you see now if you can see anything my eyes they feel really heavy and like like if a cop came up to me right now he would know by just like putting that yeah yeah the flashlight in my eyes um my hair is driving me like really bad because I don't like I don't like it down but it's still a little damp and that's a whole other story that nobody needs to hear about um okay so it was the medicated candies from Ken abysmal the cubes the taste it said was strawberry Kiwi but it tasted like weed to me like THC like you right the whole time okay so eating cuz I did eat today and I do and drink right it wasn't like the other time yesterday when I did that review when I had nothing in me so even with like had supper and all that stuff so it took a little bit over an hour to kick in I took two cubes so it's 60 milligrams you feel relaxed feel good no anxiety or paranoia you feel it like really heavy in the eyes so that's why I said if a cop stopped me he would know right away that like if he's Sean Sean if he but Dad the flashlight like in my eye whatever eyes he would know just by looking at the eyes no munchies or anything like this is like what I would like to do right now is like if somebody were to tell me like some stories just like if somebody I would just like to listen cuz that's what I feel like doing that's how that's how relax do you feel I was gonna oh I was going to do um the bong toe but that I thought well I should maybe just roll a joint but then like it's this start to kick in so now and the more I'm talking for whatever stupid reason it's kicking in more like it's you know I still feel relaxed though but now I'm still thinking I should roll the joint because why not I think that's what I'll do any of you girls out there that are watching this this would be like a good time to really like like pamper yourself like either do it at home and you know get some really good body cream and whatever or like have somebody drive you to the beauty salon place and get them to you know do your feet and your nails and everything else it would probably feel really good I would imagine so I don't have the patience for that so I'll just use the body cream that's that's good enough but and the guys I think um I think you guys should probably either get your spouse to give you a really good back rub or get your feet massaged if you don't have a spouse or your spouse's no they're not doing it because maybe they just don't want to then go to like one of those massage places and get somebody over there to give you a back massage or a foot massage and it would feel good I'm not doing stages but it's like way too long my mouth that was getting really dry ik and I should have brought up some some water and I didn't so look well I'm not really in a lot bit right now okay so I'm gonna go and feel relaxed some more and then I roll a joint and then come back and just say whatever tell you tell you guys when I'm feeling or when I'm not feeling or maybe I'm still feeling the same who knows okay I'll be back after I do the joint or whatever whatever I say because I don't remember okay so I finished that joint like 10-15 minutes ago so um there was not a need to smoke smoke it because I just feel great but just feel that much better I got the munchies vibe so let's chip cookies and you can't see it but it's milk and that tastes pretty damn good I would say recommend these cubes from can abysmal the hard candies um maybe not for the like the long time smokers that you may need to take like a couple bags but like the average person and like the thirty just the one would like kind of calm you down a bit just sixty would I took um like I can really feel it that's why I didn't want to take more than 60 cuz I did the hundred whining oh that was like it was some strong [ __ ] so 60 is good you feel it food tastes like really good I also can side my back was a little bit sore earlier I don't feel that the foot that's [ __ ] up I got these like I said it's nerve pain I haven't felt that and I was getting like real bad today you feel like pretty good almost like a shirt brought up another cookie but it's okay ouch um I was gonna say if those kind of pains were stopping you from like saying working out or just going for a blocker um going to the gym or whatever I say that if you took one of these cubes you wouldn't be feeling whatever pain it was that you're having I'm working out wasn't gonna make it any worse either like let's just put it that way I would say to do this because you could probably you know you've been getting out going for a walk or something like did I think this is like the stuff you'd want to do that on it's like an abysmal so anyways but [Music] I still feel relaxed but more like you want to get into like clean bed and hair like new sheets put on or whatever it is or and just get comfortable and you can just think about stuff I don't know what stuff but just think or if you didn't want to think thank Charlie's outside the door then close your eyes and go to sleep because that's what the next thing is is closing closing my eyes and going to sleep I think I I don't know what I love it like they look a little red here or something I don't really like looking at my eyes cuz are just oh my god you probably hear something that's just Justin oh yeah look a little bit like a little puffy there I'm not puffy but like well maybe yeah like here they look not puffy but like hi I guess you could say that you could tell it's all in the eyes okay so how do the match hey it's good get it it's like an abysmal it's the medicated hard candies the 30 milligram ones if you feel really good so and pretty soon I'm going to be going to bed so um I think that's everything I think I covered it all I may get something else to eat though cuz everything just tastes good why shouldn't say everything gets all I had was no good cookies in those tasted really good so um my I feel I can barely [ __ ] open them I don't know do they look do they look good I feel like I feel like Michael Madsen Hey oh jeez okay hang on like Michael Madsen they're all squinty anyways [Music] that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "yB1UnVyXoNk": "[Music] hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on that's good okay I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies these ones are orange I've never had the orange one from a can abismo that was early orange and there are 30 milligrams each and usually I do the this doesn't fall me a second here I have this balancing and okay that's better hey I'm just trying to hopefully that's good okay so they're the medicated hard candies from cannabis melt this flavor is orange the reason I'm doing this is because like I really need a good night's sleep I think that is the cure to this cold that I have or I don't know and it always is worse you know later on like one after supper time so I really think that sleep is the key for me and I didn't take a nap at all today so I'm just taking these out they look like clothes they look like that just a little orange cube full of goodness and I have my taste and stuff back so that's that's a good thing I'm not tasting orange I'm tasting the the THC but I'm not tasting the orange and the weather today is not helping either it's been it was raining earlier and then it was it was just so damp and whose a yuck day so I'm really hoping that this helps me a lot and on top of that to like I'm also wondering how much of this is even cold because I do have allergies really bad and fall in spring and there's a lot of leaves and stuff right now so yeah I'm not tasting the orange I don't taste the THC or whatever it is I can was a little bit wobbly so I've usually been waiting like an hour and a half sometimes in average 45 minutes when like for this to fully kick in like usually I'll feel it like within the hour maybe a little bit past but then I've been waiting right so I'll do the same thing with with like this when I when I when it kicks in and then I'll just wait a bit and then I will come back and let you know if it helped with anything that I'm feeling and it's hot about something I don't know usually I have good stuff to chat about I think ok so we'll be back on this kicks in okay so I thought come out here and smoke some of this joint talk a little bit out out here and then go back in and talk more inside it's um if you're like if your body's overtired or whatever like this stuff really kicks in hard and like you do get the like the munchies but like you really don't want to do anything like any if you had any plans you could just probably you wouldn't be doing it this is so the the Lindsay og that I'm smoking and now that stuff's like pretty good um what else I really feel this in my eyes yeah you feel like relaxed and happy and just not really wanting to do too much of anything and then if you wait till like I don't know how long it's been I would say probably like an hour and a half an hour maybe longer and then you smoke like adjoint it just kind of makes everything like really really bad bad but good and it's really chilly out here so I'm just gonna wait for Charlie to do his business but this out smoke at all and I don't know yet and then anyways well I'll meet you like we'll go back inside that's where we will be next um I really don't feel like great um they came a little bit hungry so that's why I'm having yeah the peach flavored oatmeal I bet that and like I just want to go to sleep cuz I don't cuz that's how I feel I really don't like that bad feeling but aces like I'm oh I'm already tired and I don't know my nose isn't that stuffy right now either it's it's doing better yeah I really should I don't want to finish my oatmeal coz feel like I'll get sick but that's my favorite my favorite kind oatmeal is a peach baked flavored I made toast and I really don't feel like eating that now either yeah I didn't expect to feel like this cuz I don't know usually I don't but tonight I do so I think it's just I think I just need some sleep oh if I had all my rest then I wouldn't feel like this I should make sure like I drink lots of water she probably sleep for a long time I've already told and to like not to wake me up and just let me sleep because this is like how you want to feel that going to sleep as you could think about your legs on the sheets I don't want us to talk about [Music] I've had this this stupid stupid cold for four days now that's like a record this tastes good the jam toast I hate I hate the crust I don't know why I just do I think it's just the way it's like is like hard and in [Music] I don't know more bunched up I guess only because after the crushes all softness Oh I don't know it just doesn't taste good not really uh a crust person if you're like in need of sleep you should get some of this the medicated hard candies from cannabis my one that will help you go to sleep and sleep for a long time you'd probably wake up feeling really good oh that hostess is really good Oh what else to say about it the owners doesn't taste I can't taste any orange at all great it in oh my [ __ ] number 10 I just fell really high and you want to go to sleep I don't know what else I don't know what else to say I think I want to say goodbye to you guys because I need to get some sleep and the there I Canada's of all the medicated of hard candies there's lots of different flavors [Music] they're a good sleep aid it's a good like you don't want to do anything thing type of thing no matter what like you just you just keep on thinking that you want to go to sleep so that's it that's all bye", "ajoa5U9ymOI": "[Music] hello today I'll be making a small batch of hard candy using Lauren's super strength oils if you're new to our channel would like to see more recipes please like subscribe and don't forget to click the notification button [Music] I'm specifically highlighting Loran oils because I tend to get the most compliments when I use their flavors it's very important to set everything up in advance on the stovetop I keep a cup with warm or hot water to keep my brush in and it'll be where I place my thermometer when I remove it you'll need a brush or a tool to remove sugar crystals from your pot we purchase these cute silicone bear molds which will provide a link to in the description however if you don't have a mold you can use a small lightly oiled sheet pan for your candy on medium heat add your sugar corn syrup and water and stir until it comes to a small boil [Music] periodically you want to take your brush and remove the crystals that form around your pot now that your mixture is boiling stop stirring but continue to brush the sugar crystals that form around your pot your candy will be ready when it reaches the hard crack line on your candy thermometer as you get closer to 300 you want to make sure that your oil and food coloring if you're using it are ready because once you reach hard crack stage your candy mixture becomes time sensitive now that your mixture is reached hard crack stage remove your thermometer add your food coloring if you're using it and your one dream of Lorien oils stirring continuously some oils because they're super strength have strong scents so be sure to keep your oven or your stove fan on after you remove your mixture from the heat quickly but carefully because it's very hot transfer into your molds or onto a sheet pan my husband isn't a professional videographer and I'm not a professional candy maker so this shot is a little shaky and a little sloppy however this little tool I'm using is perfect to fix my mistake so we'll be sure to add a link to this silicone spatula below whether using molds or a sheet pan let your candy cool completely before removing once your candy is cooled if you're using a sheet pan gently break your candy into bite-sized pieces and you can also sift powdered sugar over them I personally prefer molds because they don't have as many sharp edges and as you can see even with arthritic hands they easily pop out [Music] sometimes I accidentally have fill some of the molds and we end up with a bowl full of accidents which my husband is happy to dispose of there are many recipes for hard candy as you can see I have a variation including rock candy but for more candy ideas we'll put a link to Lauren's website in the description this is a great homemade gift for any occasion or any season please share your candy

videos and thank you for watching", "GFN6FfTCmxo": "believe me when i left gnc years ago i had no idea i'd be coming back to talk about them producing good products in their private labels they have not always had the greatest products their weibolic for the longest time was known as that protein that you were going to get pushed no matter what when you went into the gnc super proud today to be talking about beyond raw's lit their beyond raw line again may have not launched with the greatest of formulas but these days is actually touting some pretty good formulas they did their pump a few months back uh their rtd of the lit actually is tied for first with ghost energy for our top rtd's of 2020 and uh today we're gonna be talking about beyond raw's lit in the powder version uh specifically their flavor collab with jolly rancher now i i don't know if you guys are tired of losing me talking about flavor collabs i'm sure probably about 20 of you just nodded your heads yeah but you know i know ghost has done a really great job of pioneering this bringing it to the industry and showing the industry what can be done to legitimize this industry and i realize that most of my viewers especially on youtube maybe not instagram if some more mainstream people there uh are way more interested in like hardcore stuff but i can't state enough how much these flavor collabs help our industry out they help us legitimize our industry for mainstream consumers when mainstream consumers come to us when they say uh jolly rancher that's like wow that's a huge brand it's actually pretty cool i want to try this out this flavor i want to try it so today i'm going to talk about the formula and at the end i'm going to finish it off with a flavor of you this is completely sealed i have not tried this flavor out i'm going to put it in some cold water and try it out before we get to that you guys know i have to sit down and talk about the formula now uh we don't have a business affiliate relationship with gnc uh we were supposed to be their media group for their uh global convention this year but obviously with chronovice that didn't work out uh we are you know doing some kind of content stuff with them but i actually went and picked this up myself and wanted to do my own video on it so there's two blends in here the energy and mental intensity blend as well as the pump and no support blend now this product let's be real this is an in-house private label brand for gnc this product is meant to bring consumers to a better ingredient panel than before obviously it is improved but this is also a product that's going to have to have a higher margin for gnc they are cutting out the middleman and producing themselves but this product is going to be both aiming to be a good product and have a good margin for them they're going to want to make more money on this obviously so there's some good stuff in here there's some some stuff i would like to make better i'm gonna be honest about that but they're it is pretty net positive here and i i'm hoping at the end this flavor is pretty good carnitine beta alanine first ingredient in energy and mental intensity now i wouldn't really say that carnosyn beta alanine is really part of energy or mental intensity i guess you could say energy in terms of uh endurance energy long energy but they've got 3.2 grams of carnosine here now i'm not tied to needing carnosine i think that generic beta alanine is just fine but i hear at 3.2 grams they have uh the study dose or one of the study doses we're happy with 3.2 grams and we can move forward without talking about too much about it obviously beta alanine's gonna help add extra sets and reps onto your workouts over time it's something you need to take and actually be saturated with which happens around 179 grams in a short amount of time you have to feed yourself 3.2 grams every day for a while to keep that up over time it's going to help you out it is one of the more studied and proven ingredients in the industry so i'm happy that they put it in here it's pretty self-explanatory now here's one that i'm not all that on board with 1.5 grams of micronized creatine as creatine monohydrate now creatine monohydrate is my preferred version of creatine what 1.5 grams is not even close to the clinical dosage here now i understand why people when brands use 3 3.5 for because depending on your body weight you might not even need a full 5 grams now also with the rest of the package if you have a whole stack you're supposed to be taking i understand breaking up creatine because it doesn't need to be taken at any specific time it doesn't need to be all in one dose and well they want you to buy the whole stack honestly but here it's 1.5 grams i'm not aware of any rest of the stack that has another 3.5 grams to make it a full 5 grams but you know whatever if you're taking this product just make sure you're taking extra creatine it's a little unfortunate because crazy monitor is extremely cheap but you know gnc is gonna make their choices moving forward caffeine anhydrous 250 milligrams this is pretty middle of the road for caffeine i prefer to have a blend of short and long-term acting caffeine but at 250 milligrams it really wouldn't be that much of a difference caffeine anhydrous at 250 you're gonna feel nice um it's not overly stimulant for too many people if you're a very small female this might affect you a little bit hard uh this will mostly have to do with your caffeine tolerance so if you are a crazy uh starbucks shopper you may not have a problem with this but 250 is not all that much it's going to help wake you up but it's roughly a little bit less than a whole can of bang i love atp from ancient peat and apple extract 150 milligrams i'm a big fan of atp any stuff that that helps with energy and strength and power output is important for me i like it i think that more people should be focusing on that over just plain pump and energy this is a really great ingredient for performance athletes uh but even if you are a physique athlete your training is going to be what dictates your physique so heavier training harder training more intense training is going to translate into your body composition you need to be aware of that elevatp is a great ingredient for that purpose studies on lftp basically show that increases atp within the muscle now atp and sustaining high levels of atp is very important for high levels of training another study showed that it could increase one rep maxes of squats and deadlifts now that may be important to someone like me as a power lifter but as someone like a bodybuilder or a gym rat or crossfit or whatever that's going to translate not just in your one rep max if yours one rat max goes up you're also your rep weights are going to go up the only way to create hypertrophy is through progressive overload over time giving your body a larger stimulus now whether that's more sets more reps more weight up to you but this is going to help you increase that over time which is going to be important for hypertrophy and strength so great ingredient super happy to see them putting it in here they follow that up with a personal favorite of mine neuro factor neurofactor is an amazing ingredient that i feel more than most nootropic ingredients out there at 100 milligrams this is the clinical study dose so i'm happy to see gnc using this gnc is actually the first company i remember seeing this in their lit rtd the can i remember seeing it long time ago and being very impressed they were using something that was new um gnc's regulatory department their um research and development department i like them in some ways i don't like them in others um i was not a fan of how long it took them to include dynamine in their regulatory of allowed stuff but i do think that they do the extra step to make sure that everything is safe for their consumers i won't get too far into it because well i don't know if you guys all really care to listen to it that long but neurofactor increases this thing called bndf which is mostly concentrated in the brain it's very helpful for focus um and brain health but it also works synergistically with caffeine so you're going to have a great amount of energy for this workout using them together now the pump and no2 support ingredients here are going to be three grams of citrulline and 1.5 grams of nitrogen i'm both happy and conflicted here because i love nitrogen at 1.5 grams i get a great pump i love citrulline as well but i like to see a minimum of four grams of citrulline now there was a study at the university of arkansas last year that compared eight grams of citrulline malate which was six grams of citrulline versus 1.5 grams of nitrogen and they found that the two of them actually yielded the same amount of pump and when i was at supply side west sitting with nutrition 21 who by the way we do have a business affiliate relationship and i want to make sure that we do have a little bit of bias here i know you guys love to bring this up uh i am friends with the issues 31 i frequently go to dinner with their president joe is an amazing guy i love the stuff they make their whole team is passionate about improving this industry they are very good people and i like the products they make but their ingredients are backed by studies clinical data and human data and it's important to me and when they were presenting this data to me i was i said to them well that's great i like that these two ingredients are now in a level playing field but what happens when you take them together do we need to take these at these dosages because i think that a lot of times in these ingredients you could use a little bit less of both and yield a maybe better result at least the same result so i would have liked to see in situated four grams here that's the clinical dosage we don't have any other data to suggest that it being with neutron's gene allows you to use any less now theoretically we probably could theorize that using less citrulline would be okay alongside something like uh netraza gene which is a stabilized arginine which produces more uh nitric oxide in the body because of the way that it gets arginine to the body now citrulline also creates arginine in the body which then creates nitric oxide so we can theorize that using them together may have a synergistic effect we can use less of them but we don't know that for sure that's why i'm a little bit disappointed here with the pump product because i'd like to see one more gram of situation just one but that that is really only due to the technicality of what the studies show if there were studies out there showing citrulline and trusting together i'd be able to say well maybe this is actually synergistic or maybe maybe the data shows it is but we don't have that data we don't have a lot of companies studying ingredients together instead of you know against each other i think that a lot of the time a lot of these products we're theorizing what happens when all these ingredients get put together we don't know a lot so in any case i'm super happy that gnc went with a full dose of neutralization instead of going full of citrulline lowering the trouser gene uh but hey we're never gonna know until we start studying and trying it out um i have taken citrulline nitrogen together before and personally i do think it has a bit more of a synergistic effect so i'm not sitting here and saying that it's okay from the underdog citrulline next to the nitrogen but i can definitely say i would understand why they would again like i said in the beginning this is going to be a product that is going to deliver on results but also it's going to be a little bit of a better price point for gnc it is their private label right if you want a more expensive product a more built out product they always have uh third-party vendors for that gnc sell some great brands they now sell axe and sledge uh ghost is one of their main partners i think nutribio is still there caged muscle is there so you have a lot of options and you could actually stack a lot of the stuff with this product here uh it's one of the benefits of going to a store instead of buying straight from a brand so i've got about eight fluid ounces of cold water in this shaker cup next to me i'm gonna take a nice nice scoop of this and i'm gonna let you know what smells like jolly ranchers i'm gonna let you know if it tastes like them it's a nice deep thunk but i know that like a good percentage of you guys really only care what it tastes like so i'm joking all right cheers it'll taste just like a watermelon jolly rancher i got no complaints about flavor tastes literally just like a jolly rancher the messed up thing is i don't have a workout too after this i literally am gonna drink this and edit this video cracked out well gnc congratulations it tastes like a jolly rancher i'll let you know how how my pump is in a little bit but big fan of the energy blend here neurofactor is going to help me focus for this editing session i guess my really only complaint would be that you used a uh sleeve instead of a sticker well [Music] i'm a fan of the formula i think that it has some things that i would personally change but hey i'm just ben kane at price well i'm not gnc the you know billion dollar company they obviously know what they're doing obviously this product is gonna work for for people um some little things that i might change but maybe they know things that we don't that's absolutely fine uh there's this is why we have so many different products out there there's people that want different things and want to feel different things if you have any questions about it go over to pricewall.com gnc we also have the plum product there and pretty soon sustained protein blend girl scouts coconut caramel um we do that one sometime soon but seriously uh product is great for what you know gnc is producing i would never have thought that we'd be talking about a product this great back in the day when i left gnc um you know they've really grown over the years and i'm super proud to see them doing that in this industry as the juggernaut of the industry that they are um including brands like nutrition 21 including stuff like elevatp neuro factor i think is a huge step for the industry alongside that flav uh flavor collab in any case i really appreciate you watching if you may just point the video wow leave a comment below i want to thank you for watching this long and if you have any questions about the product just comment below as well i love talking about it in any case really thanks for watching me ramble for this long i really appreciate it and have a great day [Music] welcome to price plow [Music] my [Music]", "emYJr_OoIeY": "hey youtubers it's Kent from Keaveney productions TV welcome back to another Ken Dalek thirsty Thursdays just for you as you can recall last week we did four thirsty Thursdays the Jolly Rancher sodas and we did the blue raspberry and the strawberry and I preferred the blue raspberry over the strawberry but this week I found watermelon and green apple and it's at a store here in Bradford called hasty market just on a whim that's decided to go into a different convenience store there's a lot of people said they couldn't find them the other convenience store I went to for the other sodas that I bought weird it was just a regular no-name convenience store this is hasty market and they're all over at least Ontario that I know of alright so let's do watermelon first I'm not a huge watermelon kind of guy just don't like the flavor of watermelon I'm not sure but let's see if this Jolly Rancher is any better than any of the other watermelon things I've tried in the past it definitely smells like watermelon but it smells kind of more like Barry hmm you guys I like me and just can't stand watermelon it's there's a cross between Barry and watermelon it's got a nice sweet taste to it but the watermelon does this make me wanna gag let's try green apple I want to think again this they were carbonated as you're gonna see that the bubbles and they're just want to make sure I cover that part but the green apple if it's gonna be anything like a granny smith apple it's gonna be sour that one wasn't sour I was just sweet and yucky tasting yes you heard it from me yucky tasting okay Jolly Rancher a green apple please give me something I like I'm a smells like green apple Wow that is completely different than I was thinking hmm it kind of tastes like green Gatorade or green Powerade over like a sour green grant granny smith apple I'm liking that mmm not sour at all it's sweet hmm well ladies and gentlemen if you like watermelon you will like this one I'd give it an indifferent to a would not recommend and not to happy with the flavor of why I'm on but I thought I'd try it because a few people emailed me and said Ken when you go out again to do more Jolly Rancher things try to do Apple and watermelon like I said if you love watermelon you probably would really like that but I prefer this one this again tastes like green Gatorade carbonated drink a doraid or Powerade like not sour at all I like that I'll be throwing away my watermelon all right viewers and supporters of cutie productions TV thank you for stopping by if this is the first time you've stopped by and you enjoyed watching me review these drinks and you

ding ding ding ding and we'll see you next time on another kendama thirsty Thursdays kendama cart Cheers", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "QImpKpJ-QZE": "[Music] what's up poopypants is welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a bit of a classic which means edibles and today we are taking a look at spacejam cannabis infused sour gummy space drops and their handmade vegan cannabis treats so the box here is about all the information you want to see on it we've got lab tested results right there made then batch number all that good stuff and at the front we've got our milligram each eight point seven to perserve per serving for eighty seven point seven two milligrams total it was advertised as a hundred milligram edible but it looks like it only has eighty seven point seven two milligrams of THC oh this is a gummy of some kind but I'm not really sure exactly what they are sour gummy space drops let's find out together guys elevate your being with Space Jam okay so here we go inmate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there are little drops just in a thing that looks just like this some paper Hana in there there's not much to it there as you can see the drops are in there let's give them a taste it was a pretty sour definitely definitely some cannabis taste to it gummies usually do not too bad it's better factious sour flavor and this sort of sugary salary crystals you can see there do a very good job of masking this THC I like the flavors quite a bit um it's pretty good they're a little chewy a little sour but all things considered this is a pretty fine tasting little gummy edible maybe it's the fact that it's made with premium ice hash water hash whatever the hell that is so guys I'm about to go see a movie this new one with Melissa McCarthy that doesn't look like a Melissa McCarthy movie as soon as that movie's over with and don't worry guys with all our reviews I'm gonna finish all ten of these drops gonna go see this movie gonna come out about two hours or so let you know what I think of the movie and more importantly what I think of these space jims cannabis infused sour gummy space drops I think I got all those nouns and adjectives there alright guys I will see in about two hours thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I whoa no that's a lie it has been actually closer to four hours since I've had a space gem cannabis infused sour gummy space drops uh I finished up my movie and the title of that by the way was can you ever forgive me with Melissa McCarthy true story weird movie but what you're really here for space gems they're pretty good guys I actually really like the taste of them for gummies they tasted pretty good uh they have an excellent sour sort of snap that really matched the cannabis flavor and then most importantly they got me pretty high um this isn't the top tier gummy brand out there right now this isn't like Plus which is truly amazing but this does proclaim to have a little bit less milligram \u00e4j-- however and I neglected to mention in the first half it is actually a little bit more expensive this time uh this one cost me 20 something dollars whereas the Plus usually run about 15 pre-tax so this was a little bit more expensive for a little bit less of a high and I actually really like the way the Plus tastes as well so my recommendation to you is if your dispensary has both plus gummies and space gem try with the bullet stick with the plus but if you're looking for something a little different and this is the only gummy they've got I'd still recommend space gems again it's got a great flavor not a lot to eat not so much of a fan of the packaging as they almost all spilled out on me but they are a little pricey and they're not gonna get you quite as high I don't think it's the plus but still pretty good so before I bounce with you guys today I actually want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something and not weed related that you can enjoy throughout your week and this week I actually want to share with you the camera I'm using I picked up a GoPro Hero 7 black I've been using it to shoots in these videos finally got a better microphone on it and I love it it's great it's actually worked really well just as a little point and shoot camera for me for shooting reats videos and it's the hyperlapse stuff there are the hyper smoothing whatever they call it has been fantastic I've loved shooting some montages with it really cool really like the GoPro Hero 7 black and very strangely I was as I was deciding to do this as an endorsement billboard right up there so you know maybe that's what they were asking me to do I don't know all right guys well that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's the GoPro Hero 7 black and that's gonna do it for this review the space gem handmade vegan and cannabis treats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "UirMWx9OdK8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy crazy confusing place you call your dispensary today we are taking a look at one of those especially confusing what exactly are we talking about here kind of products that your dispensary may carry and what exactly kind of product is that well it's none other than other than tincture i guess what we're calling tincture in this day and age um and what we can also just call um emblematic of all of this sort of inconsistencies in uh weed policies especially when it comes to um dosage requirements so uh and how is that true well we are taking a look at an 800 milligram tincture that stretches the very definition of what tincture is and that is the five star extracts flavored tincture taste of peach oral uh tincture product again 800 milligrams of thc so what why am i so dubious it's not that i'm dubious of the 800 milligrams i'm um they have their lab testing results on this little confusingly curled up sticker here and you know shows the amount of thc in there i just bring this up because this isn't tincture by any traditional definition uh this is the exact same stuff that they were selling years ago when there was no limit on a thc in products and they called it syrup which was an allusion to the codeine sort of cough syrup that people used to drink i guess the idea was that it would get you so high it would be like coding i don't know i think but it shows you kind of how far off we are the mark here this is that exams exact same stuff which is now no longer able to be sold because the only thing you can sell over 100 milligrams is tincture so their notion or what they decided to do was not so much rewrite or create a new product but just simply rebrand existing stuff and i'm not saying that i actually don't know if they existed then or not but i've seen a lot of these syrup companies doing this cannabis is another one and i love them um but it i'm not blaming them i'm not saying it's anything wrong with them i'm just saying the laws are so stupid and screwy that way that you get weird stuff like um candy flavored syrup being called tincture which is nominally at least supposed to be medicinal um and uh this is again just like pink snow cone syrup except it will almost certainly taste gross now they do uh back when they used to sell this kind of stuff before they had you i think the consumption idea was you would take it like a syrup you'd mix it in with maybe soda or something here they really do suggest you take it like a tincture which i don't know if that sound is coming through it is just as thick as cough syrup so uh that seems kind of odious to me to have this much under your tongue of that thick goopy liquid but you know maybe we'll try it both ways and see uh so for an 800 milligram thc tincture i believe this was 60 bucks which is um more expensive than say your breeze uh kind of tinctures but kind of maybe in the range of some select those kind of levels so it's not the cheapest tincture out there either um uh it comes with this fancy and by fancy i mean the least fancy thing you've ever seen this little syringe for dosing which again thick thick syrup um so yeah not the cheapest um i've seen these five star extracts all over southern california especially in the long beach area and they usually come pretty highly recommended from folks as well uh and like all of our wheats reviews the way we're going to do this i know this is 800 milligrams i'm not going to do all 800 milligrams of this uh thing my guess is that it's gonna be quite gross um i uh when we do our tinctures the way i do all our edible reviews here on wheats is we do 100 milligrams because that's generally the size that you're going to buy in most edibles um and that's what we use as a baseline to review things off of so i will try to get as close to 101 8 of this bottle as possible really should have brought some scissors live and learn um i think i was able to just kind of pull it down yep there we go that smells like uh cheap gas station peach rings and weed lovely uh so yes as i said uh about 100 milligrams and then after i do all 100 milligrams it'll probably take me about i'm usually go over about an hour to do the whole thing i'll come back about two hours after that point let you know if this stuff is worth the hassle and the expense um my initial instinct is gonna be there are a lot of other tinctures out there that are cheaper and smaller so this one has some strikes against it already but we shall see you know maybe the thickness of the syrup something something yata cannabinoid receptors binding gabanoids done i don't know what i'm saying what i am now saying is wish me luck oh yes um our dosing uh instructions here on the back say that boy everything about this is just so cheaply uh or so rush put together 2.2 milliliters from here is 10 milligrams of thc our syringe is 3 milliliters um so you guys can do that conversion at home that's what roughly 13 milligrams ish in three milliliters uh in a full syringe which would be what how many of those in totality oh 13 times seven yeah like seven of those uh well no eight right yeah eight of these oh boy eight full ones of these that's gonna be fun well there's our oh my god okay they want me to put this all under my tongue that is ridiculous guys oh jesus okay well we'll try it um i'm guessing i'm gonna reserve taking this like normal syrup here we go oh [ __ ] um oh my god wow that is oh that's so bitter that is so insanely bitter wow wow oh my god oh that's um that is up there for most disgusting holy [ __ ] yuckers i've had to do that is nasty man at least i mean try to keep that all under your tongue as soon as it hits those taste buds ugh it is i mean it it tastes like cough syrup just straight up cough syrup ugh six more to go um i'm not going to be doing all of these sublingually i might try to do one more right here sublingually for you guys and then the remaining five i'm just gonna probably pour into a glass because and mix it with something this is just too much to bear [ __ ] okay oh [Music] oh oh holy christ disgusting oh it's still coming up oh jesus whoo well this is what i'm definitely suffering for you guys [ __ ] i hate this wow so what five six more six more of those for me everybody and just what um i'm gonna try to do these as uh over the next oh it might take me longer than an hour to get through all of these lovely little sons of guns but trust me i will and two hours after i get the last one of these hello buddy how are you doing the last after i get the last one these nasty sons of [ __ ] down i'll come right back here let you guys know if this is in any way worth all of the the uh rather prodigious amount of grotesqueness you have to stand ugh so far got a lot working against it sorry about the uh so much bitching um but you know we're just trying to be honest here and i will see you guys uh you know three three and a half hours pray for me see you soon [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about three and a half hours or so since i first said hello to you um in about 90 minutes since my last dropper under the tongue of this five star extracts the taste of peach as you can see or maybe our camera i'll show you the level is down to about 1 8 down as we're doing only 100 milligrams and uh this is gonna be a fun little end of this review because not very often anymore do i get sort of conflicted feelings about things it's pretty binary at this point this is good this isn't good buy this don't buy this like you know it's there aren't so many shades of gray but here um i i there's some yeah some interesting things um first and foremost does it work hell yes uh this is the 100 milligrams i did which was a [ __ ] lot um of liquid uh hit very hard i have no complaints in that department this is among the strongest tincture i have done um it is yeah the i don't know what the formulation is here but wow uh very very very um uh positive when it comes to your uh getting your your actual high off the product 100 milligrams this did the trick and then some um but there are other things about it that are that may make me say like well maybe not you maybe not want to invest in this and um we'll go back to the price again briefly it's more expensive than some other tinctures uh for theoretically less thc but i'm gonna guess that this is gonna i mean with as strong as that hundred milligrams that first one was um it's gonna feel very much as if it had the full thousand milligrams or more uh in comparison to other sort of equivalently strong tinctures out there um so yeah again price theoretically it's more expensive but it feels quite a bit stronger in some regards um the other big downside is how much you have to do for especially for tinctures so i brought a comparison here i'm working on this review of this breeze um cbd thc one to one spray um and this thing has a thousand milligrams of combined thc cbd and i've reviewed one that has a thousand milligrams of just pure thc so this is oh it's half a fluid ounce it's not even oh my god okay that uh changes things again this is a half a fluid ounce 0.5 fluid ounces um and it has a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids in it this is six fluid ounces and has 800 um uh milligrams of thc in it and that is crazy um i thought this originally was one ounce it's not it's half an ounce so i have to change my calculation thankfully just gotta double it um that makes this right here 15 times literally 15 times stronger per volume than the syrup and the syrup is revolting it never got easier to go down um i did take it sublingually every time i did not end up mixing it i just decided to stay consistent but it is truly gross i am very much looking forward to doing the rest of this bottle because it's it's a really pleasant high but [ __ ] is it nasty um it way worse than i mean i feel like such a prima donna now with these um these are nothing compared to this so it's real gross real strong and you have to do a [ __ ] ton of it but it is real strong and it will get the job done you just gotta kind of suffer through it um and you know uh kind of hard to say whether or not it's uh you know that that is ultimately gonna come down to you those factors whether it's worth it or not um if i want a uh a really powerful high this may be something i go to in the future but if i'm looking for something more casual something that i don't want to just have to put on a clothespin over my nose and just gack down probably stay away um and before i go guys normally i like to save the cherry on top so a little something extras a little just extra recommendation that's not weed related um i usually like to save those for our favorite you know overwhelming two thumbs up style reviews however today let's give you one that i'm a little conflicted about not conflicted about the actual thing but conflicted about oh man it'll just make you uh feel uh conflicted in your soul uh and that is what a terrible segue by the way um i was trying to think of like oh [ __ ] i want to recommend this book what's a transition don't do it while you're high on five-star extracts try to think of one beforehand anyways the uh book is called oh my god why did i not look up the title exactly as hot as it is called um ah yes the book is called evicted poverty and prophet in the american city by matthew desmond uh released in 2016. uh i just finished it earlier today uh it was the pulitzer prize or a pulitzer prize winner uh for nonfiction in 2016. and uh dessert absolutely deserves it it is a book that won't make you feel very good it is a book that will uh continue to you know make you realize oh boy we've been kind of living in a collective delusion for a while but hey no better time to burst that bubble than in the middle of a pandemic so give evicted poverty and profit in in the american city a chance it it's as good as everybody has ever told you that it is if anybody has ever told you about it um but again if you're not looking for something that's going to thoroughly depress you to your core avoid uh and that's the conflict and because we were conflicted about our five star extracts the taste of peach super strong but also you got to do a lot of it and it tastes like rotting ass so thumbs up for evicted poverty and profit in the uh american city thumbs sideways for how it makes you feel and thumb sideways for the taste of ass boy this has gone long you can see how strong it is when i ramble it's because i'm high thanks so much for watching guys be sure to stay high but of course even more importantly stay healthy my friends it's crazy out there and in the meantime oh i already said stay high and stay healthy [ __ ] do those things and i'll see on the next review goodbye", "FNMXcspO7AM": "oh gee

"[Music] alright guys here we go here's the face where we set to put on the collar with clear read by Tamia [Music] already mixed it [Music] and mix it with 91% isopropyl alcohol so it seems to work for me I've had good results so we went with that here is all of our spoons all without different coatings I've labeled it each stone so we will go with the red first we have one two three four five six seven eight we have ten different bases and I will do a a spoon with nothing on it at the end we can see what the clear red looks like on its own so out further ado let's go we spread the spoons out so I can grab them easy [Music] all set get comfortable here sit down while I do this for a change but that makes a difference just a hair on this baby I'm using a basic gear brush for this because again I consider this a base coat there is it's gonna be pretty subtle here at first because start to go on though it's showing up right away so I can increase the pressure on my brush a little bit up to 20 pounds I think I had that 15 and see the difference putting a little more paint this over this died all-clad dark aluminum looks more of a point Iron Man red not bad mr. color silver sorry I bumped the camera I'm kind of close to it that looks great sorry guys I really hit the camera on that one trying to make sure the spoon is dust free this is to my titanium gold all right Vallejo Chrome well boys dark to me a bronze [Music] another clue on this one's gonna look at all it's coming in Wow very good this is impressive who know this would be good to to tone uh asses ah be using one of the previous ones I just did over the chrome and then over the bronze would give you that beautiful two-tone says ah be look you want wow that's great spray can clone this is a teep Vitalogy and a spray can chrome out of Hobby Lobby let's see what this looks like this works it could save you a step of airbrushing no notes we try [Music] not bad the texture isn't great but then again I'm gonna matte coat most of my stuff if not I will gloss coat it for decal purposes but hey this didn't come out too bad I'm gonna reload my brush maybe one second the paint right here Olsen in each other let us continue liquid gold this is by Vallejo Malia's liquid gold ladies end up looking pretty similar so I guess you can eliminate a lot of choices now of course the blues and the yellows will probably have a different result but for red seems to have very similar results other than that bran but that was really dark and the dark alone among which the quartz is dark so this will obviously will have a different result this is to me a gunmetal [Music] very nice good coverage no orange peel that look that looks great Tamiya gunmetal Tamiya metallic gray another dark deep-red obviously with the dark gray as your base coat however it looks pretty good what's really good all right Vallejo liquid white gold white gold this has a very nice look to it this is one of mortar candy effects I've seen so far really nice real nice the liquid gold is pre thinned it comes in a nice sized bottle this is a good choice and last but not least a plain white spoon let's see what this thing looks like with nothing on there stuff goes on nice though really good just read clear read over a white spoon alright guys I'll show the results if I can that's them we'll do a comparison you know at the very end of this video and we'll give a close ups and I probably put a photograph up so you can see it too a photograph better than video so back to the booth here [Music] there we go they will see you what the next color [Music]", "rlTOTAu_hmU": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds [ __ ] right I got some hint to Jalapa no Tostitos the good kind not the [ __ ] cheap kind eh oh my [ __ ] [Music] we told you last night thought it was gonna take our THC gummy edibles or whatever the [ __ ] they're called they're 25 milligrams each well she's still gonna take them she's gonna take two of them there's four on the bag when she's gonna take two and as you can see they're 25 milligrams each so yes I guess you'll be taking 50 milligrams and yeah so Donna did you want to eat your your to gummy bears I don't know what to you want what flavors can you guys see her I think so I hope so what kinds of yellow and it goes a yellow one you need to drink to wash them down so yellow and a green 50 milligrams down the hatch hey this is okay little sour but no bad tastes or nothing no how weed smells it tastes like how weed smells like you could taste weed if you were like if you were good so your taste in THC yeah I think it's a THC you're probably tasting okay so yeah you can want to take a shower now all right so she ate two of those as you guys seen and she has to take a shower so she'll take a shower those will kick in and she'll be back with the this and that's and whatever you know what I mean she'll tell you guys what she's feeling her whatever the [ __ ] I'm drinking a piece tea Snowberry [ __ ] my gosh it the other way a Snowberry piece tea got a cigarette holder right on the can there [Music] usually I get the raspberry one but the snowberries pretty [ __ ] good Snowberry is pretty [ __ ] good a [ __ ] yeah so I think I showed you guys that already right you read all the stuff I hope it's coming in if you want to read it pause your screen and yeah [Music] hopefully it's coming in clear for you guys I don't know I can't tell my mirror is so small that little [ __ ] [ __ ] mirror I can see that I have it in the screen but I can't see clear enough to see if it's blurry or whatever the [ __ ] you know what I mean [ __ ] nothing ever worked so a [ __ ] sakes we have to buy almost gigantic [ __ ] mirrors I was gonna but I just kind of ridiculous to carry that around him you know to film a video you mean if I can pull up my own [ __ ] hair [ __ ] anyway I'm still smoking cheese if anybody's wondering my blog looks like dehydrated piss hey looks like somebody was really on the liquor a [ __ ] sakes I was gonna clean it today but I [ __ ] forgot just as I was thinking oh yeah I'm supposed to [ __ ] clean this thing I was already doing [ __ ] bong toke saying you know I figured well you know I might as well just keep doing bong toast all right anyway cheese it's a little nippy out today [Music] I think they said it was for that's not too bad but he's a little bit of a cool wind day and like I said before my door frames are all [ __ ] in the front end in the back so I get a cool breeze coming through all the time it's almost like having central air Hey till the summer comes and it's hotter [ __ ] [ __ ] anyway I'm gonna fill my ball back up donna's just getting out of the shower right now she's getting dressed or something so I figured I'd show you guys this I don't know if you can even see that it's a [ __ ] of salami and it's covered with Parmesan cheese you see the thick layer of Parmesan cheese on the outside [ __ ] right say I'm gonna cut a few pieces cuz I got the [ __ ] munchies look at that a look at how thick the parmesan cheeses oh my [ __ ] you guys should try some it's pretty [ __ ] good Hey look the salam is my [ __ ] [ __ ] sakes I hope I didn't wreck the video for you guys but I thought it was funny I saw ami clock with Parmesan cheese on it has a funny kind in the car came a Parmesan cheese clock you guys should try this out it's pretty [ __ ] good it goes good with the weeds they anyway let's do another bong talk and that I'm gonna go and see if Dawn is ready and you know maybe her gummy bears are kicking in or whatever the [ __ ] they were and yeah so I'm gonna do another plum token I'm gonna see if she's ready anyway give me a few seconds and I'll be back with Donna watch sakes okay Donna's gonna tell us about how she feels on the medicated sour bears remember she took 50 milligrams how do you feel on the Bears tell him how you feel ah you can't you see good [ __ ] it's okay like it sir if you're like doing stuff now you asking me or telling me no I'm telling you you're telling them do you want a banana a banana no you go good like the coffin Hey look the bananas my [ __ ] hey daughter the bananas my [ __ ] I'm stupid I thought it was funny I had two different [ __ ] today so I thought that I'd be really funny I had a Parmesan cheese salami [ __ ] and had a banana [ __ ] two [ __ ] I had two cogs and transform from one to the other it went from they went from a meat to a fruit I guess that wasn't funny eh anyway keep talking it looks like your reflexes are pretty quick on the [ __ ] on the gummies I said keep talking she's like [ __ ] use didn't hit my bananas actually I wasn't gonna hit you with holy [ __ ] Donna's been beat with bananas before she wrote the monkeys okay ah they're waiting to hear how you feel them like I said out of ten you feel like nah I'm going to if you you know smoke a joint have a beer or two or three or four I guess if you're like okay where you are like how much you smoke you would probably need like a watch thanks thanks but like somebody okay I say there's like somebody that does it like me there is they would just need two of these but if you're like more than me then you would do three or four but like for a heavy user like yourself you went usually I think you need like that chocolate bar the six hundred milligram traveler yeah I don't know what else to say so they're naked Sadler bears you know the strange thing is I went on there to look to see like cuz I didn't really look at the reviews on this I just I don't think they're well maybe there's some bad ones but anyways they're not even there now what's not work the Bears left on the site maybe they sold out it doesn't say so just doesn't it's like they didn't expand exist anymore maybe they discontinued them yeah why maybe somebody died maybe though what if you had bad hurt and you took it maybe give you a good hurt my heart's really pumping like I'm here at certain field you got the munchies or anything no not not yet it's like I'm good I'm good to go good to go work very hard to go hmm leak I guess if you were driving if you were in a car with somebody not driving not you what let's you know stress that you would be good to drive to probably set brie early you'd be good to drive for a while you wouldn't have to stop she means if you're the passenger in the car not the driver I don't know if you guys understood that she doesn't mean take edibles and drive so don't take edibles and drive no she means if you're in a car going from Timmins to Sudbury which is a 4-hour Drive she as a passenger on these that's what she means she'd be having a jolly old time but you wouldn't need to stop anywhere I don't like you you got to make sure you tell them not to drive on it that's gotta be clear on what you're saying well I said like no you should have said as the passenger never ever drive there [ __ ] sakes you're gonna make somebody [ __ ] die and they're gonna blame me my channel is gonna be [ __ ] taken away because you [ __ ] killed somebody because you said to do edibles and drive no I never do edibles and drive for hours [ __ ] no I said the person not driving so your would be the passive I don't think you said that right yes I said let's stress that that's what I said I know what I don't know we'll have to go back and take a look at that so you were kind of hiding you mumbled it no I said let's dress that if you're in a car mhmmm let's dress that hey no I don't think anything we just said made any [ __ ] sound they're probably wondering what the [ __ ] were talking about is on the berries berries I don't know where'd you get the varies from my hand I was like what the cheese it berries Donna's on berries [ __ ] see she's gummy bears make you make things I you start to lie after a while you're not on berries [ __ ] where is John bears bears bears I'm Bears yeah not berries there's no safety you know why about you do I know how you said that you don't want to know why I think you said that anyway um milkshake yep we're gonna make a milkshake and what we're gonna make a milkshake I'll show you guys let's just get everything ready and then we'll just show you me that was a tongue twister yeah I know so everything gets thrown in that were thrown into milkshake then we'll show it grind up or blend up like I'll do everything just give me a second I'm gonna put everything together you just sit there because we don't want to have [ __ ] milkshakes with fingers in it because you'd probably chop one off oh look what wait it's not that long what the [ __ ] does the length of your finger have to do with anything you thought you were on [ __ ] berries a minute ago I've seen like I can't go down and you're also at when I said I was gonna go we were gonna go make the milkshake what did you say no what am I gonna do you don't seem like you have a clue right now just you sit there I'll be right back I'm gonna get everything ready then I'm gonna make some [ __ ] milkshakes and you just stay there [ __ ] [ __ ] hey we got some ice cream and some peanut M&Ms I already put them in there you know those are already ready to go sort of we gotta add some milk Donna just lit up her joint a joint of cheese a cheese joy that would you'd call that a cheese joint should be enough milk and we got this Hershey's almond Hershey's whole almonds and we're gonna snap that in half that's about half I guess put a big half and Donna's cuz she really likes the chocolate there that's that garbage of the way got a brownie here snap that half in the package and we're gonna throw some brownie in there because well why the [ __ ] not hey that's that and then we're gonna put the lid on and why isn't turn hard Oh what the flock why isn't it working hang on no oh wait hang on I didn't have this thing on properly [ __ ] sakes I thought it had its day already you must be get all the peanuts going [Applause] anyway I'm gonna blend up the rest of this [ __ ] and I'll meet you guys back at the table because it's probably gonna take a little bit to get all these things bust it up so yeah I'll meet you guys back at the table in a few seconds [Music] [Applause] oh my flock that's pretty chocolatey a your chocolatey - here's a probably more chocolate even - put more chopped down [ __ ] she's just about done her cheese joint that sounds a little [ __ ] de cheese joint so I guess the next question would be how do you feel after eating edibles and smoking a joint pretty relaxed some of them want to know if you're feeling any pain would the edibles help with their pain yes what kind of pain okay it helps with all kinds of pains I like I don't know about if you had like a migraine it never helped me with that but um everything else I don't know like why for everything else I don't know what but everything else it's like sore back does it help with ass or [ __ ] oh yeah [ __ ] I guess

the haze today I'm coming at you with another edible review today we're gonna be doing the spicy chamoy sweeter high gummy is now sweeter hi is a company I believe based in California they do a lot of different products I think they do like vaporizers edibles so on and so on on their website I couldn't find too much information on them specifically but they say they specialize in high quality lead which I think all these companies do anyway at this point these guys are the 300 milligrams on the packaging and it does not tell you which how much milligrams is in each candy strip which is the hard part but on the back to tell you the nutrition it has lots of sugar so if that's something that concerns you be aware of that but they are very very delicious let's just go into opening them they have one of these on them not one of those child safety loved ones again they don't tell you how much milligrams they're in each strip but here is one of the strips now I personally don't like sour candies I don't have a high tolerance for sours but if you do you will absolutely love them they're very similar sour points you like sour patch kids those aren't these are for you I'm sure these are gonna be good the spiciness too is also not overwhelming and if you're not really into spice this won't really hurt you it's gonna be like comparable to like those little sweet Mexican candies with the spice around it those those are the most similar to these other than the sour being like obviously really overwhelming for me this flavor on these guys are really really good I haven't tried the other flavors but the spicy and the sweet the combination is super super nice the high so for me from those guys you do get high I wanted to say that it feels like 300 milligrams I ate an entire pack of these in one day and it felt like probably like a hundred and fifty so I don't know who does their testing but yeah it's definitely if you're looking for 300 milligrams this will be a little bit of a fall short but if you're looking for 150 labeled 300 this is for you it was not overwhelming high either I didn't get those little butterflies feelings in my tummy I just started a little giggly I'm always feeling the loose and then I fell asleep which is a thing I gotta say about edibles they will make you knock out I fell asleep like 7 p.m. and woke up at 11 so if you want to sleep these are a great sleep aid honestly um I don't know why they didn't get me super high and just made me sleepy usually both come together but I don't know maybe way to hit me or maybe it was what I was doing that day but yes these will make you sleep won't make you get extremely high won't make you get paranoid will make you get in your head but if you're looking sleep these guys are a great option also for smell wise in my last standing a video a lot of people are wondering about the smell I get no THC flavor no THC smell but if you're looking for something and that can be really hot on the low somebody can take in public something that you're afraid someone might smell it in your backpack person like that you won't get this with this this you don't smell any THC no oil nothing even in the flavor you couldn't you couldn't tell the difference between this and a regular candy to be honest so yeah if I was you and I saw these guys at the dispensary it's 300 milligrams I got these for 15 bucks I would get because oh I I'll be honest a lot of these kind of packaging a lot of these kind of candies I don't pick up when I see they don't seem to hit very well for me they always seem to be disappointing but these guys were actually something I have now revisited this is the second time I bought it and I didn't I don't regret it I think they're they're they're fun so if you want something a little bit different you're tired of cushy punches you're tired of lemonade's you're tired of the whole shebang you guys see the speeder hire any other gummies I'm sure they're all the same I would pick it up so again my name is Sara P thank you so much for watching the haze please follow us at our Instagram at the haze channel also hit that subscribe button on our YouTube please leave a comment below let me know if there's an edible you want me to review I will go out and find it so thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you next time [Music] [Music]", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "21JMBlc-5M0": "well hello this is Darnell I'm 19 coming at you from my kitchen oh yes I am mm-hmm how the [ __ ] he doing I'm doing well I went back to the drawing board and I'm gonna bring you guys some Jolly Ranchers hard candy and suckers I've done these three times now and they've come out perfect each time so first let me just apologize that I'm not doing the demonstration live with you I will do one though I promise so this is what you're gonna need you ready 1 and 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup Caro syrup 1/2 cup water citric acid your flavor and color and a gel paste food corn okay candy molds sticks a candy thermometer a knife or a vegetable cutter an 8 by 9 pan or an 8 by 8 panel all of these products can be purchased at Walmart or Target or anywhere like that with the exception of the citric acid you probably will have to get the citric acid online at Amazon I didn't find it in any grocery store around the food coloring gel that I used there's a Wilson brand and I didn't really care for it because the colors work that vibrant so I went with a generic brand that's called great value that I bought here for 2 bucks and I use the tiny bit of the red ok this flavoring they sell at Walmart there's two in a pack they're considered a dram you used one DRAM per Sippi so you will need one of these in the flavor that you like punched in paper and a saucepan and that is it my friend that is it okay so this is what you do I'm gonna pick a rib first like always tell ya this channel is for eighteen and older you know this right cannabis and cannabis enthusiast and if you are not going my friend get the [ __ ] off my channel would you subscribe up there comment down there hit that Bell if you want to know how I'm gonna go why I put up any videos like this you never know what a girl's gonna put up you just don't know give me a flavor hit that thumbs up on your way up oh it takes a second if you love this recipe I thought about going back old school I was raised on a farm and we homesteaded and I remember Carol syrup water and sugar and flavoring and you had candy so when I brought you the recipe for the gelatin I thought it was gonna be a little bit easier and I've had a couple people that are having some problems with their butter floating on the top and I bet it's probably because the temperature is off one or two degrees now a couple things I want to tell you fYI when you're making candy have everything ready to go prepared ready to go eyeing your pan with parchment paper have your thermometer out your molds out sticks out your knife and everything okay so now what you're going to do is we're gonna take a rib you're gonna put down in the comments what you're ripping on and now I'm going to tell you how to make it choose that just makes everything perfect alright grab a medium-sized saucepan take it and put it on the stove on a medium heat and you're going to add 3/4 cup of your Karo syrup and your 1/2 cup of water you're going to let that dissolve until your Caro syrup is completely dissolved then you're going to add your 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar keep stirring it mixing it up once that's all dissolved stick your candy thermometer on the side of your pan make sure that the bottoms not touching your pan or you'll get it false reading have your parchment paper in your pan lined your mold ready to go and your knife ready to go sometimes when you score you want to keep a little cooking oil on hand so have that out as well and we're going to talk about that once you get your sugar and your corn syrup and all that's incorporating it's boiling really nicely you continue stirring that so your sugars don't burn until you reach about a 250 degrees when your candy thermometer at that point I stopped stirring and I just watched my boil I don't walk away from my candy and then tell my candy thermometer reads 310 and when it reaches 310 I'll remove it from the stove place it on my cookie sheet I'm going to add my 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid my one dram of watermelon my gel red food coloring a slight amount because I did watermelon candies I infused my candies and also used two tablespoons of gorilla glue tincture and 6 grams of teeth by no means do you need to any of that in your candies and you can have that as an option if you are adding cannabis or tinctures to your candies please do that after you've removed it off the stove incorporate it when you incorporate your citric acid your flavoring and your gel mix it up really well Labe pour it in your pan and just set it on your cookie sheet okay at this point now you're just going to watch your solution it's going to begin to cool and as it cools you want to come by and grease your knife or your vegetable cover and you're just going to take your product that you pick off the stove and that's in your pan and if you look at my Instagram you'll see how I scored it now we're just going to imagine that this is our candy for a second if you will grease your knife or your vegetable cutter and just score right here in the center I worked Center out and then I turned it and worked Center out and just kept turning that now just a couple points if your candy won't score it's probably because it's too hot if your knife is sticking to it it's probably because you don't have enough oil on it so come back and try it again if you score it and it didn't work your candy will just wine itself back out again just periodically go back and do it depending on where you live and the altitude of where you live is how long it'll take and it's generally around 8 to 10 sometimes 12 minutes and you'll be able to score it then just set it take it out of your pan set it on your cookie sheet because you're scoring it let it sit on your counter for an hour and you can come back and you can break them into pieces now I made suckers and I made Jolly Rancher candies wat kaminin and puts him in a pretty jar for me and I did six seconds and these are what the candies look like they're perfect and then I made up a little package of ten and I usually do like though giveaways and gifts and things like that with some suckers and some granola bars or whatever these are very perfect size they're just like the Jolly Ranchers they're amazing hard hard hard this will make about I'd say 35 to 45 pieces of candy depending on how big you cut your candy pieces up so if you have any questions let me know once your candy is all cooled and you've broken it up and you want to make some suckers I made square ones Walmart also has round ones like this what you do is take some of your broken pieces of candy mine are stuck because I'm videoing take and stick them in the molds and what I do is I really shove them down in the malls to well sometimes the mold looks deformed I turn my oven on at 275 I place this on a cookie sheet and I leave it in the oven for 15 to 17 minutes until the candy becomes a gel again then I take it out and I place my six in it a couple minutes after that to make sure they don't fall over and you think you've got candy now because I make these in blueberry in fire watermelon and an apple I sometimes have a lot of variety pieces left over and I take them and break them up in a baggie and I stick them in the mold so that my suckers come out all different kinds apple cherry strawberry so that's what I did with these so those end up being like that posh posh if you will medicated candies that I make sucker southern they're amazing I do apologize that people had issues with that recipe I did go back to the drawing board and I thought shizzle man homesteading sugar corn syrup and water and play-doh you got candy so star go back to homestead you're not good you guys are going to love them these you can store up to a year in your freezer on your counter for a good month or longer if they last that long these tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers this is a must citric acid and the reason is is because citric acid gives candy its pop gives it its flavor gives Jolly Ranchers they're their sharpness their sourness and if you don't use this you won't get that Jolly Rancher flavor so make sure you get your flavoring of yours whatever one you like watermelon out or whatever use a little bit of paste they have the typical colors for Jolly Ranchers and use your citric acid you can use as much as a teaspoon of this the more you use I've used it it's better just don't go over a teaspoon and your sticks check your thrift stores go over and then I don't know where they have all the paperwork and all the books and coloring books and things like that they always have craft step-over they're not even open yet you can find your sticks with my duties since they're pretty cheap these molds Walmart everything here you can get at Walmart I will leave a description at the recipe below under this video and the only thing that you'll need to purchase online is probably your citric acid because I couldn't find it in grocery store unless you have a candy store near you I hope you guys love the recipe again any questions please let me know yes someone asked me for a how to clean glass bomb so I'm gonna bring that to you as well I have not forgotten about that she's been really really busy with the holidays and everything coming up orders are coming in so if you guys want your

good like in the eyes I'm feeling happy and I can't say relaxed but this is there's a taste in there and I don't know what it is I don't know if it's supposed to be the horrible thing or if it's not but there's a hip and it's not the sweet thing and it's not the dirt it's there's a different taste in there I don't know what it is but at this point who cares as long as it's not you know hurting you but I don't think it would if anything like when I say harsh it's like um how do I describe it yeah there it is again maybe there's like a horrible maybe like backed up but it's like Oh what does that stuff called um you know when you're sick people put it in those steamer things that boil [ __ ] they're um I don't know what it's flippin called not like you know like how there's mint and there's like lavender and but it's not those it's something for when you're sick is it that you you've told whatever is cold you you Pullip dis or whatever maybe that or it's kind of like that maybe this would be good to smoke every note that's what I'm doing again it kind of clears out your sinuses I'm finding which would be good if you had allergies or you had a cold smoked some platinum cush small nugs yeah I can I can say that another great one from cannabis mom always always good [ __ ] always always good prices excellent you know customer service oh I like this I definitely without a doubt would buy this this again this is a little bit paranormal it's somebody putting recycling into somebody else's bed and it's and there's no wind he's looking around to see if anybody's watching in them and I'm looking around cuz get away from there cause I mean Charlie here here's Charlie [ __ ] sakes oh yeah like I could definitely see over here well there's some damn music I don't know where that's coming from smoke not much coughing with this but I think because I'm getting a freaking scared here um that something's tightening up and I have to call off now Oh like you know what you're probably thinking I'll just get up and walk I can't get up and walk cuz he's right there and he will see me and I'm not [ __ ] crawling like that would be ridiculous Charlie Oh eyes are so many people don't dick da he's still over there yeah maybe he's leaving now that's a relief I'm gonna see if he's coming back to put more in there's people everywhere damn it no I don't see him it's the first time that ever happened I'm just gonna go back this week that seems like the safest thing to do okay um we're gonna do a whole whole review of this smell it's strong and it's dirt and it's sweet the herbal not yet [Music] go hey need stronger smelling dirt it smells like dirt but so you can tell it's like really good weed oh my god this stuff is great okay so uh okay so you can taste like dirt I can smoke I don't think there's that much smoke but if you had the bag and you were like I didn't want anybody's know you had weed don't open that bag cuz they're gonna know right away I don't know who that is and yet you can still smell the the sweet in there - I found him just it was there's more like dirt okay and then we have next is the taste you do taste something sweet and you do taste something sweet and like the the dirt weed whatever and but then I thought not at first probably but like halfway through is that smell like I can still smell it now okay inhale like I breathe it out it's like going it's like you know something like some type of herb yoo-hoos for when you're sick because it's really cleaning out my sinuses charlie get away from there yeah so that's when the herb part came in for me halfway through the joint I feel really good I feel like this is good times this is um okay and okay so I'll keep going like that review um okay so I would give this and oh my font cuz this is good stuff just on the ratings above but then like an overall like if it was just there and you had to read it it's an oh my [ __ ] to me it is this is great well point yeah I get paranoid mmm but I'm just about done this joint so by that time the smoke by the time somebody gets here the smoke would hopefully be out of the air and not just kind of lurking around so but if it was like somebody came up the driveway right now then I'm gonna pretend that I had my air pods in and I just didn't sure you yeah this this is this is really great stuff I'm like thanks cannabis no this is good yeah I didn't think it maybe I should get like some of this somehow from there I don't want to go to the difference dispensary and like crap don't be you know why mmm like I'm okay I'm not even gonna go into that kind of stuff anyways yeah you've got to get your they don't have to you but if you want good [ __ ] and never have to worry about if the weeds gonna be really that good or stuff like that it's can abysmal that's the place to go I need to do something and I don't know what that is yet so um I'm cush small nugs get it at can abysmal it's an oh my [ __ ] rating for me like I said though I have to I feel like doing something I don't what it is I'm gonna have to sit down and I'm gonna have to like regroup my thoughts I guess and I'm getting more paranoid now so that's it that's all by", "5hC8o2eXnz0": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds [ __ ] line [Music] are you here to visit yeah I'll get out of the way and I'll grandma take your belt off you there hey show us what

getting ready to do a review well she is I'll show you guys what she's gonna beat this one here it comes in a blue J bar a crispy vegan protein and hopefully you can read that it says 40 milligrams of THC and I'm guessing that's the company that makes it baked edibles Inc there yeah I guess that's all the information there is I'm not gonna read you guys all this stuff on the back air I will hold it up for ya if you wanna pause your screen go ahead and plug your screen and read it if you don't well then you don't I don't even know if this shit's even coming in for you guys hopefully it is anyway enough talk are not [ __ ] Hey Oh [ __ ] and bang my [ __ ] knee again oh that one's gonna bruise real good anyway go ahead eat it it's just bumping it's [ __ ] thumpin that was smell in there hang on I'm gonna bring the camera over and you can show them what it looks like are you gonna eat the whole 40 milligrams might as well but as well I'm not really into this vegan [ __ ] so well you know anyway that's what it looks like I hope you guys got a good look okay darlin I found it back yeah so while she's eating that thing I think I mentioned a it's 40 milligrams of THC the big old 40 anyway while she's eating that I'm going to show you guys the stuff that I grabbed while we were shopping around at the candy store no I'm not really the candy store Walmart and yes I wore the GoPro and I'd show you guys the footage but this is an edible review video and Walmart was boring as [ __ ] tonight well what does Dollar Tree - and at the Dollar Tree they got these back I bought two packs but I haven't had in a while so I already ate one and it tasted as good as [ __ ] when we're at Walmart as you noticed up on the wall right here I got a little dinky car collection is that would you call them dinky cars hey do they call that do they call them that anymore well I don't know that's what they used to be called Hot Wheels well anyway we found this one here at the Walmart for a buck and a quarter The Dark Knight Batmobile so we'll be sticking that up there I see Donna jerking around over there does it taste bad er yeah well hey you got to eat it this is a review video no wasting hey there's no wasting and then we got some of these here that we're gonna try out today some exit yeah Mexican Jalapa no M&Ms actually they're Mexican jalapa no peanut M&Ms hopefully you guys can read that my camera's been stoned as [ __ ] lately hey so it gets blurry once in a while so yeah anyway back to the review video here back to what she's doing let me open up these Jalapa no M&Ms I can only smell chocolate in the bag you think that you can smell some of the Jalapa no but you can't probably noticing anything you struggling what's a pop come on they want to see you eat the whole thing to know that you got it into you okay don't taste like it the overall even if it didn't have THC in it and somebody gave you this oh it's doing shivers up my spine all know when you're all high as [ __ ] later you'll be happier these taste like regular peanut M&Ms except for they leave a little bit of a spicy taste in your throat but they're not too bad you probably use a little bit more Jalapa no yeah I'm not if there's any vegans that watch you whatever but definitely not for me you big uns must have a teeth a tasty [ __ ] nothing [ __ ] it all up I [ __ ] up what I was gonna say I was gonna say you vegans must have [ __ ] up tastebuds according to Donna oh I don't know I don't eat vegan food it looks a little [ __ ] I mean it looks okay but then you can't win it looks like it's made out of [ __ ] that you know stuff that'll make you [ __ ] hey we're still smoking the dirty old timid Street weed I had to buy a teeny bit more today tomorrow we're gonna do a review video of either tuna cush or night nurse that's night nurse not night nurse we got a box here from buy my weed online that's Charlie growling if anybody's wondering if we got a box here from buy my weed online no we're not going to open it today we're gonna open it tomorrow morning when they get up and we're gonna do it unboxing of this and at the same time we're gonna do a wake and bake and we're gonna do a review of one of these [ __ ] strains in here and yeah that's Toros video the video after this video so if you want to see that hit the subscribe button and stick around for the next video I do the review for you guys today but you guys know the rules on my channel you got a week and baked with a new strain you know what I mean you can't just smoke some dirty old [ __ ] weed and then start smoking something else and be able to give a [ __ ] a good review you know an honest opinion of how good that strain is you got a [ __ ] you know you're done yeah so yeah once again those 40 milligrams I hope you guys can see it if not [ __ ] go back to the beginning and [ __ ] read it again 40 milligrams of THC [ __ ] we're gonna wait for Donna to get all loopy and we'll be back but first I'm gonna do this bomb talk here because I need to do a [ __ ] bomb toke was there anything you season news today that I don't know because well you can take a quick look if there is there is if there's not does not it's been kind of quiet for like the last three days because I cannot watch yeah I can't do boy that's it's hard to watch Haley and surf the Internet at the same time she's quick she's all over the place you got to stay with her that's the name no rocks missing I didn't see nothing earlier either anyway I'm gonna fill my bowl back up we're gonna wait for Donna to get all loopy and we'll come back with her review of the blue jay bar my review so far on the taste don't don't buy it because you think it's good cuz it's oh she says don't buy it because of the taste like if you thinking but that's only because she doesn't like the vegan stuff if you're vegan that might be for you you go over to can abismo and get yourself a couple you know I think I showed you guys the back egg all you vegans out there might want to see the that this and that's there I don't know if it's gonna come in though hang on give me a second give me a second here there so pause your screen and you can read all the health [ __ ] on there or whatever your nutrition facts and yeah and yeah pause your screen and read that and maybe it's for you hey we should also note that when Donna eats these edibles here she usually gets the really tasty flavored waters like chocolate flavored and vanilla flavored and mint flavored so to get this vegan one here is gonna be quite the difference in taste so keep that mind just saying anyway I'm going to fill up my balls we're going to wait for that ship to kick in and we'll be back with Donna's review or opinion or whatever you got whatever you want to call it you feel it yet a little bit Donna might look a little different because she took a shower well you're wearing different clothes a few seconds ago in our body it sound like I was playing in the mud that didn't make it sound like you're playing in the mud but okay if that's the way you feel are you feeling the did you answer yes and would you say cuz I didn't hear it a little bit she's feeling it a little bit you guys might have noticed an echo in here it's getting worse and worse for the last couple weeks that's because a few months back well maybe almost a year ago Timmins housing sent me a letter saying they were gonna well they offered me some different places how'd that work they gave me a list of [ __ ] places I had to pick three of them that I would like to move to if I was to move because the place I'm in now this place here has too many bedrooms and I don't need that many bedrooms so then we're going to give me another place and throughout the last year or so we've been slowly putting things in the boxes and that's why you notice some stuff here is like bare like some of the stuff that used to be here is not here anymore and my bookshelf that used to be here is gone and my books and all that and some pictures and whatever anyway whatever who cares anyway a lot of my stuff's in boxes right now cuz apparently I'm supposed to got a new place to live in but I don't know what the [ __ ] that's gonna happen if anybody gives a [ __ ] but that's what the echos from would you eat one of these Donna's eating one of these Jalapa no peanut M&Ms it says Mexican Jew Mexican Jalapa dole if that it was any different than normal July but you know like that you're just the worse so it's not fully kicked in yet though it's 40 milligrams you're used to taking 30 did you feel 40 also I wanted to mention over on my Twitter there's a billion different marijuana dispensaries sending me messages asking me about their [ __ ] this and that whatever and I'll get tired of telling everybody if you want me to review your product my [ __ ] address is in the description below send it to me I'll make a video review your product and tell you what I [ __ ] think it's easy stuff a trained dog can do it hey so yeah stop sending me stupid messages and just [ __ ] send me your product then I'll [ __ ] smoke it and tell you what I think and I think that's all I have to say now we're waiting for your review of the [ __ ] vegan bar vegan Bluejays thingamabob the taste is we already heard that you didn't like the taste maybe people are skipping through that part now whatever okay I'm gonna do a bomb dope glad Donna oh forgot my ball earlier oh well okay so oh yeah just it tastes horrible and even when you're done it and it's been a long time the taste is still I don't even want to know what the taste what tasted okay although than the taste everything's going okay everything's going the plan hey Donna yeah I just can't get rid of the taste and it's not like HC taste or yeah I can help you get rid of the taste miss Vicki - laughs little chips don't get rid of the vegan taste in your mouth carpet what the [ __ ] is Hardy carpet not so much you'll enjoy the weekend I will or they will I will why cuz it's supposed to be oh I thought you were saying everybody was gonna enjoy the weekend I was trying to figure out how anyway as I was saying earlier the Edible that she's eaten today it comes from can abismo that's Charlie snoring under the table if you guys are wondering they move this over to the board fucksakes can abismo dot CA you can go there to get yourself some edibles some really good weeds some shades and also uh clothes and hats and all kinds of [ __ ] mostly stuff to get nice and [ __ ] up with a you get nice and stoned if you go there and buy your stuff there they got really good weeds and I thought the batmobile hanging up there now as you guys could see I don't know why I hung it up for I probably should just throw it in the [ __ ] box a pack and stuff up anyways [ __ ] but you gotta remember this is Timmins hosing it's already been a year since they said they were gonna give me another place so I'm gonna be here another year just living my stuff in boxes who knows at least nobody will be able to steal my stuff all my good stuff would be buried and I put all the heavy boxes on top so nobody wants to steal books hey nobody wants to learn any more so my books would be safe we got some chocolate chip cookies from the Walmart they're pretty good but they're kind of tough yes I was baked in store mm-hmm baked in storm that somebody leave them out on the counter overnight these aren't like soft you know what I mean the air got to them somebody forgot about the cookies it's Walmart it probably wasn't really baked in the store it was probably baked into us in it he was probably baked in store somewhere [ __ ] else and then shipped here well wherever that is they left them out too long hmm you don't enjoy cookies like that do ya no I don't home mm-hmm what you gonna eat it anyways well you're not supposed to waste anyways I'm gonna fill my ball back up but I'm getting the munchies I'm gonna make a [ __ ] uh a ham and cheese sandwich and for both yeah I was kind of hoping you were gonna make mine and then you could make one for both how about that anyway I'm gonna fill this up and maybe maybe that'll kick in a little harder and we'll see what happens mm hmm what you don't break a tooth on your hard cookie Donna made me a ham and cheese sandwich and if it wasn't for the mustard I don't think I'd be able to get it down why you so cheap with the cheese and [ __ ] ham I put two slices that's very that is thin meat it's so thin you can almost see through it you put two slices like a still with two slices together I could still [ __ ] see through it and the cheese doesn't even cover all the bread yeah but then you'd have overlapping I like it overlapping so much bread here she's got leftover taco salad if anybody's wondering what the hell are you laughing at the animals kicking in look you have mustard seed yeah I got a mustard sandwich that's what seems like the taco salad that she's eating she

review and this stuff is the fat Panda or hot sugar Panda candy green apple powered by you fuse and every other brand that they like to throw in there so this is what it looks like this is just a one single serving ten milligram candy kind of like a it's supposed to be a soft chew so I'm gonna go ahead and open it like I said single piece I didn't you know just a single package I didn't get like they're ten pack that they have but there we go I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this is what it looks like once you open it just a weird little looks like a little turd kind of so look at me getting all smart using scissors now so that's what it looks like it feels exactly like if you if you've ever been a child airheads that's exactly what this feels like it's got that same consistency whoo it's got that same smell like I said this is green apples so I'm just gonna shove this whole thing in my mouth and enjoy it oh my god so as far as the flavor goes you guys are gonna hear me too it's fun all right so the flavor is actually really good I have it on the top of my room I like my mouth right now I've gone so the flavor is amazing I'm gonna have the other one right here in a second this was just a 10 milligram candy and yeah I'm gonna see how this reacts and I'll be back with you guys in a couple days to let your w tomorrow and I'll let you know exactly how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried those watermelon candies as you guys know that obviously I ate it in the video so about an hour and a half to two hours later completely spaced the fact that I'd had an edible hadn't smoked yet and was sitting on the couch and I look over to my girlfriend I was like babe why do I feel so hot she looked at me and just started laughing and she was like oh yeah the watermelon candy you duh so yeah this thing even for just having had the 110 milligram candy it was enough to like send me into that edible hi I felt it I got tired I got a little bit of like the haziness and this was all by 5 o'clock so if if you're new to edibles this would be a great one because it's gonna give you like just enough of that like effect that you're gonna feel it and get you know the base knowledge of how it in edibles going to like a react in your body so all around I would and if you're more of like I guess a more seasoned user you can take 2 to 3 and have a great night either way these are awesome so with that I think that's it this has been recreational 4/20 if you guys have any questions or anything leave it down in the comment section if you like these videos go ahead and hit that sub button trying to get to a hundred before the end of this month and I'll be back again with you guys soon [Music]", "XOb3mh5eq1A": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds [ __ ]

whatever in the egg right the other stuff I don't know there's ketchup on it Heinz there's no other kinds hey [ __ ] sakes oh my [ __ ] that's a tasty [ __ ] sandwich but all my [ __ ] ever RA [Music] anyway I told you guys yesterday that if it got that can of bhisma box I would do a review of the Duster yeah it does start today but here's why I'm not the box was supposed to be here this morning and Canada Post always [ __ ] around with my mail so I had to go buy some more dirty old Tim and Street lead and me and Donna have been smoking that all [ __ ] day and if I was to do a review of the other stuff what's called in that star I wouldn't be able to give you guys a good review because well you know I've already been smoking the other [ __ ] so I'm gonna wake and bake tomorrow like always and do a review of the Death Star Donna won't be here so there'll be a second video after that of Donna's review of the Death Star because she reviews the same stuff as me so there'd be two reviews one from me and one from her but that'll be tomorrow and don't get mad at me get my [ __ ] Canada Post here in Timmins Ontario they're [ __ ] I didn't want to have to smoke this dirty old Tim and street weed but I wasn't sure if my package was gonna [ __ ] be here the lady at the post office was acting like a [ __ ] Donna had to go down there and straighten her out to get my box here Donna tell him oh hang on you're kind of short I got adjusted a little for you there you go so I went there to Canada Post finish I showed the lady the Apple like the what's it called the tracking no the tracking number so I had the tracking number up and I give her the phone like this so word set so she's looking at this part up here anyways where it says delivery today so anyway she puts it in she says to me well when is this supposed to be delivered even and I said today and she then she tells me that it's on one of the delivery trucks and I questioned it saying shouldn't it say upbeat like shouldn't say out for delivery and she says oh no no our letter carriers work till six I was like it's a package yeah but the delivery guys worked till eight I said even though it just says that it's just processed here in Timmins oh yeah sometimes they don't go and switch that until right before they hit your door she sounds like come that's a lie because they scan the packages as you know when the Canada Post play it was a scanner right before they come so then I had to call back and actually speak to a supervisor I bought this package and you know what it wasn't on the truck it was braiding their damn office so I had to go back to Canada pose for a second time to get a package that was supposed to be delivered this morning and add your story that's my story right on those napkins over there um I wasn't really listening cuz I eat my sandwich but hopefully that made sense to you guys if not Donna's on the weeds so sometimes her stories are a little [ __ ] but it might have made sense like I said I wasn't listening I was eating my sandwich here the Bacon's good I really like the bacon hey there's my favorite part of the sandwich [Music] hey sure how do you know she said it a better look Houston okay I did okay we didn't know what to do today because it's been a shitty day and we have shitty weed so we figured let's do a review on the shitty weed on the shitty old dirty old way call again ya dirty old dirty old [ __ ] Tim extremely [ __ ] sakes anyway we've been smoking it all day long as you can tell daughter's already [ __ ] up no no no she's not flopped up did you join up everyone whatever you feel like it get it going anyway we've been smoking it all day actually we've been smoking it all [ __ ] week because of Canada [ __ ] post and I give it a [ __ ] two and a half out of five it gives you half of us hey so you give it half the rating I guess I give it a two and a half out of five it does the trick if you're hurting I don't know what you think that's what I think tell them what you think Hey like the rest is there where they called oh yeah Hawk and animal remember don't walk anyway I don't know why the [ __ ] I'm saying that but you have to like smoke this well we have been smoked I know it but if somebody just were together like do a bomb I'm not even a bomb let's say they got a grandma for somebody my suggestion is smoke both [ __ ] thing if you needed to go to sleep or something then you do like your three big bones right before and then maybe with a sleeping pill sleeping pills you fall asleep just like your regular Buffalo this a little bit bang you're into the [ __ ] wall man knock yourself out melon tastes like dirt it doesn't taste like third so what does that mean if it doesn't taste in there yeah if you don't taste there there's no [ __ ] good no all the rest of them not their stuff but like from cannabis melon stuff there's taste like dirt yeah you tell these from the ground so she means the good stuff tastes like dirt the bad stuff don't taste like dirt thank you what is the bad stuff tastes like it's not tasting like dirt nothing just tastes like the smell is there but it's like they squirted something on on the weed to make it smell like that like if there was a week to it it's pretty they squirted weed spray on it to make it smell like weed it's not real weed because it's printed with weed spray [Music] like that like it's like let's put it this way you know when you're walking down the road and you could smell weed in there okay sure yeah yeah like sometimes I'll be walking somewhere now smell like weed in there yeah you mean like if somebody's smoking in the neighborhood mm-hm okay well you said Sweden they're like you know yours you're walking place fields or something no somebody who smells naturally like weed in the air around here what are you saying if somebody was when you're walking and say if somebody was up the road whatever smoking a joint or something or a bomb outside or something mm-hmm you could just tell from the smell that's cheap because you don't like the good stuff stays there for a long time in the air no matter what it just stays like it sticks this stuff here of just kind of like it's there and then it's like gone you don't I don't feel paranoid on it if that helps everybody helps everybody yeah um like if you were coming to Timmins - because you have family and friends here or something smell the into the city yeah what smuggling is the button to the city weed from like tea if say if you already have to smoke with because if you came here and you were looking for some cuz you forgot at home tomorrow you're looking for some for a good time nope I don't think you have to smuggle it yeah you just bring it with you you mean we're in Canada you don't gotta smoke weed if it's from like an illegal place what illegal please you don't want to get put it in another bag you dump another one bag into another bag you lost me you don't want too many things at one time and then you're like I was telling the story quickly how I remember I told you I was gonna get a coffee before her coming here but then something happened oh what the when you hadn't picked up the package yeah okay told your story no no that's okay okay I grabbed the package from Canada Post and then I just tossed it in the backseat and on the way back I was gonna get a coffee but it was like as soon as I loved them there was like a cop here and I Drive up and in another cops I got a little bit worried about it because it should have been in the trunk Hey the cops aren't gonna open up your mail Donna won't think it's a what's in the package and you could have said shoes my [ __ ] mails in the package officer [ __ ] off and tip of my dick anyway hang on let's try this thing out [ __ ] thing we're here we got a what do you call it an Oreo donut an Oreo donut from the Tim Hortons cut that up dog let's have a look on the inside what you don't cut your thumb off this is just the PC move I don't care about nice this is just a PC night we're worried about the donut nothing nice and that's what it looks like on the inside what the [ __ ] is is called and were you donut Oh Oreo donut that's what it looks like on the inside hope you had a good look okay they put this thing back and I think it was there I hope it was there and I'm gonna try out some of this donut [Music] that's a good [ __ ] door it doesn't taste like Wario at all I think yeah I think those are little pieces of Oreo on top but the donuts so sweet you can't taste the [ __ ] cookie on top anyway I give this oh my [ __ ] out of 10 tell anybody they understand well you know what you'll try yours yeah what's the white [ __ ] like is it a cream isn't looks like Oh looks like somebody had fun with your doughnut [Music] okay it's not okay donut if you just need something sweet if you're looking for the Oreo taste it's not in that donut at all I don't even think these things up here Oreo I think it's just [ __ ] broken artificial earth so probably not real I don't think so cuz you can't taste it and this stuff in the middle that's like sweet it's kinda like a like a marshmallow texture I don't know but if you need something sweet go right ahead if you're thinking that it's gonna taste like an Oreo I don't know what's wrong with jim mertens that's our donut that's our donut thing okay so back to the weed people want to know more about the weed it's not donut breaks or it's not great yeah it's not the best weed in the world like if somebody says it's not the best weed many new rules no honestly if people sell it say for ten ten bucks a gram that's what it goes for unless you buy a billion [ __ ] grams okay well if you want a billion grams then you get a better deal but you don't really want to spend too much money on this [ __ ] when there's better weeds out there they should be treasuring five five bucks a gram yeah this is like this is like [ __ ] if you had it you couldn't give it away this is the shitty old moldy hay this is the [ __ ] nobody wants all the teenagers are selling it down at the mall this is horrible yeah tomorrow morning I'm gonna wake and bake with the Death Star she won't be here so tomorrow evening she'll do her review of the Death Star so we'll have to refuse the Death Star one for me one

than one batch if that's all you have you guys gotta see what she's doing here I gave her an old pumpkin for an ashtray and she's flicking the ashes in her own pop and while she's sitting you're talking I don't know if you see it down there she's missing it she's just flicking them past the can now like an alcoholic would exactly like an alcoholic [ __ ] sakes she's acting like a dirty old alcoholic no I didn't even know you didn't know about what no I watched you flip it well anyway um I guess that's all you got anything else you gotta say is there anything at all that you want to say

effects it says happy relaxed I think all India in because you know we keep it like that wonder if I can show there I get my little thingamajig in there and then we're just gonna take this put it into there oh my lord it's what it's supposed to be like 32 today I think God is Sunday I don't have to other than like maybe a load or two of watch I have to do it's nothing it's going to be a lazy Sunday

definitely taste the sweet right away it's kind of like um it seems kind of familiar you know like how um the smell of a cigar that first um that's on somebody's breath either but like that first smell it it's kind of like diet that's what I'm I'm finding yeah I'm not tasting the vanilla though with a sweet yeah the dirt the earth yes maybe it's supposed to smell like that I brought my coffee out I don't find it too harsh of a of a smoked butterfly I think if you were to do this like inside like dries it sucks everything out of your throat put my coffee down hmm there's somebody there just stay down here just hide here I can't even get up and make it to the because where they're parked don't think you'd see big puffs of [ __ ] smoke Jesus paranoid yes I don't want to move [ __ ] and I'm here here's a you I'm sure they can smell it it's hot out I think they're going [ __ ] good-looking [ __ ] I gotta get to the backyard okay this stuff is good anyway should I never worth hits right - orange shorts today gee I just need to you're smoking this or they'll call us a causing coughing okay they're leaving the trucks pulling away there's somebody else outside across the street not a good [ __ ] Sunday usually people go and do [ __ ] on Sundays [ __ ] this is good I like it it kind of takes a little bit to UM kick in like a creeper I guess but it's it's like a except okay it's kind of dry and but it's still like it's not like a a harsh it's not a harsh smoke just about done it now I think I start puffing faster on it when there's people were outside these are like one of the joints I find that not the choice one of the things I find striking science but like for me maybe has a hole like getting paranoid yeah thing happened but um um it's like one of those strains that you kind of maybe should have left to do in the early evening or something that's my but after you after your heart beat goes down that's okay so okay the smell was the dirt and the like I want to say you can maybe smell a sweet in there but like not a vanilla sweet after was grinded up the same thing and there was not really a difference smoking it I I would say if you smoked it in the house it would it would be smoky the taste it reminds me of you could taste like the dirt and you can taste like a little sweet and you can taste like something spicy but like it reminds me of I guess I'd be kind of like the smell in like maybe the taste but like it's when somebody has a cigar and that smell of it not after the person smoked the whole thing ee they're like getting this on their breath and it's disgusting but the smell of a cigar that's like what was like that reminded me of the taste I guess the feeling a parent [ __ ] nothing's in my hair paranoia I could say happy I'm not really feeling the relaxed part right now [Music] that right there I'm gonna say this is uh I'm gonna give this I don't know what I'm gonna give this because it's I'm gonna give it it's just it's in the decent but it's like radom free it's right up there it's like right right there yeah I yeah it's not I know my thought but it's just about a know my FAC yeah and there's that's the overall - it's a it's in the

weed you may hear the wind a bit it's windy and it's warm this is the stuff like I don't know in some of my videos I don't know which ones I say like you just feel like going outside and sitting and thinking or sitting under a tree well I am actually sitting under the tree and it feels good this is like the stuff that you would want to do that on I do want to sew wedding cake get it at can abismo it's good [ __ ] I need to do something here like that I guess wedding cake brought to you by can abysmal I thought that would be pretty neat to do I know it's uh that's a fam it's hot but I thought it would be so that's my that's my review of wedding cake so that's it that's all bye", "_SaIRQUR3Yc": "sorry about that I have to do a two part video cuz I had too much damn storage or not enough storage or my [ __ ] phone and had a [ __ ] start to be over so like I said I'm gonna have an hour in and I'm not doing nothing yet so I'm just sitting around watching new episodes with the ranch wait for it to kick in up and I'm one of my many many baits so it's crazy to think that I still got this on [ __ ] there's snow of zero and a hundred squad up I have this one della quit so this is my very first long box I love it it's just nice got some heft to it but still you know I mean feels good in the hand I got the hops I do but uh that's gonna be gone probably Monday or Tuesday and they're selling that so really say just you know I'm trying to do this little review on these [ __ ] dummies thirty minutes and nothing so I'll give it another 30 minutes and then come back and go from there so I guess I'll see you guys in another 30 all right well I'm an hour a little over an hour in I got caught up in the ranch and forgot so uh they're starting to kick in kind of feel like a little a little bit of a buzz like you know like like if we were to smoke some weed that wasn't that strong you know like some rags or something that little buzz you get I feel pretty good I mean you know lost watching the show so have you still just doing something using my dead rabbit now just started doing the coil builds so I'm starting to make my way in the baby worried and just do the [ __ ] next profile you know [ __ ] anymore I'm actually building my own [ __ ] RTA's and RD is so yeah like I said I feel a little bit of a buzz probably I wait another half hour again one more time and then come back and tell you guys how it is I would definitely recommend these you know I mean I took a half I feel pretty good and I only paid $20 for five of them so if that's the way he doesn't want you to catch a buzz 10 [ __ ] times 4:20 there's deals maybe one of those [ __ ] boots great so I keep saying all right well I'll see you guys in another half hour all right see you guys a half hour all right so it's been on another long prob about 45 minutes this time my mustache looks a little weird I was trying to shave it because it was too damn long and the [ __ ] Clippers quit halfway through so so I would definitely recommend this I feel great I feel really good I feel relaxed anxiety is just gone there pretty good buzz good watching the ranch [ __ ] he's enjoying it you know I mean me personally I prefer to eat edibles over like smoking because when you eat the edibles you feel the buzz coming you feel you're high coming and when you smoke just it's like boom you're [ __ ] stoned and that's what makes me paranoid that's where I get paranoid which is just like one minute you're fine the next minute earlier so I get to feel it coming it comes on you slow you know just you know I'm trying to say so yeah I prefer I prefer the animals so when I was down in Kentucky I was able to get them a few times there's somebody there that made them and sold them and they were pretty decent so yeah I'd give these [ __ ] and say eight out of ten you know cuz I mean yeah anyways uh so yeah I would definitely recommend them they're called stoner patch dummies 350 milligrams you get five if you if you get a high tolerance you have you probably eat the whole thing but if you're like me you don't really smoke weed or anything you know I'd go with half start out with half after a couple hours you're feeling it you know take the other half then go ahead but you know you know just rushing eating a full one so yeah this is my smock morph smoke smoke whatever I call it smart cuz it I've got a [ __ ] he at the end every time I watch the videos it like that [ __ ] Jay Hayes and [ __ ] his name is the guy's a douchebag he's always calling smoke it's SM okay so I call it schmuck

the middle sticking up the middle is [ __ ] up the airflow so I took him apart night cut that off as pair of wire snips you know it was a little better but I don't know what they use in that cotton but those coil sucked and they were huge so I got reading about it I found out they were you know compatible with like VA smocks coils and paper SOG t-coils I went down this big shop there and st. Louis while I was there picked up a smock cuz I don't know why around there they don't carry [ __ ] and they carry like you force clothes and smock coils and that's it I mean they're way behind I mean [ __ ] I asked for a valerian coil and they're like oh you have to order that I was in [ __ ] South Roxanna like down the road Wood River I go in there and [ __ ] buy whatever hello Cindy Coyle I asked for they had I mean they had this big old [ __ ] what do you call it toolbox like you know the one a wall tool boxes filled with jizz chorus and then over in Bethalto about 10 miles down the road it's the same thing you know when I hit my NRG panco that I was using I'd uh I get the deep faith coil Center you compare with the Cerberus and but uh they didn't have [ __ ] so I [ __ ]", "mZPUMQ0So_g": "okay we have one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a fourth a cup of water we're just going to stir stir stir over medium heat i do medium because i don't want my sugar to burn so and i'm not using can of sugar in this one um i'm just showing you so and you're only going to stir until it starts to boil and it is starting to boil so now we're going to insert our candy thermometer and you're going to insert it and you're going to let it boil and do not stir until your candy thermometer reaches 305 degrees do not stir at all and then remember we want it to get to 305 degrees okay we are at 305 degrees so we are going to remove it from the heat and let the temperature drop back down to 280 degrees all right our temperature has dropped back down to 280 so now we're going to add in well i'm adding in distillate i'm also adding in tincture we're going to stir we're gonna add in our candy flavoring um it's one to two teaspoons of candy flavoring i eyeball it gonna add our food coloring [Music] i'm using americana red because i'm doing a fruit punch candy and the recipe is the same for hard candies than it is for suckers same recipe and then you immediately pour into your moles um you have to pour fast because it gets hard fast and then you just let it set out at room temperature until it gets hard um it takes about 30 to 45 minutes um humidity and the temperature in your house they play a big part in how your candy's set up okay they have been cooling for about 45 minutes now we're gonna pop them out this is just the batch i'm doing for me so i'm okay to touch it with my hands lego man i recommend using silicone molds because it is easier to get them out of and like if there's excess you can just break it off do little hard candies you", "cPh0vMY1Hn4": "yo guys what is going on it's your boy we're back with another video but today's video is a little bit different it's a little bit of a special video because as you see by the title and stuff we got our first little box here care package if you will um so this is gonna be probably a quick video but I reached out to a few companies she liked messing around saying hey I have this YouTube channel just curious you always want to sponsor me or send a little package or whatever yeah yeah I got it it's the first company that actually got back to me like real like real talk they they're a local Brown here in Arizona called sublime they mostly make edibles all of its edibles so I ended up messaging them on Instagram and then they're like sure email this lady named Rebecca if Rebecca if you're watching this you're awesome thank you very much same with um Brad I think his name was he was really chill you're like hey we have a package for you I couldn't pick it up for certain reasons the first day but they held it over the week and I was able to pick it up today so I'm very excited um here on the box my name and then the stone dumpling on there so yeah let's uh let's go ahead and pop this open of not good at box openings here schools there's not a lot in here there's a couple boxes and stuff so let me go ahead and pull them out one by one for you we'll save the good stuff for last so the first one the first thing we have here is a single caramel -

Today I\u2019m back with 2 quick new recipes\nbased on the very nice sweet and sour flavor profile of green apple. I usually only make one recipe for each time\nbut I happened to have both flavors on hand this time so hopefully this will reduce the\nquestions of other flavor substitutions. The flavors we will be using today are the\ncapella and flavor west green apple. Both have a very similar approach to the flavor,\nwith flavor west going for the more candy like profile and capella trying to recreate\na neutral but fresh tasting green apple. If you also have both you could mix them with\neach other to get a perfect balance from each ingredient. But today I made a recipe for each one individually\nand tried to help each flavor on different areas as you will see. Also a quick side note, To the following 2\nrecipes you could also add 1% of flavor art pear additionally of the flavors included\nto make them taste slightly more realistic and more naturally sweet tasting. So without saying anything more here is the\ncapella version. It is using the green apple flavor at 5.5%\nwhich is high enough to get the taste to the eliquid. You could try and I have also in the past\nuse it around 7.5% but it will start tasting a litte too artificial that high. And for flavor support this recipe is using\nfuji apple at 1% for extra freshness and 0.5% of ethyl Maltol or cotton candy to introduce\na mellow sweetness to balance out the sourness of the green apple. This is a different type of sweetness and\nmore candy like than the sucralose if you are wondering why I\u2019m using 2 different\nsweeteners. This is a nice and light vaping recipe with\na lot of flavor and fruity vape smell. Next I will go quickly over the flavor west\nrecipe. Here the green apple is used at a similar\nstrength at 6%. The issue with the flavor west version is\nthat it doesn\u2019t have as much of a fresh taste as you would expect from an apple concentrate\nso the very good and realistic double apple from flavorwest will work here very nicely. You could use even capellas double apple or\nfuji but at a smaller ratio. In the end there is also again some ethyl\nMaltol and a little more sucralose than before to make all the apple flavors taste a little\nmore mild. This recipe is as you can see closer to a\ncandy green apple or a jolly rancher. Now like I mentioned earlier, If you end up\nalso adding some flavor art pear in any of the recipes, then you could bypass adding\nthe Ethyl Maltol. For steeping they will usually be ready to\nvape within 24-48 hours and it is recommended to keep the nicotine at 6mg or lower since\nit will actually start affecting here the taste. As a summary, these are both good eliquids\nand if you have the ingredients on hand they will be very quick and easy to make with a\ngood and full flavor while vaping. If you have your own green apple recipe too\neither using these flavors or a different one feel free to leave together with any of\nyour thoughts in the comments. Happy to see you here again and I will be\nback soon with a new video.", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did leave a comment below give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching i hope you have a wonderful day", "Y8dhF8XPCDs": "oh wait oh i think i have the wrong lens covered up hold on oh and is it this one is it further down there we go oh you know what we'll just put it up here this looks better all right we know what we're doing we're getting

next batch coffee oh coffee traffic flavor all right someone said new wi-fi yeah it is how would you know oh well because we uh we mentioned it in a recent video oh okay that's a dead giveaway man

or too it was like down to like 307 point whatever and i looked away for two seconds look back over nine and a half you know someone wants to know if we've seen the new borah no yeah yeah i said it is it good yeah it's pretty good compared to the original what did you think is it as good or uh i mean you kind of know what to expect going in you can see in the original but uh it held up nicely yeah i like it good stuff um yeah i feel like the whole thing with the first one was uh not knowing if it was real or not and still there's still an element of that in it people like did they talk to a bunch of people who maybe hadn't seen the first one yeah it seemed like they were talking to people that didn't know what was going on i have a whole lot more shots to put in here so i'm going to put it in players i think it's it's 13.3 you're saying right you guys could probably measure this by the cup then yeah no we definitely could except i'm not entirely convinced that this is only one ounce uh dylan could you go grab another microphone another shotgun microphone right you got it i got my minion on it because he was saying that the uh the wi-fi um it's kind of giving like a weird static sound every now and then which is great that i can have somebody in the building who'd let me know about the weird sounds yeah someone's just saying they hear static so we're gonna get that fixed we're gonna grab a different microphone that does not have static it doesn't pick up static ah that's getting real high yes it is so we got our first step super chat from christine ponton love you guys hey max heart heart uh all right so we're gonna put this down for a second and i'm going to put on a different microphone so you guys will you know i'll be back in just a second with the audio okay so that should fix the audio issues uh it looks like we got another super chat i've got a couple of other super chats um scott eisemann says where's helga well there's your answer and then we got a super chat from somebody else here comes before thank you everyone for the super chats this smells like a cup of coffee strong yeah i'm telling you we have any uh questions over there dylan i know you're right now people are just shouting out where they're from where they're from someone just like keep up the good work that's some good advice they've been watching for a while yeah someone's asking about making tropical candy well we do have a tropical candy uh box of uh assorted chocolates tropical treasures and i think we still have i don't wanna lie here but i think we might still have

stream not a where are the 4k live streams yeah no usually i mean often we will use uh my actual camera for my live streams um but this is much more portable so in between batches since i'm on my phone then i can actually go to other parts of the building instead of being stuck on a cord and then i am pretty limited um yeah that's a tough one i mean we've thought about doing like novelties i guess the pb j is probably the craziest yeah i keep pushing for like i want to do like hot dog flavor or something like cream corn fillings yeah but we're not quite there yet yeah could do some mystery flavors let people guess uh kirsty sent a five pound super superchat thank you hello from uk after a long week at work this is just what i needed stay safe guys you're all incredible oh nice

super chats because well there's 1.4 000 of you guys watching right now and as you can probably see the the live stream or whatever is uh it's going pretty quick with the chats so if you have something that you definitely 100 want to get answered sending a super chat is the best way to do it because there's so many people commenting that's hard for me to read them all obviously uh it's

some help especially if i have to if i have to chop a candy open so you can see the cross section like for the website then i was like all right max and candy and they they always cry and cry when i get home drivers friends and friends delivery drivers love coming here yeah no kidding let's try to get all our thanks and have a great day i would probably get the chips that's like our staple chocolate covered chicken yeah you know when you first hear about chocolate chips it always sounds a little funky but like here so good do you have any uh chocolate covered peanut butter left there oh yeah chocolate covered pecan brittle i actually hate my favorite so and then there's i mean you really can't go wrong with the uh assorted chocolates yeah and then also in my opinion the fruit and friendly is some of the best candy planet star wolf dragon santa claus root for that you guys do make blueberry candy it's kind of my fave i don't know you guys and or not i i keep it up guys we're uh we're not making the blueberry today but we've got blue raspberry packaged yeah by itself and i think the blueberry is in the most recent um fruit friendly i want to say but the flavorless should be up there on the website yeah uh whitney sent a two dollar bag hey guys keep up the positivity love you guys well thanks hey thank you yeah uh natalie sent me super chat uh i received my candy order

super chat what about a blackberry lemonade twist there's like not too many uh hard candy combinations that wouldn't taste good i wouldn't mind getting the black raspberry though yeah i had black raspberry lemonade this uh past summer well not this past month the summer before that it was the best three i ever consumed okay it was incredible we have uh black raspberries that grow on the side of our house every year i didn't need a single one this year uh someone said oh yeah people have been asking about like eggnog flavored uh assorted chocolates and maybe hard candy i think we have an eggnog flavor oh do we i think it's like you know from back to today yeah so we'd have to replace it which one do you think i think oh yeah definitely yeah anything mango is my favorite yeah i ate like a whole pack of dried mango last night i'm feeling it right now yeah that mangoes killer yeah uh youtube shark it's not an 85 superchat you guys could do a blackberry flavored hard candy that tastes like a blackberry fruit i mean that makes sense yeah because black candy like it was it was actually colored black i don't think people have black food do we no i don't know if there is black food coloring his white took us a while back dude start squeezing out those sharpies um yeah i mean we can even like put a bunch of seeds in it so it's like really like eating the blackberry oh noah says hello from syracuse i've heard of that place yeah annabelle says hello from buffalo that's true there's a lot of local people and not local wow yeah well i guess a lot of people can't come visit now in one lifetime yeah keep those youtube secrets yeah uh lisa cena said i love you guys i make hard candy using hero wish i could get the big tub of food you guys use my kids would love me with extra laundry oh i bet that's not possible if your mom making hard candy for your kids yeah the main ingredient is love i think it's sugar yeah judging by all the comments of people saying what's well it's candy okay yeah we got two super chats uh one from chloe again thank you for sending all the super chat today chloe uh black food coloring can stain your teeth if you're not careful permanently forever wow um more santa super chat hello from poland uh i love your videos they're the highlights of my days and these hard times stay safe and healthy love you all well you too thank you you guys thick hair up there yeah licorice hard candy yeah i can see that people being black and byron just posted a link to the website for anyone who does want to place an order uh he from the uk been the last few years well thanks mike that is your real name he's got a certain last name that i would say i think you figured it out he's trying he's trying to trick me hi from pennsylvania dylan you're sitting right there you're not tricking anybody uh would you guys ever consider doing an apple cider flavored or heart candy for fruit and friendly or the spice pack i think that's probably going to be the next flavor in our in our fallen friendly one oh yeah well i mean now that you suggested it i don't mean we were thinking about it right right yeah uh so it says what flavor is this this is coffee flavor if you've ever had dove's espresso ice cream this reminds me of yeah like it's spot on all right that one's pretty quick nice and smooth yeah we're only at i guess we'll go see what everyone else is up to i guess we'll probably see what my dad's up to first and we'll see if the girls are up there oh my mom want to make an all right well we'll go take my mom there's the last of this batch oh do we do jugger beer no we don't have anything ginger beer that would probably be really good though uh root beer this is all the coffee flavor and then we did cranberry and what else is over here pumpkin yeah okay so we got pumpkin cranberry coffee and then earlier there was uh strawberry lemonade looks like we've got a ghost in here that's it oh well i must watch right by her you can see me yeah i have a question for y'all so somebody said in a comment on an order when she was ordering the watermelon hard candy she said when she was a little kid she used to get a transparent watermelon hard candy they called it candy glass my question is is anybody interested in us making like a whole batch of transparent candy because all we have to do is really not pull it on the hook yeah because the watermelon has a nice pink color to it so that'd be kind of cool transparent um i know the cherry looks pretty cool transparent that would be a red but like what flavors would you be interested in and are you interested at all or is it just one person that wants clear watermelon it looks like everyone's just saying yes yes yeah yeah i don't imagine people would not be interested you never know i mean do you want to be able to use your camera i will unsubscribe immediately i want to be able to read my paper through my candy yeah so i was just wondering if that's interesting we're not trying to reinvent the wheel we're just reinventing hard candy not like the some of the darker colors aren't going to lend themselves well to that but i was just wondering if anybody's interested sure that's really all i have to say about that all right i'll let you get back to it and then uh i guess i'll go see what dad's up to good luck with that all right he might be in there he might not he gets away yeah yeah he wanders away and if you've had your back to him could you head your back to him yeah could walk he might turn into helga no yeah you never see those two together yeah i've never seen them in the same room before right uh see we got a super chat uh from someone i can't say their name it's a long name max is the best candy on the channel eye candy all right well yeah i think dylan just had dads out there i don't know where'd he go oh i thought you said dan was out here no i was saying i should come out here first oh okay we're looking for him he's on he's are

inception of whoa [Music] just keeps repeating there's so many dylan let's see all right so we've got this set up over here uh let's see we just got super chat from dylan sending another super chat

you're doing the the peppermint oreo bark yeah oh okay yeah yeah someone said what about durian flavor i don't know about that durian have you ever had it's uh it's a very polarizing fruit really yeah it doesn't exactly smell the best oh i would even go as far and say that it smells really bad are you guys putting together a batch huh are you putting together another batch oh yeah i can take it all back out yeah yeah do that uh william sent me two dollars what's max's workout routine like 15 arm presses one day and 15 leg presses the next day oh yeah you're just working very brief yeah huh so you're just working out at home so yeah it's like you're kind of limited in what you can do yeah i mean you know i want to get bigger but i'm not like trying to get bigger uh kellen sent a three-dollar super cat should i put a cooler pack shipping to new york city it depends on the temperature but probably yes i think right now up to like seven days it's gonna be really nice they need one i mean if you wait like another month you probably don't need to yeah or even maybe just a couple weeks if you're getting it like now then yeah um uh 2 30 so we gotta wait until we get to about 308 when you say dylan someone said wow you guys are really cranking out the candy today or really cranking out the candy yeah yeah now this is like a usual day for them yeah how many batches i was gonna say you guys are well i mean you guys do have a lot of baskets today it's like what at least seven batches when you guys do hard candy there's only six okay we did it we were gonna do another one uh peppermint for uh steve to make clark but yeah we had enough time uh at the end of the day yesterday oh yeah we did uh what did we do yesterday we didn't bring them all right or brittle yeah you guys you did mostly brittle but then at the end of the day we did a batch of hard candy peppermint yeah you got the first time ever doing that yeah yeah we we tried to do the peppermint last night to save us time today and then we wound up replacing the 18 pound batch equipment for the 24 pound batch it's very very lemonade so yeah and you guys we're going to do a green apple today but then you ran out um well we have we have like another green apple it's just not colored i don't think this one was like dyed and stuff but uh so we gotta just still be doing it but just adding the green apple yeah we'll just have to color it and we might put like another shot of citric acid in there or something just make it rip tangie uh cherry cherry sent a five hour trip hello hercules so happy to see live again would you ever consider a vintage assortment with root beer lemon drops sassafras cinnamon etc um i would say that not any plant anytime soon but i wouldn't rule it out yeah you know consider it there's no reason we would be against it uh and then dylan sent another super dad thank you dylan for all super cats from pennsylvania uh another fruit and friendly flavor i saw you could do someone said in the chat uh could be dragon first yeah that'd be good that would be good yeah yeah we could do like uh like tropical yeah yeah with like dragon fruit passion fruit star fruit oh yeah [Music] i used to do stuff like that these are like crazy sharp too yeah they're all really really scared to put a paper towel on yeah this always reminds me of like the game at the fair where it's like all the horses and you gotta spray the water in it oh yeah i'm talking about uh yeah play that game all the time any other questions done um not really people are just wondering about different flavors and things like and they're also asking shipping questions with ice packs oh okay so we're gonna answer this question then we'll probably go find my mom and we can ask about it yeah we'll go through so everyone store up your shipping questions we're about to go ask my mom but planet star wolf garden says uh what is the favorite candy and what is a popular candy so i guess what's the most popular candy and what's up your favorite candied i think it's the potato chips chocolate covered taste tips and they started chocolates yeah and then then after that i don't know but gingko has been max has been doing shipping um yeah a lot of the the peanut butter bark the chip bark um tons of hard candy's been going recently the blue raspberry the watermelon the tropical um people love the ribbon uh filled or otherwise but yeah i'd say the chips and the assorteds are probably the biggest the assorted there's like an assorted box in every single order yeah yeah nothing is not popular everything i put like four or five like chocolate apples in an order the other day uh katie sent a two pound super chat you guys make me smile my dream is to visit that's awesome thank you i hope we do get to visit you one day when this whole plague is over uh so we're gonna go over to mom and let's see if anyone has any shipping questions now is the time to ask oh where'd she go oh yeah this is her new standing desk oh there she is you found me yeah so uh people want to know about like uh cold packs and stuff like that do i need a cold pack to north dakota so can use it just explain how people can find out if they need a cold pack yes actually the easiest way because i could tell you a bunch of stuff and then your head will be too full because yeah if we just answer everyone's question do you need to north dakota yes or no or do you need to virginia yes or no it's just easier for other people to figure it out if they go to the website yeah basically um when you put something in your shopping cart there's going to be all this printing at the top and it tells you that you're um so like like north dakota if your temperatures are um below 68 and they probably are you probably won't you don't need a cold pack but just follow the guidelines here so if the temperatures are above 68 and you're ordering chocolate you do need a coal pack if you're ordering hard candy and it's up to 85 degrees you still don't need a cold pack but north dakota is like four or five days away so uh that's my answer to that yeah got another one uh yeah so people just like go to the website and then people always want to know like how much they will send us messages or emails saying how much will it cost so if you can tell people how they'll be able to calculate the shipping themselves so they don't have to ask easy peasy put something in your shopping cart anything and then it again it'll take you to the shopping cart page so let's just put some something that's not sold out yeah chocolate chunks we always have those yeah we're trying to keep up okay so we're just going to add that to our shopping cart and it takes us this page with all this writing and then that's when you can figure out if you need shipping or not yeah you just read that so if you need shipping you didn't hold back i i joke i joke and talk is it yeah never done it before but anyways at the bottom of this page it says shipping rates calculator so then that's we just want to put in oh my god i'll do new york because that's where i am and i know some zip codes in new york and i'll do our zip code 13057 calculate the shipping rates and it tells you the shipping rates from the least expensive so if i want to ship to myself right here they would take this over the ups facility yes craig mom santa claus just sent us a super chat that's how looking forward to holiday candy well we do help santa claus out yeah because santa even with all the elves he can't do it all himself yeah so he does come here takes what he needs leaves us a list is deductible on our taxes and everybody wins everybody wins so that's the shipping calculator okay yeah so then if you put anything in your car once you put in your cart you know it's not like a solid contract yeah you don't have to buy it you can abandon your car you can find out how much it costs you can click that x and abolish it yeah so yeah that's what i have to say about that what else you got uh other people want to know why we don't show apos oh because that's the post office and um we've had less than good luck with the post office and also it would involve us going to the post office and we don't really have staff to do that so that's the main reason there and then other people want to know like why we can't ship to australia or japan like just other a lot of some other countries all the other countries each country has its own restrictions japan the um ingredients has to be in japanese um we have been shipping to germany all along and i just ran into a roadblock yesterday they wanted um instead of just the ingredients they wanted a breakdown by percentage of weight of glucose starches sugars it's like ah game over yeah so now i had to take germany out of the mix and i've been shipping to germany all along but this package ran into it so it's probably gonna get sent back to me and i'm gonna have to refund her so the reason that you can't do stuff like that is because it would take so much time and well no it's labeling requirements right like i mean i would have to actually send this to a lab to get each thing analyzed right and then but a lot but it's labeling restrictions is usually what it is or some places they don't allow the importation of things with milk in them so the milk chocolate or the dark chocolate and in australia on top of labeling restrictions they're also the fastest an item can get to them is seven days even with the fastest shipping and because it's so hot hard candies would be melted into a clump the chocolate would be liquefied so it's just not worth it i have i did ship a sweatshirt to australia last week that one can get there and for me to do that i had to actually go into my administration yeah enable australian shipping and then he quick paid for it and then i disabled because i don't want people thinking they can order it because they can't because we the labeling law is there so i mean i can make things like that happen yeah but people can order from all over the world they can order all any of our merch on teespring right because that'll just that just gets drop shipped to them we don't have to deal with anything probably the shipping's a lot cheaper because it's closer to them yeah uh so william mann said where can i get that mouse the vertical mouse oh amazon maybe craig will put a link to it later on yeah i can't i can't do it right now good yeah but yeah it's a vertical mouse from amazon actually maybe i can get uh dylan to post that yeah i can't remember what brand it is yeah if you just type an ergonomic mouse into amazon it'll probably pop right up i can't see what the brand is what else you got uh i think that's it for right now this is my student my new stand-up desk oh yeah well well so this is the preview for people who will probably have it in the next video check it out it's got a lever here so it's hydraulic so i can just squeeze the lever and gently push it down so it's not ratcheted yeah so it's nice and smooth yeah so this is better because sitting is a new smoking yeah and i was just doing too much sitting so i stand you're hurting your back yes this is so much better yeah all right well i guess we'll go back to the introduction good talk did you find your dad yeah eventually hello if i'd go try to find him again probably won't oh well yeah he'll be gone again yeah he's violent yeah oh you guys have a lot a lot to pack up oh we weren't making candy what where is it yeah i had that at his wedding don't tell my mom dia clothing said i ordered from the uk alexandra says what she said the lifestream's going so fast it's hard to read all the comments i'm like hey yo just waking up and you guys are live awesome uh cam chan sent a super chat five dollars how far in advance should a wedding party order all right so we're gonna ask my mom that yep so mom would know yeah oh is the dad putting that on there gonna ask my mom i've got another question for you all right uh cam chan wants to know how far in advance should a wedding party favor order be placed for a group of 500 and will i have to pick up from new york thanks from washington dc okay if you order from the website anything on the website is shippable so you do not have to pick it up from new york and for 500 i would say if you can give us 60 days that would be a super good idea cool does the time of year matter like if it's if it's hot oh i was thinking like when it's like closer to christmas because you guys might be more well even still i asked for 60 days right and at that point it doesn't matter it has a wedding name on it or merry christmas yeah it's still gonna get made in the order that it was received all right i don't know 500 people well i mean i know you guys i know of 500 people you know very well 500 people right yeah anywho all right see ya also now said nice mask mom sophie i think that was one of our subscribers we often got a subscriber sending us masks and stuff our subscribers are very creative you know how it's pulled the other one in in uh so i found out did you know you were thinking it's a fair court i guess it's really it's a fair cost like that's just another colloquialism from britain yeah i got an important question yeah people are asking about uh sugar-free candy for people that might be diabetic or things like that so do we know what options we have that are sugar cream sugar-free chocolate yep right i think we mostly just have trunks but they're sugar-free clusters now too yeah so they are got sugar-free chunks in milk and dark and i think we also have sugar-free clusters of some kind i'm not super familiar with the sugar-free that's all steve's job this the hard kitty definitely not sugar-free yeah i don't even know what we would do yeah that's that'd be a lot of stevia you know you're like thousands of dollars i don't know do we ship overseas uh they wanna know specifically england yeah england's probably like the most common far away country right yeah yeah besides canada right yeah yeah that's right over the border we're like just two hours away yeah yeah we could literally drive it to canada yeah basically that's a different world you know my mom's from fulton what do you mean you wouldn't be saying that she's canadian or no she's from phoenix never mind i lied no i would never call it canadian no uh i wanna bring them down one time uh i think it was in a recent video i said canadia they got a joke and people like i hope he doesn't think it thank you it's writing the name that's what we all know if you think we said something stupid it was totally ironic that's awesome every single time i've never seen anything no someone wants to know what time is it here it's about 1 30. government oreo park are you doing the white chocolate yes i just crushed all that all off the hard candy just made it yesterday all right that's what i was saying earlier yeah favorite candy to make so what's your favorite candy man maybe peanut brittle yeah i like cheap hand brittle that's probably my favorite oh yeah that's awesome yeah yes i never knew it was going to be so good yeah uh meal times and mouthfuls in a five dollars uh what's the best time of year to come for a visit told my husband i want to come to see you well in person any time really after this is all over yeah after all this is so in a couple years i mean really i guess like the summer might be like one of the best times as far as being able to take your time like uh talking to us and um checking out the store yeah i mean it doesn't really matter though well you guys have definitely left rush trucks just after all this is over yeah that's the main otherwise any time of the year really is good we're always here uh dylan sent another super chat thank you so much dylan oh twenty electric chat this time have you thought of doing pumpkin spice or apple cider chocolate bars oh that again pumpkin spice or apple cider chocolate bars i don't know how we would do that without the flavoring oils basically yeah chocolate bars huh yeah because i i think would be more likely to make a card candy like that i mean we already did pumpkin spice but it'd just be apple cider vinegar are we allowing customers in the shop uh not at the moment no we can't trust them they don't do what they're supposed to some some people yeah some people and we're just like you know if we could just not have to deal with that we just won't especially since so many orders are coming in online and then we're also fine we're just doing uh what they call the pickup at the back side uh [Music] i'm gonna go see what the uh the temperature is at will this be online yeah of course all of our candy that is shippable is always on the website we're getting close someone said what about extremely spicy hard candy i can see that in the future i think max would be really into that 275 we got to get up to 308.5 yeah so max did you hear that someone was asking about extremely spicy hard candy and i was like i think max would be all over that oh that's i'm right up my alley yeah i don't really know i guess you would have to get like liquid capsaicin max you know one i think you would really like what mango chili maybe like spicy yeah i uh i have dried chili with mango or mango or something something like that yeah that's really good though yeah goku sent a five dollar super chat the real goku yeah uh says goku's like cougars i think it's

leave here maybe we'll uh we'll let greg don't do that yeah yeah i'll pick up a bag of that that sounds good yeah i know max would be all over especially if it was mango ghost pepper or sugar believe it or not oh someone said chocolate bacon because a lot of people have asked for that but we don't really have any pathogens any possible intestines and that came out currently and we would not like to introduce anything we'd be like governed by a different department at that point yeah they're not legal yeah the vegan police would come knocking on the door immediately no blacktop here or anything we'd have to buy like that pre-cooked like microwave bacon nobody wants that wouldn't be the same yeah uh someone just said how do you order they went to the website and there's not a list of available stuff that's available in prices um i mean if you go to the website um it should say what's in stock and it'll say right next to what the price is so did you go to the wrong website or yeah i've never been to the website yeah dylan can uh link uh the website there we go there it is right there nice work dylan good work though there was a lot of a lot of work done keep that up i might i

really good honestly yeah like lucky charm i could see like cinnamon water yeah cinnamon toast crunch salt berries dewey shipped to new zealand actually i don't know i feel like we were just talking about that but i'm not sure either i think new zealand has a lot of restrictions oh yeah so that's a solid maybe a very solid hammer slap 75.00 what about a form on the website for people to submit their awesome product ideas i don't think my mom would go for that because she kind of doesn't really like when people say you when they start the sentences but you should you get enough in the comments she's got so much comments if it's if enough people comment it we'll see it in the comments anyway if only one person is asking for it probably not that many people want it yeah i mean you guys could put it up there and then like the more thumbs up it gets or something we go down yeah i mean honestly if we ever say that we're ever going to try anything new it's always pretty much going to be people saying yes yeah there's not too many flavors that wouldn't work as candy yeah not a whole you lot them count for me joe that's two three okay four how many more at least eight all right five more niner and serum you know i'm not so great at that uh oh my wow that smells so good it like it's literally just liquid apple pie in here can you guys smell that at home just get an apple pie and put it right in front of yourself you smell harder yeah it smells good that might be the best one today that is definitely the best smell this part never gets old here i'll get real close you guys can smell it there you go oh man it's so good someone said it smells like grandma's house yeah you got a good grandma do you actually make cotton candy hammers we make cotton candy flavored hard candy but that's about it yep yeah we don't have an actual we're accumulating all those machines in the other room well yeah we got the tapping machine we haven't even been able to use that so we got the roller i don't think we we're not making any jelly beans or anything though but maybe someday yeah or like you know jawbreakers i think it would be really great someday if we're able to move to a bigger location we have more things and more people in the building so we can get more things done different kinds and i think max and i and joe actually were talking the other day about like someday in the future we got like a bigger place now this is like years in the future and it's a maybe we were saying i think it would be cool if uh we could like you guys could like play video games or something like madden or whatever games you guys want and you know viewers could watch and comment on anything um or just live stream something other than candy like you guys all just hanging out like maybe jamming yeah we were just watching football playing guitar yeah um yeah i think that would be cool too but we need a bigger facility oh that's a good sound but yeah so chloe's sent another super chat she's been selling a bunch today uh the oreo bark steve is making now with a hard candy looks like fruity pebble cereal oh yeah people had um a comment they're asking if you guys have ever

good how do you guys think i think it was pretty good we got another super chat from milton's mouthfuls thanks for all super chats today uh what first candy your dad learned to make see when i was a kid they sat me down with um just milk chocolate to do molds oh yeah please don't be it all by hand it sure is first thing i ever did was unmold candy i think that was it yeah yeah well i told you my first job was stamping bags with hercules candy company and name of the old and ink oh yeah and someone said why not just pour the candy like from the cuddle like you've done before um yeah i mean i could have but it's it's pretty warm so it's not going to harden right off or anything because i have to work with it warm so it wouldn't really matter either way because you're going to i have to wait for it to cool down but i can't put it down cold because then it'll harden up on here too fast even if i poured it on it would harden before i get a chance to yeah mix it all up and so it has to be kind of warm yeah uh nico pico sent another two dollar super chat uh have you guys ever made bubble gum no that'd be interesting i don't know how you would even make it though i don't know anything about bubblegum yeah uh metal bugs games send a five pound super chat as i cannot afford to get your candy to uk i will give money this way as you all deserve it as your candy looks so fine well thank you oh that's very nice over here yeah we appreciate the support after a little bit of this let's go back into the hard candy been watching since you have 35 000 subscribers question for steve have you ever made your own in-home chocolate or possibly ever considered it oh yeah i've looked into it and i've considered it but it's uh it takes up too much time yeah because i'd have to have more time and a bigger building too right to uh do that most of the day in the bar yeah because then i wouldn't be able to make the candy itself right here so it's kind of i'd name two of me if you could call me or something yeah uh midnight gaming eight seventy-five super chat have you always wanted to try i have always wanted to try or got candy with what's something you sell with the most chocolate i guess chocolate chunks chocolate chunks is the best deal here actually yeah yeah it's good good price and uh get a good amount of can of chocolate now i got to get my fingers right down in there and mix up all the hard candy pieces otherwise they'll sit on the bottom and then you turn it over when it's dry and it'll all be on the bottom just see it yeah let's see you know all that would be on the bottom we got super chat from petroglyph 75 can't afford the candy i want to support the bestest candy store in the world you even have batman working there all right let's go see what they're up to okay the one that i was really excited about though was ctr like you'll see him for the first two seconds and then you're like where'd craig go and then like he's in first place and it's done all right milton's mouthful another super chat um over here i know uh five dollars it says what's the difference between pulling and the machines you see pulling taffy i don't think there's a difference um the machine's taffy gets pulled for like 30 minutes yeah which is that's a lot of work for a human yeah so it's pretty much the same thing um this goes for way longer right you'd have to be a lot stronger to do that yeah so i i think what she was trying to say is like why does this yeah like is there any certain situation you would want to use a hook or or like a certain different situation to use um we don't know how to make that be i don't know how they keep it soft because if we were to pull ours that long it would be more and more and more and more air into it and the more air you beat into the candy the crunchier the candy yeah so i don't know what they do with taffy i've seen them like putting maybe simple syrup on it or something to keep it soft yeah i don't know um but yeah if you're going for color or texture you throw on the hook if you're actually trying to make tacking you do the tapping or i'm sure that you can use the taxpayers for that too just take it off early yeah oh anyone wants someone wants to know if we're playing the new call of duty coming out i don't know there was one yeah call of duty 89. modern warfare 13 it's the call it's cold war the cold one dylan's always kept up to date on the video games with like ronald reagan on him oh yeah that looks pretty cool it looks cool but they've they've lost they've lost my uh a while ago just just one of these yeah uh hammer slaps another while we're getting a lot of people just repeating super chats but thank you we super appreciate all you guys doing super chats um five dollars it says another candy idea i like the peppermint and oreos in white chocolate but it's graham crackers and apple pie candy in white chocolate wow so so that should basically be like uh apple pie with white chocolate the grandchildren kind of be like the crust you could probably sell your dad on anything outside uh aaron season i found out super chat this is for kara to help recoup her paycheck karen needs food for the week like 10 more mistakes yes uh george place sent a five-year-old super chat greetings from germany my order arrived really early pecan brittle and white cashew bark almond brittle tasted a bit

i'm like looking back and forth uh you guys should do a d and d oh yeah i would love to see what kind of characters everyone play i've never played but dylan dillon like before this whole schmorn schmidt happened i wanted to try it yes and i have people in my life that know how to do it just everything hit at the wrong time yeah maybe maybe at some point if we get more knowledgeable that would be fun yeah that's what that's what i was saying before is like someday in the future i think it would be cool to be able to live stream or just like hang out with our viewers doing something other than just candy making yeah and you know i think it'd be cool uh so midnight gaming sent and uh super chats uh what bark is your dad making he's making peppermint oreo white chocolate bark i better stop making bark and meal times and mouths will send another super chat if you guys made a candy that represented your favorite tv show what would it be i would say probably milk steak chocolate covered milk steak and our finest jelly beans served raw of course no cheese no uh no pretzel day references in there yeah that would be my vote so yours would be like pretzel day chocolate pretzels like with all the works yeah with the words uh jiggly cheesecake sent a five dollar superman i think you're gonna say that's the next candle uh hi how are you guys handling schmovid has business been slower actually business has been a booming yeah basically just because uh one of our videos went viral a while ago um and it's just been it's going really well ever since um and i've actually been limited on how many videos i can post because of that uh so chloe said another super chat have you ever considered honey flavored candy um mom was talking about something honey yeah yeah a lot of it is just a matter of finding the flavors like the flavoring oils how many would be a little difficult because it is sugar yeah so we might be able to incorporate it right into the batch yeah uh oh wait you already threw on there right yo yeah vila style 84's dentist loves you guys i bet he does yeah if only we had a oh someone just said i just thought of bailey's hard drive mean honestly like a liqueur flavor around christmas or something yeah that'd be pretty cool yeah we used to do more like irish cream stuff i love that ice cream i i think it didn't sell super well so yeah and if people can see in like the bottom right corner of the laptop they can probably see like inception of max pouring oh i want to see there's a live stream and under the corner there's a live stream of the live stream your dog dog i heard you like live streams you're thinking about sweden by the way sweetheart cheesecake has a good question what's your second favorite color orange hands down okay let me

uh matthew sent a five dollar super chat i would really enjoy doing what you guys do but sadly there are no places near me that make candy like this hey you could be the one to start it yeah it's uh seriously i mean it takes a while to learn and everything but you'll master it eventually and then you can bring candy to your community yeah everybody needs a local candy shop caitlyn collins and another super chat remember me also heart i love their work slash videos well you sent a lot of super chats to caitlin so i do remember you and i'm not in the business kirstie loves you i think that she's going to super chat today too i don't remember everyone who sent superstars but i think she did um my favorite color was joe coloring my little pony on the floor that was really funny thank you all for saying a birthday card for my birthday card for my birthday candy and i ordered it for my kiddo i love small businesses small business touches like that you know it's hard to read something what reasons we're glad that you appreciate our little puppies yeah that's uh seriously i mean that's what it should be you know what i mean we all we're all people we're all here and then just knowing that people appreciate little touches only makes us want to do it more so you know what maybe we'll keep doing that yeah you know what i'm sending another birthday card you know what maybe we will all right so scott and i said that five dollars how about caramel filled apple ribbon i think we did that yeah all right i think that that ribbon candy is in the other room right now uh what video event went viral it was the strawberry lemonade candy video we actually made earlier today by we i meet you guys you were here yeah don't even pretend like you can make all this game dude this

here yeah well thank you mike just keeps popping up huh someone said um what piece of equipment are you guys looking forward to next and i think it would be the taffy machine that they already have yeah but we're waiting to get to use it right which a lot of people don't know about some of the new subscribers might not know about but yeah taffy's in the future just don't know when yeah we wanted to do it this summer but yeah you know we also didn't anticipate uh the whole world burning it's all the perfect but you know we like to keep smiling while the world's burning down around i mean i'm being a little bit dramatic i don't know i see smoke out there 2020 has just been last night that was like okay so you love brooklyn nine-nine i started watching i tried to find a funny part the one part that i thought was when uh the captain he was just like talking about a really awful day and he was like i don't want to sound dramatic but today has been less than ideal i thought that was actually really funny other than that you know he's probably one of my favorite characters the captain are you a big andy sandburg fan usually i over acted on that show though so i just wasn't a huge fan of him on that show but pretty much anything else i love like hot rod i love hot wheels yeah yeah so ursula moons if i go super chat can you get different designs for the pillow candy or is the diamond shaped thing oh signature um it's not necessarily a signature these machines are like 100 years old right to get the other ones is really pricey so i mean we could get like a drop candy machine or something but they're like 10 grand so yeah uh so we're just using okay and at this point this is his signature because [Music] maybe i'm thinking of it wrong but his name is kevin mcallister on the show right during the movie i think so we had an order from a kevin mcallister in the last yeah do you have mcallister i don't know maybe will you be making vegans happy i don't know if there's any non-vegans i think all as far as they know i think it's all vegan no no you know have you burned yourself while making any hard candy um yeah but mostly like on the hook yeah right yeah just we get blisters sometimes when it gets pretty hot like through the gloves yeah i i'm not saying you know seriously don't don't make hard candy at home and then touch it but there's been a couple of times where it's flush out of the kettle and lands someone wants to know what's the worst flavor we experimented with have you guys tried anything that you just weren't nope they're all amazing yeah i mean really so yeah it's kind of hard to screw up yeah chocolate peanut butter yeah i mean because we're never going to look at a candy and be like let's put a bad flavor in here you know so uh nico pico sent it in orange and cream hard candy for the question orange cream orange it's covered in white chocolate yeah the bark that's like vanilla cream or whatever it's called circle yeah yeah well i think technically we can't call it creamsicle yeah copyright or whatever um meals and mouthfuls sending another super cat anyone's everyone's favorite old school candy mom and dad too please so we'll ask you guys first then we'll go see what my dad does old school play club yeah i don't know oh i guess uh the chops are kind of old yeah i was thinking like like what are they called red hots or something i don't know i don't know red hot yeah yeah just some candy floor yeah were you over there when we used to like we'd like challenge each other to like drink a spoonful of pranks when we we're like real little yeah all right i'll still see real quick what that's their whole time candy is if they have anything uh someone wants to know if you have a favorite old time candy candy yeah yeah the chocolate drops oh yep that's that was my example yeah the chocolate chops that's the old-time candy do you have a favorite old-time candy that we have never made like one that you tried out for well we used to make an old-time candy bar with a cream center then all cream center which like the chocolate drops would with uh peanut butter or peanuts chocolate covered peanuts on over the top of it [Music] it was just a old-time candy bar my grandfather used to make it's just a simple little cluster like with a cream center and someone wants to know how old the cuddles are you think well they've been in the family uh over 100 i don't know they brought them over from the old country right they've been they were there i was a little kid so i'm almost 100 so yeah at least i live about half and an hour away from you guys here in plattsburgh uh plattsburgh's a little over an hour away more like four or five all right we'll get back to the hard candy any uh questions there dylan oh yeah yeah oh yeah there yeah we've been training for about an hour 40. oh soda flavors that would be cool yeah we've made our root beer flavored yeah i think soda would probably be real good we had cherry vanilla cola or something like that i think like a soda bad for like soda bags yeah like creamsicle fruit beer ginger beer beer yeah cola like you said dr pepper there's um orange soda yeah yeah grapeseed although how would you get like the fizzy you can you can put a carbonation caps in the candy do you remember drone soda yeah soda had uh candy for a while that fizz i guess it's the same as pop rocks are we outgrowing this shop i think so yeah we grew into it like two weeks after we got here [Music] we just need to get [Music] we're just going to set up a couple of pods off the parking lot let's look at this yeah all the houses in the neighborhoods around here rit i remember them taking us down there for the tour and being like it's kind of a little sketchy like the whole hallway system looks like a boiler room what happened to the old place uh we outgrew it that's the way the candy crumbles james p says craig i remember watching your videos congrats dude you have done your family proud well we've all done the family proud yeah mostly me i did all the hurting um i'm making a deal something oakmoon 75 pounds super debt if you turned each other into candy like terry trans or max ribbon what flavors would you choose for ourselves or for each other so like what what flavor do you represent what is your inner spirit candy yeah your spirit net yeah spirit flavor that's tough would you do mango is it just like what you like that's what i'm trying to think i'm like am i an assorted am i hard candy i wonder maybe i'll be like a mystery flavor yeah you never know what you're going to get you're the whole boss wild card yeah every crew needs a wild card uh leslie's an 85 dollar super chat uh when will you start making edibles well i don't think we will because i think we probably need another license for that uh adele is solid and also it's not uh legal i think for a recreational person in new york um but one day uh adela stylus and a5 does set would you consider making a video comparing the shop when you move to the shop now have you added or changed many things um honestly i think if you just watch the videos from that until now basically it's just this table yeah in the new rover yeah that's probably about it yeah really yeah and shelves about a hundred more shows yeah who wants to know what is the family's last name andrea or andriano depends how great they want to go are you going to go cut it i'm just good oh you did all right you were talking so i didn't want to interrupt you yeah that's okay everyone loves that's like everyone's favorite sound so you guys are doing what flavor next we are going to do green green apple yep oh yeah oh where do you guys add that color you mean i don't know he's got we don't have the right amount of the apple green apple flavoring so he's going to substitute something else oh yeah joe did you already you already cut the stuff in there too oh yeah yeah sometimes cleaning it too yeah i just cut it out there yeah you were talking and stuff and so i didn't want to interrupt yeah that's okay lilith sent a ten dollar trip i called the store last week to let you guys know about the environmentally friendly packing peanuts that are made out of starch anywhere i think mom said no because i'd like to wait for something like that well we're always looking into that stuff as soon as the as soon as the stuff is available to us yeah we're a little switch or something but yeah it depends on who we can get it from and stuff like that yeah so it depends on like availability instead yeah so so i uh if we do start doing that then we would mention in a video so oh yeah until then no work but if you see it in a video then you'll know yeah i mean our packaging and everything is uh because it's environmentally right but it's not plastic right yeah they're kind of just like the styrofoam paper labels and boxes and adam says it's time to boot the hair place next door and expand hercules call the landlord and get them relocated that's the funny thing they're the landlords yeah they're the ones i don't think they'd want us to kick the landlord though yeah yeah can we ship oh can we put iceland on the shipping list if it's not on the shipping list we probably can't you could ask your representatives yeah it's usually it's usually like restrictions yeah you keep us from uh sending to certain countries right uh and somebody else wants to know where helga is have you seen he'll go dad i saw her just leave a few minutes ago oh yeah she was laughing all the way out the door yeah did she get a new broom i think she did oh wow uh okay mill times and mouthfuls has been something a million super tests lately so i sent another one for five dollars if hercules candy was turned into a movie what would y'all who would y'all want to put who'd you have a great question yeah yeah this is meals and mouthfuls you have some of the best questions on here but who who would play you in a movie basically what after james brolin yeah i don't know i don't know oh yeah george clooney yeah and uh match would probably be uh barrel street dude 100 percent i was either going to say or jason a little tricky you might think that it's the same person you know i think the rock could play joe yep you'd have to work out a little bit more though yeah to look like joey and i think uh the guy who could play me would be the with that guy who was uh um he was in bohemian rhapsody he played what's it called oh oh oh i feel like it looks like the tiniest bit like you now yeah he was uh freddie mercury yeah let me look at him nico pico sent a two dollar super chat this would be my dream job that's it remy romney yes what's your name email remy romeo [Music] oh yeah everyone's saying that right now too once you said that oh steve martin is steve that's what somebody else does that that'd be good yeah because he's he's funny like you george i think he's imitating you yeah yeah whenever uh yeah oh leslie nielsen he's like a funny guy one thing i got white hair yep that's basically my dad hey what the heck whoa whoa whoa whoa", "GL7HqCEikGE": "weight loss is hard and some food is so calorically dense that it makes it even harder to reach that calorie deficit so I wanted to make this video to share with you some of the food swaps I've made that are delicious by the way right delicious food trucks that are gonna help you reach that calorie deficit much faster without being in misery luck if you have a sweet tooth and you're craving some sweets you can't just say oh I'm gonna stop myself you know you don't want to look like that so I'm gonna share with you five sweet food swaps that are gonna make your life so much easier let's get into it the first ones for soda I don't need to tell you how bad soda is for you I'm sure you've heard of a lot of sugar a lot of calories for such a little amount of liquid and you could go with the diet alternatives but the problem is those fake sugars those artificial sweeteners they've been associated with increased rate risk of depression who wants that right away get that out of my face second thing is they make you hungry they've even defective farm animals because that makes them eat more food and get you know bigger so it's really important you find an alternative and the best ones are the fizzy bubbly drinks like bubbly you know that's one another one is Lacroix and they got a lot of flavors so you can choose and pick find one you like and bam you got a soda alternative another one is spindrift they do have a ton of flavors my personal favorite is period it's so good it's the lemon one you could drink it all day guilt-free if you like more sweetness in your drink there's something called buy it comes with many flavors like watermelon pineapple and a swing with a retro troll right and it's better than stevia because your body can actually absorb that sweetener with stevia your body can't absorb it and it's just not as good as a retro troll right so if you like very sweet stuff get you that one let's go to the next one the second swap is for ice cream and this is a big weakness for a lot of women I'm not saying ice cream was in the weakness for me it was definitely a weakness for me but the fact is ice cream is for calories fat and sugar and on top of that it's dairy which is full of poison you don't want to consume dairy believe me causes many issues that's that's a topic for another video I'm here to talk about the swamp how can you make your own flavored ice cream that's really good maybe even better you might like it better than the actual poison ice cream well how do you make it how do you mean first you need a blender right so you're gonna get a blender and then some almond yogurt so yogurt whatever some of them are even unsweetened which is quick for you right and then you're gonna add banana you can add some strawberries in the blender you're gonna add some cauliflower rice that's more mass right it's not gonna change the flavor you're just gonna add cauliflower wise banana strawberries really any fruit you want you basically mix them up blend them freeze them and enjoy and if you want to get even healthier I don't know if you are fan of greens but if you're a fan of greens why not add some kale to you know make your ice cream a little bit green but if you're not you don't have to do that just this is just a ice cream alternative you can add some banana strawberries with some yogurt how do you say no to that strawberry and banana that's a classic flavor then you can enjoy your ice cream guilt for you put on some Netflix maybe a Christian Bale movie right and then you enjoy it you get your vitamins your antioxidants instead of that poison from Dairy a lot of that that's making us unhappy in general all right let's go to the next one the next one is for the peanut butter lovers I'm not a peanut butter lover myself so I've never tried this but there is an alternative to peanut butter not that peanut butter is not healthy it's healthy it's just very calorically dense you know there's a lot of fat but there's another option if you look at most peanut butter out there for each two tablespoons you get about 200 calories and over 16 grams of fat but if you look at PB fit or PB 2 for each two tablespoons you get 70 calories and only 2 grams of fat so this way if you're a peanut butter lover you still get to enjoy peanut butter with a lot less calories alright let's go to the next one the next swap is for sour patch kids lovers there are so many sour patch kid lovers out there ever since I was in high school if you love sour patch kids you love them a lot you know so I wanted to provide you with an alternative that's much less sure because each bag of Sour Patch Kids has over 200 calories and over 40 grams of sugar that's insane but if you look at smart sweets each bag has about 80 calories with only 3 grams of sugar and a ton of fiber the only problem is they're a bit more expensive but what's your number one priority nothing matters other than your help so if you love sour patch kids give these a go and see if you like them alright let's go to the last one the last one I want to talk about is something that I really had a weakness for and that's donuts each donut has over 200 calories right most of them are over 20 calories and a lot of fat so finding alternatives for you is a must because if you have them daily it's just gonna make you hungry and it's gonna make you your weight loss journey so much harder because they're very calorically dense so good alternative is to get some rice cakes wait I know it sounds bad so far maybe you maybe some people don't like rice cakes but there's more all right you get some dates Europe or on that rice cake slice up some banana put it on top and enjoy and it doesn't have to be banana thing about rice cakes is you can be creative put on it whatever you want strawberry jam raspberries blueberries be creative here and make it eat because I know you have a sweet tooth you like doughnuts and this is gonna be a great snack for you it's gonna be a great alternative to doughnuts you're not gonna have the 200 calories to deal with you're gonna be enjoying yummy food guilt-free almost you know and you're gonna be making progress towards your weight loss you can be looking better it's gonna get exciting because who doesn't want to reach their goals right you want to reach their goals I want to reach my goals I hope this was helpful that's all I got

so much that is so exciting next stop 1 million let's go anyway so I've had a few requests for doing a hard candy I did have one video there that kind of I did as a quick music video but I'm actually going to do one of my tutorials more in depth to give you more information and I'm also going to show you two different recipes so I'm going to show you one that if oh you only have can of butter to do with can of butter and the other one is if you've got texture how you can now make a really good tasting hard candy alright so as always I'm gonna jump right into our ingredients what we need and then get everything together to make some awesome candy ok so one of the most important things when you're doing candy making a hard candy making is humidity humidity is a huge factor if it is too humid in your home don't bother trying it it is summer in it is too humid don't bother trying unless you have a dehumidifier or air conditioner so I made these the other day and it was a little too humid and that's what's gonna happen is they're gonna come out sticky and tacky and they're just gonna melt together so optimal humidity is 35% however about 45 to 50 absolute maximum 50 is but 45-year okay at sugar alright so for our cannabutter hard candies you are going to need 1 cup of white sugar half a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a teaspoon of soy or the other one sunflower lecithin yes you can use the powder if it is granular you may need to strain it but I believe the powder will work as well so that's what you're gonna need for your can of butter ones now if you are a tincture person you can make candy sugar & Canas syrup from your tincture if you don't already have those made up I do have the videos that show you how to make those so you can make up your your can of sugar and your can of syrup so for your tincture for takes your candy sorry gap there and this is the way the reason why I did this is so that you don't have the taste of alcohol this way the the alcohol has been evaporated off and it gives you a really nice tasting candy versus probably most you just use tinctures straightforward always have a contend with that taste of alcohol this is going to help eliminate that problem altogether so what you are going to need is a half a cup of white sugar regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar yes you can use one kind one cup of can of sugar I just prefer again for taste to do the half and half you're going to use a quarter cup of kanna syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water and again whatever flavors that you would like to use and colors to make it again this is gonna come out very green so you may not want that color you may want some other color and again the white for the solid background again more I'll go into detail now the nice thing about using this recipe is that you don't have to use an emulsifier like gore gum we're not trying to stick butter in places that has no business being and trying to make it stick so these are all natural ingredients and that's why I find this recipe works so much better all right so the equipment that you are going to need is first a pot a cold pot of water with ice this is for us to stop the cooking process when our candy reaches temperature you're going to need a small or medium heat transfer it pot non heat transfer and sorry heavy bottom is preferred and non heat transfer is there is no dark spots in the bottom of your pot so that means that there is no spots that get hotter than any other spots you have proper proper heat distribution and your candy isn't going to burn in it's not gonna be hotter in one spot but another you will need a spatula your candy thermometer your candy mold yes I know they're red and my dummies I say don't use red molds for hard candies are perfectly fine but not for gummies or if you're making lollipops there's this type of lollipop mold which is a 3d mold or you've got the flat mold that you can get as well so you're gonna have get those prepared and have those standby on hand and I'm gonna use these that's probably another one you're making hard candies you also want to make sure that your molds are small remember you want it to be in your mouth you don't want to be like you want it to to feel good in your mouth not be oversized and that's about all the recommendation I have for your candy molds we will get started first on the can of butter recipe alright so for our can of butter candies you are going to add your one cup of sugar your a half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna stir that until it is combined and your sugar started to dissolve and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high oops sorry I always forget so you're also going to need a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or a paintbrush to clean these sides of the pot down up for many sugar crust that wants our sugar and water there of kamae gonna turn your heat on to medium high and you're just going to continue to stir it until your syrup begins to boil the moment that it begins to boil we're gonna stop stirring and we're going to attach our candy thermometer and cook our syrup to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and again you always just want to make sure that you wash down any sugar crystals that you see for it on the side of the pot the reason for that is so say your candy doesn't crystallize if you leave sugar crystals there it can cause your candy to crystallize now when you're stirring you always want to make sure to go around the edges of your pot the sugar likes to sit in there so you just want to make sure that none of the sugar is sitting or forming on the sitting and crystallizing they're on the bottom of the pot so you can see our or I hope you can see bubbles just starting to form there around the edge so it's starting to boil at this point I am going to stop stirring and I'm just gonna clean off any sugar off the edges then I'm going to attach my candy thermometer and as I said we are gonna cook this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit the moment we hit 300 degrees we're going to dunk it we're gonna dunk the bottom of the pot into our ice water and at first when it starts to boil its gonna be cooking off any impurities in your water and your sugar so it will bubble up like this for a moment but then in a few moments as soon as those cook off it will settle down and the other thing is the ones that starts with the boiling and you've tossed your thermometer just turn your temperature down to about medium now while your syrup is cooking you just want to get your molds all ready and prepared because once our syrup is ready we need to work fairly quickly and then just to let you know so when you attach your candy thermometer it'll go up pretty quickly and then you'll notice that it's gonna sit in around 220 220 - probably for about 10-12 minutes that's while it's mainly cooking the water off after that the temperature will start to increase and it will start to increase fairly rapidly so you don't want to go too far away from the kitchen right after that point so if you do need to take a quick little break and don't forget you've got about probably 10 minutes of safely way right now all right so I am 300 degrees remove your candy thermometer dunk it in your ice cold water to stop the cooking so we just want to wait for it to stop bubbling there a little bit turn off your heat and there we go you don't want to leave it too long cuz your can't it'll start to solidify on the bottom now I'm going to add in the butter now be very very careful because you are working with molten lava you're going to just start to gently just kind of get that there now if it does if your syrup does start to solidify too much on the bottom just put it back on the burner it's still warm enough to melt that and now we are going to get our lecithin and we are going to add in a half a teaspoon a generous 1/2 teaspoon of our lecithin and you're going to drizzle it all over the top of your syrup and butter and then I'm just gonna move this hold on and now you're gonna gently stir until your syrup and butter starts to combine be very very careful as it starts to combine you want to stir it from the center like this so you're pulling your butter and your syrups from the side and this is going to help to emulsify them and emulsifying is bringing them together bringing your water and your oil together as one one solution is one syrup so my syrup seems to be crystallizing it a little bit here so I'm gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of citric acid all right so once your syrup is all mixed its gonna lighten up like this and it's gonna go solid now you can add in your coloring and your flavoring so I'm gonna do this one tutti-frutti first oops I added a little too much sorry normally I'd in a capful I don't know why I just went all freestyle there and I'm going to add in the white and the white is going to help to give a solid background to him for our color and I'm going to do this one pink all right so I was having a little trouble there for a little bit there I thought this was actually gonna be a flop because my emulsifier might lecithin wasn't coming together fully with my syrup but I persevered and kept stirring and and it did come together that graininess is now gone that I was having there and now getting a nice smooth candy syrup so sometimes you might think it's a fail but keep going that's usually what's the failure probably close to way it will be failing is that it's just not am also fine correctly just not coming together so you just gotta beat it a little bit better I have just added a little more color here and now my syrups getting a little bit thick here as you can see it a little bit thick to work with so I'm just gonna turn my heat on to low just to help melt to keep it melted so I'm just gonna get this color mixed in and just get that melted I said just gonna heat it up a little bit so it's a little more melty melted and I will get this poured into our molds all right so with the butter and the lecithin your syrup is a little is a little thicker then if you were using the other when using the other method so now I'm just gonna pour it into my mold as best as I can it's a little hard off that happens just scoop it off you can clean that up later okay so this syrup I'm sorry is a little too thick to try and put into the sucker mold so I'll actually show you the sucker molds with the other one I'm just gonna fill the regular candy mold with these don't worry too much about it the Mesolithic drips on the side you can easily break those off and clean up your candy afterwards so yeah it's a bit messy sometimes the other syrup you'll see works so much nicer now if you do overflow on those just get a straight edge so straight an offset spatula or a straight edge knife and you can just scrape it off the top like so I just scrape it on my table and clean it up afterwards so that's it for our butter candies now we're gonna let this B's sit I'm gonna finish filling up the molds I'm gonna let them sit until they are completely cooled which it takes about an hour or so ready so for our texture version you're gonna have already have had pre-made up your canna sugar in your can of syrup and so for this recipe or rework what we are going to use the half a cup of Canada sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar the quarter cup of can up syrup and our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our half a cup of water our citric acid does not go in until we are done cooking if you put your citric acid in now beforehand you will actually make your syrup too hot and it will burn so just going to combine all our ingredients and then once they're combined I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high until our syrup begins to boil and also make sure to go all the way around the edges of your pot to make sure to get all that hiding sugar now you're gonna find the difference if you tried between the two recipes this one is so much easier to work with so I turn my heat onto there medium-high I'm going to continue stirring until our syrup begins to boil and I am going to wash down the any of the sugar crystals here that a-port got onto the side of the pot now that your syrup has started boiling you're gonna stop stirring you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and I also recommend to get the fan going just because you are cooking even though you're using the dehydrated sugar in the hut there could still be some alcohol left over and that can cause you just want to have it ventilated now if your syrup starts to bubble up this too high and you're getting a little worried there just pick it up off the heat turn your heat down to medium and place it back down and you are going to let this cook now until your syrup hits 300 degrees the only thing that you're gonna do here like I said you're not going to stir anymore only thing you'll do is if you see any sugar crystals or anything formed on the sides just clean that up and as your syrup gets close to temperature don't forget to grab your pot of ice water all right so I'm almost a temperature I've got my pot of ice water ready let's stop hitting the camera and 300 remove your candy thermometer carefully put it in your sink and then drop your pot bottom into the ice water until it the bubbles start coming down and also turn off your heat okay so I'm starting fires here all right so we've got our syrup here and now I'm going to add in our flavoring so I'm gonna do a peach mango tropical punch thingy here so I'm going to do a half a cup a half a capful of each flavor sorry a capful I lied sorry the jiggling of the camera it's a little hard to work off now in some candy hard candy recipes they'll tell you to put that the your flavoring in right away you don't want to do that I can see how that's vaping up there that's your flavor actually burning off so when you see that huge vape of smoke that's all your flavor burning off okay so those are my flavors it's gonna get them stirred in there a little bit now for the color now if I just have if I'm just gonna add in yellow I'm gonna show you what that will look like rocks I'm gonna use peach and you can use the liquid gel or the gel these gels the Wilton gels either one doesn't matter okay not quite that much so I don't use the white and I just use the peach on its own you have a translucent color but it's not very pretty you don't put some on the paper here so you can see it's not the prettiest of colors horrible but if you add the white in it gives you a solid background and it makes your the color the primary color that you want standout is the actual color and so you can see also this syrup was a lot easier to work with stays much thinner and the same thing though if it starts to solidify a little bit on the bottom there just put it onto your burner it's still warm enough it's still warming up and it'll just get that all melted in so I'm just going to finish stirring that up there and I'm going to get the get this ready to pour into the molds so once your syrup is all nicely one color one uniform texture we can get ready to pour it into the mold see that works a lot better and if you're doing these lollipop molds you want to bring them up right to the right to their edges if you don't then when you put them together you'll find that you'll end up with gaps oops not that much then to put small together just flip her over make sure that you do it on the right side put it together and squish her down and then you're just gonna make sure that it's all well pushed down and some firm I'm gonna fill up our little our little molds here and that's it you're just gonna get these filled up and let them harden up and then we'll get them out of the molds yes he's so much easier to work with alright now that our candies are cooled we can take them out of the malls so our first one with our butter the ones that were kind of messy and yucky and trying to get them into the mold just work them out and then with a pair of kitchen scissors you can always just cut around the excess and it'll just come off and then you can just save that you can also put it all any excess you could also put it back into a pot melt it down if do it in a double boiler and or just put it over low heat but be very careful and you can remount it and then recast him again now what I would probably recommend is with the butter one as I said you saw kind of how difficult it was getting in the molds is to just lay it out onto a pan and score it make score lines in it so they can break it easily you can kind of see have a look at that I did it in the cough drop video and then and then here were my the cans syrup and the can of sugar ones the same think there's any extra edges and these two edges you can just easily just snip them off they come off really easily now let's have a look at our suckers so far so good there's still a little bit warm same thing though just cut off any excess around the edges like so and also top them off there you have it two different versions of hard candies and lollipops so odds obvious if you have it as always not as obvious I apologize as always if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments then I will be back to say goodbye in just a moment oh sorry one thing I forgot to tell you if your place is your good through the humidity's good oops you can just store your candies and just put them into a glass jar or into a candy dish good to go if there is any humidity or you find that they're sticky at all you can toss them in powdered sugar or icing sugar and again store them in a glass jar or airtight container the icing sugar will help them from sticking together so I hope that helps you out so guys that was my tutorial on lollipops and hard candies I hope you enjoyed that and as I said before if you do have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and thank you guys so much to help for helping me get to the nine thousand mark well it's Riley a little bit over now yay and and again to lots more recipes to come I do keep a list of these suggestions that you make and I will try to get through them as we go so as I said lots to look forward to in the future if you're new to my channel I do hope you subscribe and if you enjoy this I really do hope you share with your friends so thanks again for joining and you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "WHkCVQ4q1EM": "this is our one cup of organic sugar and there's a half a cup light corn syrup [Music] [Music] and then 1/4 cup of cup of and turn it on medium heat medium-high heat and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "0StE7lIJUXc": "[Music] do [Music] hello hello hello welcome everyone to midweek critique midweek cratic med week critique

things all right so recently i have been on tick tock that's right tick tock diy or die over at tick-tock and i've been making waves baby my latest video which i posted yesterday has 52 000 views check this out there's literally a whole pack of cigarettes in just the little puff bar it's actually kind of a false equivalency but let's just entertain this idea um you're actually it's actually a good thing because you're getting this level of nicotine which is not the bad part of cigarettes or vapor products the bad part is with cigarettes you get all that combustion all that burning all those carcinogens that come from burning tobacco the tar that comes with it that's what's bad and with vapor products you don't get any of that and with high nicotine vapor products you're actually using them a lot less than a lower nicotine product so you're inhaling less pg less vg less flavorings which are not even really shown to be that detrimental but those are the more harmful aspects of vapor products so there you go all right and uh i'm i'm combating all the misinformation that's going on on tic tac i've had enough of all of the misinformation that's going on around about vaping specifically on tick tock so i took it upon myself to start correcting all these [ __ ] so head over to tiktok give me a follow and also let me know if there are any like vaping tick tock videos that you think are stupid or egregious let me know i will respond back and i'm just taking down anyone who's you know who's just lying about vaping these days that's my goal here um and honestly i didn't expect for this to really start like making you know views and stuff but it seems like uh it seems like it is so you know it looks like the people want to know more about vaping and the truth around vaping and i'm going to give it to them so diy or die over on tiktok and of course my instagram uh diy or die over on instagram i'm gonna start posting the same sort of stuff up here um you know they do have like a tick tock competitor on instagram so the same goes for instagrammer right all right everyone thank you all happy acs happy saint patty's day is that true is it saint patty's day is that actually true god damn leprechauns and four-leaf clue what is saint patty's day you know i never really understood what it was nor what it aims to accomplish hold on let's google this what is saint patrick's day so it is st patrick's day it's not saint patty's day uh st patrick uh st patrick's day or the feast of the saints or the feast of st patrick is a culture and religious celebration held on march 17th okay um interesting what's going on here so how did we get to this how did we get to this being about st pat like isn't it weird how we take these holidays or like these traditions and we just [ __ ] destroy them like what does it have to do with saint patrick's you know the leprechaun hats and the green and the [ __ ] beer drinking and i i don't know i know nothing about irish culture or st patrick's or catholic culture for that matter i know nothing about anything um okay well go drink some shamrock shakes go eat some green eggs and ham i don't know what you guys do on st patrick's day other than drink i know that a lot of people like drinking on st patrick's day stay off the road that's for sure don't be driving around on st paddy's day okay all right so we have three recipes here on the docket today first one by npa homemade banana milkshake utilizing flavor art fresh cream flavor art milk creamy vanilla by mullenberry and soft banana by mullenberry simple easy easy to understand i'm excited to try it npa has this is his second time his or her i don't know if it's a he or she second time on the show um so we're gonna check it out looks like it's doing good morn sea is here with cherry sprite using interwear cherries cherry extract fizzy sherbet capellas lemon lime polar blast and ws23 and then a new victim pro b420 with dolce de cheesecake cheesecake graham cross doji de leche graham cracker new york cheesecake and some sweetener i'm excited these are all very sort of simple easy to understand recipes they all look pretty decent i don't see anything wrong with them uh just from a glance so uh a nice easy understandable show here and um i'm gonna give out as many helpful tips and tricks as i can okay i'm gonna do my best on that matter all right cool dudes now i got in something i ordered my nicotine fridge okay so i'm going to show you guys what i ordered i didn't get this in yet i'm it should be here any any minute uh wine fridge i guess no no no wine no this is the one here so i ordered this okay i put an order in for this it should be here in the next uh few hours maybe the schmeck 12 bottle compressor wine cooler refrigerator with lock large freestanding wine cellar 41 degrees to 64 degrees fahrenheit digital temperature control wine fridge for red white champagne or sparkling wine now you might be like why would wayne buy a wine fridge wouldn't you rather buy a freezer not necessarily not necessarily kind of but not necessarily so the reason i went with this instead of like a freezer or a chest for one this is just nicer looking right you can lock it up you don't have to worry about anyone getting in there if they don't have the key to it you could do that with a chest of course but this is like a nice freestanding one but it's just cheap it's 200 bucks it ships to you in a couple days and it's got temperature stability i i will let you know how stable the temperature actually is with this you know i'm not exactly sure that that will be found out but if this is one of the selling points that's why so when we look at what carolina extract says over on their nicotine website okay when we go to their faq which is uh i don't know where how to find it let's see here let me see if i can find it carolina f extract q freezer maybe google that faq okay here it is all right so when we go to carolina extracts faq on their website they state here okay should i store nicotine products in the freezer and then it says if you know that your freezer will maintain temperature below 30 degrees fahrenheit or negative 1 degrees celsius then yes otherwise no damage can occur to 100 milligram per milliliter nicotine products when oxidized when oxides form during near freeze thaw cycles caused by a temperature caused by temperature fluctuations of some freezer units but not all such fluctuations are typically caused by opening the freezer door and outside weather affecting the efficiency of the unit typical refrigeration temperatures or even room temperatures are a much safer storage range because they are well away from freeze thaw potential so this is really where you kind of want to pay attention is with that freeze thaw i guess area because that can introduce oxides when that happens now if you can maintain most freezers should be able to maintain a freezing temperature but if you don't know that for certain then it's a good idea to maybe find a chest or a wine fridge that can do that where it can just maintain a temperature so that's what i'm planning on doing um i planned on i planned on this product here this is exactly what i what i want to do so i ordered a bunch more nicotine so i can fill this thing up and i also ordered here some little uh i believe these are two ounces i ordered a couple two ounces that i'm going to fill up and they're also going to go in there and i got in the art spray so now we're going to be able to once i get my my new nicotine batch because my other nicotine it it's crazy this feels like it's empty it feels like they sold me an empty bottle but um it comes with a nice little cork let's see if the cork fits on these i don't think they will huh nah uh polycone lids but once the other batch of nicotine comes to me i'm gonna break them down into these bottles okay so i'm gonna get the nicotine i'm gonna fill this up and then i'm gonna screw it down chuck that in the fridge and i'm not touching it ever until i need to touch it do you understand so each of these filled with 100 milligrams per milliliter i'm stuck baby i'm good to go are you good to go that's the question right are you good to go me and my family and all my friends who vape don't ever have to worry about nicotine ever again okay so that's kind of the point that i wanted to to get no i shouldn't have crushed this because i kind of want to store this uh we don't have to worry about it right this is the this is where you might want to position yourself so you just don't have to worry about it can you get in the future can you not get in the future can you get it shipped can you get it black market can can companies from china send it over and call it massage oils nothing like that is known right now it's just a wait and see game so if you have the funds it doesn't hurt to be prepared if you don't have the funds i i i feel bad for you honestly i feel bad for you it sucks but welcome to america where the politicians decide on things without any input from you know the constituents okay so once i get the fridge in we'll do a little video on like nice proper storage so would i love it if this could be a sub you know refrigerator or temperature refrigerator sure i would but um this was 200 bucks and it was shipped and i rather kind of do it this way it's the the cheapest easiest way to show all of you guys how i'm doing it just so we can maintain you know the cheapest way possible and just know that it will work okay so that's what's going on here um and you can see all here here are the other specs which you know it all of this stuff rewind goes for nicotine as well temperature stability it's uv resistant so any sort of light that shines on it you don't have to worry about it it's going to go through the you know the stained glass the uv light is not going to go through the stained glass nor is it gonna go through the stained glass and then through the amber bottle so you don't have to worry about that uh it's got like a nice look to it you can lock it up so no kids can get into there if you have children um and yeah and honestly the best sort of way maybe i'll do this in the future is put some sort of like battery system so this would instead of plugging straight into the wall would plug into like a battery generator and then have that generator plugged into the wall just in case if power goes out it doesn't sort of affect the temperature it just keeps it running you know what i mean um that's a little bit paranoid thinking but it is the best way to do it and if you are spending like a thousand dollars on nicotine maybe it is a good idea to go that route you know it's really up to you on uh how crazy you want to take it so there we go there we go that's my uh my uh vape apocalypse um what is it called uh what are those people prepping system that's my prep there's my my bunker my nicotine bunker if you will um and yeah i'll be making videos about all of this once it all gets here should be here today i got everything else i just need that stuff i need that stuff all right what's going on everyone you guys have any questions comments anything you want to ask before we start getting into some mixing here um chasing classes don't want to be a bummer but can my dad get some prayers we just found out he has a lymphoma cancer oh man uh sad to hear man sad to hear prayers shout out to some prayers to chasing clouds hopefully your dad can overcome it i know nothing about that does it have anything to do with your lymph nodes is that why it's called lymphoma i don't know sorry to hear man stay strong you should do a video on storing your nicotine with that gas stuff yeah we will be for sure i have a huge bottle of 100 stored under argon from years ago yeah we're definitely gonna do that and i'll let you know if one bottle is enough to fill i don't know how many 120s or or two ounces two ounces 120 right i bought a few liters of nick so hopefully it will get me by for a while yeah a few liters is is a lot a few liters is a lot you know um you know it kind of sucks for uh for those who aren't in the know right if you aren't watching this channel if you aren't you know in vaping it's hard to know about all of this stuff it really sucks how are you like how how are you going to get by are you going to go back to smoking seems like that's what the government wants you to do i did not get the vso apple and that's why you're not on today sorry buddy i had my weightless arg good deal had my weightless argon cannon bottles arrived last week now a little over two liters of nick to store wait have you got your one shots figured out for shipping well as far as i can tell they should ship just fine they should just ship just fine uh we'll see what's going on with liquid barn but the ones over at flavor jungle there's we have no issues with them it's not a nicotine product it's not a vaping product it's a flavor product from a flavoring company you know what i'm saying should ship just fine now with liquid barn things might get a little interesting we're going to see kind of where they're taking it are they going to continue being a nicotine company are they going to become a flavoring company are they going to separate the departments you know is liquibar nick a different department from liquid barn flavor we'll see uh we've talked about it a little bit but there are no concrete answers it's kind of a wait-and-see game for all of the nicotine companies nicotine river included stuff like that we kind of just need to see where the where the chips lay um but in terms of just the just the flavorings over at flavor jungle they're they're not vapor products and they're not vaping pro they're not vaping products and they're not nicotine products they're not tobacco products so don't have to worry about that now if the government says like i told you guys if the government says you can't ship flavorings anymore then where i'm out of here i'm not a us citizen anymore and i and i hope it really comes across as like i'm not kidding about that if the government tells you you can't buy flavorings or ship flavorings you now live in a communist country and i don't care what anyone says about that it's it that's out of the question so if we get to that point you'll know because i won't be here anymore we'll be streaming out of some i don't know shed in the uk or something but we're not there just yet technically we kind of are but we're not there just yet hello wayne i'm a canadian communist thanks for that bc has zero issues with nicotine and flavorings there's flavor bands hitting canada federally this year this bc has issues with zero nick and flavorings there's flavor bands hitting canada federally this year um do you mean like you can't they won't allow you to ship flavorings at all is that what you're trying to say i've been canada been bugging fusion flavors to bug you they carry your stuff but barely um yeah tell them to contact me for sure for sure they can pick up some stuff canada is on its way there uh health canada soon will be releasing a canada gazette to propose a federal flavor ban we now have credible information indicating that we may see the release of the gazette part one as early as may uh in my country politicians are surely waiting for what else to do in the u.s politicians are so useless that they don't even think for themselves but you know the third world country what country are you talking about bobby told me they were going to be just flavors when you say you're talking about liquid barn are you talking about liquid barn two ounces is six milliliters right so four ounces those are four ounce bottles thank you for that four ounces is 120 correct um canada's on its way there especially notice grocery restrictions here are [ __ ] so when you say like you can't ship flavorings like that's my question just flavorings from a flairing company not a vaping company that's my question if that happens i mean let me let me put it this way if the u.s says you can't ship flavorings or any anywhere that i live says you can't ship flavorings i'm not doing this whole thing anymore i'm i'm becoming an advocate or an activist against the government because there's no point in living in a country where they're restricting your access to flavor for no reason and i hope that makes sense like i hope the severity of that makes sense like it's not a joke imagine if the government for no reason for there's no benefit to it they're just doing it because they don't actually know the industry imagine the industry said you can't ship certain colors anymore you can't buy certain colors of paint because a kid might use them to draw a red swastika so you can't buy certain colors of paint everyone would go [ __ ] insane and you would be like this is crazy we're living in a crazy country right now living in a dictatorship you could do that for sounds right you can't make music with certain sounds you can't ship certain instruments because they make certain sounds because a kid might use it to make a sound of i don't know sex noises or whatever they would deem is bad right you'd be like what the [ __ ] is going that's this that's the same level of what's going on with flavorings if they do that with flavorings it's a bad we're in a bad we're no longer having fun vaping we are now revolting against the government a tyrannical government you know i like i might even consider like suing like i would might even consider suing taking it trying to take it to like the supreme [ __ ] chord on that it's [ __ ] outrageous it's outrageous maybe i don't know maybe no one else thinks of it that way maybe i'm the only one that thinks of it that way i see when i bring this up to people when we talk about flavor bands they kind of go oh yeah i guess that is kind of crazy like they don't think of like wait a second they're restricting access to to flavor let alone just vaping it just the the just the access to it alone you know we sell flavorings at our shop to mix with unflavored base marketed as water concentrates boss was saying they might change to a diy soap supply shop to get around the vape tax on the vgpg nick yeah okay well we'll see if that works uh now i understand not saying i agree with it but i understand a company saying if you ship this vape product with nicotine along with this flavoring product then of course you know can't do that you can't just you can't do that but in terms of like look this is a multi-purpose flavoring it's just a flavoring you can't ship it bad news bad [ __ ] news because there's no precedence for that there's no precedence for that they're limiting your access to a specific sense that's 1984 bad we're we're not having fun anymore this is not a joke anymore we're we're now living in a dictatorship if your country already does that they get the [ __ ] i mean you gotta do something because i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to tell you you're living in a you lit you're living in a prison you're not living in a country you're not living in a state you're living somewhere like a prison i feel the same way unjust laws need to be challenged on an individual level yeah that would be that would be where i would draw the line and say okay it's time to it's time to really fight for your rights you know what i mean now how to go about that i don't know i don't know the logistics of that i would happily figure out a way though i would dedicate my entire life to it or i would just move i mean that's the easiest thing i would just move to a different country that didn't have a dictatorship essentially but i have the means to do that not everyone has the means to do that you might just be screwed you just can't know what strawberry flavor tastes like um okay the supreme court won't do its job i have a lot of faith in the supreme court to be honest it's not a perfect system for sure but i do have faith in its uh i'm not that i'm not i'm not that i'm not uh i have more worry about like lower courts and how lower courts would rule on something like that than the supreme court sort of ruling on supreme court usually gets things pretty right maybe after some time but for the most part i have more faith in that than anything else in the justice system come to the uk wayne you know every day that goes by i think more and more about that for sure every day that goes by all right just order 2 liters cnt and watermelon hell yeah baby cesaro round of applause four boxes of samoas and some other ones are my brother all i care about are the most samoans right isn't that how you say sumo wins all right you need to live in a state where a governor tells the feds to stuff it yeah true that is true i don't have faith in governors though i mean pa is not too bad but we'll see you know when the when [ __ ] starts to hit the fan we'll see if they really care you say no samoas yeah but is it aren't multiple samoas samoans i don't know what i'm talking about florida should i come to florida it's too hot i lived in florida for a year i did enjoy my time in florida do you remember when that guy ate that dude's face on the uh highway uh that guy ate he was on basalt and ate that dude's face i lived right there that's where i lived in lantana florida right next to palm beach i did enjoy it florida was pretty cool but i don't know if i could live live live there it's a little wild all right well let's start mixing while we keep talking about florida and eating faces all right let's do the banan let's do the dolce de leche cheesecake first here it's from a new victim pro b420 okay looks good to me i don't see anything wrong with what i'm seeing here saying a 14 day steep okay not off to a good start we're not off to a good start but hey man i am uh i am alone on in my thoughts about steeping it doesn't seem like anyone else agrees what's going on with this all right sorry about that all right is that probie no we get the wrong bottle here i went and i labeled bottles for you guys today all right so we can see what we're doing alrighty then here we go here we go got governor cuomo here he's trustworthy oh yeah very nice i wish you all the best in your endeavors yeah it's a shame kind of how new new york is a beautiful state if you guys have never been to new york it's got great hiking it's got great like seasonal weather like if you like the seasons um you know upstate new york gets pretty cold but overall it's like a it's a great state that's just completely destroyed i hate to break it to you but like the constituents you know a lot of the people that live in new york just vote against their ins their their interests maybe it's new york city that does it um but for the most part it's like you know the governor's there the law is there it's such a nanny state it's a shame really you know pa is kind of a lot like new york except just a little i would say like a little bit more southern in its law making and it's uh you know it's a little bit redder of a state which is kind of what you want you want a more balanced approach to your legislatures and your laws in your state you know you don't want to you don't want you don't want either too far right or too far left it's policies you kind of want to smack in the middle there seems to be this anti-centrist movement going on also which i don't understand so he's using tfa sweetener i'm just gonna go a half a percent of super sweet normally i would do exactly the type of sweetener you tell me but here i just don't feel like digging it out i don't really use tfa sweeter i don't recommend tfa sweetener uh where's my base where did i put my piece what the [ __ ] yeah this cnt stuff has been uh sitting room temperature opened uh almost i mean pretty much daily i open and close this bottle you know multiple times a day and it's still spot on and i've had that for a few months now maybe maybe a year now maybe over a year it's still good like this stuff lasts pretty good if you just make sure you're closing it you're storing it away from any sort of light or heat don't have to worry too much about temperature i believe states need to have an electoral college most big cities rule the rest of the state yeah for sure for sure you know at least here in pa you know the laws that philadelphia imposes don't necessarily attract with the rest of the laws the state imposes you know you do have some sort of municipality separation but i don't know how that goes for other states and other cities like you can see like at least in the case of new york new york city definitely influences a lot of the rest of the state but i don't know like the ins and outs of new york law so don't quote me on that they said the city smell bad new york city come to philly it's all fake news it's phony stuff it didn't happen you're not alone on steeping sure i mag stir for a bit but after that i never see a difference in stuffing a bottle away for 50 years i believe uh all right i read that one all right dolce the cheesecake here here we go dolce de no that's not correct milk is leche dulce dulce dulce a sweet food or drinks it just means sweet what does it mean sweet sweet cheesecake does it mean like caramel or something i don't know it's got a good smell to it it definitely smells cheese cakey which is not you know not a obviously a bad thing it is sweet let's give it a rip not a lot of depth from the hand test pretty good not too bad i can see why you want to steep it for two weeks steeping would actually help in this situation i'm not gonna lie sleeping would help a little bit here um all right let's get to some points here your cheesecake is a a little coconutty and that's really just a product of the cheesecake that you're using the tfa cheesecake and new york cheesecake it's a little coconutty like you get a little bit of that coconut note i don't think it works very well in cheesecake it's hard to get around because it's so prominent in tfa cheesecake steeping does help that and that's why i really think you know this would benefit from a steep it doesn't get rid of it but it helps it a little bit four percent and then you have three and a half of cheesecake two i use cheesecake one i don't have cheesecake too they're not very different um and the dolce de leche gives it a kind of like a nice sort of nuttiness it gives a little bit of depth but that's kind of where i think this is really lacking the depth of the flavor we're not talking about volume here we're not talking about um you know uh width we're not talking about like uh flavor stage or anything like that just simple depth of flavor i pick up cheesecake pick up a little dairy and then i pick up like a touch of nuttiness sweetness and that's really it there's really not much to it i'm not really getting a big graham cracker note maybe a touch of it maybe a touch of it but i would like to see that improved in some way um tfa graham cracker might not be your best answer for that it seems to only accentuate the coconut note but it's not bad and i think you have a pretty good base here if you just continue working on it i think you can have something really good my tips would be figure out a way [Music] to um [Music] figure out a way to get your cheesecake a little bit more cheesy but i don't mean that in the way of like a yogurty cheese i mean it more in the way of like almost like texture try to get some sort of fluffiness going on here because that's really just going to kind of broaden your flavor stage a little bit and then maybe you can add a little bit more accent to the to your recipe to give it a little bit more depth so whether it's a little bit of caramel butterscotch um maybe it's another vanilla maybe you go brighter and you go with another vanilla it also help kind of separate out your graham cracker it's just not too much here to really get excited about you know what i mean like it tastes fine but it's not a very exciting mix which i'm assuming why you sent it in you want tips to how do i make this better how do i get this to that next level right white sweetener instead of tfa sure yeah flavor west sweetener at like .25.5 um tfa is not the best sweetener to use but that's not really the issue i don't think it's more so just the flavor really am i roboting oh no [Music] what the [ __ ] man are you kidding this is getting annoying if i'm robotic i have to literally reset my computer it stopped if it robots again it's gonna do it again i feel like aaron bieber [ __ ] man it's just so annoying it's been doing it the whole time on and off uh we'll just have to be quick then we'll just be quick [ __ ] no it's windows windows [ __ ] sucks some driver's messed up and when my computer goes to sleep and i don't reset it my drivers get roboty sometimes all right look we're just gonna have to be quick i apologize all right um i just have to remember to restart or just not use windows anymore um okay so going back to this going back to this not a very exciting recipe just off your score we're gonna give you a two and a half this is very average i think of being uh a little bit generous here with the two and a half out of five you caught me on a good day i kind of want to give it a 2 2.25 um i want to see more from it is really what i want to see i want to see i want to see this added with some added depth so try to figure out maybe accentuate some of the nuttiness that's going on with your recipe maybe try to add different accents such as like another caramel um another butterscotch something else you know what i mean throw something else in there like that try to figure out something to really kind of take this to the next level and then try to fluff up your cheesecake a bit you know what i'm saying try to get a little bit more fluffiness going on you could do that with you could try it with yogurts you could try it with like some sort of whipped cream some sort of fresh cream you could try it with different types of creams you could try with a different cheesecake maybe try mullenberry's panna cotta i've been having a lot of fun with that ingredient you could try there's a lot of different ways you can go down that route because what's that going to do it's going to give you a little separation it's going to allow you to infuse another accent or two in there and it's going to just give you a little bit it's going to be a little bit more forgiving um and yeah there's a little bit of like that coconut off note but overall i think it will steep out i don't think it's that much of an issue it's not bad though like i don't want to say it's a bad recipe it's got a good taste good flavor to it it's just not very exciting it's not something that excites there's no excitement to it you know if this was the first ever cheesecake maybe but it's not this is you know the millionth cheesecake here someone says hanks in italian cream yeah yeah you can go like that route you can go the vanilla pudding route you have a good base layer just need to figure out what to do with it okay two and a half out of five well i'll give you the average you're like again you're lucky you cut me on a good day i want to get to give it a two 2.25 but we'll keep it there for now all right let's do the banana milkshake another very simple mix here simple straightforward just how i like it i'm saying let's mix this up here so this includes fresh cream and a half let me adapt this before i make 70 mls of it oh yeah baby okay fresh cream half a percent just a touch just a drop not a lot what's that from is it from art class when you were in school anyone ever say that to you just a drop not a lot one percent creamy vanilla by mullenberry this skill seems better days hey i use my skills i put the work in on these scales all right if you see a clean scale don't trust a mixer with a clean scale that's what i say we got one and a half of flavor arts milk classic flavor art milk dap bonanza and the three percent soft banana by mullenberry which is possibly one of the best banana ingredients you can get very good stuff and a touch of sweet you know i saw a post on reddit that said is sweetener necessary they were talking about hey i see wayne when he mixes he uses a lot of sweetener well he uses sweetener in every recipe basically this is a conversation that comes up a lot but the the the let me put it this way if you are acclimated to commercial e-liquid then it's a good idea to get it it's a good idea to get it and use it at a half a percent super sweet um of course you know sucralose based sweetener but it's really what it does is that it increases it it cuts out a lot of development time it increases your presence of your recipe by like 10 times you know not even like 10 like 10 times increases the presence without having to need to go through that extreme amount of development time to replicate it without sweetener cause like you can do all of this stuff without sweetener it's just gonna take you a really long time to develop it and it's gonna you know you're gonna leave out a lot of profiles that you wouldn't otherwise be able to make as saturated so it's like a cheat code it is like a cheat code it can quickly become a crutch and that's something you have to watch out for but um you know if you want something that's very present very saturated very vivid sweetener just helps you get there without worrying about that extremely long development cycle so like some of my best work has been made without sweeteners it can be done it just you know those recipes took months to make for no real benefit other than like do you want a vape sweetener or not you know do you do you want to inhale sucralose or not that's really the that's really the uh where the contention comes into play so here's the recipe sorry also when you go sweetener it's very difficult to go back that's the other thing too so if you don't if you can vape and you're completely fine without sweetener just know when you start using sweetener it's hard to go back nothing is going to taste as saturated or as potent or i shouldn't say nothing but most recipes aren't because no one really that that mixes without sweetener takes the time to develop as if they're trying to replicate something with sweetener usually a mixer who mixes without sweetener mixes with that like they vape without sweetener they they want it less sweet they want it less present you know what i mean but there are some occasions where you know someone who can post up a recipe and it's vivid and bright and saturated without the sweetener included because they took the time to develop it that way just going back to the nicotine i would freeze the nick i think carolina extracts information is wrong i had in the freezer for five years just what i think i don't know if it's wrong i wouldn't say it's wrong it's just i think it's a i think they're being a little bit more overly cautious is what is how i read it they're basically saying like we don't know what type of freezer you're using if you're in that freeze thaw threshold a lot with your crappy home freezer then you know you could be ruining your product so they just say look there's really no detriment to putting it somewhere that maintains the same temperature obviously you don't want it in a hot environment but they were they were like you know a refrigerator is a better option because you're not getting to that freeze throt freeze thaw area so most freezers i would say probably can maintain a good freeze temperature but it really isn't about that it's really more so just oxygen heat and light you know oxygen heat and light is what's going to degrade your nicotine um not you know keeping it frozen slows that process down but ultimately if any of those attributes were added to the equation it's still going to the grade does that make sense did i say that in a way that made sense all right i use sweeter and all my mixes but i am concerned about diabetes you don't have to be uh i was in contact with someone with diabetes and they were concerned about sweetener and they said not an issue for them yeah so like going back to the nicotine that's why i'm going with this method with the wine refrigerator essentially um i don't have to worry about the freeze thaw cycle at all you know what i mean i could just pop out a bottle of nicotine let it sit and it's not going to go through a defrost it's going to just you know slightly come up to warm temperature which is only 10 20 degrees from whatever temperature i'm going to set it at and it's going to keep just as long you'll see you'll see once we put it in there you can certainly freeze it don't get me wrong you can absolutely freeze it but it does it does bring up more points of failure than not um you know i have multiple bottles that have just been sitting because i don't have room for them in my freezer that have just been sitting in my closet you know all right here we go homemade banana milk i'm very excited for this one i haven't had a banana milkshake flavor in a long long time smells good tastes a little runty on the hand okay not bad it's a little disappointing unfortunately i hate to break it to you let's read your notes here very simple profile it tastes like you put a banana and milk in a blender nothing artificial depending on how green you like your banana you can add some mb soft banana at four percent it's quite green at five percent it's mostly peel interesting testing haku vena okay thank you for your testing notes a round of applause for anyone who has their testing notes of course yeah let's just let let's sit on this person let's sit on this for a second oh slushy critique yes send in you submit your recipes man submit submit i'm roboting this is so annoying i didn't know it started to do it to my microphones okay well someone said robot alrighty then okay okay okay i have i have a few of your recipes slushie well i have like a mint chocolate chip one or something there might be another one too all right this is good this is simple that you you do say you wanted a very simple profile this is simple but it to me i'm going to be a stickler here to me it tastes as if it tastes like you just didn't the simplicity is missed in the profile your your flavorings that are are added are simple but the taste of it in my opinion the execution didn't quite work it's a it to me it tastes more like a banana cream with cream if that makes sense i'm not getting like a banana milkshake you're not really hitting that very simple profile um just because you developed it in a simple way doesn't mean it's a simple flavor right you know what i'm saying there it just kind of comes through like uh um just a bit lacking kind of like the last one a little bit lacking like the idea of simplicity shouldn't be about you making a simple recipe that the flavor itself could be simple you know yeah i apologize we're just gonna have to run through this i i'm gonna i would have to shut the whole [ __ ] thing down and restart we'll just go right through it whatever the last episode doesn't matter it won't happen again i'll just remember to reset every time i go live you do have a good base here the soft banana is a smart move three percent i think it works as well um i would like to see a little bit more of like a natural banana flavor to me there is a little bit of like a banana runt flavor like a candy banana banana cream flavor that could be worked out you know where it could be a little bit more natural maybe include some sort of like baked more baked banana flavor in there and i would really just like to see more of an emphasis on the milkshake part um i think that's where you could really let this recipe shine it just to me it's not shaky enough it's a little bit more like creamy less so milk shaky like i want something to kind of add some again like some sort of volume being included maybe a cheesecake in here for instance that that to really kind of give it some density some weight um maybe some sort of like richer cream you know all the creams that we were talking about in the cheesecake would apply here as well you know try to mess around with that to really see where you think this profile can go to meet that milkshake idea yeah i i i apologize it's pleasant you got a pleasant flavor here for sure it is pleasant i love banana i love but like my my the the flavor that got me into vaping was a banana it was epic vanilla which was a banana vanilla flavor very similar to this so there is some sort of like an underlying bias here yeah i i think we're gonna give you a three out of five a little above average here three out of five a little above average a little above average oh i see that's that explosion is probably louder than this explosion isn't it yeah see i got to change the volume on those things as well three out of five um i'm giving you a little above average mainly because i do think you have a nice sort of base layer going on like you've got a good start here but it's still kind of falling into the same trap as the other one where i just want to see a little bit more depth to it it does you don't have to make it more intricate you don't have to add more notes to it but give me something to hold on to something to bring my interest some sort of intrigue to the recipe whether that's making that milkshake super accurate that's the thing with simple profiles guys when you're doing something simple it doesn't just mean like a sim like they're simple in two ways you can make a simple recipe where it's just a couple ingredients or you can make a simple profile which is what this person which is what mpa is saying here right he wants a simple profile banana milkshake right well that doesn't mean your recipe has to also be simple okay um so like i said give me something to hold on to when you're doing something simple a simple profile you really want to sell it you really want to sell that through so strawberry you're just doing a strawberry make it the best [ __ ] shrubbery you've ever had that's what's really going to bring people to it don't just go okay this is a simple strawberry and it tastes like every other [ __ ] strawberry that we mixed up you know what i mean in this case you're on your way there but it does taste very very sort of like this is a banana cream with another cream added to it and they're not doing anything really new and you're not bringing any interest to the profile and i'm more partial to this because i do love like i said banana flavors so yeah um that's my big critique for you there you need to kind of think about where you want to take it do you want a better banana flavor do you want something to really bring that banana in or do you want to work more on like that milkshake base do you really want to make like a super accurate milkshake to bring people in that way you could try to do both um yeah that's it that's basically it so that there's my big sort of uh there's my big sort of uh lesson for the day simple when you do a simple profile not a simple recipe simple recipe is different a simple profile really try to sell it really really try to sell that thing make it the best blank that you could possibly do because it's only going to really further that idea like wow i love you know i have someone who really loves blueberry flavors like blow their mind right when you're making them a blueberry recipe or you're going down that simple route make it the best make it so vibrant or so accurate or so you know what i mean bring bring something to it bring something to it don't don't just say i'm making a simple blueberry and then you just give me flavor west blueberry because that's like okay well this is simple in the fact that like you didn't really work hard on it you know you mean you didn't really develop it you just said it's as simple because you just used one ingredient that's that that's a simple recipe that's a different story okay there's my big uh lesson for the day and it goes for both of those recipes it goes through both of those recipes the dulce de cheesecake and uh the homemade banana milkshake both are simple but they're like simple in the sense that it's like boring you know you submitted a different recipe all right from russia with love um you can send it to my email if you're not using twitch you could send through discord send it here oh just know that if you send it through twitch you're uh more likely to be on sooner i should say okay yeah we're gonna start opening them up a little bit more as it seems like i have to force you guys to send recipes all right cherry cheesecake i'm sorry cherry sprite cherry cheesecake cherry sprite cherry sprite very nice okay anywhere cherries one and a half i can't afford to pay for sending in recipes you don't have to pay you don't have to pay do you mean like the amount of watch time needed yeah i don't know maybe it's not calculating the points correctly maybe that's what's going on let's see how many points you have type in let me see how many points you have days for glory cherry extract at one and a half oh you have enough points what do you mean fizzy sherbet by vape train two percent so um the way you do it make sure you sign into your twitch name on stream elements so go to that link and make sure you're signed into your twitch name three percent lemon lime and then you do critique recipe which is a thousand points polar blast nws23 okay polar blast nws23 oh actually i don't know if i haven't i don't have any uh i don't have any we're gonna have to pretend like i use some [ __ ] i thought i totally forgot about it well let's see let's if it if if i feel like it's not good then we'll postpone this damn dude i don't have any ws23 i need to go to flavor jungle the lucy mint do i have to watch on twitch to get points yes but you can just submit through email if you want recipe straight from canada all right okay okay if you want seven up verse sprite check out this cherry up very similar to this kind of i'm waiting on a pie crust for your recipe one-on-one pie crust the one that you submitted i don't have any ws anything i have culada that's it it's okay it's whatever there's a little bit of a caveat here you know what's also really nice about soft banana it doesn't stick to your coil like other bananas you can drip on top of it and the banana goes away like like lorenz banana cream some other bananas too like like flavor art banana they do not leave your coil man all right here's cherry sprite by morency morrissey recently picked up a bunch of flavors i was really wanting a good cherry recipe i took the base from iutenti's one two three uh cranberry spring replaced the flavor cranberry with a combination of vinegar cherries and cherry extract didn't really know where to start with them so i kind of guessed this result is my cherry sprite recipe good shaking vape but after a couple days seeping it really shines doesn't have that medicinal cherry taste the cherries are definitely the forefront but the spread is there just enough in the background to give it a subtly uh fizzy lemon lime taste in the excellent i also added some polar blast at 3s23 to give it a chilled cool feel so it seems like the the coolant isn't really uh that necessary to the recipe test it on the citadel thank you for your testing notes 28 dads super fun what's that a bad bad bad that's dad here we go fantastic fantastic fantastic jello see ice that would involve me digging out my delusion i just have no i have no interest in doing so graham is such a delosie shill i need another i need a bigger shelf that's the thing i only bought a six a six six block shelf and i threw away my eight block shelf or no i threw away my uh i have a nine block shelf i threw it with my 16 block shelf which was a bad move the one that i had in my out my old office that might have been a 12 block show nonetheless i'm i'm out of blocks and i need more this tastes excellent this tastes like cherry sprite man this tastes excellent it's definitely um it's definitely like more along the lines of like a um how do you put it the pull the blast works actually really well i really i i really like it i really [ __ ] like it to me it's definitely like it keeps the vibe of sprite more than the cherry like to me like cherry sprite i don't even know if is cherry spread a thing there's a bottle here i don't know if i've ever had it but it definitely has like a sprite like a really good sprite vibe to it with like a nice sort of ride out on cherry i was a little afraid your uh cherry extract wasn't gonna bring much to the table but it seems like it does i don't know if it's really the anywhere cherries that's pulling that along every time i've used cherry extract i've been kind of not impressed by it it's kind of thin and light but i mean i'm getting a really good cherry note here but real i'm really impressed by is like that lime and lemon fizzy sherbet lemon lime and fizzy sugar i mean that's sprite that's [ __ ] sprite it's a very nice sprite flavor this is a fun vape too someone rated you three stars let's see why citadel rda uh one week light cherry comes first then astringent lemon quite thin with the predominance top notes that's interesting um might be good for your mouth something and that's interesting i actually think the opposite i actually think the opposite i think this works really well i think this works really well i don't get an astringent lemon maybe their lemon lime is bad or something or maybe too much fizzy sherbet we're gonna go 4 out of 5. [Applause] [Music] i just see my where i'm talking and then i see the red when i press that button i see the red bar just burn [Laughter] yeah vape train fizzy sherbet it's pretty [ __ ] good with the cap lemon lime really sells the sprite flavor i'm trying to give you some critiques here my critique is that i can't give you too much critiques i didn't do with the ws23 but my critique would be that when i think of like a cherry soda like that cherry is really prominent and like like it's like really a main aspect like it it's really there you know what i mean like the cherry is like all cherry this definitely seems more sprite flavored with like a nice cherry right out i don't know what cherry sprite tastes like but all the other cherry sodas i've had like that cherry is like the main thing and that's not here in this recipe to me the the winner is the sprite base and then you kind of color it in with a little bit of cherry on the finish you definitely get cherry in the top but it's i get that when you when you exhale you get that whole sort of note and that's where it really is nice but i wouldn't call this like a super like cherry recipe it's more like a cherry accent it's good though like that i like that um but that's my critique is if if uh if making this more cherried would make this closer to cherry sprite then maybe work on that maybe try to figure out a way to get a deeper cherry note in there i like wild cherry by mullenberry um who's saying uh rin is saying ssa juicy cherry yeah juicy cherry is great mainly mullenberry cherries are the best ones uh the inner cherries taste great maybe the cherry extract maybe it's not necessary maybe increase anywhere i don't know or maybe maybe i don't know maybe the cherry extract is doing a lot anytime i've used it i've not been impressed by cherry extract okay there is a little soapiness going on there is a touch of medicinal quality or chemical quality and i'm assuming that's from the fizzy sherbet every time i've mixed this up it's kind of had this weird sort of like artificial vitamin note um yeah that's definitely where it's coming from i can just smell it on there maybe that steeps out i'm not sure now it's definitely the fizzy sherbet so maybe try to work out that off note it's slightly there if you know if if you're someone with a less refined palette you might not pick it up sweetener will just cover it up anyway but i can i can pick it up you know that's something to knock points off right there um everything else is pretty good though everything else is pretty [ __ ] good good time to ask sent email chemnivatic fizzy ad or new fizzy ad version two what do you know i know i know about neither i don't know anything about fizzy ad or fizzy ad too i know nothing about them bob says indian mango liquid barns vanilla ice cream and fizzy sherbet amazing recipe just mix it without ws23 as well and it's indeed true to spite sprite beverage i like it and the cherry is there pro probably more cherry would kill the sprite yeah it's good thanks i love when you guys mix with me especially i know screwdriver you've been mixing with me a lot it's great to see when i get some sort of like outside reference to what i'm saying thank you for that um yeah that's the thing right if that's the thing that i mean that's kind of i i haven't tried a cherry sprite so i don't know but i know you know exactly what i'm talking about other cherry sodas the cherry is like such a deep part of the recipe so if you're looking for that then maybe try to figure out a better cherry a better way to add the cherry in here um you probably would kill the sprite but that's really where the the creativity or the you know the crafting would come into play try to how to how to figure out how to work that out and then i do get a touch of like that fizzy sherbet medicinal vitamin note that could be worked out overall though i think it is really nice i think it tastes great now when i look at sam's where is it i don't see it anymore where'd it go oh when i look at sam sent over his cherry sprite which kind of has the same base i can see this being a little bit more of like that deeper cherry flavor just because you're using the red cherry going a little crazy with the moscato and the sour lemon you are using a lemon lime soda instead of capella's lemon lime which might work i mean i don't see why that wouldn't work but you got the inner wear cherries with the fizzy sherbet yeah i'm curious as to i don't know about i don't know about the moscato but it seems like you're not trying to go for cherry spray well you're saying akin to 7up is a pretty finicky ingredient it's very vibrant cherry seven up is delicious cherry on top of the first sip and then it just kind of disappears that's kind of what you get with this recipe it's kind of what you get here the cherry is more of an accent the the sprite base is really where i think it and like with just the polar blast is good you know the ws-23 is just going to add a little bit more fizziness to the mix but just the polar blast works as well it cools it down and it adds a touch of fizz to it for sure that's stripping cherries with lemon lime you already know what it tastes like you already know what it tastes like mostly oh true yeah yeah yeah i forgot about that recipe yeah you could probably go cranberry you can probably go cranberry you could probably go with like a little bit of some sort of like boozy flavor if you wanted to do like a cranberry vodka sort of thing cranberry vodka soda maybe black tea tfa black tea for that vodka note i mean that's it you're the winner here morency is the winner let's give morenzy a round of applause [Applause] am 100 let's see yes he is 3 000. see once you start uh winning then you

My name is Matt and today we are ranking grandma's hard candies. We got them from a real grandma. She wasn't looking and\nwe raided her pantry and stole all of her hard candies. We did not do that. If there's a grandma out\nthere that's missing candy right now I'm sorry it wasn't us. I was just joking. (upbeat country music) Matt's gonna wrap. Not in a R-A-P way a W-R-A-P way. This is gonna get noisy in here. (wood taps) Here's how it works. So things we're looking for. Obviously taste cause it's candy. Appearance that's kind of important. You don't wanna put anything\ngross in your mouth. Also like how long does it last? It's hard candy. It should last a long time. So this Bless Your Rank is all about of course grandma's candy, but really more specifically\nthis is the kind of stuff that grandma might sneak you a piece of while you were in church. Or if you had a grandma like I did she probably would just quietly unwrap it and hand it you cause she\nknew you would manage to make that wrapper louder than the pastor. I wasn't trusted with a\nlot things as a child. But now I can just be as loud as I want to with these wrappers. How about that? Number one. The I don't know what you call these. These are just the little\nstrawberry candies. I don't think they have an official name. The get a bad rep. People like to trash\nthese strawberry things and say they're not really\ngood and they're cheap candy, but they have this like soft gush strawberry gel on the inside. It's like a bonus candy. It's like candy inception. Candy within a candy. This isn't as sweet as I\nremember it being as a kid. Also double wrapper for some reason. They just really out\nto get the environment. Taste right now like\nsome weird piece of candy that barely has any sugar in it and absolutely no\nstrawberry favor whatsoever. This is a huge let down. I remember these as a kid just like killing it with some strawberry flavor. I'm not getting any of that. I'm gone bite into it now. There's the strawberry flavor. It was hiding inside of it the whole time. Now we're finishing off pretty well. It was a really good ride. Exiting to the gift shop now. I like it. Grandma hand me one of these at church I'd probably be like\ngrandma what else you got? I think you can probably\ndo better than that. Do you have like a tootsie\npop in there somewhere. Even a dum dum that you got from the bank. They're OK. They're good once you bite into them, outside not that great. Grandma maybe keep these in your purse just in case you're craving mediocrity. Gonna put in on the doily here currently in first place. Our next competitor. Peppermints. The original hard candy. It's stuck. (wood taps) Alright there we go. These are the hard peppermints. These are not soft peppermints. Grandma wouldn't have those. You never know when she's\ngonna have her teeth in or not. These are good peppermints. Strong on the pepper mint. I mean I know what a peppermint was like, but see there's a lot of different types of peppermint out there. You don't really know what\nyou're getting sometimes. Maybe that's something that\npresidential candidates should look at becoming\npart of their platform is that you correctly label peppermints. Is it soft or hard peppermints\nto avoid confusion. If you agree with me, then you use the hashtag\nregulate peppermint industry now. This is a traditional peppermint. This is what you think of\ngetting is a hard peppermint. It's really good. It tastes like a candy\ncane which is exactly what a peppermint should be. This is more like a paw paw\nwould have these in his pocket though I think. Beware though. They may come from his last trip he took to Sonic Drive In in 1997. Alright so I'm looking at taste. Peppermint was good all the way through. Appearance? I mean what do you not love\nabout the strawberry thing? I'm a take a gamble and I'm\ngonna go for the strawberry cause I know what the potential is then. The potential is very high. Peppermint's a good\nstandby, it's a classic, it will never let you down,\nyou know what you're getting. But I know that we can do better. Contestant number three is oh no. This is black liquorice. What are y'all trying to do to me? Don't make me do this. (groans) I've got news for you. If this is your grandma's hard candy, you're grandma is the devil. I'm sorry. This isn't even candy. Isn't like, legit liquorice, like a root that you found in the dirt? Candy is not from the dirt. Candy comes from heaven\nor the Wonka factory. Aw man. Can we just fake it? Like mmm but not very good. Blah blah blah last place. Ew. This is what I imagine like taking a bite out of a dog turd is like. So many flavors and none of them are good. It's like it's punching me in the throat. Like karate kicking me to death. It's like it's effecting\nthe way I breathe. Like I can taste it in my breath now. (groans) I have absolutely nothing\ngood to say about this. This is a waste of space. I'm sure it came in a wrapper\nand it's a waste of that. This is terrible. If you are in church you're\nlike grandma what do you got, you got any candy, and she hands you a\nhandful of black liquorice go to the alter immediately\nand pray for grandma's soul cause it's gone. Where do I wanna rate this? This is without a doubt the worst thing that I'll have today. Not just today but ever,\never, on Bless Your Rank. Dead last. Contestant number four\nis cinnamon hard candies. Of course obviously cause you can read it right here on the wrapper. So to our three fans in Japan, and I'm probably off by\nthree meaning we have none, there you go. This is a little tribute to you with the cinnamon hard candies. My least favorite chewing gum is Big Red and this is I imagine is\ngonna be right up that alley. That's not candy. That's not fun. I like spicy things. Hot food, spicy food, I love cajun food when\nit's like super spicy, but I don't want my candy like that. There's a line. For the love of me I can't\neven open this wrapper! Alright so much for that. It's like a peppermint that's\njust gone just all red. This is a communist peppermint. That's not overwhelmingly cinnamony. It's not bad. I'm kind of a fan. Lot's of flavors. It's getting a little\nspicy, coming back down, getting a little spicy, coming back down. (upbeat music) Not as much cinnamon as like Big Red Gum. This is not bad. Whoa! Can't talk a lot with it in your mouth. You got a grandma that\nhands you these in church you got a spicy grandma. That was grandma that had\na little bit too much fun at the bingo hall on Saturday night and she's in church Sunday morning kinda nursing a hangover\nand is also like here and she will hand you one of these after she accidentally\nhanded you one of her pills. Where do they rank? They're still not better\nthan strawberry candies and I don't think that\nthey're really better than peppermints either so I'm\ngonna go ahead and just say third place cause as I've said before nothing is worse than black liquorice. Contestant number five. Werther's Originals. I love these. Maybe I'm a grandma. I don't know. They are delicious and\nthis is something that I definitely had at my\ngreat grandparents house. I feel like there was an old man at church when I was at church that had these too. I may have just been imagining things. Mr. Werther, can I have\none of your originals? And then he's like yes you can son and he pulls out like a handful of them. Take as many as you want. Thanks Mr. Werther. Here we go. (laughs) A little difficult to get\nout the wrapper there. This taste like grandma\nand grandpa's house. Like distant banjo going\non, you hear birds chirping, and you're just kinda\nrocking back and forth. That's what this tastes like right now. It's like a caramely cream. These are so good. This is gold standard. Pun intended. I mean this is like if you ask\ngrandma for a piece of candy and she pulls out one of these originals, your grandma has a good\ntaste in candy number one, number two grandma just got\nher social security check so she's affording the good candy, and three just grandma loves you. That's what that means. This is as good as grandma\nhard candy gets maybe. I don't know. There's more to rank so we'll see. This is so much better\nthan strawberry candy. It's not even close. Contestant number six. Oh Tootsie Rolls! Cotton candy, sweeties, go. Let me see the Tootsie Rolls. Fun fact about Tootsie Rolls. They haven't made any sine 1978, but I believe there might be\nsomething to the fact that grandmas are given a certain\namount of Tootsie Rolls and they can't go on to heaven until they've handed out all the Tootsie Rolls. Here we go. Now that looks like chocolate. That looks like a hunk\nof chocolate right there. This is good candy and\nthis is candy's evil twin. Grandma hands you one of these at church grandma's playing a prank on you. You're definitely gone get\nthis stuck all in your teeth. This is my teeth isn't it? I feel like it's in my teeth. I'm quite the butter finger. (laughs) Holy crap! Do you ever finish chewing this? I love Tootsie Roll but this\nis not good for my teeth. In conclusion, Tootsie Rolls are delicious but they are really going\nto mess up your smile in a heartbeat. Also why are there so many of them? We as humans are outnumbered\non Earth right now three to one by Tootsie Rolls. Contestant number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. It is unmarked yellow candy. What are these? - [Producer] Butterscotch. - Butterscotch candies. I don't know what to expect with these. I don't even know what they look like. If I saw a bowl of these sitting out, I would think that's like\na medicine for a dog. They spend all their money\non protective packaging for this candy and not the candy at all. Yeah this is like a\nyellow peppermint kind of. I like this. And there goes the flavor. Didn't last long. Short little visit. Yeah this was like at first I\nthought this was pretty good, but I could do with\nnever having one again. This is like showing a red pill blue pill. Like you don't know if you want the red candy or yellow candy. Both will be very mediocre. At first little bit I was\nlike it's not terrible. I kinda like it. And then it's like it's\ndoing nothing for me anymore. It's like a terrible relationship. It was really fun at the start and now it's just like it's a chore. I don't see these definitely not better that Werther's Originals, not\nbetter than the strawberries, I am gonna say that they're\nbetter than the Tootsie Rolls. I'm gonna say that currently\nthese are in fourth place. Let's move the devil's candy down and then make some room here for unnamed butterscotch candies. Our final competitor\ncontestant number eight is Andes Mints. This is the chocolate and the mint. This is like a mint sandwich\nwith chocolate and then mint and more chocolate. I love the smell, I love\neverything about these. These are so good. Here we go. Aw man. These are a treat. I don't ever have these. Can you buy these? Granny stole some of the Andes Mints from the Olive Garden again. That's exactly what she did. Man these are good and these are all mine. I got a whole bowl of them now. I've never had this happen in my life. I don't know where these come from. Can you get these at Wal Mart? I'm a have another. I'm a do it. I'm a do it. It's the last one of the day. I'm a do it. Shout out to the Andes wherever that is. If you are a place, if you\nwere just a guy named Andy, I don't know, but keep\nup the good work Andy. And if you're grandma hands out these, congratulations you've got the greatest grandma in the world. (sighs) This is one of the\nclosest Bless Your Ranks I think that we've ever\nhad and I'm trying to think of all of them right now. And this could almost be a tie, but we don't do ties on Bless Your Rank because ties are for little\nleague sports and communists. This is America. This is Bless Your Rank\nand Werther's Originals is the best of grandma's hard candies. It's the best of grandma's hard candies and it's one of the best\nhard candies period. Like name a better hard candy. I'm to just go ahead and take\nall of these with me here. \u266a Werther's Originals is a taste of home \u266a \u266a Grandma and grandpa's house \u266a \u266a Something that rhymes with home \u266a Don't tell grandma.

She might share if you ask nicely.", "uep6FKZWRsY": "they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty much everyone enjoy sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections their gourmet candies custom-made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite-sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the ride into pieces almost 2 feet long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an al I know a V Andy oh why oh and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering is in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the wrong candy comes off the cooling table is transparent to make it opaque or light in the color they'll pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand it's your new sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops if you have any comments about the show or if you'd like to suggest topics for future shows drop us a line at Science Channel com /how it's made", "s6wv6AtOTbo": "Hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in\npublic displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida Greg is doing the narration and Jake is doing the subtitles. The candy I'm going to be making today is  sugar free Sour cherry. As I pour the hot candy onto the table let me tell you how unbelievably hot it is. This is hotter than sugar by 25 degrees F (4C). It does not seem like a lot , but ti is. \n The candy is been flavored with a natural cherry oil. Unlike most cherry candy, this does not taste like cough syrup. Also it is a great flavor for masking the flavor of the sugar free part of  the candy. I thought there would be two parts of The flavor to cover.The front of mouth taste, and that I covered with the cherry oil Then the back of mount flavor I thought I could cover mostly with a good sour. To do that I added this citric acid. It's trickier to add acid to isomalt because everything is hotter. And this citric acid while harder to add  gives this candy a crisp sour tart flavor just like you'd\nexpect from a sour cherry. Sour Cherry isan American tradition it's the most common cherry here in North America and it's known for being made into\ncherry pies and things like that but its history is ancient it was first discovered by Roman soldiers when they were on duty near the Black Sea. They  found this cherry\ngrowing in towns along the Black Sea and they brought it back\nto Rome and eventually the cherry was called the Montmorency cherry. It was  named\nafter a region of France even though it didn't come from that region in France. It was just the flavor I was going for and I'm happy how it came out. This candy is sugar-free, and as such it's not made of sugar it's\nmade of isomalt. Isomalt is a substitute a type of sugar alcohol and is a sugar substitue used primarily for its sugar like properties it has little or no impact on\nblood sugar levels and it does not stimulate the release of insulin so\npeople who aren't supposed to eat high levels of sugar this candy is good for\nisomalt is also about 1/2 the sweetness of sugar so to tweak the sweetness up a\nbit to match what we expect a hard candy to taste like we had a little bit of\nsucralose and we don't need to add much sucralose because sucralose is between\n300 and 1000 times as sweet as sugar. Since I only needed a tiny amount I used a very accurate scientific scale to get the proportions rights. So we build on the sweetness of the isomalt with the sucralose and we count on the isomalt to behave like what you expect hard candy to behave like. Neither of these mate rials promote tooth decay or effects insulin levels. I heard from so many of you that you wanted to try our candy by could not. iI's a little different to work\nwith than regular sugar it's a lot hotter when I pour it and it also sort\nof behaves more like plastic than clay so I have to get the temperature just\nright now that it's adjusted we're gonna cut off pieces and we're gonna feed it\nthrough our drop roller this little machine was made in the late 1870s and\nthis particular machine was owned by the A Cincinnati candy company. Greg\nwas able to acquire this piece of equipment because of a Kickstarter\ncampaign we did and you our fans allowed us to get it.  I want to thank all of you\nfor the support you've given us over the years this has been an amazing to get to do what we love, and have a lot of fun.

"DxVx5My-Zkc": "hey guys welcome to taste of love i'm marine and today we are making jolly rancher candy grapes so before we get started go ahead and give this video a thumbs up click on the subscribe button and turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time a new video drops so let's go ahead and get started okay so here we have our supplies we have our cairo syrup white food coloring blue food coloring toothpicks jolly rancher grapes and a one cup measuring cup so before we get started we're going to prep our grapes our grapes have already been washed and dried they would drive using a paper towel and now we're going to insert the toothpicks into our grapes so that we can dip them in the candy now when it comes to dipping the toothpicks when it comes to putting the toothpicks into the grapes you can't put it where you remove the grape from the stem on this side you put it on the opposite side on the bottom so you run the toothpick through the bottom of the grate so that when you shake it and you dip it it won't fall off so we're going to insert our toothpicks into all of our grapes make sure you go through your bag of grapes really carefully because a lot of the time some of the grapes are rotten and they're deforming so you don't want to dip those grapes into candy so we're going to stick them all and then you want to put the toothpick not just a little bit in so that when you go like that it'll fall off but more all the way in so when you shake it because you would have to shake off that excess candy it wouldn't fall off [Music] and then you put it all the way in so that it's sturdy so that it really holds onto the grate you can use any other food color that you want also i'm using blue because i wanted mine to be blue and i'm going to flavor it with the blue jolly rancher candies also [Applause] but i'm going to show you guys that in one second so you also need your thermometer and a deep size pot because sometimes your candy batter does bubble up for this recipe we're doing the four one one method so we're using four cups of sugar 1 cup of carrot syrup and 1 cup of water now if you do put your toothpick all the way through and it comes through the top it doesn't matter because when you slip it out after you dip it in candy it'll still come easily out [Music] [Applause] okay so right now we're going to add our ingredients to the pot to make our candy batter so we're gonna add four cups of sugar [Music] one cup of water [Music] and our cairo syrup [Music] now i'm going to add a few drops of white food coloring [Music] and i'm also going to add the blue and just two drops of the blue now i'm going to start my stove and turn it up to 7.5 so that my candy batter can cook and we're going to leave our candy batter to cook until it gets to 300 degrees okay you see the the colors is getting all mixed up on its own this is why i don't mix it because i like when it gets mixed from cooking it gets a more even mixture then if you try to mix it up but that's just what i like so this is why i didn't mix it when i put the colors in [Music] [Music] all right our candy has finished cooking it's gotten to 300 degrees look at how pretty that blue is so we're gonna take our pot off of the hot stove and then we're gonna get ready to dip our grapes okay so i have my pot angled to the side it's leaning on the stove just so that the angle would be i guess kind of able to tilt all my batter down so that i can get it and what i have here is my food processor which i'm going to crush up my jolly ranchers with so i'm just going to drop some of the jolly ranchers into my food processor and crush them up real quick and the reason i wait for my candy to be done cooking while i do this is because i don't want my um my candy to my well not my candy not my candy batter but the jolly rancher candies to get sticky and stick together and then it's hard to use so i'm just going to drop them in here really quick and blend it up so i'm opening my blue candy first because what i'm going to do is take this blue candy and drop it into my candy batter so that it'll flavor it i'm just putting two of them in here the candy is hot [Music] so it will melt it [Music] so now i'm going to drop my jolly ranchers in here really quickly so we could just crush them up if you don't have a food processor you can put them in three ziploc bags i will triple bag it and then use a rolling pin and crush it [Music] that method has worked for me personally for a little while before i started putting it in the fruit processor the food processor just makes it more fine and more dusted than really chunky and i like it finer than more chunkier because if you ever ate candy grapes you know that when you put it in your matcha bite into it if it's really chunky it can like scratch the top of your mouth and it's really painful so i'm just putting all my candy in here [Music] and i don't really need a lot because we only did a little bit of grapes [Music] okay so i have all the jolly ranchers that i want in here now i am going to turn it on so we can crush these up [Music] there we go nice and fine now i'm going to take them and pour them out into a little bowl so that we can go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy mixture and add jolly ranchers to move this inside nice and crushed so now we're going to go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy okay so here's my grape i'm going to dip it into my candy shake it off and roll it into my genre and there we go that's how it's going to look here now let's dip all of them shake it off you don't want to exist and also i use a spoon to keep the jolly rancher constantly mixed you can use a fork so it doesn't really matter because if you let your jolly rancher sit still it will start pumping up and get hard [Music] and i would suggest putting them in the refrigerator immediately after dipping [Music] i do suggest putting your candy grapes in the refrigerator immediately after dipping because it does get sticky and it starts melting almost immediately candy grapes is one of the fruits that will melt really really fast like really really fast from the minute you dip the grapes into the candy it starts to melt because grapes are a water-based fruit so they don't last very long you can put your grapes in the freezer after you dip them to try to lengthen how long they last but it does not lengthen it by much maybe by just a couple hours and putting it in the freezer would not change the taste it would still have the same great taste so we're going to go ahead and keep dipping and then add the jolly ranchers too [Music] look at how pretty that color is now the reason we add white food coloring is so that the color does not become transparent if you don't add white food coloring to your candy your candy will be transparent meaning that you can see right through and you can see your fruit like if you guys remember in the candy tangerine video we didn't use any color so the candy was clear your candy will be clear with like a light color if you don't put the white food coloring in the white food coloring is what gives it the background basically so that your grapes can turn into a different color so they won't be like you know green with a light blue look and i've tried dipping red grapes however red grapes are really really really sweet so they're not as tasty as using green grapes i think it's more delicious with the green grapes because the sweetness weighs out with the sour to give it a nice taste but with the red grapes it's just overly sour and i mean overly sweet i apologize it's just overly sweet so it's not really [Music] that good because to me too much sweet just takes all the flavor away from it [Music] i was about to dip it in the jolly rancher without putting it in the candy bag [Music] and you see how good our toothpick comes in handy um you can use skewers if you want to um i think the skewers are too long personally i don't like using screwers that's why i choose the toothpick method but there's like a different way for everything and i tell you guys this all the time i teach you guys what works for me i like showing you guys what i like to do there's always a different way for everything i just show you my way and what works for me because you can do it and say oh i don't like her way of doing this i like this way better and that is perfectly fine because there's always a million different ways to do stuff [Music] so my jolly ranchers are almost finished i'm just going to [Music] start using my spoon so i can pick up if you wanted to add a flavor to your candy also you can use the lorraine's flavor oil and you can add that instead of adding the jolly rancher like i did i wanted my jolly rancher flavor since we're using jolly ranchers and their decorations [Music] i'm running out of space [Music] let's just give them a flat bottom instead of a flat back and then you have to dip these real fast also because depending on the temperature of your house the candy batter will start to harden really fast because these are hard crack candy that's why we get it to 300 degrees 300 degrees is the point of hard crack [Music] it's how a lollipop would be you can use the same batter to make lollipops also and of course if you guys try this and i would love to see what you guys did so take a picture and tag me on instagram my instagram is in the description if you guys make these you had problems with them it was easy um whatever happened just let me know leave me a comment let me know if you liked it if it was delicious just let me know how it turned out i would love to hear from you guys [Music] and you see that the jolly rancher candy is already [Music] [Music] the whole time [Music] okay so we're almost done [Music] then i'm going to show you guys how to easily slip your toothpicks off and get ready to serve them eat them enjoy them put them in the refrigerator um if you're saving them for later later like you don't want to eat them right right now put them in the freezer so that they don't start breaking down as fast because they do break down very very quickly very very quickly like i believe candy grapes only last i think a maximum of about two to three hours depending on how you make them depending on the time of the year um to me i find that they last longer in the time because it's colder depending on how hot you keep your house also um in the summertime if you have them outside they will almost melt immediately and the same thing goes for your candy apples also they melt really quickly i'm gonna sprinkle it some of my candy is still on wet most of it has already dry and hardened it gets hard almost immediately after dipping them they dry really really quickly okay we're down to our last three grapes so now we're going to get ready to start pulling off our toothpicks from our grapes and separating it last two roll it in my jolly rancher last one i'm gonna cover it in our jolly rancher there we go [Music] all right so there we go now we're going to slide them off of our [Music] toothpicks and i'm going to put them [Music] and you can tell that the candy is hard when you squeeze it it doesn't get soft or squishy [Music] and that's how it looks when you like into it [Music] it's really crunchy and there we go

super sorry I've been cheating and making Facebook live videos instead of making videos for you guys but it's so much easier I don't have to edit anything not that I do anyway um and I can just post a live no worries no mess no fuss but unfortunately I'm not popular enough on YouTube to make live videos you need like a thousand followers I'm only at 119 so it is what it is but as always we are going to start our candy making adventure off with a nice good hit of marijuana from altitude organic on North Academy Boulevard in Colorado Springs Colorado check them out oh yeah that's the stuff alright so today I know I already have a herd candy making video shut up battery I'm trying to make sour hard candy today a couple months ago I made some amazing amazing sour mango hard candy I've given it to people all over town everyone loved it they were like I want more a lot more well my foolishness is showing cuz I didn't write down the recipe it was an experiment and it just turned out amazing I've tried like four times to replicate this recipe it has not worked so I'm trying again today but we're not gonna do mango we're gonna do strawberry and watermelon and what I'm going for is for a sour profile if any of you are old enough to remember Altoid sours that came in this wonderful - round tin they actually the sour mango that's our tangerine and I'm not sure I think the lemon was the other flavor they've been discontinued for years they were the perfect amount of sour and the sours stuck with you it wasn't just like I hit a sour on the outside it was all the way through so I'm going to do my best to replicate something to that level of sour because those were delicious and I don't know a single person who was familiar with them that would not love to have them back so if I can make them awesome alright let me show you what I got for ingredients first we have 400 grams of sugar or 2 cups that you prefer to use cups which is foolish you should always wait things I also have about 3/4 of a cup water if you add too much it's totally ok you just can't add too little the water will evaporate off so I like to add the water next because it kind of makes a little easier with the next step yeah I just poured in the corn syrup which is why you want to put the water in first if you put corn syrup on sugar it gets very viscous and it's very hard to stir so the water kind of helps break it up but this is 2/3 cup corn syrup or if you want to be awesome and weigh things 213 grams it is so much easier to weigh your corn syrup if you know it everything weighs it's so much easier if you ever try to get corn syrup out of a cup or a bowl oh my god you end up wasting so much and I know there's ways to like grease it and it's just a waste of time just weigh everything or use the measurements that I've given you and I've already done all the hard work here we go 1 cup flour under 20 grams 1 cup sugar to anagrams etc etc etc etc etc these have all been tried and true I have taken legit measuring cups not crap ones and done the work if someone wants to copy this it will save you so much time here are the next ingredients I have some generic flavors you know Loraine oils sorry Loraine nothing against you but there are better options out there I got watermelon I've got some amazing chef rubber confectionary candy color I love chef rubber they are the best prize so much more above the rest there's my song for you guys um go check out chef rubber chef river com they have everything you'll ever need I talk about them shamelessly in every I'm not saying this because they're paying me I'm not saying this because I'm getting anything out of it seriously nothing out of it I just love this company it's amazeballs and you will love it too so go check them out we also have some Lorraine oil tart and sour tart and sour is a liquid acid that has citric acid and malic acid and then over here I made my own liquid citric acid I just mix some warm water with some powdered citric acid it is tart oh my lord I tried it and about Burma tongue off so different a chicken the difference between citric acid and malic acid from my understanding citric acid the road sever Malik's a little bit more sir but citric acid is used mm-hmm on top of candies like favor head sour straws or sour belts that's citric acid on top if you were to put malic acid on top oh my god you burned a hole right through your Facebook it'd be so bad so the the malic acid unlike the citric acid sticks around citric acids great but it's only good for a short burst it doesn't linger through the candy but the malic acid does so that's why I'm using tart and sour and my own mixture of citric acid watery stuff so basically I've got those three ingredients water sugar corn syrup in the pan I'm gonna turn that up to seven on my oven because I have numbers don't know the time sorry I could use my little thermometer to like read with my digital dot and be like here's the tip maybe I'll do that for you we'll see but unless you're using uh what are those things called an induction burner I don't see why it'd be helpful anyway if we're gonna heat them up and we're gonna get them to 295 degrees so let me start that process okay so we're just gonna start stirring this and as you can see it's pretty thick it's got like gloppy gloopy spots and it would be so much worse if there weren't water in there first and I'm sorry about the background noise I can't make candy and record videos with no sound in the background by myself really boring so I'm watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 go Harry Potter no we don't own the rights no I'm not selling anything no one's paying me to watch this it's just amazing background noise please don't sue me Warner Brothers just realized what I was going through the other ingredients that weren't sugar corn syrup and water I didn't give you any measurements I'm sorry I'm not stoned enough okay so chef Robert color oh my gosh she literally just need two drops two drops and it's supersaturated it'll work if you want it to look as pink as the stuff on this bottle add three drops it'll happen okay so three drops of that we're gonna use this whole DRAM a DRAM is such a weird measurements of liquid I think it's super old we just kept it but this DRAM flavor I'd normally use more but we're experimenting so we want to see if one DRAM have to actually flavor candy well enough um and as far as the tart and sour in the citric acid this is my version of a tablespoon it's pretty close to a tablespoon might be slightly larger than a tablespoon but I'm gonna do a tablespoon of each of the tart and sour and the citric acid so there's so much okay so the candy is boiling it actually started boiling while I was cleaning my machine uh-huh pay attention to your candy people don't let it boil without stirring it I'm lucky it didn't burn so this is gonna be like this for about 20 minutes we also have some other equipment we're gonna use we've got our digital probe thermometer we've talked about probe tips people get yourself one I'm not gonna say why you're not gonna mention how bad the other thermometers are just get yourself a probe tip the router over here we've got our Thomas Mills awesome Victorian candy roller here so fun I need to give it a little oily though we also have a marble pastry board and two stainless steel scrapers that's not all you're gonna need let's get to it oh trying something new um huh I think it's a joke but I'm gonna try it anyway these are essentially lotion gloves they're cotton gloves and if you put them on underneath a pair of blue nitro latex whatever loves it's supposed to defuse the heat and make it not so hot when you're mr. hot candy but I think this is going to be fully uh works works I'll be super stoked but yeah so I was ahh because the gloves underneath are for baby hands and I have large hands hmm they're only like up to here they're slipping sliding alright we're up to 265 degrees maybe to 95 so we probably have another 5 7 minutes to go I forgot to show you another piece of equipment darn it here you go this is an old-school boiler King hot plate thing and I had a Silpat over it this stage really was a little diffusing um it stays really hot and I put the hard candy on it to stay pliable while I am working in running it through the machine let's start this video now or you're not gonna get to see what I'm doing so pardon the fact that I'm not in a frame right now I'm still here with you have an abandon you I think that we're past 295 oh okay so I have all of my flavouring color citric acid all that good stuff in this bowl we're gonna dump it out and get all of it because it's precious and we're gonna stir it's gonna steam whoa it's gonna steam it's gonna keep steaming you're gonna keep with smells like water none we're gonna keep stirring until the steam goes away bye bye steam we don't want these days just add so I think it's all gone now and I'm going to pour this you're not gonna be able to see crap that better yeah I'm gonna pour this on to this surface here sorry you're a little out of frame but trimester on the Moulton candy and being the maker the filmer and everything it's not easy people it's not easy I'd rather not burn myself and sacrifice my body for a perfect shot I'm not one of those youtubers all right that's enough right put this in the sink what's that right you have our scrapers but I instantly start moving this around we don't want it I saw a dark spot I look nothing burns Oh that'd be bad let me close this so there's a better that's not better at all why so foggy in here all right now I did put more liquid in it that I normally do so there's a chance that this could be a little sticky I hope not I don't want to be sticky wants to be perfect and I cooked Italy longer than normal so maybe maybe that won't happen but we just continue to move it about until it's a little less liquid because I can't do much with it let's see if I can get a drizzle yeah I got one but you couldn't see it because oh there we go alright getting close to where it's getting sticky damn it I think this is gonna be a little sticky I'm gonna have to pull Andy pulling we can't be erase it and makes it more brittle we're just gonna cut whoa Wow that's stick into the glue that's not good all right cut this damn it off of my scraper get in my belly actually I need you to get on the warmer so get the hell off my scraper oh the hot mess okay this is why we're doing experiments all right we got the little ball we're gonna go put it on the warmer you stay on the water bowl as I fling pieces of hard candy everywhere oh my god oh my god this is so sticky look at it it's sticking my gloves this is bad you guys this what okay so the only good part about this oh my god is that ah the gloves do defuse the heat a little bit maybe you just need a new clothes let me get a new gloves news what might help maybe it was just a sticky spot all right we're gonna pull this yeah you know what these gloves really do work I am amazed because I mean don't stick to the glass all right and as you can see it's getting lighter with every pull I only put a couple drops of camp candy only put a couple drops the chef burger color in this one I didn't want it to be super pink okay this is watermelon and I'm gonna be making a strawberry I wanted the strawberry to be brighter more vivid and more red so you could tell the difference between the two I'm just gonna keep pulling this because I'm really enjoying it normally you can't pull candy this long burns a on my hands yeah yeah doctor friend I need to find a good position just put the camera so you guys can see the magic of it going through the machine Oh God this is pretty such a light pearly light pink at this point I've never been able to pull it this long alright I think it's getting firmer I need to stop pulling it and run it through the machine so let's move you to here I guess that's the best I can get for that and we're actually gonna cut this in half this is quite a large piece my foot all right beautiful while those are so pro lesson because of all the air that got pulled in there so pretty alright here's the second piece and this smells amazing I truly hope that I've gotten some kind of really sour candy honestly those right there are so pink they look like sobs has anyone had Zots I love them they're amazing though look at this fun mess normally you can hold yourself hand it over itself and over the candy and it'll come on it won't stick to itself but since I have such a wonderfully sticky recipe right now this is failing miserably Wow this sucks balls all right come on maybe if I just work it for a long time it'll do that yeah nope get off of there okay all right it's getting getting more cooperative now that was just a pain I guess with the sour candy I'm just gonna have to deal with the fact that there's huh but there's more liquid in it so it's gonna be stickier which sucks I don't want stick gonna go stop sticking with us cool boom boom stick I mean not trust I mean they pull right now no I'm kidding all right I actually really like these clothes I knocked the out of them before I even tried him and I apologize either amazing never what I thought lotion gloves would have made a difference they're just cotton and they're not even like we will get me some heat now oh okay right when I started to talk good about you I'll just start burning my skin oh yeah oh okay like I said no you won't listen to me okay all right I think it's getting less sticky and more firm so I need that what I need to cut this in half and roll this loverly piece let's see I kind of have a test to see if yeah it's good there we go there's another one then the last piece stick to the stuff that I'm sweating sweating a lot it's cold outside but for whatever reason I don't know why maybe it's better holding 300 degree candy I'm just all of a sudden really hot oh okay last one all right well flip you round whoo no there we go and if you look closely they say Madi on one side and boy on the other so I did it at the right time because you can't actually see the letters if it's too warm they kind of like room you can't really make them out so we have four pieces of what looked like really weird pink corn and I'm gonna pause so that I can get the next batch ready okay well I was lying the heat transfer was still very real look at my hands they're really red really warm so warm that but you know what it's worth it I love making candy oh Todd um and yeah I was gonna say something there was a reason I turned on the camera and I wasn't just to show you my hands oh excuse me I didn't drink kombucha that stuff was like like that but foamy uh-huh anyways um I uh I need to taste this before I make another batch of the same exact measurements I can't just like duplicate it and hope it worked out perfectly to know it does have quite a bit I'm just kidding um yeah so I don't know it's not cools and we're gonna taste it together I'm gonna feed you someone with a Karen you're gonna that's delicious at least I hope that's what you'll say so we'll be back here shortly okay I'm back sorry I had to login to this math class I'm taking online but doesn't have a great bandwidth or anything and it let's just not get started on that it's crap um here comes the fun part of the candy making not just the tasting but the breaking so there every time I do this since I don't have a backing on my table I end up getting candy all over the floor so I'm gonna try my hardest not to break candy all over the floor and I'm gonna hold this for you Wow I am breaking it so here we turn you around you pick this up and that wasn't very satisfying I'm scared there we go let's break another one they got to do it from high from up high but I just I don't want to break it all over my counter how about this there we go that was pretty good so you can just throw them around like that or you can  there goes the piece on the floor and another piece over there uh I need some a table with some something some edges so we're gonna break a couple of these alright and I'm gonna mmm-hmm excuse me I'm gonna try one I like to try pieces that are broken so that if I they turn out good and I want to sell them another I sell any candy no one's letting anything renew I can use those so here we go super pulled super extra sour stuff it is a little tacky to the touch which is not good but let's see okay whew not good that's right I'm trying to bite into it see her sour on the inside sorry here we go I think you're trying to phase a smidge but I'm a really big sour fan so how do you think it's not like warhead levels me isn't super sour but I tell you this was a good good recipe there take any spirit out to taste bad I tasted delicious I'm trying not to eat a lot of candy that game like 10 pounds do this quarantine crap so don't take it the wrong way I love my candy it was delicious so here's a nice pile of it I need to break the rest of it up and put it in packages Oh someone's calling

it's jay again and i wanted to really uh talk briefly today on blood oranges um so blood oranges are one of my absolutely favorite oranges and in fact it's probably one of my one of my favorite all-time citrus and if you're interested in growing uh raspberries here in arizona or in the heat well they just don't do that well in the heat but what does do really well is the blood oranges of course because they're in the they're in the citrus family and this is going to sort of fill in your area of the raspberries because raspberries just do not do well here with the heat like blackberries do so it is march it is the end of march getting into april and i'm always asked like why aren't people's blood oranges bloody or or dark red and really the key to this is just waiting to get through the cold so blood oranges are going to put on their dark color their deep dark purples and reds in during winter so a lot of people pick these early they think that they're ready you know in november and december in january and they start picking these but the longer you let these go through the winter the redder they're gonna get the bloodier they are going to get now this happens to be a sanguinelli blood orange and it's been left on the tree quite a bit longer than normal so it is actually kind of taking on the color of a moro blood orange which would be a totally dark red like this the sanguinellis in fact are have a little bit of orange mixed in with the red but even them if you leave them long enough they're going to turn entirely dark red like the last few oranges that are on this tree the ones that i picked a little bit earlier in the year maybe you know a month ago or two months ago those did in fact have a lot of their orange left in it but i tell you what guys there is nothing as good as as citrus and if you can grow citrus in arizona so successfully without so much trouble why not do that so yeah these are blood oranges these are sanguine ellies even though they look like morose and i've got tarakos and of course lots of morrows here on the property also it's one of my favorite absolute favorite citrus but man just wonderful wonderful fruit let me see if i can get down here i'm going to set down one of these okay and then we'll do the old uh i'd like to do the old juice test right guys oh man look at that oh man you guys i bet your mouth's just watering right now look at that beautiful juice that comes off of this all right so yeah once again definitely grow your citrus grow some cool varieties i grow a lot of varieties over here and i also carry a lot of varieties a lot of these weirder cooler things all right guys thank you for watching", "NE10Y6yMAR4": "[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] bye [Music] now [Music] do [Music] now

flavorings Apple we're gonna do green apple orange we have to combine yellow and red food coloring strawberry some red grape we're gonna mix blue and red and raspberry we're gonna do blue raspberry hopefully it won't turn out super red because the raspberry flavoring is red that's the same part ruby homes yeah Eric got these what's a van you like our van you like measuring tools and a candy thermometer because that's something you need to make candy you know she said so basically just pay any a stepstool eun-seo a stance on a step stool so she it looks like she's the same height as her

one of these let's just turn the heat on it's really okay it is very hard yeah it's really hard to pour but instead of showing me pouring it terribly you can see Eric haha as an Eric's I'm just so bad at it and we have to let them cool for 45 minutes like maybe you have like three hearts if you're halfway through games you were sitting in there's like five types of rubies there's like a lot actually there's all the rubies like the the most rubies ever been in any game is like green for one blue for five yellow for Tampa right for 20 purple for 50 which is another making orange for a hundred or two hundred depending on the game you're playing and then they're silver yeah for like yeah this one's really good yes yeah this is what they all look like definitely moment of truth they're probably gonna do like a jump cut to like red yeah have a clip then you can just clip into the side of the ground of the thing yeah but these are our pots are not tall enough so I'm just having to hold it and my arms are getting tired so I thought hey what about those who do think probably isn't safe they look cool they're kind of sticky yeah they're really sticky tastes good and our candy bar maker pretty well now we know how to make candy which we did not know the green the grapes got a really good flavor yeah I like strawberries oh yeah about the fact that we've learned while

little bit different how about some old-fashioned hard candy not only made the old-fashioned way but with chili peppers hey guys how's it going to spill more back again with another hot and spicy product to review for you guys know today I have something a little bit different just like I said in the intro I have some old-fashioned hard candy made the old-fashioned way and made with chili peppers these were sent to me I've got three of them to review today these were sent to me from the chess pros handmade confections I believe I'm seeing that right chess Bros handmade confections are located I'm not too far up the road from where I live in Thomasville North Carolina let me go ahead and read what it says on their website it says we trace our candy making routes all the way back to the Davis candy company located in 1910 in Springfield Missouri the business has changed hands and names several times over the years but one thing remains constant our commitment to making quality products for our customers I thought this was really cool it says we still use most of the original candy making equipment today copper pots gas stoves wooden paddles and vintage turn-of-the-century candy making equipment you can taste the difference that quality makes now you can check them out at chess bros confections dot-com I'll put that link down in the description and they've got a fantastic website guys they not only have these old-fashioned hot candies I'll be reviewing they're three spicy ones they've got other flavors as well they've got soft candies they've got Brittles which look amazing fudge dip mixes desert mixes snack mixes gift items they've got fruit slices just a some awesome looking products so let's go ahead and get into these guys this one's the first one I'm not gonna sit here and eat these for you here on this video review but I've tried them several times they're mango habanero just look at that these come in four and a half ounce size packs but very large pieces of hard candy probably at least thirty in here this has a very very delicious mango habanero flavor it's the mildest of the three not much heat from this one at all but a really nice delicious fruity mango type flavors what you're getting from from this one I think this would be for everybody it's really not that spicy I'd probably put the heat on my one to ten scale at about a 1 out of 10 but very very delicious so this is their mango habanero if you like that combination if you especially if you love mango and fruit and you love hard candies I definitely recommend this one now this one is delicious guys this is moving up in the heat department a little bit this is their whoops their orange ghost chili hot candy look at that dragon on there and now this has a nice sweet and sour blood orange type base to it I think this is the favorite of three this has a little bit more heat coming from the Ghost Pepper so you definitely can tell that it's got more heat than the mango habanero it just kind of fills your mouth all over with with a very very to me low level ghost pepper type burn but super super delicious blood orange flavor to this one with a little more heat I'd probably put this one maybe at a 3 out of 10 oh my one to 10 scale it's kind of hard to give heat ratings for candies it's so subjective but I'm just trying to give you an example of how I would rate them for heat so maybe that will help you and then this one here guys this is their hottest one this is the one made with Carolina Reaper now if you love cinnamon type candy if you love Hot Tamales or if you love a those fireballs you're probably going to really love this one so it's got a nice cinnamon spicy flavor to it this is the hottest of the three and I think it's probably seems a lot hotter than maybe you what it is because of the cinnamon I think cinnamon candies sometimes come across as being a little bit more spicy but you could definitely tell that because of the Carolina Reapers it are in here this is spiced up probably to about a 5 out of 10 on my one to ten scale the longer you keep it in the mouth you got to give these time as you suck on them and keep them in your mouth you've got to let it dissolve a little bit and then you can start getting more of the flavor you could start getting feeling more of the heat to sum this one they may want to take this out of their mouth for a while and put it down and maybe get something to drink it may reach that level to some but it does you know heat the mouth up pretty good with that nice awesome fiery cinnamon flavor so about a five out of ten for heat on my window ten scale but great candies highly recommended once again this is the Carolina Reaper hot candy I think the favorite to want to really enjoy the most is this one this is the orange ghost chili hot candy I really loved that blood orange base and then the very mildest of all of them once again is the mango habanero hot candy so thank Texas Company

thought you're Steve okay ready oh he's hoping you'd ask there we go orange you glad orange you glad that nice it's all frothy mm-hmm can you say frothy frothy the Stockman roughly the folds fold in [Music] who's playing the foosball today Miami and Pittsburgh oh it's a college town yeah it's a college game City College games all afternoon and night and one tonight or a couple time here we call Terry no I guess here we go it's an intercom ready to get the hard job as a supervisor huh somebody has to be in are you writing down dad what time is what time is it no no you did it didn't you see how many badges left doing orange shots oh we can make up one more batch those all air bubbles it's actually oil bubbles suppose from das orange they've already been added the Flavor Flav now the neat thing about this is I don't have to change the flavor all over the table he don't have to be a flavor saver literally a favorite shape itself that's what I call my mustache meet the flavor savor gosh did you save any flavor yesterday yeah what you save baby baby baby for later mmm-hmm one o'clock so there's tomorrow flavors be easily be done with this by I think you a330 hmm cuz then I can pack some up and put it on the shelf I just wish I knew somebody with a camera that could take a picture of that pile when it's all mixed up with a pretty cool shot and every batch is different so this won't be yeah and that the batch we're doing today will be different from the one we did we're like what two weeks ago one week ago this and usually yeah usually you guys only do one one day of hard job yeah and then it sold out in like what two weeks maybe less is the interweb people the interweb people I liked a lot but if you could take us still yeah that would be swell cuz you're the guy how'd you know I have a camera looking right at me see you had to take things are not moving pictures you take still pictures no I can't stand still for you well be accurate representational like all ours well you did that a purpose on purpose fishing for compliments we better try really hard then hey Brad to the bone I'm gonna take my stride how do you feel that I just cleaned these petals off to the tune of jingle bells okay let's see how much color I can get on the table this time choppers got month did this duck yeah you're right it will hmm I didn't wrong this time I hope so okay if I need any tech support did you get left and right sock on today I got check my feet first [Music] you're good good things don't get sugar good thing boy boy thank you didn't get away from you and every done I mean it all hard candy yes no chocolate we mean it oh yeah except for Saturday yeah that's already been oh yeah and then maybe like another day next but then that's it oh yeah are you guys still doing more peanut brittle okay then the only reason we didn't do more recently is because we don't have anyone to put it hmm don't have any room to put those big cases so we're gonna pack that up because basically we made three batches we solved that already huh so make three more but we knew we had to make more don't don't see chocolate-covered peanut brittle because then that's all they're gonna want cuz that's like the best thing ever it's true but don't talk about it cuz some think you should take it hopefully by the time you see this vid it'll be made yeah they're gonna want that for sure mm-hmm I bet last year normally we do like a half a batch covering chocolates to say 17 pounds ish this year we measure just do a full batch not mess around cuz if Craig does a video about it actually if you are out of town I'll just do an iPhone video yeah and what do I put that in the drop box sure email to me video will drive I think can hold up to 10 to 15 gigabytes and I think email isn't gonna handle that much well I think if you try to email it'll automatically sent to Google Drive if you try to do it through your Gmail account okay so Senate through G that makes sense because I already be on my iPhone anyway yeah yep until you do it and then I'll be able to edit it on my new laptop that's coming in today yep and when I'm out of town I can still work on the youtubes I love my job well I think you probably love your boss the best yeah you're the best boss you ever had mm-hmm you really get you yeah I really do and I don't mean to get all sappy but thank you thank you guys for watching all my ads and whatnot because if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be able to do what I do that's true you'd have to go to work where you wear pants yeah you know hey I'm wearing pants cause it's cold it's only because I have to shoot a video and I'm just adding and why I'm not going anywhere today yeah that is a big strength you can make a two-tone snap that was plenty joke I don't

[Music]", "Z2-64BHNNIc": "Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make another recipe from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook So that's exactly what we're gonna be doing today Gems and stones can be found in so many different video games including one of my favorite games, Zelda You collect a little rupees, so today we are gonna be making rupee hard candies The recipe is a simple hard candy recipe, which you can dye to be different colors And we're gonna be using the mold from my baking line We're gonna be using this shape this gem shape is a hexagon which means it has six sides And it's the most similar looking to a rupie. I just love this gem mold It's so cute And it has shapes that I have been wanting for a really long time. And side note, you guys our swirl silicone mold was trending number one on Amazon for molds. If you want to help this mold become number one mold on Amazon, I'll put a link down below because if this becomes number one then the poo mold becomes number two. (laughing) In the book, I dyed the rupies red blue and green because I felt those were the most iconic But I really love this recipe because you can make them any color you want. Today, we're gonna be making the same hard candies with the same colors, but I'm gonna be using different flavors Let's get started! The things you'll need to make these hard candies will be: a mold I'm using the mold from my baking line And I'm only gonna be using the hexagon shapes. For the recipe, you'll need three cups of sugar 3/4 cup water, 1 cup of light corn syrup, 1 teaspoon of blueberry oil. 1 drop a blue dye 1 teaspoon of strawberry oil, one drop of red dye, one teaspoon of green apple oil, and one drop of green dye now. Let's put it all together! The ingredients in front of me is enough to make 3 different colors I like to make mine one at a time because when you're working with hot candy I don't like to separate it and move it around too much because it's just so hot the first thing that we're gonna do is Take 1/3 of our sugar water and corn syrup and pour them into a pot. Pour our sugar, that means we'll need 1 cup then. We'll need a quarter cup of water and a third cup of corn syrup Woah! (laughing) There we go! Then we add the one drop of food coloring I'm gonna start with green because I'm wearing a green shirt and the flavoring that we're using is apple And I just love apple hard candy so start with the good stuff. It's all good, but this is just like my favorite Use a toothpick to scoop, it in mix together until all the sugar is wet now We'll take this sauce pot over to the stove. Place your pot onto the stove turn the heat to medium and allow the sugar to completely dissolve. Once dissolved, place the candy thermometer into your pot and cook the candy until it reaches 275 degrees. Then, turn off the stove heat and take your candy syrup back to the baking station. Once you take your hard candy off the stove, pour immediately into a heat safe container with a pour spout at the end. And before we pour the candy into the mold add your Flavoring I'm using green apple! Whisk together work that flavoring in there. Oh yeah! Now pour your hot candy syrup into your mold and be careful because it's very hot I'm only filling them about 2/3 because I want them to be a little bit more bite-sized. Once you've poured the candy, let them sit for 45 minutes to harden. While this sits, I'm gonna make a couple more batches using our other colors. You can do it this way if you have multiple molds otherwise just wait till they've hardened and repeat I've given the candies plenty of time to harden. Pop them out, it's super easy This is one of the reasons why I love Silicone molds because they're bendy! Tug this way, tug, tug, tug, stretch it out, and the other way, then flip it upside down and pop 'em out! These look amazing! Oh my gosh you guys! Now do this for the rest of your candy Tada! There you have it here are the rupee hard candies that we made today. The recipe is from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook But, we switched the flavorings. We made green apple flavored, blueberry, and strawberry. One of the things that I love about hard candy recipes, is it's very customizable. You can make your hard candies any colors you'd like and any flavor. growing up one of my favorite candies were Jolly Ranchers So I love making a homemade hard candy recipe. Easy-peasy bite-sized and delicious! omnomnomnomnom I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the recipe on rosannapansino.com Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these little hard candies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy! It makes my day! And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies please let me know leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen! Alright thanks again, you guys, bye-bye and now I have a candy for me! I'm gonna have a green apple one. Growing up, my favorite Jolly Ranchers were green apple and watermelon. Let me know in the comments below what your favorite Jolly Rancher flavor is", "suvHkZCQEQc": "hello and welcome to another episode of totally not Nigel I'm totally not Nigel your host today we're gonna be beginning me first in an eight part series on hard candies yes Thanksgiving and Christmas time are here once again and we're going to be celebrating with what else old-fashioned hard candies and these are made by clays and I hope I'm saying that correctly but clay ease sounds a little weird so clays CL a ays you can read it right here on the label natural herbal flavor horehound old-fashioned hard candies we're gonna start off with the horehound candies i've heard that these are actually pretty good if you have a sore throat or if you're trying to you know just kind of soothe you throw it a little bit of hard candy sometimes works and these are also verbal in nature or herbal as I said earlier but yes horehound candy and it's got a little blurb here on the back about horehound what is it and what it'll do is robot scientifically speaking and then ya ask for all of clays delicious flavors and then I've got a list of extensive list of flavors there there's even root beer ones and other ones but this series we're going to be looking at eight of their flavors so if you're interested in any of these eight you've come to the right place so soothing to the throat it actually says right here soothing to the throat and yeah so I don't know what horehound tastes like but we are going to give this a try I've heard that it's a really old-fashioned flavor that used to be extremely popular especially around Christmastime Thanksgiving time and the tie-in all right so wait reviews we're kids I'm gonna open this up give it a smell give it a taste and let you know what I think and the ingredients in nutritional information I'll get this posted on the link in the balonus and you can go whisking out read all about what's in it they're all right dealers when you find the best way to open this typically with these like stuff there we go I kind of made a mess of it ripped it right down the middle oh well anyway you can see they are lightly coated in powdered sugar or some other kind of sugary kind of coating there that's not exactly powdered sugar but it's a thin coating of sugar so there it is there kind of a brownish tannish color so let's try it actually let's give this thing a champ shall we they don't smell like much at all it smell mostly like the bag so we're gonna give this a try and see how it tastes no I'm not gonna eat the entire thing here nice light sugary taste when you first put it in your mouth though I can see why they would use this as a Christmas candy in days of old they used halt how does a Christmas get their little children enjoyed it Sarah got a very different kind of a flavor to it very difficult to describe it's very mellow very unobtrusive tastes kind of herbal which you know they're right upfront about it that it's an herbal flavor I like it I mean it's not gonna be for everybody but it's kind of like a toned-down Ricola and they may use a lot of horehound in Ricola I don't know I haven't used them in a while because it's so strong and off-putting the flavor of Rico love it this one's very pleasant very pleasant flavor it may not be for everyone though like I said it's gonna be an acquired taste for folks but yes I would say that clay is horehound candy for the right folks would be an excellent choice a good stocking stuffer or something to put out in the little glass bowl that you don't use for anything else except for Thanksgiving and Christmas you know just load it up with horehound candy and see who all comes to your shindig and enjoys them and then you'll know in the future how much of it to get so that said though i'm going to give this a hearty recommendation and I don't know if it's soothing to the throat or not but I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be it certainly has that kind of a flavor to it and that kind of a feel so that being said that's it for this particular episode to totally not Nigel thank you so much for watching be sure to LIKE comment and subscribe share

hard candy part 2 of 8 [Music]", "6FQlIslZYAM": "you're going to be surprised at just how simple it is to make your own rock candy today welcome to Todd's kitchen who doesn't love rock candy it's so simple yet delicious but let's put a little Christmas Ben on it so join me today as make my version of rock candy and also don't forget to check out Todd's kitchen com for my merchandise store now to start off with I have a pot on the stove on a high heat so today I'm going to add 3 and 3/4 cups of sugar then to that I'm going to add 1 cup of corn syrup or glucose syrup then 1 cup of water and finally a few drops or dissin out of red food coloring being a Christmas theme so it just can't - keep on stirring this over high heat until the sugar is dissolved and it comes up to a boil okay so once it's come up to a boil I'm going to turn it down to a medium heat now and just keep on stirring it just another minute or two just so it doesn't burn the bottom of the pot so basically at a medium temperature this is going to a simmer away for about 40 to 45 minutes you want a nice and slow you don't do it too fast and what I highly recommend is to use a candy thermometer now these are very cheap they're probably about 15 dollars and we want to go for the hard crack stage which is 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about 150 degrees Celsius so basically what it does it just sits on the side of the pot like so with a thermometer just inside and that will tell you the temperature that's that your sugar is currently acts so remember the low and slow is best because you want to make sure that all that water is evaporated and but give it a chance for that sugar to warm up nicely till we get to the hard crack stage so you want to add some peppermints for their Christmasy taste or we can add strawberry it's really up to you you can use any flavor that you'd like for this candy but being a Christmas version you want to try and keep it more Christmasy so I'm going to add some peppermint extracts and keep it as a red color so remember low-and-slow gonna should take about 40 to 45 minutes give or take okay so just got to the hard crack stage so I'll turn the heat off and I've also taken it straight off the heat you don't want to overdo it otherwise you can burn the mixture so what I have here is just a shallow baking dish and I'll just line with some baking paper so basically all we have to do now is just pour on our candy mixture on to our shallow dish now try and get as wide as you possibly can or as big as you possibly can possibly can so it's not overly thick and once there that's all you do it so it's simple as that just let that rest and sit there and cool down for a good two three hours and then it's ready you don't have to put it in the fridge or anything it is really that simple now as a tip with the pot just simply fill it with water and over the course of a few hours the water will simply dissolve all that leftover sugar and candy and you will be left with a perfectly clean pot so you won't have to worry about trying to scrape or break off any candy that's hardened on the pot okay so as you can see it is now completely set so you should another piece of baking paper here and I'm just going to place that just on top and just on the rolling pin basically just going to shut it see also start to break up like glass [Music] okay so I'm just got a bowl now I'm just going to put some powdered sugar icing sugar just going to place that into the base now because this is going to be very sticky so I got to coat it in the icing sugar so you see it just comes off the pot comes apart just like so and we just break it up and cover it in the icing sugar there's any really sharp pieces if you have kids around just make sure you just try and break those little bits off you can even eat the little bits if you like so this way I'll just prevent it from being all sticky so we have our candy and there we have our special Christmas edition rock candy no of course you can make this at any time of the year you can use any color that you like any flavor that you like for any season whatsoever because rock candy is so simple to make but it's also versatile so just by adding superb Mint and making a red for Christmas I've made it into a Christmas edition but the sky's the limit and rock candy is pure sugar so you do want to have it in moderation but honestly no matter what flavor that's use what color that you use rock candy always tastes simply delicious", "SmEIe45TtOA": "they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an O a V and E a y OU and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they could also twist rods into lollipops", "0DR3s3E1VwM": "first pass of the day first batch this morning what is tiny bit more look at that you'll be a professional one day you gotta just think in this turn you know yeah they're just having had the bigger bag I don't know why but you take sugar sugar right [Music] fewer forgotten ahead that no don't think so it's just a habit so i'ma start today I've never really looked it up to see exactly the properties of it to what it really knows what my father and my uncle's always said it was just to stop cracking it's for the hood if this for the sort of cheese a fan on the go outside Karen which I get other people yeah most smell outside like you when you said you were a kid becoming on getting off the bus right yeah I'd smell the candy and you knew what we were doing hey I can smell on the park console packs the old days was following the publication small not yeah [Music] [Music] regular [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so every lemonade was going to be the first batch but I I messed up with it like that because I didn't do that all right with them we're supposed to be 24 Compaq for you - 21 are you it's just because you most of the time to do 21 pounds yeah I'm just not to have it I put it together and that was that yeah yeah I realized later worse things have happened to it oh yeah like what crack mean one so for this condom good part that's the other day you guys burned that didn't happen so we're gonna just pour half yep that's good you'll have to scrape the kettle yellow they might want to get the last chick a mini letter then we're gonna add strawberry in the kettle some actually go ahead and do the lemon oh no I've got one 3/4 I believe you you crunched the numbers I wrote down what was she putting they're pretty stronger remember we just did this driver this one oh wait you did write it down yeah you said to take point here two and three quarters it's one of the worst it's I got it written down I'm telling you three quarters it's two or three quarters for lemonade one three quarters for card remember we were just talking about how strawberry gets three shots here double batch and lemonade gets the five shots yep that makes sense next doesn't think this he'll be very awkward but he does I'm just his heels they were dug in okay okay I guess worst-case scenario just isn't growing strawberry well do you put too much strawberry and it takes chemically don't want that this good I just want to make sure it was like a compass it's so cool over there if you like it does smell a little bit chemically but also like Captain Crunch and over here there's no men women hands huh well just look lemon oh my god yeah this smokes just like oh yeah it calls just like hold yeah well it was calling off a little bit you want to stay in there bring it back to the basement we have to pour this bench Craig yeah so you need me recycling me out right here okay let's not burn that to you it's so annoyed so I was thinking some crazy candy related thoughts I mean some off-the-hook stuff I'm almost afraid to say it but I miss it because I forget it but don't forget it I'll remind me know the savour would know nothing not to see every line of every candy I was thinking of what if we put something crunchy and like what if we got crushed up Oreos and added into peanut butter peanut butter full mandatory all just murdered us for reals yeah and peanut butter and then maybe a free chocolate cover yes yeah so I have an idea that I am pretty certain would work be and I know that because one of our viewers actually did it and sent us pictures and it came out really great they did caramel filled ribbon candy well we totally want to do that don't try that our example yeah they didn't yeah well we had apple pie so should we do that which go for our plans the summary only it's a public experiment but SMERSH Mona seems to change this all up yeah it's over I'd still like to try that out because I'm gonna be me but yeah that would be pretty cool but then I had another one we're talking about I came here what flavor ribbon candy we were talking about the other day Cara was there she's saying well what could we fill that flavor with cuz you don't feel things with they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it marshmallow fluff chocolate I was thinking what if we took actual cream max actually cream some crushed Oreos in the back into cream request Orioles in the cream and then we put that in urban candy justic Crisco and confectioner sugar make our own Oriole fill and fill it with that we could make like oh my god because we could take the the chocolate liqueur uh-huh like a chocolate flavored ribbon candy and then really ribbon we did anyways yeah and then just fill it with Oreo filling oh okay if you put it in just cream I think that they would get like Siamese huh I really like well I was also thinking wouldn't it be interesting if we crushed Oreo into creamy feta green Oreo cream green I'm talking to treatment we make for our starters I know crazy but I think yeah I'm saying just take some cream you've you know and you'll drop it don't don't starts facets that in the middle of ribbon candy and then you can have a flavor whether it be Oreo or whatever that you're like fruit flavored oils we could do anything if we did if we put out your ice cream oh we have people are want maple maple pecan and there's my crunches I just asked for fresh pecan and oh wait crushed up Oreos to cover the whole thing okay yes Oh ain't you glad well if you wanna you can make him 24 cuz the watermelon all the watermelon we need maybe should make it 24 we I mean we need so much watermelon orange you glad this is probably so wait you something take it down put in the hook yeah oh yeah you see that's way too soft it's just sticking to the table so let's talk about strawberry lemon-aid so I don't know if you picked up all that wasn't we flavored lemonade this one we played strawberry I was dropping here no we figured instead it's like pouring both in there we thought we'd keep himself at the trial that's how that worked out and we we might get some point inside football flavors in one pedal and see how that works so today is May 30 and this strawberry lemonade is going into our fruit and friendly bash but by the time you guys see this video I'm friendly badger probably sold out yeah and the strawberry lemonade assuming it tastes good cuz this is an experiment we're just trying it out but hey let me taste great Oh strawberry tastes great alone why would the taste great together me so that time you see this video we'll probably be doing separate flavors women in is a separate flavor to buy as a standalone flavor yeah because we we just tried that out with watermelon and put that video up one yesterday can't start out with 120 bags of it it's gone and that's where we're making more today kind of on the fly we're gonna make another 48 pockets today but there's just so much to candy makers can do out yeah they're giant they're trying valiantly but it's kind of like trying to push a boulder a really big one up a hill and sometimes it rolls back with crushes this is what Mitch fossil wants to make up strawberry-banana hmm right I think we should do a bunch of bananas in a bag blueberry banana mmm banana Irish cream Oh banana anise banana peanut butter banana peanut butter would be killer good the Elvis heart candy you certainly feel tired just watch me yes I mean do you wish you were me I'm not tired I just thought the water table should be much more bringing it over warm seems like a good idea until you realize that like you can't trap the air in felt school that just means that you're no longer just doing this for fun just do more work for longer yep yeah your mom kicked in my side you see I like its second form the strands in it and stuff like that's usually like you know when it's super cold it's not it's very pretty quick get that nice silvery look though that'll be cool yeah if you pull it can you call it too much like was it was like I'm a lot of it way more because it kind of stopped oh no it'll it'll keep trying Baltimore white yeah yeah we've never thrown into like it like right now on rough you just saw but like it just got a lot paler yeah kind of go on for that like silvery can I make it a hammer please hammered telling the cameras that's a beautiful collar hey how did you do this it actually feels fluffy hey I think you pulled it you really did this is puffy feeling are you calling me yelling Oh yellow yellow belly how'd you make all right we talked about like the Old Yeller esque movies like what was up with that what you're like let's make kids really sad Shiloh Old Yeller what's the other one Bambi there's that one between two ferns do you remember occur between red fern where the red friends grow that's what I never saw it though wait what the book yes I've never seen that car hmm yeah classic motif boy s dog boy doesn't have dogs yeah the brave doesn't have dog in sad way talks to the hound lady in the all right think so I think there has any okay let's don't bring that up yeah I'm sorry come on I'm gonna cry right into the strawberry I was just gonna say is this a good pink or should I keep lighting it up I need your strawberry you're awesome he knows you can do a strawberry but don't do a raspberry I can't wait to taste this I wonder if it's okay if everybody before lunch I gotta call my mom I want you to trust him right now no I said I call my mom okay I guess I guess that going now hmm how close did you come I guess AR purple or I mean this one this color here this light right here there's a little bit larger there you go do it do it you well yeah this one's really soft a college dealer plates I can tell this is 24 pounds I didn't realize he was gonna be together the old days we've done this before but we put him back to the back what flavors we gotta do that way to do two flavors in one yeah [Music] I guess Lord or twenty pound batches pete'll it would it would save us a whole 45 minutes of cook time you know what is it your arm zone would you be able to pull it oh you'd pull it in two different two halves you know they'd be two separate flavors I mean one flavour ran into the next warm funny this way we used to do it to save time especially if you're doing half batches you don't want to cook up like 10 pounds of time does Oh I forgot to bring moving or [Applause] yeah I saw that because they're talking about you have a second favorite SNL star you know first or second favorite you have the ranking in your head I mean Will Ferrell's probably but I really like John Belushi is Santa present shiny all right so what do we have to do for the water bug and we're

gonna have to make pieces you can become okay Terry okay panting adjourn it is meeting adjourned is [Music]", "A1L3UNm2bsk": "welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays confection in Tallahassee Florida today we're going to make some strawberry image candy we've poured our flavored hutt sugar out into our candy Cohen's bedroom this table was made over 150 years ago in Hartfield Connecticut and we're now adding food coloring for our palate we're going to use green for the top of the strawberry yellow for the background and the seeds and of course red for the strawberry the strawberry shape that we make is a good example of how we design our image can we're not going for an exact image going clues that your brain is together making image in this case let's look at a strawberry it has yellow seeds that a little vertical specks it is a red background that has green on the top and we're going to take all of those elements and when we make the final product it's not going to look exactly like a strawberry but your brain will see it as such the white powder you see is citric acid that we've added to give that little sour lemon strawberry taste like strawberry we're about to cut apart the sugar and the edges that have been touching the metal are now cooled down to a point that we can touch them they're actually to cool but the center is still over 300 degrees we're going to cut our palate apart into pieces and then we're going to fold it together to get the temperature to be even in each of our colors an Arizona where the Batman you hope the yellow on the hook to make it an opaque yellow the room where the pastel and we've separated our colors we have green on one side waiting to become leaves and we've got the red separated into T hearts one part is going to become the seeds and if we made into a cylinder the other part is going to be saved wrap this one cylinders would be multiplied into all the seeds it's too large right now to use but when we stretch it will become smaller in diameter we'll cut it apart and you'll make it to strawberry syncopated again let the here the fellows come the Western Sun you can see us make the scandium person in Tallahassee Florida and lofty pursuits we do it right in front of everyone and that's why we call the public displays confection you can also buy our candies online or if you go to WWE at our website you can even request for custom candies to be made we make custom candies for all occasions from weddings to anniversaries to any special event we even make it with corporate logos while Greg rotates the triangular shape for the body of the strawberry maggie starts the frog she'll make the spacers that are triangles out of the yellow this is actually the harder part of the tron and then greg will use the green candy to add stripes which will become the fron itself they add letter by you by love for you is true on account of you kid they are letter by make sure my love Oh hey out of mine ready the background rat was stretched to size and log is assembled waiting for it out around the artwork in the center of the log was cooled to a lower temperature than the RAM we are going to be rolling this back and forth for a bit to equalize the temperature Maggie during this time we'll be making the outer wrap and she'll be making this with a green stripe the green stripe is there mostly because we have leftover green we don't want to waste the sugar and the outer design sometimes changes depending on what colors we have left and how much candy we've used we have to keep the log of candy moving at all times it'll distort under its own weight because it's still soft and we stretch the log into rods which then get rolled on the candy cooling table to cool down once again if we don't keep them moving they'll go flat or they'll cool all that's left is to take the rods candy and cut them to their individual bite sized pieces you can subscribe to our channel like us on Facebook or just visit

that's right we are making candy some friends of mine at church said they really liked watching these silly videos we make up and and all the different desserts and and sweet things but they said also that they like watching Animalia videos too so I started thinking to myself how could we do this I came up with the perfect solution cooking with animals how about that we're going to cook up some candy with animals how crazy and fun is that going to be if you're wondering has he lost his marbles the answer is probably yes but we're going to still cook some candy ax it's awesome it's easy basically going to show you the ingredients we're going to do it fun easy cheap cheap cheap and you should be able to make it and you know it only takes like 10 minutes so this is awesome stuff okay so four ingredients as always or generally speaking I should say if it's a complicated recipe I generally don't make it and this one is very very basic you really only have four things that are going to make this candy up you've got two cups of granulated sugar 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water and then some kind of a flavoring I'm going to show you up close what I got here this is a raspberry flavoring but it's from my believe Lord and Lord and oils raspberry flavor and you can use whatever you want I've even seen people using essential oils and all kinds of other things but we use those because it's pre-made pre-measured out easy to do I think it costs like 50 cents or something really really small so there you go ok for tools its basic stuff you're basically going to need a saucepan a spatula and you're going to need a cookie sheet or whatever kind of form you want to pour it into if you're going to make lollipops you could get little forms for them or dinosaurs or even ape-like looking things that would be crazy candy candy apes but yeah anything whatever floats your boat you will also need a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your soon to be deliciousness in candy yay okay now that we've got our ingredients sorted we're going to heat up our saucepan and I'm going to need help from my lovely assistant David because it would be truly a silly thing for me to be cooking with a rabbit in my hand so here is my lovely assistant David ha the hammer the cannon DJ magic snappy pants whatever you want to call up so he's getting the saucepan ready and we've got our thermometer because basically all you're going to do is you're going to heat these ingredients up to 300 degrees they're going to boil then as it's cooling down you're going to stir in your lovely raspberry Ness for us it's raspberry nice it's whatever flavoring you want and that's it then you put it on your tray it'll spread itself out and as it cools down you cut it so here we go let's get it going over a medium-high heat so now as David's putting ingredients in I want to make a note there if you see that thermometers stick the sticky thermometer you basically don't want it touching the bottom or also will give you a false reading but you do want to make sure that's fully into your mixture here and in goes the water and now it's simply a waiting game as the temperatures coming up to 300 degrees you do want to make sure that you're stirring it regularly you're looking for a boil make sure that you're checking that temperature you don't want to get it too hot or you will burn it now you do want to keep stirring but when when you reach 260 degrees then you're going to stop stirring because it's going to continue to elevate in temperature that's already at a mass a critical mass critical critical mass and it's going to keep getting hotter so basically at 260 you stop and then it should start to clear up okay so we have just now crested the 260 degree mark so we will no longer be stirring we will still be waiting oh yes we will be waiting alright so now we're keeping an eye on the temperature like good little Scouts that we are but keep in mind that the last few degrees the last 10 15 degrees jumped quickly so you got to be ready to get this off the heat then you're going to stir it up again as you add your flavoring and then on to your form we just crested 300 degrees we've taken our goo off the heat we're adding our flavouring we're going to stir it up and pour it into what we're using for form is just our cookie sheet so we're going to take that thermometer off there be careful keep in mind this is 300 degrees stuff and if it sticks to you it will stick for a while it will burn the stew out of you be very careful so here we go now we're like I said we're just using a cookie sheet for our form because we're going to cut it into squares you just pour it on and it will spread out just like that now some of you might be saying yourself right now hey inner chubby guy why don't you lick the spoon that would be a terrible idea it might tear off your tongue it's very hot don't do it resist the urge all right let's see if this thing is cooled down it's been about 15 minutes what you do is you just take a regular little pizza cutter you're going to score this yeah like that into whatever size of shapes pieces you want now if it's not see that if it's not ready it'll just kind of blob back over itself and the idea is not you're not cutting it we're just trying to get it to a score so that when it actually does get completely hard then it will break apart very easily now if you let this go too long it will start to break right away so there's a sweet spot it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes oh so you look started to blob back together the edges are fine I got to wait so we'll wait another five now at this point it's all gridded up and it's not going to blob together anymore and if you were a normal person you would just let that sit there for a good 40 minutes or whatever but well let's just say I'm abnormal and I'm also not very patient so into the freezer you go baby all right so we very impatiently waited and reluctantly waited and waited and now it's done it's ready so basically you can just take and crack it bust it out of here however you need to do it I can sometimes get under here with a knife which was exactly one we'll do right now so now you have made candy delicious delicious candy one more step that we do is well actually take some powdered sugar and dust this stuff with it shake it around I mean this this little container is not big enough we'll do it in a bigger container but the reason for that is it helps it not stick together which is really nice so there you have it folks cheap easy delicious homemade candy it literally cost us maybe 50 cents for everything and in the great part is you know what you're getting you know there's no nasty weirdo chemicals no asbestos or fungal material well anyway I hope you liked the video and the animals so there you have it I'm Brad with big family homestead please pass the video around yes we're silly it's just silly here anyway have an amazing day that is one lazy dog one lazy dog indeed", "wKHaFj1T8Lg": "*Galactic Music* Corinne: Woah, dude! This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video. Um, doesn't really matter if you subscribe or like it up and I probably won't see you next time. Computer, set a course for deep space nine. And computer, turn up the space jams. *lit af techno music*", "A2hn1DjrK7Q": "hi guys back with another moonshine flavor to share with you guys tonight and tonight is any fries no not really it's a green Apple Jolly Rancher as you can see by the candies laying here and this this one is 100 proof corn liquor and my girlfriend just takes Jolly Rancher candies and unwrapped some and there was a big handful of them in there and lets them dissolve it takes a day or two sometimes from all to dissolve but it tastes just like the candy and you can use if you like it sweeter and more candy flavored you can use more if you want to want a little thinner I guess and taste more of the alcohol you just use less this one is kind of a name between she makes hers extremely sweet for me but she makes them for me that's not quite as sweet what she likes that okay let's give it a smell and the taste smells exactly like Jolly Ranchers green Apple Jolly Ranchers with just a hint after uh alcohol mmm tastes like Jolly Ranchers of course green apple till I'm answered but this could be like a shooter that you would buy in a bar or something I think maybe younger younger people this would appeal to you but I don't know if you like Jolly Ranchers you like this and just a real quick one on green Apple Jolly Rancher and I'll catch everyone later bye", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "xnpqEOsJbuw": "welcome to lofty pursuits and public\ndisplays a confection in Tallahassee Florida\nthis is Greg and I want to tell you it always makes me feel good when a project\ncomes to fruition we put a lot of work into this project these are our\nchocolate fruit drops and this is a raspberry chocolate fruit drop while\nit's more fudge like than chocolate the results are spectacular since I feel\nmost heart candies and chocolate aren't chocolate enough the raspberry flavor\nwas in the pot when we poured it in the food coloring gets dripped in and\nstirred in and the water boils out when it hits the hot sugar turning to steam\nand this gets the water out of the candy because we can't have much of any water\nin the candy where the candy will be sticky this candy will be colored\nprimarily brown by the actual cocoa powder we're putting in so we're just\nadding a little pink here so we can identify the flavor in the assortment\nand we're putting it in a part of the candy we're not going to add cocoa to so as we cut the pink out of the candy\nand we let the colors drip is that the temperature can equalize we're gonna\nthink here about why hard candy doesn't normally taste like chocolate\nthat's because chocolate is not just a flavor it's also a texture it they call\nit mouthfeel or a mommy and what it means is cocoa butter the actual texture\nof it affects the flavor or your sensation of the flavor so we're going\nto solve this problem by actually using cocoa on the hard candy and this is a\nbit difficult because cocoa is oil-based and the candy is water-based and we've\ngot to sort of make an emulsion out of them we're making an emulsion and\ntrapping it in hard candy we're not making it when it's liquid we're making\nit when it's semi solid and we're doing it like one would fold a strudel or\nbutter into a strudel we're working with two distinct flavors and the raspberry\nneeds citric acid to pull out the raspberry flavor so we're adding it here\nand that's what those white crystals are and the cocoa powder then gets added and\nit gets added with some difficulty originally it made quite a mess but\nwe're getting better at that now we're only making a little mess while we know these candies and future\nmonths are going to be great for Easter and Valentine's Day and other\ntraditionally chocolate holidays we're actually making this specifically for\nsweet day a little obscure holiday sweet day happens on January 14th\nit's a month before Valentine's Day but I'm not sure that there's any connection\nwith Valentine's Day I haven't quite figured out exactly what culture this\ncomes out of but on sweet day the tradition has that that on the darkest\ndays of winter a small treat a sweet or a cookie or something is given to a\nfamily member a child someone they love to brighten their day in the coldest\ndarkest parts of the winter the story goes that on the day before I guess that\nwould be the 13th the night before a visca a little pink bear delivers the\ntreats and he delivers it in his yellow cart or wagon and he comes around to\neveryone just bringing cheer it's a holiday just a fun and happiness and I\nkind of like it and it's based around sweets so of course I like it so on the\ntable we mostly work the cocoa powder in but there are still pockets of it in air\npockets that are gonna tear if I'm not careful so I'm taking it to the hook not\nso much to pull it like I do to make candy white but more to fold it in and\nto blend the chocolate that much better because we really want the cocoa powder\nin here if you look at the ingredients you'll realize that this isn't a\nchocolate this is technically a chocolate hard caramel but that also\nmakes this a fairly unique in confectionery circles and it tastes\namazing we want to color code the candy because\nthis is going to be an assortment it will have chocolate orange chocolate\nraspberry chocolate blueberry chocolate cherry and we want to know what colors\nthey're gonna be so the raspberry is pink pomegranate will be red\nblueberry will be blue black cherry will be black and orange will be orange and\nyou'll be able to tell what a color what it is but I've got to make the stripes\nand I need one stripe to show up on each of them squares of candy we're gonna\nmake and we're gonna be doing that by making a lot of stripes you see there\nare five rows of squares and if I make 12 stripes there's good odds that will\nbe at least one stripe on each side of each piece of candy and I make the stripes by making one\nstripe and pulling it out and turning it into four stripes and then pulling it\nout and turning it into three more sets of four stripes if you'll notice I have\na little bit of pink left and if you watch carefully at the end you'll see\nthat I won't waste it I'll hide it in the middle and it'll be just as yummy in\nthe final candy this was the first batch that I sort of tested proportions and\neach subsequent batch the color was made in a precise amount if you would like to\ntry this candy or any of our others please mosey over to our website www.engvid.com buddy's life a little\nhappier on a dark day in the winter you may have seen us to use this technique\nfor candy canes but once we make a wrap with the stripes we taper it off and we\ncut off the end but not to waste the end we work it into the back where we can\nsort of hide it in the middle with that pink that we also hid in the middle it's\nall delicious candy and none of its going to waste I've always thought\nsticking candy in the center like this is sort of like making a hard candy\nturducken but one that tastes a bit sweet unlike most of our drops we put this\ncandy on our batch roller to keep it spinning because we want to keep the\nstripes visible we don't want them going flat so it's spinning here but unlike\nmaking a rope like I do with image candy I'm just gonna cut off a big hunk with\nstripes and feed it through the batch roller the dye for the batch roller\nwe're using today makes about half inch squares and it was made in the late\n1800s by firm Cole Thomas Mills this is the Victorian part of the Victorian\ncandy we made and yes we're working on equipment that are well in excess of 100\nyears old that batch roller is actually one of our newer pieces of equipment it\nmay only be a hundred and ten years old if you're interested there'll be a link\nin the description for an alternate version of this video with a more\ndramatic soundtrack I made for fun please check it out if you liked this\nvideo please subscribe to us here on YouTube and ring the notification bell\nif you are subscribed you may also want to check to see if your notification\nbell is selected YouTube is getting weird about showing videos to people who\ndon't have this notification on I want to thank all of our viewers out there\nwho gave us feedback from the prototypes of this candy we gave out free samples\non Black Friday for people who use the proper coupon code so they could get an\nadvance taste of this we actually sent out three versions of the candy and by\nthe feedback we got we tweaked our flavors and I think it's really\nspectacular now and we want to thank you for your input this is the first time we\ntry to get mass input on a flavor and it worked not only does the cocoa make the candy\ntaste interesting it also makes it a little bit more delicate it's harder to\nget through the press and it's easier to break into pieces it's actually very\nhard to lift as an entire unit but as we break some of it by lifting and dropping\nyou can see why this type of candy is known as drops we're gonna just use our\nspatula to scrape up the rest and give you a spatula I've you on the candy\nbreaking up process and there we have our finished raspberry chocolate drop\nwith its pink stripe and it's gonna go join its friends in the fruit drop\nassortment of chocolate fruit drops thank you for watching you can get these\ncandies at our website wowt.com and if you're ever in tallahassee we're\nright off the i-10 exit of Thomasville Road in Tallahassee you can visit us for\nyourself and if you're lucky you can catch us making hard candy we don't make\nit every day but we make it a lot of days and we serve brunch from 7 a.m. to\n2 p.m. and ice cream from noon until 10:00 thank you for watching", "xlfkPFBW36o": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary let's melt down some butterscotch we're gonna try to make some hard candies with our SL and let's open some of these I put 20 in here we have 1/2 gram let's melt them down I highly suggest using a rubber spatula we're trying to stir this mixture because it's gonna get stuck on everything else even though I swear when you cook with these I will never lick the spatula because it tastes like rubber okay it's a weird taste to it so well melting these down you just kind of want to keep stirring it so we don't burn it we're get it stuck to the bottom it will start to melt if you want it to go a little quicker you can smash them up first but I kind of want to see how long it took just to melt when I need the Jolly Ranchers on here we had them crushed up and I had them on low forever they just it turn into this weird like you dumb mixture ooh so I'm trying them from full and I'm gonna go a little bit higher I have it [Music] when these all get melted we're just gonna add straight our so to it and I think a little butter but I don't know that I would add anything else so if you still want that candy to get part again and here we start adding all this sticky stuff I'm not sure that it would solidify and starting to clump together keep stirring the hardest part is judging like how many you're gonna make I put in 20 hard candies I'm going to use half a gram or so it's so hard to dos when we just need peanut butter cookies doesn't that look like peanut butter I think it was a good idea that we didn't start on low started around four but I don't even think it's been ten minutes and it's almost ready for the RSO and butter ah broke this dang injector maybe this will work [Music] ding-ding-ding we have a winner [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's a piece of plastic but I don't want to waste all this I'm gonna pour it in here everything's ready to go it gets cold fast and you want to pour it back [Music] [Music] you were there you were there I know you're incorporated with the mixture damn it give any court ring for top number two [Music] [Music] so like to see which is a little lip on it [Music] so far we have a nice little mixture [Music] [Music] we had a butter double chocolate [Music]", "VY8q0hN6KwA": "so I'm rich are tell on professor faculty member here at the University of Wisconsin huge candy signs so we make some heart candy today this is a mixture of granulated sugar you can see the white stuff here we have corn syrup in here as well and then we have water to help dissolve the sugar we're just gonna dissolve all the sugar and make sure that there are no sugar crystals in here because eventually we're gonna make heart candy which is a sugar glass so we don't want crystals so we've reached the boiling point now and so essentially we're gonna follow the boiling point elevation curve up so in making hard candy we're going to boil up to what's called the hard crack stage where temperatures are on the order of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and water contents are down around 2 or 3 percent so we're now at the 233 degrees fahrenheit range and and this is where we have the thread state and what that means is the viscosity is high higher that high enough that when you pour this into cold water it forms threads as it falls through there but the viscosity is still low enough that those threads dissolve fairly quickly so we're now at about 240 degrees and this is according to the candy thermometer where we find the firm ball state and so we boiled enough water that that when you pour this into when you drop it into cold water it forms a coherent mass that you can take out and form it into a ball that can still be manipulated so it's plastic enough to be malleable but it's still a firm ball I can hold its shape okay and we're at about 298 now and and so I'm going to stop it and take it off the heat so we're now going to take this over to the cold table and pour it out and start the next stage of the process so at this point we've poured it onto the cold table and it's starting to cool you can see that as it cools it becomes more plastic more firm we have some color granules and we'll add those in here some flavor so we're gonna add a little bit of lemon flavoring to this and then we're gonna add a little bit of acid as well so right now we're in the stage where it's becoming a plastic mass and we're just trying to get it into a shape that it will go through the rollers it still has enough heat in it and the viscosity is low enough that it starts to flow so far to form it now it would form but then it would quickly deform just like it's doing here so this is just about at the point where where we can form it it's viscous enough that it's not flowing very quickly yet it's still plastic if it enough that we're going to be able to get it through the the rollers and and turn it into a nice candy [Music] so as you can see we're sending this plastic mass through these drop rollers they fill into the shapes and make the drop shaped candy so now our lemon drops have solidified enough to reach room temperature where now they're in the form of a sugar glass so this is just like window glass except it's made of sugar molecules not of silica but now because it's in a sugar glass I can drop this onto the tray and it's going to shatter it'll shatter along the webbing here or leaving behind some intact lemon drops so at this point we have lemon drops but they have all these sharp edges on them still so the next step in the process would be to put them into some kind of tumbling drum to smooth out the edges [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "Xd5r_fFM6d8": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] all right so one person to take thermometer out one person supervised and one person to record it one more tap otherwise it doesn't happen oh it turns out too many oh no all right it goes nothing oh what is it really it's not nothing flavored right yeah there's no label oh wow yeah nothing smells like flavor i'm doing green apple for the first time so i'm going based on the recommendation that is very green wow very green that looks like ecto cooler the high c oh yeah can you see it on the camera yeah it's very green very green how green is it oh so green berry it's too much green oh yeah that smells like green apple oh yep all right well we kind of had a little we need to put a ton of coffee and coffee oh yeah wow that is really reacting look we should have seen the coffee let's go crazy this looks like very halloween-ish is it all too smoky yes i am getting spooked well your mom should come in here scared she'll make you feel better okay so you can protect me from the boogie man yeah are you saying that because it's green and sort of boogies no my mom just always like uh whenever we were talking about some being scared or something she always said just boogie man it was just like the uh kids she's like yeah just don't worry uh don't get eaten by the boogie man don't get taken by the boogie man don't get attacked by the boogeyman you know don't get sued by the boogeyman yeah exactly stuff like that it's just her go-to now it's mine because you know i was raised by her yeah i guess you can use it she'll watch it no that's pretty lucky yeah those are what is i'm gonna stick the boogie nobody's blown away yet but you guys aren't you're not shooting it down right away which is good i'm just letting everybody taste it first oh okay it tastes like wood it tastes like like it tastes like light green yeah it doesn't taste super green no it's very faintly green yeah i think it needs more two more plus if you imagine for sure it's like eating a little bit yeah we could probably get another at least two more shots yeah oh they really the fun shops so the green apple's gonna go in the same bag as apple pie flavor right yep very happily oh yeah people who eat this will live happily ever after keep the doctor away for sure i mean that's true for candy too apple flavored things [Music] all right you ready to hand out spoons sir oh you know it corn man don't your wife get jealous all right this is going to be the one right correct knew it i knew it you sure did those of you tasting green apple at home be sure you wash your candy before you eat it it's a free-range flavor you don't know where it's been man this is gonna be a fun one to scrape out of the kettle yeah it seems like it's pretty sticking pretty hard oh yeah what was that the first one was pumpkin right yep uh there was like a quarter inch layer in the whole kind of just got you guys just have to throw out the kettle yeah yeah we went down to the 100 year old kettle store got another one it's getting there you might as well put the rest of it in cool oh man that's really struck my tooth mine too because it's still warm yeah that keeps happening to me too that was for me biting it with my teeth i don't know if you can see yeah there's the string yeah that's still fun so stuck to my tooth that's why i don't find it i just like kind of i feel like a lollipop that's when i get the wood flavor so i tried to just like get a little nibble up and wrong with that that's natural yeah you vegans are into that it's natural like grandma used to make at one time [Music] you better do another half shot whatever yeah it's like 10 my third third feels like i tried raspberry and it wasn't but i mean it's still give it a little bit of tartness if it puts them in i think that would be good a couple of tablespoons or something and we'll taste it afterwards yeah and cool that so we'll make it like kind of like the orange is that six and there's an 18 pound batch now it's like two three four tablespoons so yeah i think i think six teaspoons in that one you want to be like that you want to be more like a lime which is a little tarter yeah let's go for tartar okay because we already have the apple pie which this tastes nothing like which is good they're very different but yeah let's go for tartar okay tartar sauce that we're probably not really the best uh hard candy flavor yeah i don't think so i mean it sounds weird but it could be fantastic just like chocolate conversation if that sounds weird that's great yeah oh boy this one might be more like a 15-pound batch i'm not scraping it yeah really good luck throwing it yeah oh my god maurice is not sticking to the cuddle yeah we got that going for us or anything else making a lollipop right now max you're so strong yeah that's what they tell me have you found so some of the other flavors have also stuck to the kettle well it's from the taste test you know it just gets colder and colder because when we added the 10 shots to the coffee because it's the coffee isn't it yep yeah that one took a while to doing that yeah all right i'll go get steve after this i'm scraping it like with the the back end of the scraper i need to specially modify a scraper that can stand up to this yes flexible but still rigid all right you can barely even tell there's any candy in there yeah good job [Music] oh yeah see it bouncing yeah two five only four fighter oh what are we doing what are we doing uh wait for the color yeah full green's fine full grain perfect yeah it's already colored just be hard to unless you're gonna do like light green and dark i was like maybe like pull a scrape out or something yeah oh yeah yeah this table's worked out pretty good i know there's a lot of nostalgia behind the the old marble one this one offers a lot less headaches i think that's all we're getting shards of candies you got the rusty thing with a scraper oh it might go flying everywhere that's not too good charging dust that's about it yeah it's cooling down pretty good fill a little bit before you want the hook just a little minute all the candy out of there looks like a brand new old kettle that's exactly what it is did you grace the hook yeah all right wait that hook oh no i did the one on the counter oh it'll be fine so no no not this time too early i guess it's still a little green huh oh thanks for the real laugh yeah it was real totally yeah that was a real fun x well we saved half of it that's cool is your foot okay you just put it on my foot's fine yeah you're looking at your shoe well it's all good dude we got six flavors so it fell off that happens to fall off the hook don't do that don't worry it's gonna come out of carrots paycheck yeah for real sarah bad news i don't know if you're going to be eating this week well she could eat the spare candy yeah yeah yeah let's take it out of the garbage come on it's like a thousand calories right there's dinner it all tastes good that's honestly still like a pretty decent amount of candy yeah that's like most of it yeah i mean we're only doing 18 pound batches yeah and we're going to mix it in though yeah this is a custom badge all right i i gotta get the next match going too though yeah all right yeah at least got to get the water in there and turn that on you want me to put a tripod on and do the thing down there or if you want to if you think that'd be good for the video but um if you're more comfortable doing that i got this this is this is still pretty pretty yeah i mean i think it'd be interesting to see someone do both i don't think i've ever seen that before okay yeah all right why not it's still wicked soft though i don't know i might even get back on the hook for that yeah dad you seem you seem pretty upset with your mustache i can tell yeah that's a nice about the little dude i don't go throw that on the floor again italian christmas donkey something about the walking through the alps of italy or something yeah yeah i think that this probably just cooled off the rest of the way while i was switching gloves oh let's yeah though that's a nice color though yeah yeah there's plenty plenty of color in that uh food coloring i mean if you told me that was 18 pounds i believe whatever it is yeah yeah really yeah it's a little more easy to manage now isn't it yeah way easier well it's like a lot colder now too you think i just went on the hook a little too early uh that could be part of it um i'm not saying this to be nice though like really like the past few times i've had to like try to pull it out differently to get it to like go uniform because i've been getting like real lumpy bits and then like you know the thin spots on the hook and like it really wants to fall off and the lumber parts on its way to the ground that looks like an apple right yeah every week every week every batch that only a beer will solve well it's almost five me too oops my bad i'm almost wondering too because like they remember i was saying on the pumpkin how it almost felt like a bike tire like it felt like inflated i wonder if there is like a different water content in these uh flavors you know that's why it's bubbling up when we put them in there yeah definitely seem to have marble reactions i was trying to see if it's water-based or glycol or what but i don't think there's even ingredients on the bottom it's something soft yeah were you thinking the same thing you're just looking at it does it feel like yeah yeah i like has the candy felt like this all day i think so oh yeah a little softer huh yeah i mean you had 10 shots to it like [Applause] snake green apple do you remember the green snake that was at the zoo and it was always coiled up on the tree branch there was that one in the big yellow one i remember one time i was at the zoo and i was talking a snake and then my my husband was really like pressed up against the glass and then the glass just disappeared boy the snake came out and started chasing him and then and then my uh aunt and uncle they made me go back to my bedroom under the stairs and i was grounded for a week man that sounds like magic or something i don't know man i just unexplained got yourself in a pretty hairy situation huh you know i never i never put that together but what's the only other dudley you've ever heard of no one definitely do right right like do right you've never heard of the new ray i don't even know i just know i've heard that oh maybe he's from the old cartoons or something does he do right yeah hannah barbera remember the episode of the office where ryan starts telling the story about uh the lion king and saying that heaven is like my cousin mufasa how does kevin ruin it what's he say is that like sticking into there a lot more too yep oh wow you seem like good flavor warm candies sticky uh you want to finish this one this one up yeah a little bit for the camera and stuff oh come on you got your cap shoes on and everything those are my orthopedic shoes oh well they're very stylish what were those do you remember those shoes they were supposed to like make your butt round you don't remember those they're like really round yeah they're like this big too where are they sketchers oh they look like i forgot about them remember dad remember when you guys got his moon shoes for christmas do you just like stuff your feet and they're just giant rubber bands i wonder if it made you jump any higher because like it also kind of weighed you down yeah although it did it did make everything springier but that makes you heavier it was like there wasn't enough resistance yeah in the vans where like you would just kind of sink all the time yeah just made you think more yeah yeah helmets yeah yeah really what were the sock'em poppers is that what the ones that went on your hands were called just like the blow off things yeah they're great [Music] i'm trying very gently with those i'm sure a lot of fights got started and finished with those plus but nobody i knew ever had two pairs so it was always like okay you get the left one just a perfect amount well that's a sad little batch any difference i don't think so oh no there's flex in there it's like totally evaporated so we're just gonna smell [Music] yeah you could definitely see beans in there but i don't know if there's enough in this one shot here oh i just made enough of the beans it it smells pretty strong so i want to taste it before we you know especially since it's extract not flavoring it does smell really good all right um you guess what i mean it kind of smells like it's going back to just like plain candy smell now yeah go right there i mean a lot of the aroma does evaporate that's true that's kind of chicken now are you going to put some of the powder in first you should i just want to see where we're at yeah i mean it's probably nothing but if i just i just wanna i just wanna make sure okay where are we going pizza man that's delivery as soon as your pizzas are baked can you deliver them to karen please yeah i'll bring them out in a minute that'd eight uh but that's that's in a full batch and this is essentially a half match of that so hopefully we'll be able to get away a little more um what do you want to do with this i mean a tablespoon or a teaspoon i don't think a tablespoon we could try and see what happens um this is just like crushed vanilla beans yeah there's special kind though i can't remember my favorite one of those items was eighty dollars thirty dollars yeah vanilla is expensive it's so it was so good vanilla bean it was a while ago so i can't really remember but it was crazy expensive for the size of the bottle yeah i'm thinking a little powdered one was 30 bucks see how this comes out of here maybe i won't do it over there just in case yeah [Music] really smell good and then again it smells a little better i think i think it kind of smells like that the high lull or whatever you're supposed to say that i'm not gonna like it reminds me like a candlestick all right i mean again at the end of that it kind of all went away but you guys want to taste this anyway very nice put in a couple of shots of vanilla you know why you're gonna eat it this is the other stuff it does yeah it smells good i just didn't it just didn't taste much okay two two [Music] can always get you another one if you need it oh [Music] [Applause] that's all i got get down for this one too uh sure use as much feedback as we can yeah take it around i can run [Music] okay i'm getting good at reading the faces after these this kind of tastes like candy sweet don't no taste like much no vanilla there now another tough one it's tough to get it strong enough i tell you what what i already told you keep on two shots of vanilla so that's ten of these two of the other ones let's go for an even fifteen [Music] see what i don't know what you're even talking about we don't make mistakes here no nobody does oh no maybe [Laughter] [Music] 82 degrees you better hurry oh man that's pretty warm in here yeah no i it's like pushing it through corn syrup again i'm gonna make fun scraping it out again oh you know it i'm almost thinking about turning the kettle back on that's the funnest part right i like it but you know what i've been hugging all the fun i'll let joe do it this time i'll watch both of your heads safety first man see how cold that is that's doing better than the last batch yeah just kind of crazy because it was in there for a long time gotta get my finger strength up is it hurting your arms haven't to you know resist all the force that i'm putting on a cutter looking nicer very nice yeah probably feels like my wrist is gonna break [Music] oh yeah there's no candy in there at all thank goodness for sinks huh yeah because i mean it's probably pretty cold coming out of the kettle and i got to do all this stuff yeah yeah all right let's go take a look it's the last kettle though at least so what are we doing stripes all white i'm pretty sure just pulling the whole thing calling it you got voices are supposed to be the color there you go no problem okay joe good work joseph try some soup we're all counting on you we're all counting on you to try that soup potato thing yeah it's cool a mashed potato soup no it's smashing no there's not mashed potatoes is there something it is okay potatoes like sausage or something like that and and kale all cooked and maybe spinach i'm not sure there's other stuff in there about i don't know what it it's good though yeah yeah i haven't tried it yet max's mind always makes us a bunch of food yeah the e-best vegan she sure is nice okay yeah i just want to say good work dad thanks we're all counting on you i know can you just hammer this it's hammer time oh thanks oh yeah you can see the flex in there the vanilla so see how it makes it smoother it's the canvas that's the secret canvas gloves probably helped too yeah it's only touching canvas it makes it shiny showing it up look at that you're doing good dad oh boy let me just turn the fan on there goes sounds like an airplane taken off okay all clear your clearance clearance i'll do roger oh that's one of the tribeca there's one more clearance you ever been to a turkish prison i said that one time someone who didn't get the joke that i've never seen an airplane they were like what yeah oh yeah who doesn't go there right you haven't seen the travel mags that turkish prisons are all the rage all the influencers on instagram are here you got pictures with the prisoners yeah i can go back i go sit down on the real you know i heard there's a growler in the fridge so yeah it's not gonna drink itself you know no no well you didn't spring for the new fancy self-driving drivers so [Music] hmm [Music] good it's pretty soft man a little it's kind of cold too long so well that's what we were saying maybe it's from putting all the flavoring in i mean this you want to guess how many shots are in this one six uh nope nope nope really more more oh won't be using this again that costs too much oh yeah this is this is like this is it it's like at least 100 pounds this is like around equivalent to like what 15 shots or so 15 shots yeah yeah plus the crushed uh specialty beam whatever that is uh one of the easiest flavors and it was a one a very strong one well even when i first started like that's when we still have the two fold i think of us and you can put like two or three shots in it yep yeah i mean all the shots if you look for the queen book they all used to be like like two shots at the most you know and now it's like at least three shots how'd it feel to be pulling out a batch again like riding a boy you guys want to see how long we can not talk to it won't last yeah i know no jake oh yeah do you really have to say it every time kevin it's really good it's like one of the best needs like as he's unwrapping it the whole office starts to look at him like yo put it down kevin don't feel like there's sales people too and they're like no no phone calls what are you looking at checking the time it's time for you to work max still two o'clock you got time to look for the clock when you you got too much time if you got time to look you've got time to work yeah work cody i'm not paying you to look at the clock you know some places at work that's a legitimate statement i'm not kidding you're a dalton i might want to keep the camera back yeah hurry up dad what am i paying you for um beer i i don't know what are you paying me for wait you're paying me uh no oh that's a first i meant you're paying me yeah what are you paying me for european european european if you're american when you go in the bathroom like just one of them these are really sticky yeah i noticed that they've been really sticking to the uh the metal cutterizer yeah yeah the metal smacky thing we even know all the technical terms of hercules yeah you lost me with all the technicalities uh sorry so we got so many different flavors that i figured we'd just do like a round table of each one so you guys want to start blue raspberry so this is the blue one blue raspberry i just got the slow motion video of this i didn't get actual videos appreciate the color good job max it does look very cotton candy it's kind of like the like we did the cream video with this that's this is actually gonna be the um the cotton candy replacement for now tastes just like a dum-dum mm-hmm it's not nice it's just like a smart smart that's really good though i really i feel like that flavor is nailed yeah well bananas now they got it all right so while we're doing vibrant flavors we'll do cranberry next so this is what the cranberry one looks like hey craig fyi we've done cranberry before so you don't have to do this one if you don't want to no uh we haven't done it whatever well like taste for sure okay yeah i dropped it so we're not doing this no we're doing [Music] that's really good it's pink it tastes more sweet than because i feel like usually cranberry juice is like kind of tart let's just taste sweet oh you guys eat it without me yeah no i can't eat it it's news you lose should we add citric acid do you think to the cranberry yeah oh craig said the juice tends to be tart depends what you want i think it tastes good yeah that's pretty good that's very cranberry this is like the biggest pizza arcane i've ever heard in my mouth so far so far [Music] no cigar green apple coming up you've been asking for this one for a while huh yeah yeah you know we finally got to it ready ready oh no are we doing that oh it's a tiny bit sour like i wouldn't describe it sour but oh yeah i got a little i got a little tart there it's not exactly a warhead but yeah just taste way more green apple than when we tasted it on the stick i think we got it reminds you a little of sour straws there's no sausage they could even be more sour how many citric acids did you use three three three three three three six three teaspoons or three tablespoons yep that's pretty good though i like that one nailed it didn't know it at the time so this one you can kind of see like a little flecks of vanilla i don't know if you can really see it on camera but in person and if you were to order it it's kind of hard to see yeah where would it be really close let me see this is going to be part of the um what do they call it oh it's going to be festive a taste of fallout name okay taste the fruit flavors fall unfriendly um the vanilla will be in there um we probably won't make this again because unless we do it separately it took about nine hundred dollars for the flavor it's seriously the most flavor we've ever finished there's something max and i wouldn't want to try a long time remember we tried the cherry vanilla once yeah and the vanilla wasn't very vanilla this this it didn't know when we tasted it on the stick it wasn't very vanilla-y do you have it in your mouth yeah like this it is now there are 15 out of here so now it is so i think that's gonna be awesome i really like this one are you more of a chocolate person craig no i think it's just like it's tough to get the flavor because like you saw like it tasted really weak now it tastes really strong are you a vanilla guy in general i think so usually yeah i'm still getting hard candy it tastes a little to me it tastes a little strong for vanilla i'm tasting the vanilla now but i think it's just right i like it is it good yeah it's good maybe if we did all extract instead of the extract and the flavoring like you know how we did the maple with the canadian maple and the regular maple and it kind of you know we kind of lost a little bit of the maple-ness and we did that with in a cream mm-hmm okay then we never had a maple pear candy hmm that would have been a good flavor well the reason we did is because it's so hard to get things mapley enough and to me it tastes more mapley because of the walnuts that we sprinkle on top yeah that brings out the maple otherwise it's not very maple you know you could put a whole bottle in there and it still wouldn't be very meat fully i believe this is coffee um cover up your face this one's coffee there we go pumpkin pumpkin coffee's got the street that's coffee the hat's like in real life does everybody here like coffee no poor crack that's coming through pretty good for someone who doesn't really like coffee though i kind of like this for me it's not like super overpowering or like it's not very bitter maybe that's why because there's a lot of sugar i don't remember caffeine yeah coffee with sugar kind of reminds me of the peanut butter molasses it kind of reminds me of like mocha flavored ice cream yeah i could drop one of these in your coffee well that's yeah right yeah coffee flavored coffee that would never work double coffee all right so the last one is pumpkin pumpkin saved the best food pumpkin pie pumpkin spice yes this is this is the best one and this is the that's the biggest piece of hard candy i'm ever going to have yeah it's a big that's a hawker mine's got diamonds huh why don't you special i can tell you're apparently is that what i always sounded like to you you could just see your legs [Music] and then you did the dance that's really good and this one even has a little texture to it because what you had we added actual pumpkin spice so you can get some little little granules of uh rice yeah i kind of like it i do do you grab something really good everybody's gonna like these this is good these are all good this is the best one really good that's a good slogan dad everyone's gonna like these it's good but this is the best horny stuff you should put that on a shirt you should put it on the building um what does that say yeah i like the pumpkin i mean i like them all but i'm glad we stopped for the pumpkin we did flavor i would eat pie crust pie i totally would i love pie crust wonder bread hard candy oh boy gravy okay i've been saying gravy like not ironically for a long time if we could fill ribbon candy with gravy what about gravy cream it'd be so good gravy cream yeah wrapped in turkey okay interesting i'd have a short shelf life yeah two hours really we can do mashed potato instead and it's then it's vegan if we use the vegetable shortly greg did honey baked ham and a bunch of thanksgiving yeah right i think he did cornbread he deserves stuffing wow the ham tasted just like him can't go wrong with pecan pie i'm pretty sure i saw um maybe brock's the company makes a candy corn i think they were doing some thanksgiving flavored stuff so they must have got the idea from greg yeah from lofty pursuits if you're wondering who we're talking about that is a lot of person soups it is ham flavored candy actually that one is pretty good just yeah the ham i like the stuffing one didn't really do it for me yeah but the ham i mean it could be sweet salty savory that all works i wonder if he's doing it again this year no probably i don't know i don't think he likes to repeat himself too much we love to review that all the time that's all we do yeah basically because people keep asking for it so we can make the people happy or not make the people happy it does seem to be a good business model to make the people happy maybe you should write that down you can sell it on a t-shirt i'll do that right now yeah all right good work guys okay hey guys littlejoe here reminding you to like the videos and subscribe [Music] paper", "rvn0xep-EsY": "hey guys Shayna here so today I'm a bit of a different video I'm going to teach you how to make homemade hard candy I'm gonna making watermelon flavored umm I've tried this recipe or a similar recipe once before and I accidentally burnt it so I'm hoping this is going to turn out a bit better I got a candy thermometer for Christmas I love candy so I'm gonna try to make some and I'll show you how to do it for your ingredients you will need two cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup you'll need one teaspoon or just one small container of candy oil I am using watermelon flavor you can use whatever you'd like and if you'd like I'm going to put a touch of red food coloring in it you're also going to need a saucepan a cookie sheet with parchment paper on it and a candy thermometer so we're going to start off by mixing in the water the sugar and the corn syrup you are going to put it on a medium heat in the saucepan once the sugar is completely stirred in and dissolve into the water then you're just going to let it sit no stirring and boil until it hits between 300 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit also make sure that you can zoom over to does not touch the bottom of the pan it has to be taking the temperature of the candy not the pan the mixture is just starting to boil but about 100 degrees to go make sure that you don't have it on too high of a temperature because you don't want to burn the sugar one thing with candy making is that you have to be quite patient it takes a while to boil if you have a gas stove that is better it's best to have constant heat on it it works on your ways but it does take a bit longer be patient we're now getting quite close to 300 degrees if your guys can do oil to make it flavored when you put it in be sure to keep your head away from the pan because it will send up some steam and it is a very very strong okay you have to be quite quick when you stir it together and make sure you take it off heat first that smells delicious drops are red that looks so good once everything is all mixed in you're going to have to pour it very carefully onto here you want it to be fairly thin you can also use lollipop molds if you have them I'm just going to make hard candy that we can snap later let's hope this works crazy color okay we are just going to let this sit now make sure it sits at room temperature you don't want put it in your fridge and afterwards we are going to break it apart and taste it looks like it looks so good and smells delicious well cuz stringy it is I don't know if you can see that what's quite hot still I've got such a nice flavor can't wait till that's hard one quick tip while this is cooling make sure your candy thermometer you clean it off completely so there's no like little chunks left because otherwise next time you make candy there's chunks you're going to get stuck and the candy will get stuck to the chunks it just it won't work properly so make sure you clean this very well hot water works good okay so the candy is hard now so you're going to peel it off and just break it to pieces and make sure you put it in a continuous a good seal on it comes off so nicely there you have it this is a very simple recipe maybe a bit finicky and it takes a while but how to make just an old-fashioned kind of standard hard candy uh I will leave the link down below where I found this recipe if you'd like to try to make it and yeah I will see you guys sometime soon thanks for watching watermelon I love candy you can replace sleep with exercise so his suggestion was sleep for six hours instead of eight and use those two hours to go for a run or bike ride get some exercise", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "9aCTRSJE2Fg": "hey give away this is Chuck here with another shisha review before I go into that on what I'm smoking i'm just going to tell you we got a huge buzz off of this so if i'm talking a little funny or mix up words reason why i am smoking Tangiers green apple candy going a little bit on the cut it is a really choppy movie see natural cut juicy moist and it's it's black I mean and smell illness um it kind of smells like the valley ranch or candy green apple just a little bit and this stuff has a very potent smell I mean you open up the container you're going to smell it from the classroom it does smell really good a little bit about my setup I'm using today using a my cutie with a vortex bowls with one and a half hour circles I found that would be the best use of the polls right heat management this stuff is not for beginners it has really hard time with heat management so you got to keep on moving coals and stuff like that now on to the teeth smoke of this I like to add something else to eat before you smoke this it if you don't you'll get a really really bad it does as you can see some smoke that's all right okay clouts I was getting bigger you just have to kind of trust me on that one getting big clods earlier I've been expecting this probably for about 20 minutes or so so you might have to add another cold or something to that affect the taste on this who like I said to buzz it's really bad taste on this I wish it pays a little bit more of what it smelled like almost has a little bit of hint of black licorice I'm not a big fan of black licorice taste it does have that little bit of pace as the Jolly Rancher green apple candy as well or a green apple jolly rancher as well but I'm still getting that hint of black with black licorice so that's going to affect the rating definitely the rating only going to give this I'm going to give this a six out of ten reason wise because of black licorice taste in it I'm like I said this is problem might be my fit time smoking Tangiers so hopefully i'll get some other Tangiers to solve a good Tanja's review on blueberry on hg check it out maybe some snozberries but for this this is definitely getting a six out of ten if you like the black licorice taste maybe try this out like I said do not try this if you're new to smoking hookah says also kick you on the butt yeah whatever I'm Chuck keep on smoking hg", "Pv58NamFqz8": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I am super super excited because we are reviewing a product I love a lot loved in my entire life love de ma since I've been four years old and we are reviewing Nutter Butter bytes the snack seals real peanut butter edition you can grab them you can share them you can zip them and take them anytime anywhere that is the Nutter Butter bytes promise the peanut butter lovers cookie I'm just [ __ ] with you we're actually reviewing peanut butter another butter bytes if you like Nutter Butter bytes but I've got these here because I'm actually out of my real substance Nutella which is what I like to take before I review any remedies that's right what we're really reviewing today is T key killers what a name T key killers gummies these guys right here they're coming fancy looking little T shapes kind of cool-looking so this is a 300 milligram edible green apple flavor and it cost me $15 at my dispensary got it at a $2 discount so 13 bucks if this is really a 300 milligram edible great deal I gotta admit I'm already a little apprehensive because one gummies rarely work for me outside of flourish and occasionally cookie or cushy punch and too rarely do you get these edibles that are cheaper that have a lot of milligram \u00e4j-- that actually seem to pan out it works sometimes sometimes you really do get good deals but often especially when they have sort of suspect packaging like tiki killers here which is just a ziploc bag and a couple of stickers they can be misleading because they really have no there's no regulation there's no reason that they can't about their mill agreement so why not outside I've screwing their customers I'm not suggesting they're doing that let's give them the full review here first and make sure and and and you know give them a fair shake but I'm just letting you know I'm a little apprehensive okay so as I said this is the TT killers 300 milligram apple green apple flavor if you've never tuned in 2 weeks before their way our reviews work is I'm going to eat this product maybe not the entire thing in front of you but I will eat this whole thing over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling or I'll just edited it through and you'll see me in a couple seconds and I'll say guys I'm super high or guys I'm super not high okay so here we go we've got one of the little gummy pieces right here it's actually a quite a little handsome gummy I like the sculpt on it quite a bit so let's go ahead and plop her in my mouth this is a very cool looking gummy well tasty no real cannabis taste good green apple tastes good get me taste some nice sugar coating on this outside good gummy um like the taste is that got me quite a bit help a lot better than like the infused creations or a tap here or any of those kind of gummies um but what it's really gonna have to come down to oh I could eat some Nutter butters I always like to have a little fat before I consume any gummy edibles just because the THC is fat activated so or as fat soluble normally I have Nutella but I'm out okay well I'm gonna finish off these Tiki killers and I will see you guys in two hours or through the magic of editing just a couple of seconds to let you know I'm feeling thanks for watching weights guys and I will see you in just a bit peace alright guys it's been two hours since I had the Tiki killer or killers Ikki I can't really remember which way it was to be honest than 300 milligrams which might be a good sign for the product because I am rather pleased with it I'm very surprised I was I was a doubting Thomas and Here I am in accepting Andrew it's not perfect I would say I'm at like a 6 right now but it tasted great I am hi I am unpleasantly hi and and for a dummy it was it's it's it's almost up there with flourish in terms of quality again it tasted really good no cannabis taste whatsoever I really like the design of the becoming I know that doesn't really mean much but hey I like it and it you know I tasted really good and I'm unpleasantly high I wish our maybe were just a little bit higher for a 300 more for an edible but you know I can't fault it too much because it is still one of the best companies I've ever had outside of flourish and so guys I'm really pleased with TP killer or killers EE I'm sorry I couldn't remember their name but I'm looking forward to reviewing some more of their products to see if they're gonna say nice and consistent and with that guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later review peace", "oJKnXFcpcUI": "tis I miss cannabis puree with more reviews for you today and today I've got these sublime products here elevated cannabis is a 10 milligram THC we've got this little sorrento cucumber cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom sublime products I love sublime products I've talked about them numerous times again the reason being is that they're really consistent these are no different than anything else and they are low dosage again 10 milligrams can you see it there 10 milligram THC I've already taken this because I already know what they do again they're so consistent that it doesn't matter from batch to batch they're always the same and what I think is important to discuss here is how they work and why they work for me and then maybe you can decide how they're going to work for you and if they'll work for you I take these as a preemptive strike these little goodies never make me feel high I never get that I'm high from THC feeling what I do feel is a ease of anxiety so when I know I'm gonna be in a stressful situation I take these beforehand for instance I ride my bike a lot there's a lot of places out here or there is no bike lane you know people just don't care either you do not get that three feet that they are supposed to allow between you and their vehicle they don't care there's none of that so a lot of times there is no bike lane I've got like this you know what's supposed to be the shoulder but it's just kind of where the asphalt kind of trails off into gravel and that little area I have to write it as usually filled with debris and rocks and things that I have to avoid so while I look as cool as a cucumber while I seem to not be worried about anything if you were to look at my hand you would see that I would just Knight white-knuckling it you know I'm just gripping so hard but these help a lot with the anxiety and it's why I look as cool as a cucumber because these help with a lot with that I usually would take them excuse me like maybe an hour and have two hours before I knew I was gonna be in the situation and they just smooth out that edge so I'm not in a situation where I go from anxiety panic attack it is very scary riding your bike on the side of the road because people are insane anyone who rides their bike knows this and you don't have to have PTSD to have that anxiety so if you you know bright a lot like I do I'm not gonna allow my fear to stop me from living my life so these candy has helped so much with that all right so I'm done talking about how great they are this also helps a social anxiety by the way social anxiety again they won't make you feel high they won't interfere at all for me anyway because there are such a low dosage didn't they just help smooth the edges now let's talk about the flavor these two that I have I've had one before it this one I have not tried yet so I'll try here but this one if you are a fan of spicy stuff which I am I love spicy it's got a nice little heat to it it's not spicy enough for me so it's not like flaming hot level but there's a little heat you know you feel in the back of your throat as you're sucking on it and the cucumber is really nice and refreshing so this is a really good choice I have other flavors of this that I like but this one definitely is is a go-to if you like a little spice and you like a little heat definitely this one now this one I haven't had so I'm gonna try it and let you know what I think mmm they come packaged individually so whether you know this was a sample this was is what I got at 4:20 hey from Phoenix suspensory and my swag bag I was so happy that I got sublime goodies oh shoot I need my scissors hold on so I find it difficult I find it difficult to cut these open on my own I mean you can't with your teeth but there's so much easier just use some scissors you know use the tools available to you in life so such as blossom then my first thought was tangerines hmm like those little halo candies but now it's kind of devolved back into like lifesavers orange that's what it tastes like lifesavers orange so the initial yumminess in my mouth it's still good but the initial mmm tangerine kind of went to orange flavor it's good I like it I'm pretty sure something have the same effect I mean as everything else does that sublime makes yeah okay so anyway this is gonna be short one there's really nothing more for me to talk about sublime products the flavors of these candies are good they're not too sweet for a hard candy I think that's great I don't want too much sugar even though I love it and I know that's important for some of you would diabetes so not too sweet these are really great 10 milligram THC again cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom both great helped a lot with anxiety if you want to get a high off of them I'd eat a bunch but keep in mind there's only five in a pack I got these for $8 I believe I eight dollars five and a five of these little candies so 50 milligram is basically for eight bucks which is not bad it's pretty much in line with everything else but again if you need the high feeling take more than one then then just figure out what your dosages for you as with everything else so I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this candy you all have a great day thanks for stopping by if you like my videos and you want to see more just subscribe to my page please maybe like the videos let me know you're

know what you're doing and more comfortable like not way too hot [Music] if you haven't dealt with these batches yeah yeah that's probably why dad has you do that part right yeah especially the hardest part of the whole first part not sick or anything right oh you drinking water after this bed right then maybe water water yep water you go is there a better size like this yeah just keep doing yeah I don't get how you like move so slow when you're doing it like you see I have to like constantly keep my hands mm-hmm know when you're doing it like you're just a lot more like intentful with like your movement mine is like I have to do it like this so that it might come down just be great thank you when I first started doing this I'm good all frenzied like trying to get it all straight now am i doing right okay you know after the last couple rafters I've been looking through them and like okay the pillows look fine there's no real awful on but uh you follow through I really like that they paint purple [Music] tongue that we got last year oh yeah you still have oh yeah keep that thing forever it looks we like to talk yeah it does everywhere we took a snapchat picture and I think I told people to oh you know what I think it was on a live stream and I think I told people to screenshot it and then they like posted it on Instagram and stuff and so input let's have you filter on you or something I think someone put like a puppy filter on you or something like that it's funny cuz like with the tongue sticking out I didn't even have to have the taunting out it already wellness like floating around the internet somewhere man ever take you seriously again yeah never got a job anywhere else why did why was not aired well we saw a picture of you and there's nobody else

coming down [Music] yeah seems like a tab it's like a little under 240 yes there's a little time to kill for three o'clock I'm on three we go a start load before before the batch starts mean I'm sure people won't complain I'll give people some time to file until don't miss anything Hey that's all right now [Music] you [Music]", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "4d0b-tIUsis": "let's make some candy together this is my second\u00a0\ntime making it and i am going to try a new recipe\u00a0\u00a0 i want to try to make the butter toffee so i\u00a0\nhave butter sugar corn syrup i have flavorings\u00a0\u00a0 and the tart and sour and food coloring and let\u00a0\nme show you the molds that i'll be using i have a\u00a0\u00a0 thermometer it's not a candy thermometer\u00a0\nit's a meat to my thermometer but it works\u00a0\u00a0 well and we have the lollipop and the lip\u00a0\nlollipop molds and just regular candy molds now what i'm going to do with my\u00a0\nflavors i'm going to go ahead and mix my\u00a0\u00a0 sugar corn syrup and butter and let it start\u00a0\nto boil up and then what i do is mix my\u00a0\u00a0 flavorings and food colorings in these\u00a0\nlittle cups here and i pour them in at once\u00a0\u00a0 all together once it reaches the 300 degree which\u00a0\nis crack candy stage and then i just um stir it\u00a0\u00a0 and it's done i don't know if i'm able to\u00a0\nshow you all that on here but let me try\u00a0\u00a0 this particular recipe i'm gonna use one whole\u00a0\nstick of butter two cups of sugar and maybe a half\u00a0\u00a0 a cup of corn syrup and see how that turns out the\u00a0\nmain thing is to get it into the crack candy phase\u00a0\u00a0 the first time i made myself call myself making\u00a0\nalcohol lollipops and i put too much alcohol they\u00a0\u00a0 turned out good and they did the job they actually\u00a0\ngot me tipsy but they were soft like toffee okay the butter's melting i'm gonna\u00a0\ngo ahead and pour my corn syrup\u00a0\u00a0 that i have measured out already\u00a0\nhalf a cup and then the sugar um\u00a0\u00a0 i am using a stainless steel sauce pan i got it\u00a0\nfrom walmart for like 12 they say the best one to\u00a0\u00a0 use is aluminum and then the second best is copper\u00a0\nbut this one worked just as fine it worked perfect go ahead and put the sugar up and i'll\u00a0\nshow you when it comes the butter is\u00a0\u00a0 boiling let me get the sugar in\u00a0\nand then i'll show you that boil so you also must use a metal spoon go ahead and\u00a0\ngive that a stir real quick just because i want to\u00a0\u00a0 get that sugar dissolved so it can start boiling\u00a0\nup and then i'm going to check the temperature\u00a0\u00a0 i put the top on i'm gonna let it get the boil\u00a0\ngoing and um then we'll put the thermometer in\u00a0\u00a0 the digital thermometer and i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\nand get my flavoring and food colorings ready\u00a0\u00a0 i want to make two different color\u00a0\ncandies so i'm gonna after i get\u00a0\u00a0 this to a certain temperature\u00a0\nbefore i pour my flavoring in\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna actually pour half of this into\u00a0\nhere so that i can um you know get two flavors while that's some boiling up we'll go ahead\u00a0\nand put our sticks in this i'm gonna have to\u00a0\u00a0 use the smaller sticks i'm glad i got some oh\u00a0\nmaybe i need the smaller sticks for holidays\u00a0\u00a0 yeah let me get my small sticks one more got the\u00a0\nsticks in and on these i think i'm gonna put the\u00a0\u00a0 candy in first and then the stick as it starts\u00a0\nto harden these does not require stick let's go\u00a0\u00a0 check on the um boiling mixture so it's boiling\u00a0\nup and what you do is you don't stir it you just\u00a0\u00a0 let it boil but let's go ahead and um see what the\u00a0\ntemperature is i have to get it to at least 300. let's see how fast it's going to change\u00a0\nit's going fast it's 144 158 170 already 180\u00a0\u00a0 89 always getting on up there okay i'm gonna\u00a0\nlet it get to 300 and then i'm gonna separate\u00a0\u00a0 it let me get my flavors ready i didn't do that\u00a0\nyet but i'm about to but this is moving fast\u00a0\u00a0 okay someone made this with strawberry and the\u00a0\nsour tart and we're gonna put a little red in that\u00a0\u00a0 make some red candy i hope that's enough\u00a0\nand this we're gonna put a little green and at once once this reach let's check this again saying 95 let's check it see how fast it moves up and i wanted to burn you got to get\u00a0\nto about 300 that's going pretty fast let me turn the stove down a\u00a0\nlittle bit once that's all 247 when i get it with 300 guys because i'm\u00a0\nusing one hand oh it's getting up there\u00a0\u00a0 and i'll show you what on\u00a0\nhow i put these flavors in but anyway you get the idea let me get that stirred and i'll be back\u00a0\nand then we got to pour it in and the molds okay guys it definitely got the correct\u00a0\nstage um perfection it started like\u00a0\u00a0 like setting like hardening up\u00a0\nreally quick let me show you\u00a0\u00a0 first time i made it in get the heart cracks\u00a0\ncandy i can tell it did not because it has\u00a0\u00a0 all these little pieces that is hard and\u00a0\nstringy so i'm excited about this the flavor show you the end results before i show the\u00a0\nresults i just want to show you i'm gonna have\u00a0\u00a0 to figure out but these look pretty good these\u00a0\ncircles but i'm gonna have to figure out a way\u00a0\u00a0 to get this stuff in here smooth so i can have\u00a0\nmy proper shape i noticed that it works better\u00a0\u00a0 than the silicone mold i just tasted like\u00a0\npieces from the end guys and this is a very\u00a0\u00a0 very good flavor so if you want to ramp up\u00a0\nyour flavor and your hard candies add butter\u00a0\u00a0 along with flavors and sweet and tart otherwise\u00a0\nit'll just taste like sugar it'll be pretty\u00a0\u00a0 with different colors but it'll\u00a0\njust take like sugar and water so these are the final results and they\u00a0\ncame out really good as far as the texture\u00a0\u00a0 and the flavor came out amazing these are\u00a0\nthe first ones that i made with the alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 they didn't come out so pretty but they were\u00a0\nperfectly flavor i put them in a refrigerator\u00a0\u00a0 and they're a little bit harder but they still\u00a0\nend up being a toffee like texture before you\u00a0\u00a0 finish eating it but it's delicious and\u00a0\nyou can actually feel the alcohol in it\u00a0\u00a0 these definitely got to um crack\u00a0\ncandy stage the green is really good\u00a0\u00a0 but the um red i put a little bit too much flavor\u00a0\nin it that flavoring is really concentrated so you\u00a0\u00a0 have to be very very careful and light-handed\u00a0\nwith the flavorings but that tart sour that\u00a0\u00a0 you can be heavy-handed with it i really like the\u00a0\nflavor of the green but i'm getting better at it thank you all for watching please\u00a0\nlike share and subscribe and have\u00a0\u00a0 a wonderful day night evening morning\u00a0\nwhatever time you're in at the moment", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before stay tuned for this great recipe thanks for watching", "RYraNBvmjAo": "hey what's up mixer today we're going to be talking about apples apples apples apples apples are probably the most versatile fruit out there there's no other fruit that touches the versatility of the apple the Apple can bend into so many different variations it has such a great sweetness about it it's got a wonderful texture and it really just pairs up well with everything if you're a new mixer I highly suggest that you pick up all the apples I'm going to be talking about today in this video and maybe even a few more that I don't talk about because I promise you you're going to be using them a lot if you enjoy foods and candies and you like a vape that has a really nice fresh sweetness about it it's just unrivaled in its versatility and it's a fruit that will last you very long because you're going to be able to use it in almost any of your recipes so I have a few apples here that are usually the apples that I like to go to when I need a specific apple flavoring now when I say apple flavoring that doesn't just mean I need a flavoring that tastes like an apple it might be I need some nice sweetness that will pair up nicely with the fruits that I have or I need a flavor that's going to help drive some bends or I'm going to need a fruit that has some kind of crispy freshness about it at Apple kind of covers all of those spectrums and the apples that I have right here are the ones that pretty much cast the widest net in terms of what I need is versatility and what I can pair them up with now the first thing I want to talk about is the king of all King a pelear arts Fuji this is the King Apple when I say the King I mean it's the Apple that packs the most punch it's the Apple that has the most flavor if the Apple that has the most sweetness it's the Apple that really packs its own flavor and probably the least versatile of the bunch meaning you're not going to really be able to put this in a recipe and not taste it and just get its accents or just get its uses whatever you use this you're going to taste it in your recipe and that is a great thing if you need a really nice apple flavor now this is based on the Fuji apple which is more of like a reddish yellowish apple it's got a really nice bright sweetness about it it's got a little bit of texture but you're really taking this for its top note and its sweetness the top note kind of lends into like I said that yellow Golden Delicious red style Fuji apple if you've ever had a Fuji album before this flavor tastes a lot like it except more of a candied version of it and if you're mixing things that are like candy then you're really going to enjoy this one this also being flavor art it's pretty potent so you really only need like 1% if you're really trying to max out its flavor I've used it at a half a percent a quarter of a percent I've also gone up to 2 percent depending on my uses for it and generally the old and generally this is the Apple that I choose when I need a nice bright apple flavor if I need an apple flavor within my fruit cocktail or if I'm maybe making some kind of apple bakery or some kind of apple candy this is the Apple that I like to choose because it has such a great and and vivid flavor whatever you put this in it's going to create a very saturated vape and that's why I really enjoy this ingredient and this like I said has the least versatility about it because it's just such a potent flavor it's such a unique flavor it's going to come out it's easy to kind of harness with fruits like pineapple fruits like lemon or even some heavier fruits like raspberries or pomegranate but it does really well in all those situations on all those fruits it's just difficult to kind of hide and only use its sweetness or only use its crispness one of my favorite recipes that use this flavoring is goldfishes apple butter it's a great Apple caramel butter recipe and it just showcases you the potential that Fuji has a really good recipe I highly recommend that you go try it link down in the description and the next fruit that we're going to be talking about is green apple and this is both green apple and natural green apple by flavor west and there's other green apples out there but I find flavor west to be the most vivid and the most potent the National green apple is very much like the regular green apple except a little bit softer now I did a live mixing not too long ago where we remixed a carnage by animal and I use green apple to give the recipe that kind of plastic artificial gummy flavor that comes with you know Twizzlers and that comes with gummy bears and candies that have like a chewy artificial quality about them Apple does that in a great way and it also pairs itself up really well with other fruits like strawberry like dragon fruit like raspberry like mango like pineapple all these traditional fruits the green apple pairs up really really well this is a lot more versatile than Fuji but still saying it's not as versatile as the others that we're going to be talking about but you're still going to be able to use this in a lot of situations mainly and recipes that call for somewhat of a candy like property if you're also trying to add someone of a sourness to your recipe green apple is a great way to do so because it packs a little bit of that sourness and that tartness alongside of the the pairing capabilities of it it really gives you a lot of uses now this ring IV is anywhere between 1 all the way up to 5 percent it really depends on what you're trying to use it for if you're using it to bend certain things if you're using it in your candy keeping it on the lower end around like one or two percent is probably your best bet but feel free to bump it up anytime you feel that the other flavorings next to this flavoring kind of cover it up you can absolutely turn this up to as high as you need to to get the most flavor out of it next we're going to be talking about is anywheres two apples now this flavoring is really interesting it's probably the most unique of all the apples this flavoring is a cross between a green apple and a red apple like a McIntosh Apple it has a really nice tartness about it in its body but it also pairs that up with like a nice sweetness of the red apple because of that it makes this flavoring extremely versatile you can use it in so many different recipes to give your recipes an apple like flavor or you can use it to bend certain flavorings into something else you can use it to just give it some sweetness you can use it to kind of give it some partners there's a lot of use cases for this flavoring and it's delicious there's also like an apple cider like quality to this as well so using this in tobacco's is a great idea to kind of give them an Apple tinge and it's very authentic it's very much taste like it just too compressed green apples and red apples just push down into juice and just squeezed into this bottle it's an excellent flavoring and it's potent as well I've used this for anywhere from a half a percent all the way up to three percent you don't really need too much of this flavoring to get the most out of it I don't use this flavoring enough it's a really delicious flavoring that just really helps Drive fruits and drag bends into anything you need that has a more subtle sweetness about it so for instance if you're trying to make a caramel pear recipe this will be a great flavoring to use to kind of Bend the pear to keep it so quality about it give it some more sweetness so it doesn't get bogged down by the caramel and allow it to break through the recipe and have that somewhat tartness about it and that's what I mean by driving the bend this flavoring is used to take other flavorings and turn them into something else that drives them to turn into something else and because it has that top note of the red apple and the bottom sourness of the green apple it makes it extremely versatile definitely pick this one up and last it is probably the most versatile flavoring of the bunch it's cappellas double apple this is basically just a red apple so the very inside of a red apple almost like a gala Apple where it has like a really kind of gritty texture to it when you bite into a gala Apple you have that delicious Apple like texture and that's my favorite part about this flavoring it really gives that texture very very well it's very subtle on its flavor its subtle on top note its subtle on its sweetness but that makes it even more versatile and if you're talking about driving then this is the flavoring that you're going to want to use it can just take flavors add a little bit of sweetness to them and give them that Apple like texture that it needs to really stand out and make a recipe great and add that dimension of texture to your recipe a great example of using this to bend the flavor is my water melone recipe that I just released I also did a live mixing on this last week a lot of watermelon flavorings leave out that texture you don't get that kind of Apple like texture that makes a watermelon so authentic the Capella's double apple as that texture in there keeps the sweetness there as well and doesn't disrupt any of the flavor so I use this to drive the bend of the dragon fruit as well as the four watermelon into a much more authentic watermelon flavoring I highly recommend you go check out that recipe it's delicious and it really showcases what bending can do and double Apple is the secret weapon in that ingredient this is also flavoring that you kind of need a little bit more of three to four percent on the lower end but you can turn this up to like five six percent don't go too high though because then it will start to move your recipes now before I get out of here I just want to tell you the amount of versatility within these flavorings what kind of flavorings you can make just out of apples starting with watermelon strawberry hair Quin dragon fruit passionfruit cherimoya one on star fruit Kiwi white great white peach pomegranate agave prickly pear guava it's just crazy there's so many flavor profiles that are compatible with apple the sky's the limit really it's really up to your creativity what you can do with Apple so get out there go pick up a bunch of apples go play around with them use them to kind of bend certain flavors try to do your best to see how you can turn different flavorings by using Apple into other flavorings and I guarantee you're going to have a lot of fun doing it it's really fun to try to bend certain things into other things and it just gives you a new level of dimension it gives you a new tool set to use in your recipes it allows you to add many dimensions to your recipes that you didn't think we're possible because there's just they don't have those flavorings on the market or the other flavorings just don't do it quite as

packaging is fire the thing is I don't know if I've ever actually seen the candy I've only seen the rapper's perilla I think they don't taste as good cuz they're in a bag I think they taste better

episode I'm going to show you right now and we're going to take that glycerin when we're done and we're gonna bring it over to Betty Crocker's house and we're gonna make some hard candy for a cinnamon candy for Christmas so enjoy the episode alright in this this method was a very slow process where we used about 8 grams of cannabis and we put it in this jar and we barely covered it with the first month with the vegetable glycerin now the vegetable glycerin is a solvent that is its aggressive as far as stripping those cannaboids out of the out of the plant but over time they it loses its potency so the slow process every month what I've done is I've tagged the jar when we started on a 9 18 then on 10 18 I added some more vegetable glycerin that I did again on 11 23 so it's been in the process now for three months so it's a very slow process as far as stripping that all out what we did was we debacle eyes the cannabis before I added it into the jar remember how we debacle eyes it we just take our cannabis put it on a cookie sheet and we bake it in the oven at 250 degrees for 25 minutes that activates the THC on the plant then we put it in a jar we added our vegetable glycerin and each month we added a little bit more since the vegetable glycerin loses its potency after a couple of couple of weeks okay so I've got a pretty good basin here of paste we're at the point now where we're ready to strain it alright so I've got my pirates dish under here and I've got a cheesecloth I've doubled also going through the wire mesh so this will take a little while because it's like a syrup so it'll take a while to strain out this mixture or tincture it's gonna be pure confused to the THC so you we can use this for edibles you can also use it to smoke in your be sick but this can be used in your gummies in edibles the remember the vegetable glycerin is that it's a sweet solvent so you can use it in all kinds of cooking and foods but it's can also be used in your your cigarette paper you know for smoking if you vape so forth the babe juice ecig juice you can see it's coming out pretty clear so we'll continue that process and let me keep straightening this out and I'll get back with you okay and here's our finished product I put it in another jar but that's what we got out of our vegetable glycerin fully infused now THC so now we can use this to inject it in our cartridges for ecig it's an occluding cig jewy sig juice or we can use this to infuse gummies and cooking and so I thought what we do is we're gonna take some of this and we'll go over to Betty Crocker's house and see if we can't put some of this into some holiday cinnamon hard rock candy all right they are making hard candy we're gonna use three and a quarter cups of sugar 3 and 3/4 cup sugar okay one and a half cups of light corn syrup 1 cup of water and then we'll put our flavoring medium heat until all the sugar dissolves you know mixing it all up so it dissolves I'm gonna bring it up to a boil all right so the sugar is now is all out of boil we've got a thermometer in there and it's a candy thermometer we want to make sure that we do not go beyond the 310 all right the sugar will change color really I guess to be done there overdone so monitor the temperature okay I think what you now is almost at 310 and now we're just gonna keep our eye on and then we'll add the food coloring and the cinnamon oil a lot of flavoring you add this will clear out your sinuses hold that cinnamon oil and you just do it till the color you want I'll just do one pan clean out your sign okay get ready I'll just pour one pan and give it to you right for our texture in their thin if you read if it's too much that's faster with my I like to spread it out there then there's a better - it's not marriage good if it's too thick I'd say within a half-hour I just take something heavy you smell that soon I take mine all right we're back from Betty Crocker's house we a little shout out thank you for showing us how to make this hard candy and we've got these two here that have been infused with THC and this one is a plain okay now that they should be hard enough all we got to do is just could be the copper plate but those would be nice too so now we'll bag them all up and we got some hard candy to travel with these are pretty good excellent great holiday tree well I hope you enjoyed this episode of how to make hard candy and infuse it for the holiday little shout out for our costumes by the roof up and a little shout out for our special guest Betty Crocker thanks and have

little taste oh my god what's going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of tommy the bartender and today we're gonna be making moonshine now this is something i've never really actually drank before i've only had moonshine once in my entire life and i saw like a like a recipe on how to make moonshine with like a gyre i'm not jolly rancher a starburst so i kind of think well i'm not really the biggest fan of starburst so maybe let's try like a giant rancher so i did a little research and i i've um this is for what i came up with what i want to do is what i'm going to be showing you guys today so we are going to be doing um our green i mean jesus our blue raspberry which is going to be blue raspberry uh jolly rancher and then we're going to be doing our watermelon jar rancher and we're going to be doing green apple jolly ranchers so what what you're going to be needing today are three massive freaking mason jars you're going to be eating some everclear you're going to be needing some of this simple syrup i couldn't find the flavored simple syrup to go along with the flavors of the jar ranchers i went to like five different stores so we're just gonna be using the plain simple syrup you're gonna be needing some lemon lime soda so i'm using 7up and some sort of measuring utensil alright so let's get things started so the first thing you're going to want to do is you're going to want to take off the top of all your mason jars okay so now the next thing you're going to want to do is take all your jolly ranchers and put them right into the mason jar [Music] okay okay so now the next step you're going to want to take is you're going to need need your everclear so you're going to each mason jar is going to be needing 40 ounces of everclear so i have only enough to do two so my last one is just going to be a bunch of extra vodka that i have so i i i don't know what brands i'm pretty sure it's tito's and some other sort of brand of vodka i'm going to put it in there so this is just kind of a mixed one for the blue so let's get started for the the alcohol part here we go look at that massive everclears we got 95 alcohol hopefully i don't die after this is made [Music] stinks of pure apple okay so that's 40 ounces of everglade that took freaking forever so we're going to pour it into our green apple and i filled up most of the freaking mason jar okay so now the next thing you're going to want to do is you're going to want to take your seven up so you it calls for eight ounces of seven up so i'm gonna put in a little bit more than eight ounces just to kind of maybe um water down part of like that alcoholic flavor just add a little extra flavor in here okay so now the last step you're going to want to need is for your moonshine is you're going to need your two ounces of your flavored syrup or plain syrup as i am using so you need two ounces of this okay and after that you take it you give it a nice freaking shake and fill up this whole freaking thing here okay so now you give it a nice shake so now let's do that for the rest of our mason jars [Music] oh [Music] okay so now that we're done with our mason jars filled with our moonshine everclear flavor and vodka flavor okay so now the next thing you're going to want to do is you're going to want to let these sit until the candy in the bottom absorbs you know it kind of absorbs in with the alcohol and disappears so once that that disappears then your moonshine is ready to be served drink and have fun with and drink responsibly when you do that okay so now what else you're going to want to be doing is periodically throughout you know the process of everything coming together you're going to want to you know give everything a nice little shake every now and again like house i'm doing so like i don't know every like hour or so just come in you know come into wherever you're leaving it and just give it a nice shake so the next part after this is gonna be our tasting of our moonshine so let's jump into that and we are back it is currently the next day and our moonshine is ready to ready for its taste test so hopefully this came out pretty good the alcohol percentage is high in the everclear one so i'm a little bit nervous on trying it but we'll give it a shot and i'll let you know my opinion so let's open it back up doesn't smell so good here i got a little taste oh my god tastes like freaking rubbing alcohol oh my god it's disgusting don't it's so bad it literally tastes like rum and alcohol that we put in the hand sanitizer it's literally what it tastes like all right here it goes here goes the next one same thing ever clear i mean this one smells a little better it tasted good going in your mouth but you get that that alcohol that apple taste this one was better than the green one was just straight nasty but this one's a little better okay let's go to our third one jesus freaking gross so remember now the blue one the blue raspberry one is vodka so we use tito's so this should taste a little better so hopefully this one is better than the freaking last few we just the last two we just had so it smells a lot better anyway and i hope this one's good i hope one of them is good so let's hope this one is good now this actually is pretty good pretty decent pretty good this blue raspberry one okay so if you guys decide to make this at home do vodka don't do this everclear crap okay so the vodka one was a success and i thought this one was gonna be the failure but the everclear one is just gross like it's honestly not even worth probably having but if you want to do the real way i say maybe try and get like a less percentage of the everclear so maybe do like a 50 maybe this is 95 and we use 99 rubbing alcohol in the freaking hand sanitizer so this literally that's what it tasted like flavored rubbing alcohol it's freaking gross but this one was pretty good so this one it's definitely good to taste you know take as like a shot or something but you can also probably mix it down with something put it in and like use it as a mixer and some sort of like a juice or a soda or something so this one i would say is definitely a hundred percent of a success it actually did it tasted not that bad straight up and i'm not a straight up type of person but this is for it wasn't that bad okay so conclusion don't use everclear use the vodka okay so that kind of wraps up our second episode of tommy the bartender and the question for you guys is what do you what type of bartending videos do you want to see what kind of drinks you want me to make so let me know your suggestions in the comment section down below alrighty guys so that's going to wrap up our second episode of of time of the bartender if you like this

"VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "5gHdJR6DuXY": "[Music] hey guys it's angie from the squishy monster column and today i'm going to share with y'all something very exciting I don't watch any TV at all but I will make an exception for the Walking Dead and Breaking Bad which is premiering this Sunday and I wanted to have something fun to accompany me instead of Junior Mints or the conventional popcorn I'm going to tap these in my purse and snap on them throughout the night watching this premiere it's going to be shattered blue hard candies so hang out with me and I'll show you exactly how to whip this up these are the only ingredients that you'll need so it's super simple very easy and quick so you'll need some sugar I have some regular granulated sugar and then drip in some corn syrup and if you first spray it with a little bit of cooking spray it'll slip right out just like this and then third and clean after everything is cooked together and bubbly you want to add in a little bit of color and it's not important like with buttercream to use gel because it won't really affect the consistency so you can use your inexpensive blue water color in this instance then you just want to go in there and give it a nice whisk and you're going to add in that blue color in that tin after it's bubbly so just mix it's going to be clumpy it's totally fine and then when it's all mixed together you can add in some chili powder I'm just kidding but you can add in a little bit of salt to kind of balance out the sweetness from the corn syrup and from the sugar so I'm going to pop this in the microwave covered with plastic for about three minutes and different microwave temperatures will vary depending on how strong it is but you can also do this over the stovetop if you like but how easy-peasy is the microwave you just pop it in there so I didn't forget it just taking out my cup at the three minute mark and it'll be a light amber color and you want to be careful and slowly take off the plastic because you're going to discard this one and put a new one on top because you don't want that condensation to kind of beep in there so take that off you don't want to stir and you want to cover it with the new plastic and pop it in there for an extra three minutes and just keep your eye on it because you don't want it to be an overflowing sticky mess so just be near and make sure the vessel that you filled your candy in is large enough to kind of hold it all together this is the part you want to work really fast you want to uncover the plastic and then drip in little drops of your blue color and now you can start be very quick about it this is all and if you want to you can put some flavorings in here at this moment as well and I have some parchment or some soap at standing by because I want to pour it on there and let it harden so be careful because it is hot sugar and just pour it onto your prepared surface look at that how cool looking is that this would be really cool to do with your kids as long as you're watching them after about 15 minutes time cooling in the refrigerator it is now ready to smash into a million shimmering pieces so to get those little pieces you want to shatter them with I'm using a mortar pestle just that part of it or you can use the bottom of a dull knife or really anything you can use a rolling pin and just kind of crack over it but now comes the fun part you can just go in there and smash what you end up with are these blue sparkling sapphire pieces like this and you can put them in little glass pane or little candy bags or whatever you want to serve them in and they're really fun and perfect for breaking bad [Music]", "VJgbvQ3UQF8": "hey pennsylvania patients it's me again we got a little distillate and some organic vegan gluten-free non-gmo lollipops to melt down and add the distillate and pour it into some of these molds there's 60 of these lollipops we're going to take them apart put them all in the pot to melt them down and see how many hard candies we can make well that took some time was stressful it's sticky but it's beautiful so let's melt it down and add some distillate it's like rainbow bright colors i'm going to start it on medium melting this down you want to just kind of keep stirring that see how it locks up and then we're gonna add once it's all melted so 60 lollipops and a half gram of distillate let's see if we get around 30 of them i don't know i'm trying everything's sticky like my feet everything's sticky but this is almost melted down it's pretty viscous add the distillate to this melted and even we have a measuring cup in the oven at 200 degrees just to warm it up pour this into that pour it into the molds [Music] oh way to break all them [Music] really has to despite the fact that this broke that glass cut me real bad we have 23 candies and i'll do a taste test in a little bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's 23 all together if we had used a gram of the distillate and we made 23 it would be about 35 milligrams a serving so since we used a third of a gram it would be one-third of that so we're talking like 11 milligrams each it's nice to have hard candy again let's try one out [Music] one two", "fZwPhSCIlLI": "today I'm going to be making cinnamon rock candy it's actually a pretty easy thing to do except it takes a long time to do it about an hour but it doesn't have very many ingredients as long as you can babysit it for a while you're good to go it's actually a pretty easy thing to do so I have 3 and 3/4 cup sugar 1 more 1 and 1/4 cup of corn syrup 1 cup of water and you'll need a teaspoon of red food coloring and a teaspoon of cinnamon oil and you can get the cinnamon oil at a cake food store they don't normally sell it or you can buy it online now you're gonna dump your sugar in the corn syrup the water you'll do a teaspoon the red food coloring turn it on to medium-high heat and what you're going to do stir it in all together will start to melt together here but this will become very syrupy you're going to let this boil on medium high heat stirring occasionally and this process takes about 15 minutes to do to get it to boil ok so when it comes to a boil then I have to take a lid and stick that on there for three minutes okay so now my sugar crystals are all dissolved so I'm going to take the lid off and mature my fan on now and it's going to be nice so then I'm going to take now I'm going to take my candy thermometer stick it right on the edge just like that I'm gonna go up I need it to get to 300 degrees before I can call it good here so it'll just go up a little bit and this will process will probably take about 20 to 25 minutes depending on how high your so yours going to leave it you don't stir it you just let it go and you'll let it boil and come check it often okay so well that's just cooking we're going to prepare for our next part of this and you want to get like an ax I think this is 11 by 16 just a piece of tinfoil so it's got a wall on each side because you don't want your candy sticking to the pan at all for touching the pan so once you get that done you're gonna take either butter or margarine something doesn't matter and what I do I stick it on a napkin I know this is weird but I'm give it a good heavy coat because it is hard to get the candy off of this if it is not buttered it's just about done I'm going to dump a teaspoon of cinnamon oil in that and then I'm going to take it over here and I know this is a crazy setup but it really does work I've set a fan I'm going to open my window and all the steam from the sin roll because it's very potent is going to go out the window and not in my house and I'm going to dump it on my tray here that we've got buttered okay this is ready to go so I'm going to take this down I'm going to be very careful and you should too nuts you don't want to burn the inside of your nose and so I'm going to shut my heat off dump that in I'm going to turn my fountain it's not going to do anything until I stir it and then it's going to go crazy let me get out of the way make sure it's good and stir it in they're going down here is not open here we go now we're going to do this select your cow don't try to scoop it out or just whatever's in there they kind of rock it back a core just to make sure it's to the corners and there's your tray of silicon okay so once it's hardened for about 45 minutes I will go ahead and put a piece of wax paper over the top of it to keep it from getting stuff on it and so it's nice for you and you can keep it like this for overnight if you need to so next thing I'm going to do I'm going to leave this on here while I crack it so I've washed at the end of a hammer and I'm just going to take it and that's it so I got to do okay so the next part after you have hammered it you're going to flip it over and so the wax paper is now on the bottom and I've already peeled off all of the tinfoil so you just peel it off and put that aside so this is kind of what it looks like any next you're going to take some powdered sugar and I have a sifter and you can sprinkle it on but I feel like this does a pretty good job and what I do is just sift it over the candy and then once you're done you call it good then what you do you can get little gift bags like this I like to get them after Christmas every year because then they're super cheap not that they're already cheap but they're now they're super cheap and then you just take your little scooper here up with the bait down so you can see and I'm guessing I can do about ten ten bags worth per batch that I do but I don't seal them up until I know for sure that I have enough in each bag so that's it and what I'll do is just take a little tie tie it around and sometimes I'll even so there's your little cute bag of candy it's really fun sometimes they'll take ribbon and put it around - and tied someone's name on it but that's how you make cinnamon candy from start to finish um thanks for listening", "HmClCY2OJS0": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary and I thought today since I have to go to the hospital later in the week that we can make a nice edible to take with me I've decided for this edible on using a Cresco RSO a nice sativa blend you know can't go wrong has some cbgc BC THC so what's next what do we do with it after trying lots of different ways to try to make different edibles and doing baking I really wanted to make some hard candies I don't want to get a candy thermometer I don't want to boil sugar and corn syrup so I found something about melting down Jolly Ranchers and then just pouring them into a mold and doesn't that kind of sound fantastic if it works hooey you already kind of know it works as I showed you so you want to see how we did it we just bought Samara so and I have a ton of Jolly Ranchers 22 and we're gonna try to make some melted down Jolly Ranchers and add the RSO and these levels this is gonna be real time-consuming taking them all apart separating them crushing them up and then hopefully make it easier to melt the fam well it's we're gonna use strawberry and pineapple watch this like now let's crush it up [Music] so we're probably going to double triple quadruple bag these ranchers before we smash it off with a hammer [Music] I don't have any three years of thanks are being so quiet she's terrible [Music] empty out we're emptying the contents of the crushed-up Jolly Ranchers into a pot and we're gonna put out on the stove yeah she looks all innocent this girl's been Barkin the whole time I'm gonna make sure some little butter in there just to give the heart so something to stick to so look a little sour - hey Zeus all this butter over here jacked up with candy on it just keep stirring just keep stirring [Music] it's kind of the consistency of like previously chewed bubblegum yeah accurate it looks like that too yeah it's five minutes away from giving in and becoming a liquid and you how long do you think we've been like stirring this on low oh my gosh at least 10 15 minutes okay not there yet it wasn't really doing much so we turn the heat up just a little bit it's like number two or three right in between there like a little past three but now it's really starting to melt down and I think we're almost ready to squeeze the RSO in there we have to heat up a tower so a little bit we're gonna fit the RSO in there for a couple minutes let it soften up so it doesn't break that click container so and we're gonna squeeze about half of this into that mixture if you could only smell this right now remember it was pink mmm no it's dank I'm gonna just pour it into the mold but it's to meet you hard to film that so I'll show you the aftermath here's the aftermath the pan came pretty clean only burned a couple fingers definitely a whole bunch of edibles I'm working on cheeping my own it's a little edible to be [Music] yeah I was just told that people don't keep confectioners sugar in the fridge comment below and know where do you keep it [Music] yellow like it was definitely worth making him this way but it seems like definitely a team effort yeah if I was alone I would have been really stressed out there's a audibles calculator online if you go to how to add a bowls calm and you type in the amount of product you use and the amount of THC that's in that product so you can use or so you can use distillates you can use your own can of butter and it tells you how much each of your edibles is when you divide it by the amount of edibles you make out of it so I'm not a math person it makes me real stress to even think about it the how-to edibles calculator is a lightsaber doing the math on our half gram of our so that we added and and we made oh I forget how many pieces but we had done the math the other day so the larger pieces that we made around 14 to 15 milligrams and the smaller heart pieces that we made were around 7 so I'm not mad at it I tried on the other day it was good it didn't last as long as people claim that their edibles last but if I get a couple hours of relief it's worth it for me and you know just keep eating them like you would a gummy bear so it's nice to have like a hard sucker so medical Mary approved", "aKwdz_9qfdY": "what is up

a few minutes the first thing i want to do is sort of just give a rundown of the tent we're going to start over here with our breeding plants and we'll just go through these quickly and we'll talk about our phenohunts and some of the turkey profiles in a few minutes so the first thing i want to talk about is this bewitched bx2 right here this is our number one phenotype what we call the lavender cupcakes phenotype has some really delicious uh sort of a linoleum heavy kind of lavender grapey uh terpene profile with some sort of earthy cupcake notes and it's really really delicious very excited uh this is of course for our preservation run so this is a bewitched uh bx2 cross to our keeper males of the bush bx2 right next to her we have our sfv and these next couple of plants are pollinated with our sex reversed blueberry cookies um if you are interested in that check out some of the earlier videos um the pre i think they were called pre-season six um we did a number of sex reversals and did some sts experimentation so definitely check those out and if you're interested in doing your own sex reversals making your own feminized seats visit our website www.cbgyca.com stskit and we have a lot more information there you can pick up those kits as well in case you missed that link i will also drop those in the comments along with all the other links for the equipment and all the things we talked about as well down in the description so make sure to check that out so this is this here is a super classic strain sfv og crossed to our feminized or sex reversed blueberry cookies and we're making cannabinology really really amazing line very popular for it's high vigor super frost great really interesting sort of exotic terpene profiles extremely high yield it really really stacks so you get these massive colas actually kind of similar in stacking to this although the flower structure on this one's a little messed up this is the blueberry cookies but it really stacks very similar to that but much bigger plants than the blueberry cookies the next plant here this is our purple punch uh sort of a hype strain pretty well known super frosty very purple sort of a light uh grape punch grape soda type of flavor of course this is crossed with the sex reverse blueberry cookies as well we're making purpleberry punch really nice sort of a candy grape lots of deep purples plenty of color in this lime so very excited to have more seeds of this and then here we have our little short blueberry cookies i was hoping this was going to be bigger that we would get more seeds out of it but this is a pretty small very short stretching plant so a little bit short here but this is our blueberry cookies and this is for the blueberry cookies s1 feminized just sort of a preservation of this clone all right so the next two things i want to talk about here are some of the clones that we're running and then we'll hop into our blueberry cookies phenohunt we'll start over here this is the cushman sort of a hype cut here uh really starting to look good very commercial flower look sort of that round dense super frosty flower really looking good really smelling good has a nice sort of sweet fresh cushy taste hence the name cushman's so that's very cool we're probably going to do some crosses with this maybe in our next run with our blueberry muffin do some muffin mints or cush muffin i'm not really sure what i'm going to call it yet if you guys have ideas of what to call the blueberry muffin by cushman's let me know down in the comments i would love some great idea names next up we have our blueberry mac and i guess i misspoke this one is actually a clone this is from seed so this is the mac one capped cut crossed with the blueberry bakery zero which is sort of our our a cut of our blueberry bakery males we have two males that we decided to keep um and this is what i feel like is the better male over the two um so this cross to the mac one uh the blueberry bakery across the back one absolutely beautiful not quite the flower size i was looking for but it did get quite shaded out it really doesn't stretch kind of like the mac one really doesn't stretch pretty slow to grow but beautiful color super frosty looks like it's going to be real real dense i did raise it up on a little sort of riser here this is just uh i think mushrooms came in this or something like that we cleaned it out flipped it over um brought it up a couple of inches to get some more light so beautiful color on this all right moving on we have our kuiper belt another uh variety that's somewhat similar to the mac one actually very slow to grow this one is pretty weak stems but as you can see beautiful frosty flowers already starting to get that that purple in there it's got a really uh really really delicious sort of a sweet uh gravy cushy [Music] terpene profile just absolutely amazing this one probably is going to go into the 65 or 70 days so this has quite a few weeks to go actually same with this blueberry mac i'm expecting this one to go out quite a bit [Music] all right moving over we're going to talk about our phenol hunt here and i will say everybody i'm super stoked about this vino hunt these plants look amazing i'm really really happy with how these are turning out beautiful beautiful flowers really great structure amazing terpene profile there's a little bit of diversity which is honestly kind of nice that way you have you know some sativa leaner some indica leaner but all sort of with that uh common blueberry flavor um so this is four plants of the blueberry cookies bx1 and so one thing that i really like about this is i'm actually finding two phenotypes that are pretty close to identical there's a little bit of difference in terms of flower structure and that's the blueberry cookies number five and the blueberry cookies number three they both have a pretty conical sort of cone-shaped flower both have a really nice sort of round open sweet blueberry terpene profile which is really really excellent i really love this terpene profile very greasy resin which really means there's probably a lot of terps in it which is really something that i'm breeding this for so the blueberry cookies the things that i'm looking for are good flower structure the blueberry terpene profile that the number three and the number five have i'm looking for a little bit higher yield than the blueberry cookies because as i mentioned blueberry cookies is really small a very very short plant doesn't stretch much it's a little bit higher yield and some color so those are the things i'm looking for and i'm honestly seeing that in in all of these plants nice chunky buds pretty frosty delicious terpene profile so very happy so as i mentioned these two the number three and the number five both have the sort of sweet round blueberry terpene profile so these are probably what i'm waiting for is keepers the number five may not be a true keeper but i am seeing this uh fasciation mutation which i believe is caused by an upregulation of a plant hormone called cytokinin which does a number of things um including affecting lateral branching and cell division all sorts of stuff so i'm planning on keeping this because i think i think this uh this type of mutation could be used to significantly boost your crop yield just because the flowers grow really funky and just kind of grow bigger so if you look at a flower like this and you look at the flower right next to it obviously this fascinated one much bigger so i'm hoping we can sort of play around with this stabilize this trait and get some really interesting looking flowers and boost yields much more quickly than with sort of your standard breeding methods of selecting looking for the highest yield breeding that selecting again i think we could use this and i think it would be really cool to have a whole plant with these very interesting cool looking flowers on them all right but we are talking about terpene profiles here so the number three and the number five both have that blueberry terpene profile and then we go over to and then we go over to some of these other phenotypes so for example here is the number two phenotype and we'll get a little smell of this one thing i did notice about this one it has really big trichome heads which is pretty cool potentially really good for extraction as far as terpene profile we went ahead and just sort of rubbed our fingers on there that's a great way to test those terpene profiles it still has that delicious blueberry flavor um but the undertones those so it has some sort of deeper a little bit gassier earthier sort of undertones in there really really amazing though very excited for this one i'm potentially going to make some rosin out of this because of the larger trichome size i think it'll press really well and i also think this one's going to be a bigger healer than the other ones unfortunately this one did get a little bit close to the light so we did get some of those flat tops on there as you can see but i think if i uh had monocrop this we could have brought that light up just a little bit we would have gotten some really beautiful flower structure on there as well so i think this is probably a yielder decent purping profile i would definitely consider this a keeper and i'm in my f3 or my bx1f2 which is basically an f3 i am gonna probably run this one and the number three uh just because this one has amazing trichomes beautiful beautiful trichomes and probably higher yielder so i do want to hold an f3 of this number two phenotype and an f3 of the number three phenotype the number three is definitely the one i'm leaning for it has the flower structure it has the exact flavor that i'm looking for it's got perfect height beautiful beautiful beautiful flowers i already said that i just love how these flowers look i'll give you a little close up there absolutely gorgeous dense frosty looks like they're gonna have some great color really really stoked sorry i know i've spent a lot of time on on this number three phenotype and i'm super super excited about it all right so then we'll go over to the number six phenotype so this one is actually very different from the other ones obviously uh it's a little bit taller a little bit more sativa leaning i mean i actually really like the structure of this at first this one kind of like the number three got a little bit close to the light so we've got some funky growth here a little bit of fox tailing but that's okay one thing i noticed about this phenotype is as it was growing it was actually one of the shorter ones in the beginning but it stretched for a longer amount of time and actually met the canopy of the taller one and i say shorter and taller it's only a difference about an inch or an inch and a half between all these plants but some minor minor height differences really the unique thing here is the flower structure being much more sort of stick like a nice big stick of stacked up flowers much thinner leaflets probably leaning more towards the sativa-like effects just based on how this looks it looks more like a sativa plant so we're gonna get a little smell some terps here so i really just like to sort of grab one of these outer leaves rub a couple of trichomes off just to get some [Music] flavor yeah so this one's very different it's got um what i consider sort of a haze type of flavor it's got a little bit more citrus a little bit more earthy in it definitely sort of a unique phenotype here so this one probably would be a keeper for some people if you're looking for that sativa with a little bit of your sort of citrus and berry notes um this could definitely be for you it's not too tall it looks like it's not going to take too too long to finish probably in the 60 to 65 day range and of course had this not gotten so close to the light we probably would have gotten some better flower structure on here that said i probably will not be keeping this i am keeping it for now but i'm probably not going to move this into the f3 round um just because it's not really the turkey profile that i'm looking for with the blueberry cookies it's also not really the flower structure i love the sort of conical or not the conical the sort of pole like stacked flower but it's not the structure i'm looking for for blueberry cookies specifically one line that i may use this in is in the cabinology in the the thai stack line or the thai exotic which of course is an offspring of this sfv and blueberry cookies here one of those the number two phenotype has this same structure really really uh stacked these really long colas so i may cross that uh do a femme cross between this blueberry cookies and that can have an og since they have a similar structure maybe stabilize that structure get some some more terps in there and things like that but that's all to say that this is a keyboard just not for this line and i am very excited to try out the number six all right from here i do want to jump into a little bit about our flushing cycle we are here on day 45 and day 45 uh usually it's a little bit early for flushing and i'll explain why i sort of consider my flush period starting now but for those of you who are just tuning in who don't really understand what flushing is and why you do it i'll give a really sort of brief overview overview so flushing is basically where you take plain water and you dump it through your media and what that's going to do is pull out any nutrients that are left over from your flowering cycle especially when you use mineralized or salt nutrients you get a lot of buildup in your soil so you might be going and pouring in your nuts at you know 1.5 1.9 2.0 ec um but over time that's going to build up and i've seen build up even in my grows up to three four five thousand if you're not flushing and doing maintenance flushes throughout your cycle which is okay you don't have to maintenance flush it is a good idea though so towards the end of your flowering cycle you do want to flush out any extra nutrients this is really going to help the senescence or the death cycle of these plants is going to help them flush out bring out more color a lot of people will say it also helps with the color of your ash and the smoothness of your smoke there is some debate there's not a lot of evidence to say one way way or the other scientifically but my personal belief is that flushing does help with the color of your ash and it helps make your smoke smoother and more enjoyable so here on day 45 what i consider the beginning of my flush cycle is when i switch my res to plane water so i'm on drippers here i have a reservoir that these come out of and generally for the most for the majority of the cycle were somewhere around the 2.0 1.9 to 2.0 ec on day 45 which is about three weeks before i plan to harvest most of these plants i switched it to plain water no nutrients i used the water from my dehu so it is distilled or sort of close to ro water but you can do this with tap water it's totally fine and i just let that plain water water my plants for the first week and that's going to help bring down those nutrients i happen to have done a number of maintenance flushes in this run so i do know that my soil is somewhere around that 2.0 to 2.5 ec and so i think about a week of plain water should bring that down below that 2.0 mark so that's your first week or what i consider the first week of the flush period after that uh once we get to two weeks prior to our harvest we are actually going to flush do a physical flush pouring lots of water through the medium to get that soil ec down to about a thousand or below and that's really going to help those plants flush out if you have any questions about flushing about this sort of pre-flush period anything like that definitely drop those down in the comments and i'll make sure to answer those there or in a future video uh so that's uh pretty much our update for day 45 but before we sign off today i do want to remind everybody that we are still doing our 1000 subscriber giveaway we're somewhere around 930 or 940 subs at this point so 50 60 70 more subs and we'll be at that 1000 sub mark so if you want to join that uh 1000 subscriber giveaway all you need to do is make sure you subscribe to the channel uh drop a like on this video and leave a comment with a number between one and two thousand and that will count as your entry uh for the giveaway and of course you can do that on this video in any future video until you until we hit 1 000 subscribers on that note that is our day 45 2x4 flower 10 update so until next time thanks for watching stay frosty and i'll talk to you later", "0gUS_AFxV-w": "Welcome back guys. Today we're bringing you another lovely animal, the most requested design from our last video's comments. An Akita Dog. Now we add the colour. At this stage, the candy is still extremely hot. You can see when we put the colour in, it steams out the water right away. Now we're pouring it onto the cooling table, so it cools down to a temperature for us to work with. As you can see now, the candy is super soft, that means it is still very hot. So we need to spread it out on the table once in a while, so that it cools down evenly, and fast. Now we're going to add in the citric acid. Today's flavour is tangerine, which requires quite a bit of acid. From the previous videos, people ask us where does the acid come from? It comes from a well known fruit, lemon. So now we're cooling it off on the granite table. This table serves to cool it off evenly. While it cools off we have to spread it out and fold it nonstop so that is cools down evenly. Many people ask us from previous videos, do the colours have the same flavours or different flavours? The answer to that question is, each batch has the same flavour - however, All the candies in the shop have different flavours. Here we go! Right now I'm stretching this big piece of candy. We have to stretch it until it's white. In order to do that we have to stretch this 120 times, sometimes 200 times! By doing this, we fold little air bubbles into the candy. What the air bubbles do is allow the light to reflect and make the candy more opaque and white. It also adds a great texture to the candy. It makes it easy to chew and crunchy. That's why our hard candies are chewable. How I will put this piece of candy on the hot table, where we shape the candy and maintain its temperature. Look how white it is now! One,\ntwo, three! This is a much smaller piece than earlier, none the less, we still have to stretch it 120 times. For smaller sizes like these, we don't need to do it on the hook. We will do it by hand on the table. We will start off today by making the eye of the dog. The upper part of the dog is orange coloured. Now we're putting on water. Water is like super glue for candies. That's what we use to stick one piece to another. As you know, the Akita dogs, it looks like they have a little eyebrow on top of their eyes. So, this is what I'm going to make right now. So from one eye, we stretch it really really long, then cut it in the middle. That gives us two identical eyes, so we don't have to make the eye twice. Now we're going to assemble the two eyes together. We got to make sure we put them together with the right orientation. You don't want one eye up, and one eye down! So now, we're making the nose! So now that we have the nose, we will attach a mouth underneither it. Now we're going to put the mouth and the eye piece together. We will now wrap around the entire face. These triangles are going to be used for the ears of the dog. Excellent! Good! Perfect! Now this is where the magic happens. How we make this giant piece into smaller candies. Now we have to chop the candies one by one. Thank you for watching. If you like the video, give us a thumbs up! To thank you for all the support you gave us during the year, we would like to choose ten lucky winners for the candy we just made today. To find out how to win, visit our facebook and instagram page. Thank you guys for watching. Until next time, au revoir!", "uOT7bG5hwi0": "welcome to the sugar Test Kitchen guys we're an all natural vegan candy company based in our bure to Canada this is our new YouTube channel to show you guys how we make our candies here at sugar today we're making mango passion fruit hard candies that are colored with turmeric and flavored with natural oils at this stage the sugar has already been colored and flavored now that I've tested the sugar for heat and consistency I'm adding a mixture of citric and malic acid with our acid candies tastes like nothing it would just be like eating a lump of sugar and nobody wants to do that if you're gonna eat candy you want it to taste amazing now I'm incorporating the acid into the candies by folding it and kneading it like bread this is the process to make every candy taste the same so you don't have a lump of acid in one that makes it really sour and not in another [Music] now that the acids been incorporated it's time to split the sugar into two [Music] because we don't use any titanium dioxide in our candies which would make them white and opaque we have to pull the sugar this process aerates the candy trapping air bubbles inside which reflect light this causes the candy to appear lighter and more opaque the pulling of the sugar also gives the finished candies a better mouthfeel [Music] see the difference pulling can make to the same sugar [Music] now I'm gonna roll each piece of sugar into a log and cut it into three pieces of varying sizes this is going to help me create this concentric circle design later on [Music] time to flatten each piece [Music] now for the fun part creating the pattern that will go into the candies because mango passionfruit is a more grown-up flavor I chose a subtle concentric circle design for these candies don't worry the crazy patterns are coming soon each piece of sugar is wrapped in a slightly larger piece of sugar of the alternating color to create this design [Music] the design is finished and now I have to keep the candy round until it reaches the perfect temperature so I can pull it and make it into smaller rods [Music] as you can see here I'm tapering down the end of this big blob of sugar so I can pull it into rods that will eventually become individual candies [Music] these rods have to be rolled pretty much continuously until they Harden and cooled down otherwise they're gonna go flat and misshapen and a little stick together [Music] this is where I get to see if all my hard works paid off I get to see if the design of the candies worked sometimes it goes really wrong and it gets to try the candy and see if it tastes good which also sometimes can go really wrong you guys don't get to try those ones but that's the fun of the Test Kitchen I also get to play with a really big knife and a really heavy envel so yeah this is one of my favorite parts of the can't be making process [Music] these candies turned out exactly how I wanted them they tasted amazing the pattern was really subtle and caulis a success I think these are definitely going to be made in the commercial kitchen and ready to sell to you guys make sure to check our web store it's updated every Sunday with our new candies and will be coming up with new videos very often and very soon this was really fun bye guys", "_5e_7FgR0U8": "you already know what it is I'm very excited to be here with you today my favorite part of the day today I am coming at you with a hard candy with variable so pretty pumped about that too and also I am having Oh [Applause] [Music] I started making a list because sometimes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] my photos too and share the links [Applause] started a blog really with just the engine to upload pictures I [Music] kids my brother and I [Applause] I don't explain I just felt like this like 1840 something it was maybe it so now he's gonna say maybe install in my history okay so it says 1876 but hey I swear somewhere here I'd like you think you need forties hang on or maybe I said they 1870s I can't remember okay root beer has been salt and confectionary store since the 1840s [Applause] [Applause] anything but I got the but it was fine I know it's important to learn about everything in history it just wasn't my top choice my friend really good part of it was talking about [Music] I don't remember the poem I remember I honestly have no idea what I recited but I'm cheating just the water out and it does all the sour but not too much [Applause] [Music] nothing to do with my studies but I love plans [Applause] you know you can start having classes of the same people are you going to see the same people because you have specific buildings where's major but the article like this separate building attached to this amazing greenhouse I was obsessed it's real strong one of you guys if anyone's interested just kiss me I'll lord have mercy on my soul which is amazing they have this but especially you know maybe your study prayer just near campus maybe your party just you know like option to get you from point A to point B safely again amazing I'm so glad they I'm so freakin sorry but my my phone ran out of storage space that I have tried glaring so many times beautiful party bus closing time I leave you my beautiful angels I love you", "i5aohtEVqV4": "hi YouTube this is Teresa I'm gonna do a review on the Werther's original it's caramel apple filled hard candies and I get a chance to review it yesterday I got it from Michael's yesterday I opened it yesterday in half so it's wonderful I'll show you one looks like here it's the profit is that right let me take off you know you shouldn't bite hard candy but this is like a little soft hard candy and I struggled up it looks at the side you know filling the screen up we'll take sticky that's very good and the product is very good Mike were there's called Werther's Originals but it has Apple caramel the most like taste like it yep it yeah you're knowing amp caramel apple on a stick a taste just like that that you can add the fares or any time you want to make them out there at home and sometimes people make them for Halloween to eat at home as you even those candied apples those ones with the red ones of there's cherry flavored ones and cinnamon apple candied apples that you get around Halloween time or any time you can buy those kits to make their own candied apples but you have to make them with adult supervision because the candy part is very very extremely hot and it's hot to handle it so you have to be very what like a teenager or any aim except those little you know little kids shouldn't be touching hot stuff that got burnt very bad I want to make candied apples with my staff person sometime and make them and I want to ask her to record me doing uh yeah there'd be a lot of fun to make candy apples make sure you subscribe to my channel all make sure you smack my white button and make sure you comment down below and happy Thursday bye YouTube see in a minute [Music]", "IyGcwdRzPSc": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to four different kinds of old-fashioned hard candies these are clays candies and they've been around since 1919 Zac syntheses from South Bend Indiana he said that normally they're a dollar ninety-nine but they were on sale in his store for 99 cents so he was able to pick up these fours for $4 I think that's awesome I have the wild cherry and the Lemon Drop root beer and cinnamon and we are we are not going to be able to sit here and like suck on a whole candy so what we're gonna do is we're going to be disgusting we're gonna put a piece in our mouth and we're gonna taste it for a while and then we have a paper towel that we're going to lay it on so that we can go on to the next flavor but we will be able to tell you what it tastes like to us okay so this is the wild cherry these are artificially and naturally flavored they're fat-free and gluten-free it says now you can enjoy that old-fashioned wild cherry flavor and some delicious martini try some today I wonder if they're all the same calories 3463 460 whether 20 calories aged no made the same they're just flavored oh they do have a lot of other flavors they have natural horehound peppermint green apple the watermelon they have a bunch Randall berry do a lot more around always it really really strong for me okay this is the cherry oh and I love this it has a powdered sugar you look hooded and shut up I'll have a picture of them at the end so you can see they're very very pretty candies you could even for these out into a candy dish yes to me that tastes like a pop drop but no but I like it - the medicine yeah you don't really strong - mm-hmm you don't get the medicine apart but it's just a red cherry hmm but if you do not like cherry cough drops I don't think you would like that because that is exactly what does look it's not like a cherry watch savoring - it's not like a jury laughs I know it's like a cherry cough problem yeah because I'm meeting if you're sit in the meeting and one was cut off his penis now this is women some of those are really big yeah some of these aren't are like giant size also you have to get through the sugar-coated we get the point [Music] not fast for the part of s1y I hate that down - wow I just got the lemon it's really strong mmm now see I like that I like that buy that mmm is it too limiting to you it's not like you know like we've said before a cleaner like furniture polish or something like that that is not like that at all this is more like during an eliminator it's like yeah I'm like lemonade that's a good yeah I like that a lot quite quite good mm-hmm that it's just like a lemonade I wonder if you put them like if you mix them and put them in a candy dish together if the plenty because I don't think so because they're coated with that sugar all right so you could do that what's your favorite barks are aimed at me and we drink the diet and it's so good yeah diet barks it's better than the diet NW but I think I like anomic barks probably barks is the best one the barks is never on sale and they don't put it in bottles around here yeah we like to drink it out of the bottle yeah you always buy I am Debbie because that's what's on sale involved mm-hmm aren't they smaller model soon dude 16-ounce ball no the 12:05 I hope those guys have a good climate oh yes and you can tell that it's not sugar-free you can tell that that's like the full flavor that's the that's the real deal and root beer if you don't get the barrels after you eat Oh mold for a while but her mouth my mouth start our leeks with her tongue out - yeah they're so strong mmm they're very very good that is under excellent mm-hmm do you do you like those or the barrels I like these better these tastes that are quality noodles I agree the barrels piece cheaper I agree now this that's cinnamon sometimes the best for last I'm not a lover of cinnamon I like red hots I like atomic fireballs good hardball please I take out my own name this one's not gonna be like that though mm-hmm that's just a really nice yeah like a cinnamon disco that's exactly looks like it's a cinnamon desk mm-hmm except the cinnamon disks are wider yeah and this these have on around this room hmm that's really really good very strong flavor I'm wondering if I'll lay it next to the cherry if I could tell the difference in the color now it's the same friend it looks like the like the exact same red that's the cherry so you wouldn't be able to tell that that is my favorite out of the four our curriculum um I like a cherry I like a cinnamon cinnamon is good it's just uh there's something I want you all at home mmm that's nice I like the since the cinnamon is my favorite then what I will do I don't know how a lot of people do these I said you could put them in a candy dish for me though I like to put some in a baggie and a ziplock baggie and keep it in my purse and like Kevin has put it in Ziploc baggies and put it in his bag for meetings and stuff like that Kevin loves taking stuff like this for me I'm sure the person next to me love yeah you know why do you have nice breath I would rather have someone with nice breath and squishy noises yeah that's someone with a bad breath you know so yeah so and thank you very much as I these are really really good I like them and now that I've seen that name clays I'll have to be on the lookout for all around here to see if we have other flavors so I really appreciate you all Center me this I think you send me these I should I have a picture of one that's pattern and one the done powder another man wants to see the slobbery things okay no they're not slobbery they're not slobbering than the sugar oh yeah I'll take a picture and you all will know that these have been sucked on but that's okay and and I'll take some with the powder and then some without so that you can see what they look like because they're really pretty I love them with the powder on them I think they're gorgeous so I hope you enjoyed the video if you've had these before or other flavors that you really like leave me a comment below cuz I would like to hear about your experiences and thanks for watching [Music]", "Qbd3v4ZtBog": "hello so i'm really excited for tonight's video because um the last time i did a video where i just did a whisper ramble and had a butterscotch candy in my mouth you guys really seemed to enjoy it so i'm back with some more butterscotch candies and i love butterscotch so much so i'm really excited they're like one of my favorite hard candies so it's hammond's butterscotch and there's just some little one two three four five six butterscotch candies on the front and i'm really excited to dig into them so i have a couple right in front of me to use throughout the video and i didn't really think about what i was going to say i have no idea what i'm going to talk about but i think that makes it more exciting so let's open this a little farther away from the mic i don't want it to be too loud okay so we just got this little butterscotch candy okay delicious so i think the last video i did like this i was talking about my new year's resolutions and um i don't know what i want to talk about i will say um i'm really excited about this year because i want to take more time to go camping and stuff and just spend more time outside than i did last year i'm gonna move the camera a little bit um i was inside all year like literally all year i went outside to go running sometimes but that was when no one when i went outside and then everyone started running and going on trails and my city closed off all the trails because they were getting really busy which makes sense you know and then i was just kind of back inside again and my little dog um i've showed him before in my channel but he's just a little tiny he's like a york game on these and he actually has cancer he's like 11 years old and he pulled a muscle in his knee and he actually got surgery in the middle of last year like in the middle of quarantine and so we've been kind of taking it easy with him he's got arthritis he's like a trooper okay but he doesn't act like he has any of those things he's like an old guy in a teenager's body or something i swear and um my boyfriend and i are staying at my parents house while they're gone and so we're like watching the dog in the house and everything and they left us one of their cars and we've been using it to take my dog on little adventures um so we recently just went to i went on a camping trip we just got back um we went on like a five mile hike the second day that we were there and that's like the longest walk that my dog has been on in like a long time because it's been like i guess like six months now that he's gotten out of his surgery for his knee and um you know we were only allowed to take him on like five minutes at a time and so now he's like in the clear for months now but we didn't know how he was gonna do and he was making us look bad because he was more in shape than like we were which you know made me really happy not for my physical fitness but for my dog he's doing so good and he's so happy and i think it was like really invigorating and exciting for him to be in a new environment and not go on this team you know routine walk as he's gone on for years you know because we have a few trails over here but they've been closed and so we kind of just go around the neighborhood in different areas but he has everything memorized he knows where everything is it's not um as exciting for him you know what i mean and so one part that made me really nervous on this hike was there was a sign that warned that for the next mile and a half it was gonna be very steep and i was thinking oh no you know one because i'm out of shape but do because my dog like is too scared to go up and down the stairs by himself so i didn't really know how he was gonna fare going up a mile and a half on a steep cliff that he's never seen before so i was getting really nervous and then um this little guy we reached the very beginning okay and um it's literally like you cannot see the top it's just so steep and like a little mountain goat this tiny 12-pound dog just goes like up the top of this thing and we're just standing at the bottom like what what this 11 year old dog i just got out of knee surgery has arthritis as lymphoma and like hasn't gone up the stairs in years just went up this cliff like it was nothing and i'm like he's going so much faster than me that i'm actually holding him back because i'm holding the leash and i have to speed up this ill clever rocky thing and i'm like holding him back but anyways we were stunned like we did not see that coming at all you know so we're really excited because we like going backpacking and we haven't gone um in a really long time i think it's been a few months now and we have the car for a couple months so we're thinking of going on more camping and backpacking trips but we also were watching the dog and we didn't want him to do like anything that he was not you know like anything out of his comfort zone and so when we got back from our camping trip we thought that he was just gonna be like sore and tired and just like completely you know just no energy tired for the rest of the day and um he was doing that thing where he was whimpering at the door and at his leash so that we could take him out again and ever since we've been like going on walks after that he's been more adventurous and like jumping up on these rocks because he's very tiny so he can't really see and um one of the areas that we walk by has a bunch of rocks lining the sidewalk um and there's like trees on the other side and so there's a bunch of squirrels running around there and usually he stops at the rocks because he can't see past them and so if a squirrel runs across and goes up the tree it doesn't even bother right but now he jumps on the rocks and jumps over the rocks and is like running up to the trees and like i don't know we're just so much more excited about everything um and it makes me happy that he's so excited but it makes me sad that i didn't do this for him earlier you know what i mean but um i didn't know that he was going to be so good um or like so energetic and athletic um but yeah so i'm just really excited that he's gonna be going with us on outdoorsy things um and the fact that he was so ready to do it like everything all over again the next day and day after the day after we're probably going to take him like primitive camping with us so you know like backpacking um but we're still going to do a few like car camping where you like drive up to the side and pitch it in and you don't like hike to your spot or anything um just for a while to get him used to everything um plus i want to groom him because his hair is really long right now and um you know he gets those little like stickers and things stuck in his fur and they get matted up so i want to kind of get his hair cut a little bit so that um it won't get like matted in his hair and stuff when we go um i'm going to start hiking to our spot so so yeah i'll put another candy wow i just ranted about my dog for like 13 minutes it's so hard not to he's so cute and he's kind of at that age where he has really weird eating habits so he'll only eat if you tell him not to it's weird we've tried to figure out other ways to get him to eat but it's like a game for him um and you know you have his food in his bowl and he'll actually go up to his bowl and whimper and whimper and he will not eat it until you say no no no and then he'll start like his tail will start whacking and he starts you know doing a little bit of growling and then i'll start eating it and then i'll look up at you and kind of have that expecting look on his face and then you say no and then i'll growl and it'll start eating if anyone knows why he does that and like if it's a game or if your dog does that but it's like fun for him because he'll whimper until you do it i don't know or um if i set food out on the floor and like a trail and i like leave a trail of his food like around in a circle i'll just start he won't start until you tell him no and then he'll start eating it and then go around and eat the trail of food that you left i have no idea but he's a little goofy but he's very adorable and i guess it's just going to be a video about me talking about my dog but when i was in high school i went on this camping trip and i got really bad mosquito bites like everywhere and there was one in the middle of my back that i couldn't reach and i taught my dog how to scratch my back i'm not even kidding so i just held a treat behind me like this and i kept saying scratch scratch and so he would go and he knows back so if you go like this i'll do this you know um so i kind of it was kind of that same idea but i just had him do it until he went like this and scratched my back so i'd be like a scratch and he knows to do this but now i don't really have him scratch my back you know i actually never have him scratch my back but do any of you also have like a sequence of tricks that you um do with your dog if you have one um like you do them in a certain order because we do sit pop which is like shake down roll over and then bag and then scratch but we'll have them like scratch our leg or something um and then speak and oh this is another thing that i taught my dog um so we got him when i have no idea what grade i was in but i took french in middle school and um my professor my professor my teacher would always say like just like listen and repeat i don't know why i did this but i would tell my dog like echo day and i would also treat up and that means like i'm about to throw it like a fetch but i don't know like echo day i know the treat up and he get ready he's going oh my gosh she's gonna throw it and then everybody eat it and throw it and then you like oh i try to catch it but i don't know why i did that so it's really funny now watching people do it because i was just a dumbass and i was like echo day day and now it's like a thing and we tell him to scratch i i don't i don't know why i did any of that but it's really funny like watching my boyfriend do it because he's like echo day every day and my dog is like ready and then i don't know it's just so funny watching people do it because like like what was i thinking and then i also um so before i would go to school um like i wrote the bus in like middle school and high school and it always made me really sad that my dog would be like home alone while we were gone um so i liked to hide a treat in his bed i would give him one i would hide a treat in his bed and then i would go up to him and he would always wait by the window for me and i would give him the treat and then i would be really excited for him to find the treat later on because he would eventually get bored at the window and just go lay down in his bed and so now whenever i give him a treat he goes in his bed to find the other one because he eventually learned that there will always be a treat in his bed so now i always have to give him another treat and my sister finds it really annoying because she's like oh i forgot to put the treat in his bed like i hate that you taught him that i'm like sorry but yeah that's pretty much it um i hope that you all enjoyed this random dog talk but i love you all very much and i hope you have a great night so good night good night good night", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you guys so much for the feedback on that video it was number one trending for a little bit boys we

with the like button subscribe and let's get started so i actually got this recipe from facebook and it's kind of just like a picture and kind of like tells you so not really any explanation but um it looks really good so i really want to try um you melt the jolly rancher candy and you dip the pineapple in it and then coat it with like sprinkles i'm actually using the tropical jelly ranchers and these have different flavors than the original they have ones like fruit punch golden pineapple mango and lime so i'm gonna go ahead and like separate each one into like their designated pool all right we got our flavor separated and before we melt these i'm actually going to go ahead and cut and core the pineapple and this is a cord all right now that our pineapple is out we're just going to cut it and then melt the jolly ranchers i'm going to microwave these on like 30 second increments until they get melted i noticed about 50 seconds is ideal it's about 30 seconds check it and then 20 more so it doesn't stay liquid it definitely gets hard so it's like the bottom is a jolly rancher and it's like crunchy it's really good", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "ThPzNokG5uE": "[Music] I kind of honor respect the candies of that candy counter helped me to create something nice [Music] [Music]", "rWKfsjwvxy4": "welcome to spiced candies in this last chapter or let's say last but not least and definitely not the last one but in this series of candy making using chocolate I'm making my own favorite chocolate which is chocolate nougat these candies are a first time for me as well so join me I'll be using a Barney got chocolate and this chocolate is fresh from the fridge so it's really really stiff you can hear that but I won't be using it as is I'll be taking advantage of the fact that still summer around here and I'll take advantage of that and allow them my chocolate to warm to room temperature around 35 degrees Celsius you can see what it did to it it's really really good in candy making because you want your canned ingredients to be warm otherwise they will steal too much heat from the candy which means in this case your candy will be hardened too fast so let's make some candies and see how it goes our candy has reached the right temperature of a 150 degree Celsius 300 degrees Fahrenheit nice and clear I'll are the chocolate new books mixer and quite curious to see how it works yep think it's ready that's for my call chocolates is getting hard really fast yep it's hard already and use that nice Oh got most of it let's cut it before it's too late [Music] according to the aroma here the flavor should be really really intense so I cut this into small squares let's see how they do I let it cool off I'll see you in a minute okay our candies is cool this is definitely rigid or a bit but still not too hot to hold [Music] well that's it I'll try this one oh there Huntley that's definitely chocolate Nouveau my favorite of

about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "8NFHruKeaHk": "3/4 cup sugar 1 cup corn syrup the moms are on make sure that it's on Fahrenheit stuff medium hot tincture boiled down beforehand approximately 20 minutes very low simmer till it's just barely juicy this is sat it's a little bit dry use a pot scraper to get it out candy trays lightly sprayed with Pam small packet of jell-o ready put some in the sugar as it's boiling not all of it just some pock scraper is very effective especially in the stride out state do not lose the pot scraper I have a rata added the first amount of tincture that I showed you the other amount is waiting just gonna do some bubbling and boiling you don't have to stir it constantly but it's a good idea to stir it regularly already at 2:26 this candy thermometer has a cover that has a guide on it candy on the right hard crack 302 Fahrenheit I was previously only going to 250 275 which got you somewhere between fall and soft crack the fall is going to be chewier the hard crack is going to be just like a hard candy it'll start looking a little bit frothy that's alright it's normal just keep doing the stirring a little bit we're already at 236 within a couple of minutes try to scrape the edges every once in a while to keep it all incorporated it's going to get a little bit thicker keep going we're almost 300 first put the teacher in still won't but it'll break down with stirring it turn down a little bit we got a little too hot out of jell-o try not to fling it around in the pot that's pretty much what you put on the sides you're not going to get off keep it on the heat you can lower the heat a little bit keep it on the heat so that you can keep stirring the jello in just be in the pot looks like like super sure to get all the edges and top bottom so you know you got all your jello and your team's you're mixing okay scoot over you did hurry to try and get as much of it out of the pot as you can before it starts doing the stringing crap nothing but once it's in the tray let it cool a little bit where you start spreading it other ways you get that so it's best to try and pour it across this mold as best you can so you don't have to mess with it a lot still a little warm spreading that as it gets cold or cooler it's easier to just push around where you want places where it slowly I'm just kind of try to get rid of the lines these are it's not a big deal for your personal use but if you're gonna sell it these are harder to deal with it's not square it's harder to make them all level just don't look as nice but if you're starting with this tray you will probably get closer to looking nicer like that rather than the partial pour where you don't really know how much fill of your mold you just on a poori so these are a little bit thick and sloppy looking you try and mash them down but as they get cooler they're just gonna snap off Chrome's like that", "BhOM39nn0Wk": "dude this is me by the flames were a candy company this is the same people that made the toast eight minutes this could be super happy [Music] you're like my resident candy guy thank you I like candy I know you do that's why you're here yeah so today we're going to be trying some ghost pepper heart candies I know absolutely nothing about them at all okay that could be incredibly underwhelming they could be incredibly spicy who are the really go means go ahead go you know look like I I think it's the same candy oh dude this is me by the flamethrower candy company this is the same people that made the toe of Satan made this this could be super hot Shh yeah let's give you really hot I don't know God used I swear you trick me to get into this seat myself into this boy it's actually a very good extract two more on that later oh so this is me both playing freakin a company that's a field event Oh Satan which is incredibly incredibly crabby spicy um sea greens ingredients are quiet by the way we have two flavors is blue raspberry and wild cherry they're both ghost pepper I don't know like the red might be hotter because it's red I don't know um okay sugar corn syrup water artificial flavors citric acid ghost pepper blue number one in sodium benzoate so it's just a ghost pepper this goes it's the exact same ingredients on both of those they should be equally hot which one do you want to try first you want the raspberry it's oddly shaped to like I'm like picking up with the leg I feel like it just it was like one piece both bags feel like that oh that's adorable and they're all stuck together smells like  one off oh you can see like the peppers yeah yeah look it look it I see oh there we go you hold up the light I can see he right through it I feel like a man like a Jurassic butt yeah okay judging by the inside of this I don't think it's gonna be that hot it's stuck to your lip oh yeah you ready you're doing it this candy a little heat all right I'm just sucking on mine me too but do you get a little low heat action there's something very slightly I don't trust my mouth anymore though your mouth is probably broken Mike really is do you have taste buds still I mean I do I say the whole time my mouth is very leveled up my stomach holy schnikeys was it good there's like a juice or some of them really you bit it uh-huh it just like came out the side of it argues yeah like huh gelatin gelatinous going in it was just some weird chunk hanging it's got some spice um I feel like Emma could handle this mm-hmm I feel like rod you could handle this we should warn people uh-oh warning choking hazard yeah um not a heat hazard choking hazard so the more that I'm like I'm Michael by the way so I'm gonna I'm gonna get into the wallet area I don't buy this let's see if it's gonna be any different great hotter why those these are holy either truck the other that was scary dude I got to bite into it kept absorbing into my teeth and not breaking and then I try to release this duck I will say okay the wild cherry one are made better so like you can actually see like the pepper you know a shape of a pepper mm you know I'm working on this - this one has got like I'm not seeing it I mean the pepper is red generally speaking so you might not be able to see it as much in here all right do these are good good flavor mmm good flavor and I'm actually trying to think what this compares to like candy wash so behind on like eating candies we do this is like it's a jolly rancher there you go it's a jolly rancher it's a spicy joy hmm it's exactly what it is it's okay so talking about the heat is it an enjoyable money heat is not enough is it too much no it's not it's not to my level like I'm completely cool like I'm not on fire but it's like you do sense the heat mm-hmm what's enjoyable I agree um I mean for you on my scale it's like a 1 right n about point 5 out of 10 or anything like that I give it oh there's absolutely detectable heat mmm and I like it like most candies when you're to see like a spicy can hear something like that one you're probably talking about cinnamon and - you're talking about this like super artificial flavor but he comes from right this is not that no like I believe there's actually goes pepper in this and I truly believe that what I represent the heat that I'm getting from this although it's mild it's a it's a quality that makes me I always forget this do you like those pepper other idea that's the one yeah the point the one super hot I like scrappy flavors a little bit too but ghosts numbers like the one super hot that I actually do enjoy the flavor okay um so that's why this works well yeah that's good so um super into these um I mean I don't need a lot of candy but this would be I wouldn't say that this is like a challenge like this is definitely like appropriate for like the look it up like Emma your daughter could have it right and could probably have the easily but yeah this look good want to eat you're like 10 of them what um maybe a little overkill there I'm starting to get a little sweat I don't know you got sweat building up oh yeah I'm like your nose and there's Samson your cheeks right there who's that accumulative yeah is it definitely definitely working where do you get a rack me next video tune in for Alex getting erect in the next video

of your ice cream and jolly ranchers is originally a candy so it'll attends the sound nasty if you're putting in on milk or ice cream and well I have a glass of milk here and we'll put the Jolly

some funky stuff oh this has been a jolly rancher green apple or syrup I bought it at walmart see if you can get it there by", "ARd8oVjSftc": "hey guys what's up and welcome back to nostalgia unboxings today i have an interesting item i ordered some handmade candies from the lofty pursuits website if you don't know what uh lofty pursuits is it is uh it is another youtube channel albeit one much bigger than mine currently is that uh they make candy essentially because uh i guess the guy his name is greg owns a little candy shop uh down in florida and he decided to start filming the candy making process and it's really cool i'm a big fan of the channel just uh i like watching it before i go to sleep kind of at night when they make a new episode although because of the uh current events they have not been able to make an episode recently since you know they can't open the shop because of uh corona i don't think so that kind of blows but yeah it's uh so he gives a whole rundown of like the whole candy making process he shows it from step one all the way until it's all nice and done in little candy form and it's really interesting like a lot of the history behind certain flavors certain candy shapes stuff like that it's all you know stuff you don't really think about and then you hear it and you go wow that's a lot more interesting than i expected it to be since we're just talking about like a congealed brick of sugar but yeah it's a pretty great channel they tape this thing up really well so uh i have three okay that definitely went through i have three different flavors here today inside this box or at least i should unless they mess something up there we go using my animal strength i have popped open the box whoa okay so uh i'm going to move the box out of the camera since there's a exposed slip with some information at the very bottom so these are the bags they're not too big i guess but it also depends on how fast you go through candy if you have some uh self-control then you could make these last for quite a while uh the total price was i think i paid like 25 bucks honestly like including shipping for all three of these bags which isn't terrible considering they're all you know nice handmade uh candies in small batches and the cool part is most of these you can actually go to their channel and watch it being made which is freaking cool like that's so cool to me i don't know it's not something you really ever get to see with any other food more or less i mean unless you're like the hibachi girl but this is candy so the three flavors i picked out um i went for the more kind of unique interesting stuff so we have these um these are the whorehound and marshmallow cough drops you see they have like it says cough right there uh these are a lot of the candies also he makes on like machines that are like 200 years old um from like back in the victorian era which is awesome and that includes these like cough drop actual um well you can't see it's on this side the cough drop stamps which is really really cool but we will start with these ones i will keep all the other flavors secret for when we actually get to them delightfully devilish so it pops open it's a nice receivable bag too which i gotta give them credit that's a really really nice touch i do have a little paper towel so i do not accidentally get any sticky candy on my uh on my little filming surface here which is also doubles as my bed so it says what is that dullen i think it says dahlin it's very hard to mullen there we go it says mullen i can see it now so that was the original company that owned the press that they're using now which is pretty cool oh sorry about that and then cough so i'm going to try this right now and let you know what i think of it oh okay so in the video he explained what hor hound actually tastes like i very much agree with what he said he said that it's a very licorice flavor and it is a very very licorice flavor if you're not a fan of licorice i would definitely not i'll not get the hounded marshmallow ones there's also no marshmallow flavor at all to them because um they're not actually flavoring it with marshmallow they're just using the actual marshmallow root from the plant that it's derived from and rather than giving flavor i guess what it does and what they used it for back in the day so they use basically an original recipe for this it was um it kind of moistens up your throat to help relieve your coughing and um yeah it works personally i am a fan of licorice so these are delicious [Applause] really like them um i'm sure you know your grandparents might enjoy these types of flavors more than a lot of the zoomers out there but these are good i'm really satisfied with these ones jump cut it took me took me just a little while to finish crunching up that uh candy so this video didn't take three hours next up we have pickle dill pickle flavored candy i'm a big um i love like dill pickle flavors being a a slav so to speak hailing from lithuania i am a huge fan of all these kinds of pickley things so i'm assuming i will actually enjoy this one even though the flavor does sound very weird pop the bag open we have little pickle itself kind of translucent no fancy um stamp on it or anything and now let's get right to it okay so it doesn't taste as much of like as the pickle itself if that makes sense it tastes more like kind of the brine what the pickle would be and you know in the jar very kind of vinegary acid flavor and honestly yeah i like it it's really good man i'm i'm pretty used to like super weird flavors i guess so maybe these don't phase me as much as they would someone else who you know grabs a piece of candy and wants it to taste like candy i guess the stereotypical candy flavor rather than pickle juice but yeah they're really good um i should also add that this video is in no way sponsored my lofty pursuits i'm just a fan of the channel and always wanted to you know try some of the candy that i watched them making and thought hey that made a good video i think so here we are i also show off their logo here this is a a caricature of greg himself the owner who provides all the voicing for the the videos on the channel seems like a great guy he has such a relaxing voice too so 10 out of 10 on that front but yeah lofty pursuits and you can buy these candies if you want um they are made pretty small batches so i can't guarantee that all these can these same flavors will be available when you guys go on there but they have like 50 flavors at any one time more or less so you should be fine finding something that will tickle your fancy so it'll be at www.pd.net and i'll link to that also in the description and stuff for sure the actual candy store i believe is called public displays of confection and it's in tallahassee florida as greg states in every video and a final jump cut hopefully we move on to the final flavor and what i think is gonna be the weirdest one because i actually don't even know exactly what the flavor is this is the um forbidden fruit candy is what they called it and it might be hard to see i will try to pull one out but these are actually these are based on tide pods uh hopefully not the actual flavor of tide pods because i can only imagine that going very bad but uh i guess they made their own flavor mixed something up in house that tasted very strange and unique and maybe what you would expect a tide pod to taste like given its colors and here we go it kind of looks like a berry i think used um a berry drop mold for this since they didn't they probably didn't have their own like special tide pod molds but they did swirl all the candy around with the color so you know it kind of gets the point across especially on this side and i'm kind of nervous because i really hope this actually tastes good and they didn't just like pull an epic prank on everyone here but uh oh them it's really tart it's like sour i did not expect that what are these other flavors it's definitely it's definitely berries some sort of berries i'm gonna go out on a limb and see maybe maybe like raspberry flavor but there's definitely like several things mixed in here but the tartness definitely makes me think of like blue raspberry maybe lemonade it's really good though it's super fruity and soury so if you're into any of those kinds of flavors just to be right up your alley it's really really good honestly out of all three of these this is my favorite one um i'll probably rank the pickle one last even though i did enjoy it but i did enjoy the other ones a bit better i really do like the licorice flavor of this one it's very like i don't know it kind of makes you relax when you're eating it it's just like on one of those like chill flavors i guess if that makes any sense i don't know maybe i'm just a really weird eater and can associate flavors with kind of feelings and stuff but um yeah this one is really good but this is definitely this definitely takes the cake because it's a very these are very simple flavors where it's like you know just kind of briny and acidy and this one's just pure licorice almost whereas this one has like it's really complex it's got all those weird fruit notes going around there like that lemonade blue raspberry vibe and then that citric acid the sourness it was really good ah here forbidden fruit two uh i guess they made a couple versions of this and um because the first one from what i understand what it said on the site was a limited run and but it was like so much that they're like you know we gotta make it again and then they made it again and we got this and it is good so it works and uh congratulations to pd.net and lofty pursuits aha see they don't tell us so it says artificial flavors natural and artificial colors make me just a coconut oil huh i don't think i've ever seen them actually put coconut oil into candy on the on the channel so i wonder if that's like maybe like a lubricant or something but yeah that's very good i will probably finish this candy this particular one off screen but that's about it for the video this really didn't come in handy at all i guess but uh thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed watching me test these kind of very strange and somewhat historic candy flavors i'm really thankful that they actually all ended up being good and i didn't like throw up on camera because that would be bad but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed and if you aren't a subscriber already i would really appreciate it if you hit that subscribe button like or disliked and dropped a comment you know telling me what you think do you think these candies are good have you tried them do you want to try them uh are you a fan of lofty pursuits in general stuff like that it would all be great to hear since my comments seem to have not been very active so far and i would like to just interact with people because i think it's fun to you know hear other people's opinions and whatnot so yeah uh see you guys make a new video every saturday so i hope to see you there next time everyone have a good one bye bye [Music] you", "5Mxm9-FSV8o": "hi guys so before I start a shout out Dana T she requested I think it's a sheath since its Dana D she requested the soft-spoken video where I talk about my life my family were growing up you know she wants to know my style so I will do that while I let you see the background there is that I don't know how to point there babe oh babe there guys is the river we are at the river house and that one that one is our deck and I can't really see it in the viewer finder but the river I love it on the video because I did some videos before and while I checked it on the laptop my god I love the view I love water guys anything like even water from the horse but especially like river ocean waterfalls you know gorge everything and I love the sounds of Chris but we are inside a house so the visual I think is amazing so just you know so it doesn't matter you can't see me so well because you can see the river right candy sweetie let's have some candies it's sugar free sugar free I stole it from no he did steal it I got it from Michael's - its caramel flavor yeah I have made a trommel I've video before and I think I also spoke in a soft spoken voice so my life I'm almost 46 years old I was born and raised in the Philippines and I was there until I was 17 and 11 months in two weeks and then I went to Sweden before that I started a one semester in University of the Philippines in Varya Varya is up on a mountain skies it's cooler there it becomes around 10 now you can say that I had 10 to 16 degrees Celsius so around 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit and I studied there I started my pre-med it was a bachelor's degree but my mom and stepfather convinced me to go to Sweden so we went it took them two weeks of calling me they wanted me to come before but I couldn't luckily I did it guys because when I came to Sweden that place there was a big earthquake there and one of my friends bring her back because of the earthquake so luckily okay I felt sorry for her and for the others but that's why I'm saying Maki I feel I have Cochin angels guys and somehow my subconscious listen to those angels so I started studying Swedish and then since I won you know I love languages and I was very serious okay I am serious in learning new languages so I studied subjects that I was already good at but I wanted to master the Swedish language you know I wanted to sound like a sweet so I did I studied so many subjects and I really wasn't sure what degree I would take as I said I started a pre-med boys back in the Philippines but I know I'm interested in science but not that interested not like my husband Michael so I kept on changing my degrees like to nursing which I didn't start but I just came in preschool teaching high school teaching the preschool teaching I studied for two years the young high school teaching I only went for two weeks I also started a economy boys I was only there for I don't remember if it was for two weeks or three months but anyways I didn't wait so long and what else but in the end I finished my social work so polite unites in social Bachelor of Arts in social work now I met my daughter's father while I was studying Swedish and we got married and we got Maria because I never dreamt of having kids but that marriage didn't last long only seven years but that's my longest relationship I had a serious boyfriend before that and and not so serious boyfriend after like my first boyfriend I had for one and a half years my second for some weeks so Maria's father was my longest long-term relationship her father is so strict but they not my much in any way I'm strict too when it comes to safety and hygiene I'm super super like germaphobic and I want my daughter to be safe and I'm all for safety too like generally so I wasn't happy with him mostly because our background was so different mmm now my second marriage was even a shorter marriage we were together for four years I was in love with him though but in the end I had to break it off now he was from her way but he stayed I think most of his life in Sweden no Maria's father is very good in technology I think Maria inherited that and I'm happy for that because I'm not so I worked late in my life I was and when it comes to love of course I have my husband now my girl and we have been doing the LDR thing long-distance relationship for two years and now we're married for one month and it's my longest dating before a marriage and I think that's very good because we got to know each other before getting married Michael is my much in any way I can think of like in how we all our personalities are matching or past our background is matching it's an engineer guys from aerospace and also a manager in aerospace he's retired now but that was his job I love striving so I think it should have been I try way too but he started a as as a chef in the ECAM camping-ground and I love that about him that we are both foodies and that we enjoy it oh you can can hardly see me guys but I too want you to see the river let's see if I can turn on the lights so you will see me flavor I think that's a little better very much like I can't believe he found me and I found him you know because I didn't expect this in my life and then usually tell you that your most that your happiest and you don't expect things and I guess that's all recipe Michael and I did not expect him to meet our soulmate so late in life and I'm not religious guys but I do think we're meant for each other and that God helped us find each other and better late than never right so I thought I would grow old without finding my soulmate and he thought it too so as they say third time's the charm something like that makes me so happy guys when it comes to work I work I started as I did studying in a culinary school awesome for one year but I started out as a personal assistant or you know a caregiver and I didn't like that job but it was hard to get a full-time job so I studied and became a social worker and but before that before I studied to become a social worker I also worked as a chef or as a really pastry chef for airlines like Lufthansa and you know I wanted to go back that was in between my college studying you know I took was it one year or two years I don't remember how many years at least one or two years Sabbath here of Sabbath here I wanted you know to rest from all studying but then the end I went back to school and I was like oh yeah it was 2 years yeah I studied that started studying social work my late stepfather was a social office chief for a big town so I guess I got inspired from that but I I worked as a social worker for three years but I was threatened by clients family and I didn't feel safe on continuing that job and if you know me you will know I'm not a social prison I'm far from her you can hardly see me guys so sorry about that so yeah if I win today but anyways I'm not so sure so I don't think I was meant to work with social work honestly I want what I really want is to entertain people and I have always done that since I was little I was always in the declamation contest in the sector and things like that and I love that I love winning all the contests that I joined except for one where my teacher gave me in longer version of a declamation script and I was disqualified but the judges talked with me and said that if I had the right script I would have won they told me so that is really my passion entertaining people at least from a Ford since I'm not socialized and I do hope someday my YouTube channels will grow bigger and I did get some revenues now but I am hoping it will grow because so that it would be like I'm not like hoping to be rich in YouTube but I do love it when I can you know shop and buy foods and things for the house I love it when I go to Dollar Tree and contribute to the household so I'm not earning a lot but it's little now but I want it to be like him a monthly salary like I don't okay of course every youtuber wants to be big and I would love that but I would just be you know happy if it was like a monthly salary like you know the normal age so I would be happy with that because this is my passion guy since I was little but you know going into entertainment doesn't usually require hire a an academic background and all of my family especially in my mom's I had an academic background so I never thought of acting as my career and pursuing it but I didn't know before because I wasn't thinking seriously about it I wasn't thinking that I could go to you know have a theater course in the university but I guess if someone told me I would pursue that you know going working in theaters and stuff but that could be stressful but that would be better then what I did what I did was trying so many crises and getting so many levels because of those courses if I knew if I got some support I would certainly try studying the theater course in the university that would that would have been awesome now I when we went back to the Philippines a few years ago I studied literature American literature and it was quite close to entertainment but not

and Jake is making candy today and we're gonna ask the question where did the idiom blowing a raspberry come from because it seems to have nothing to do with raspberries but it does these fruit drop rollers are a little different than most of the ones we have you see these raspberry rollers are asymmetrical the top and bottom are distinctly different and they create the top and the bottom of the raspberry and this is cool because when you put one of these in your mouth it kind of feels like a raspberry because you get that 3-dimensional shape you don't even realize you're connected with it this is sort of like the strip effect that we covered in our video number 73 and while I found studies that cover flavors and colors with this strip effect I haven't found any that covers texture so I find these interesting the flavor and color was added when the candy was in the pot but Jake now sprinkles on some citric acid that'll give it just a little tang and make it taste more raspberry like I've always been fascinated with words and the origins of them and sometimes words can be confusing so let me give you three words to think about entomology etymology and entomology etymologies of course the study of bugs etymology is the study of words and entomology is the study of snack cakes and while the third study might be useful we're going to concentrate on the second study and go back to the origin of blowing a raspberry because it has a fascinating story one that takes British television British censors American TV and the paranoia of movie studios all together to add a term to the English language that's an unusual term in the first place so while Jake flips the candy to even the temperature and lets it drip he needs to get it all to the right consistency to go through the machine clearly let's go back to the early days of television television was on unlike the early internet it was struggling for content it could make some but it needed more than it could make and the movie studios in the United States were not being cooperative they were scared of television they were afraid it was going to destroy their business so they didn't want to license them their blockbusters they did license the monster movies that they thought they'd never show again like two Creature from the Black Lagoon which will be in another video by the way and they also did old old films like ah The Three Stooges Laurel and Hardy and our gangs sometimes known as The Little Rascals but what they ended up doing was leaving an opening but American television found a solution that was England you see the British film companies didn't see a threat from the American film companies in post-world War two and for many years after that people in the United States got their first real exposure to British movies and it was a good one and we absorbed accents we considered the British accent cool I think it paved way to the British revolution in music and the acceptance of it here in the United States but it also added words to the lexicon and one of them was blowing a raspberry that sound that you make when you're disappointed with things sometimes known as the Bronx cheer the writers in British films started using terms like blowing raspberries because there were censors in the British film system and there were pretty major cutting things out these sensors were originally employed during World War two to censor letters movies to keep information from going to the enemy but after the war they found a job the censoring films for the public's quote-unquote protection and the directors and writers found this stifling so they try to get around this by putting things in the censors didn't know but the public might and one of the things they used was London rhyming slang sometimes known as cockney rhyming slang if you're not familiar with it it's two words that rhyme with another to confuse the upper classes and the police so table and chair would mean stair but you wouldn't say table and chair you just say table you'd have to know stair to get to chair and for another example is frog and toad being rode well there you had a term raspberry tart but if you think for a second you might be able to figure out what raspberry tart rhymed with fart so because London used rhyming slang in people knew it the movies could use it to get around the censors in England when the movies came to the United States that were shown on American television because the television companies couldn't get American movies and a term entered the English lexicon that meant the term that the sound blowing a raspberry makes and I loved it came full circle there's the Golden Raspberry award that now gives awards for bad movies and the name of that award is the same linguistic origins as the name for sticking your face in a baby's belly and making a funny noise that makes it laugh and if you haven't figured it out already there's a reason why these candies are called drops

jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be

things that I want to can and want to share with you and things I want to have on my shelf for the holidays and this is a recipe that I've been wanting to do for a number of years and I've just never gotten around to doing it so today I'm going to do it with you we are going to be making apple wedges in cinnamon red hot syrup I think these are so pretty I've even a purchased commercial made ones at the grocery store for my daughter I thought it would be fun for her and we enjoyed those but I thought it would be better to try and make my own so that's what we're gonna do the recipe that I am using is from the bog Blue Book of canning and preserving I chose this recipe because it just makes six pints which is all that I really need on my shelf I just want a few jars for over the holiday season and the other one that I came across was from the National Center for home food preservation that recipe made a lot more jars than I felt that I needed on my shelf number one and number two they had a notation at the bottom of the recipe that said for many people it was too sweet and I did when I did look through the recipe it does have a lot of sugar in it so they made a note saying that they were gonna be reworking the recipe on that one so I kind of nixed that one I found came across this one in the ball canning book and it yields six pint jars which is perfect for me and it had a lot less sugar than the recipe from the center National Center for home food preservation so that's why I chose this one I think the one from the National Center home food preservation there Apple there apples were in rings this one says apple wedges so I don't know that it really makes a different difference how you cut them so if you prefer rings as opposed to wedges that's totally fine but I'm going to do wedges so let's get started ok to start they wanted you to prepare your apples and the recipe calls for peeling them and coring them and then cutting each Apple into 8 wedges so that's what I did I used large Honey Crisp apples for for my apples I just I love Honey Crisp so I and these were on sale at Meijer last week so I purchased these to do mine now the bald look of canning says it's gonna take 8 to 10 pounds of apples which is about 24 to 30 medium that seems like a lot to me for just 6 pint jars so what I did is I sliced an apple and measured how many I could get in one pint jar and it's I so I only ended up peeling about I think it was 9 of those large Honey Crisp apples so I'm not sure where they're getting 24 to 30 medium that seems like a lot of apples for just 6 pint jars so we'll see where that gets us and then the other ingredients you're going to need well first of all back to your apples once you peel them core them and slice them you want to keep them and I have mine just in cold water with several tablespoons of lemon juice to keep them from oxidizing you can use fruit fresh or something like that to keep them from oxidizing it's up to you I always have lemon juice on hand so that works well for me and then we're just gonna need sugar the cinnamon red-hot candy cinnamon sticks whole cloves ginger water vinegar that's 5% acidity always 5% acidity for canning so you can use whatever you want originally I kind of thought apple cider vinegar would be really nice here and I think it would be for flavor but I chose to use just white vinegar because I really want that pretty red color to show through so I'm gonna use white vinegar and then you need light corn syrup and then optional as red food coloring I feel like there's enough I'm not a huge food coloring person and I feel like there's enough already in the red-hot candies so I'm not going to add that but you can add 2 tablespoons of food coloring if you prefer I'm not gonna do that so this recipes really straightforward it's really simple if you're just gonna dump all of your ingredients except your apples into your pan we're gonna bring it up to a boil boil it for 5 minutes add our appro apples simmer them for 5 minutes and then we're ready for canning so let's get started we're gonna start with adding we need a cup and a half of sugar and then we need 2 cups of water and we need a cup and a half of vinegar and then we need 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup and then we need 2 cinnamon sticks we need 2 teaspoons of whole cloves and a teaspoon of ginger and then the recipe calls for a half a cup of the red-hot candies that's almost this whole package so I'm just gonna use the whole package that way I get a beautiful more intense cinnamon flavor and a little more color I'm just gonna use this whole package this package was a five five five ounce package of the red hot cinnamon candies so we're going to go ahead and bring that up to a boil let it boil for five minutes and then we're gonna add our apples so I will bring you back okay guys our syrup has been boiling for five minutes so now it's time to add our apples I want head and drained my apples and our go ahead and add those into our syrup carefully want to get burnt with hot syrup smells delicious [Music] okay and balls instruction is to add them to the syrup and then reduce your heat add the lid and simmer for five minutes so that's what we're gonna do while my apples are simmering I'm going to get my jars ready okay guys here we go our apples have simmered for five minutes with the lid on the ball canning book doesn't say anything about straining out the cinnamon stick or the cloves I'm going to leave my cloves in there but I'm not gonna put the cinnamon stick in my jars but so I guess that's up to you neither the fall book or the National Center for home food preservation say anything about removing the cinnamon stick or the clothes so I'm gonna the clones are kind of hard to fish out so I'm not gonna worry about those but the cinnamon sticks I'm not going to put in there so I'm go ahead and fill our hot jars [Music] [Music] you're gonna put your apple wedges and first [Music] and we're looking for a half of an inch headspace so once you put them in if you kind of wiggle your jars a little bit you can probably squeeze in another couple wedges to get them tightly packed in there [Music] and then we're going to fill our jars with our syrup to a half-inch headspace [Music] okay then we're going to deep bubble [Music] and check our headspace [Music] add more liquid if you need to after you do bubble to maintain the half of an inch headspace [Music] and fruit if you've never canned fruit before has a tendency to want to float even when you heat it they say heating it helps prevent that I've not found that to be true because obviously we heated it here and it's still floating so anyway get to about your half of an inch headspace and you're going to wipe the rim of your jars [Music] and then we are going to add our lids in our bands fingertip tight and then in the canner they go look how beautiful those are beautiful beautiful color [Music] okay for those of you who are new to canning if you've never can't fruit this is what I was talking about fruit likes to float so to check headspace if I can take my debugging tool because it wants to pop up above the syrup so I take my de bubbling tool and kind of push things down to see if I'm at the correct headspace because no matter what you do it wants to they want to float so that's how I check my headspace and then the other thing I wanted to mention is on when you're using any when you're canning anything really sticky you really want to make sure you wipe your ribs really well or you may not get a good seal so I always dip my paper towel in white vinegar to wipe the rim to make sure that there's no sticky residue or your your jars won't seal and we don't want that so just a couple of tips there I'm gonna go ahead and get these in my canner and then we're gonna start canning okay guys these need to be there be there a high acid food so you can water bath key in them or you can steam can them I'm gonna be steam canning in my Victorio multi-purpose canner I love this you guys have heard me rave about it and if you haven't tried steam canning I highly encourage you to do so it takes less time to bring all that to get things up to temperature for your processing when you water bath can you have to have your jars have to be covered by at least an inch of water and that is a lot more water than you use for steam canning I only have about three inches of water in the bottom of my steam canner and that takes a lot less time to come up to temperature than all that water covering your jars so I highly recommend you try steam canning anyway if you are water bath canning make sure your water covers your jars by at least an inch like I said for steam canning or water bath canning our processing time is 15 minutes okay guys our canner is up to temperature so I'm going to set my timer for 15 minutes once our 15 minutes are up I'm going to turn off my heat and remove the lid let my jar sit for five minutes and then we can remove them from the canner it's a reminder for those of you who are actually water bath canning you need to bring your water up to a full rolling boil and then you are going to start timeing the other thing I wanted to mention is you need to make sure that you adjust your temperature you don't want it vigorously boiling crazy boiling the whole time you just want it if you want your heat high enough that it maintains a full rolling boil and for those of you using this canner you want to just maintain your your dial gauge you want your little dial to stay in your go zone which is green so just adjust your heat so that it's not trying to boil your lid off of your canner hey guys we are all done once my processing time was up I turned my burner off and remove the lid to my canner we've waited five minutes so now we're ready to see the finished product so pretty and they taste really good for those of you who may have been like me and we're a little skeptical about the vinegar don't be you don't even really taste the vinegar at all it's just sweet and spicy the cinnamon and the cloves and the ginger is just delicious yeah look look at how pretty isn't that great so pretty so excited to eat these great for the holidays so a couple things like I said the vinegar is not weird if you haven't made this before when I was looking for the recipe I thought wow that's a lot of vinegar and I thought maybe it might be weird but it does not taste weird you hardly taste the vinegar at all like I said it's just sweet spicy just really yummy so kind of like eating a candy apple that's not crunchy like a candy apple like you get at the fair it just doesn't have the crunch it's the same flavor so good the other thing that I did want to mention if you go on the hunt for the recipe the National Center for home food preservation they're caning time says 10 minutes for up to up to a thousand feet of altitude Baal says the processing time should be 15 minutes so I'm not sure what the discrepancy is there like I said the recipe from the National Center for home food preservation has a lot of sugar in it and so I don't know if that makes the difference in the processing time I'm not sure so you but anyway if you go looking for the recipe you may find that discrepancy and wonder what that's all about I don't know what that's all about I just stuck with the balls instructions because that is the specific recipe I used so there's that and then as far as the amounts like I said fall they're claiming you need 8 to 10 pounds of apples which is 24 to 30 medium I only cut up nine of the apples that I showed you I think I put them away anyway it was the large Honeycrisp and that was perfect for six pint jars so I don't know I think this recipe is a tiny bit off as far as the number of apples that you need and I had almost the perfect amount of syrup as well so I don't know I think that that's too many apples but that's just my opinion because I did maintain my half-inch headspace so I'm not sure what that was all about but anyway just a few discrepancies but other than that the recipe is absolutely delicious and wonderful for the holidays so I'm glad you came along with me I hope that you will give it a try if you have any questions or comments leave them for me in the comment section

Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram

things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "yOezzl6KdKE": "hello everybody we are here at Balboa Park next to the T pavilion and Japanese Friendship Garden and we are going to truck some Japanese candies now this I got from Mitsuwa marketplace this mango chocolate which I'm very curious to try and these were actually from Japan these are three different types of hard candies and I'm not sure what they are exactly these were purchased at Narita Airport so let's go ahead and open these and try them chocolate and it looks like it has milk chocolate exterior with some sort of mango cream segmented into little squares it's easy to break apart that's what an individual square looks like try this definitely mango we very interesting combination it's not bad I've run the combination a little odd you know the chocolate I think that the chocolates actually pretty good quality it's very creamy and smooth and the mango has a very distinct taste and it does actually have maximum mango in it our official mango flavor so I would recommend it no shame want to try let's see what chain thinks of this we like it it's good thumbs up alright and what's up for both the company is Meiji that makes this chocolate now we have three hard candies and you know since this was purchased in Japan there is no English on here at all I'm assuming it's some sort of mint or menthol flavored creamy part candy but that's just an assumption based on the images that I see it's like drops oh it is exactly what I thought it was it's milky and minty what's actually not bad I like it I couldn't tell you what it small but it takes good Melky a minty very distinct flavor would you like mmm-hmm what did you think about it oh okay just okay yeah I don't know I don't know if I would repurchase it's because the flavor combinations aren't quiet my taste but I think it's not bad Shane says it's ok he's making some vases though no you don't like it it's worse now ok thumbs down for Shane I'd say it's a thumbs up it's good but you know they're better things this is one of the scarier ones this is actually it looks like plum candy and it's looking at the package it looks like this this plum that's encased in hard sugary kind of reminds me of those tequila candies with a little bug in taste all right I can't eat this apologize I know people really like these like ones but it's salty extremely salty as part of the plum is exposed I'm gonna exteriors just like regular sugary of our community the combination of the string says he was sweet so what did Shane think about this salty pumpkin if you liked it Wow mixed reviews what did you think about the combination between the salty and sweet good good if you liked it okay all right well I unfortunately have to say thumbs down but Shane actually likes the candy so that's good now moving on to this is looks like a green tea flavoured hard candy based on the picture just don't bargain green tea candy has a very distinct green tea flavor taste somewhat creamy it's almost like green tea ice cream our King comes up at the end of our candy review here at the Japanese tea Pavilion in bubble park looks like they're closing up here you can see the organ pavilion over there it's another beautiful day in San Diego", "7ByIlrav5o4": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi y'all we're gonna do THC infused strawberry starburst cannon shoes start with two and a half cups of sugar 3 tablespoons of cornstarch you mix those together well then add our light corn syrup or water as well as our unsalted butter teaspoon of lecithin and salt stir that bring it to a boil up to 250 degrees once temperatures reach we're going to turn the heat off put our product in vanilla extract and two packages of strawberry lemon-aid kool-aid once again get that stirred up pouring that into our prepared pan let that cool about 15 minutes until it's ready to handle [Music] then comes the time to pull our taffy [Music] Apryl the tapping about 15 minutes until I reach the color and consistency a designer [Music] these can be shaked any way you'd like I'm going to push them into a mold to make

updates and notifications whenever we post a new video thanks for watching [Music]", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "bBsBNrWbTzg": "welcome to spiced candies well in the previous video we did some chocolate spread candies and the guys that were complaining that this is not a specific brand they like well the brand they lack is a very known well famous brand of chocolate spread and see the logo over there and since I promised here is my new candy making from this specific spread as you can see it's very similar to the last one so if you have friends and family members kids you like to make some candies that's the way to go let's get started oh can use reached the right temperature this is on 50 degrees Celsius or in I think we're ready to pour [Music] and that's it let's cut it and since these are so thick you better cut them small now the Roma in the kitchen now is quite amazing I can assure you Oh our lollipops isn't farewell they're not fully cured because this is so thick I should have used larger lollipops for these even worse of this one it's missing half a wing it's sort of a well Nemo butterfly lollipop okay I'll let this cool off and we'll get cracking as soon as this is cold enough to touch our candy has cooled and we can break it well our lollipops is not fair well now there are 3d actually so I'll try that next on off-camera of course in general you don't want to pour lollipops are too thick right so just break it [Applause] [Music] right so these are candies so that's all there is to it hope you enjoy this in case you've been wondering this is just like the original you can feel on taste the original flavor of the spread and this chocolate is really nice even as a hard candy hope you enjoyed this have a sweet day and I'll see you soon", "lZVirid-jL0": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and this is a drop roller a machine that makes drops that was made in 1871 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania we're gonna use this machine today to make some hard candy and the hard candy is a bit of an experiment in color and flavor this is about the fourth batch of the day and this is what I like to make experimental candy because the machine while it's a little stained with food coloring from the previous batches is also just right for making candy easily there is an old saying that you taste food with your eyes long before you taste it with your mouth the sight of a food or a color triggers a response which brings on the flavor and leads you to expectations and this video is about those expectations and expectations also take place culturally as we've discussed in other videos the United States sees purple as the flavor of the grape specifically the concord grape and europe sees the purple flavor and candy as the flavor for black currant so now that my hot sugars are 310 degrees i pour it out on my candy cooling table and I ask what flavor is this I mean it's not clear it could be anything and that's what this video is kind of about wondering what the visuals which you can see on the other side of the internet are and how they compare to the flavors which are on my side of the video camera these associations are well known by the people who make food and prepare food for you walk down the aisles of any supermarket and you will see the tomato sauce mostly in red and something that has blueberry in it will have a splash of blue the color is there to key you to what you can't see and can't taste outside the packaging and you are tasting with your eyes and this is okay it's because it's the way we were programmed if you think about it we must have developed food skills before we even developed language skills as a people because if you didn't know when the food was ripe or when it was dangerous to eat you wouldn't be able to you know process the nutrients you made so when something feels soft and even versus lumpy or picky when something smells nice or something looks nice you have expectations and the expectations are programmed into us earlier this year with a laundry detergent tablet we can see these expectations going the wrong way and I think this is a video about breaking those expectations let me give you an example there's something called the strip effect you see you can't taste or smell the candy across the internet but you can see colors and words just fine so let's have some fun with them and then try to apply that to candy so let me demonstrate how you're programmed with colors now I'm going to display some colors on the screen and as I display them save the color out loud for instance we're starting with orange will then do red green yellow blue pink red orange and you'll see the speed is pretty consistent when you do this remember we're saying the colors we don't really care about the words but here the words and the colors will match I want you to read these out loud left-to-right the colors that these words are we'll get back to the Stroop effect in a few moments but we're gonna go play with the hot sugar now and it's cooled off to a great consistency it's sort of the consistency of silly putty or playdough we're gonna put it through these brass rollers that'll cool it off a little bit and make it keep its shape if you'll notice we're making lots of drop rolled round candy here and an opaque red and that opaque red is gonna be important in a moment so now to get at what I'm demonstrating when I show you this next card read out loud the colors not the words but the colors and see if the delay is a little longer than last time [Music] if you did this experiment correctly and just read the colors you'll find the delay going on between when you see it and when you can say it because your body's trying to say or your brain is trying to say the word that's printed not the color of the word and flavors are like this too if you try a flavor that is red and it's colored blue unless you've been trained to recognize that like we have with blue raspberry you're not gonna end up saying or tasting in this case the flavor and that's what our experiment today is we're making drops in bunches of flavors but they're all gonna be the same color and one of the meeting I told everybody what we're gonna do they looked at me and almost as once they said that's madness and I realized our flavor assortment now had a name and madness it is and we're going to pack these candies randomly mix together so you should get some of all the flavors but what flavors some of them are going to be normal do you expect black berry in pink or would you expect an apple in pink we might have butter we're looking at doing a salty flavor and a hot flavor with chili pepper in it and other flavors with this and the fun part is we're gonna be replacing flavors as we run out so we're never quite gonna know what's in the assortment but there's always gonna be six or seven flavors I'm gonna aim for a salty and a sweetness sour and some other things in here and you're gonna have to guess the flavors it's an assortment of fun and love it's sort of combining spin the bottle and Russian Roulette and will give you hints online as we put them up so pay attention when you order but they're gonna change and we're gonna throw some wild cards into because you know April first is coming up and we're gonna have some fun with this candy

your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll catch you on a future one peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video

actually haven't visited in like a year because I just haven't been in the area even though they're like 30 blocks away from my house anyway so I bought these two um both brands that I've never seen before so this is called Greg bowls and this one is cannae Green oil this one is 240 mega ooh that's a lot Oh 12 milligrams per piece okay so this is 12 milligrams per piece jolly ranch Jolly Ranchers and this one is 500 milligrams 100 milligrams per piece of sour gummy worm which I'm a little bit concerned about because in the past I didn't I've never like filmed all of my like CBD like eating but I think the highest that I've ever gone for a CBD edible was 25 milligrams so this is a hundred milligrams so I'm kind of scared but at the same time it's just like it's CBD the worst that could happen is I fall asleep for a really long time and then wake up feeling refreshed so basically I'm pretty excited I have really high hopes for this one because they do also make as you can see down here THC candies as well so I think out of the two I'm going to try this one first just because this is 12 milligrams per piece and I have a very important day tomorrow I have a lot of I mean that's not true I have two things to do tomorrow I need to wake up to go to a job interview tomorrow early in the morning and then I have a doctor's appointment after his hat so I want to make sure that I am able to wake up the first doctor's appointment so I'm not about to eat a hundred milligrams of CBD and it's also kind of early now it's 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon so I'm going to take a shower wash my hair so I'm presentable tomorrow because this is like real greasy I'm going to eat some dinner and then or maybe like early or late lunch whatever and then you're gonna try this and I will let you guys know how I feel all righty everyone hair has been washed so has my body I just ate dinner so I am super full um I kind of wanted to wait until I like digested my food a little bit more before eating this because I don't know you know like when you tummy is full of food like it has to digest all the food first before the food like goes places so like things hit you not as fast or as strong when you're like full of food but at this point it doesn't really matter I just want candy there's no pull tab on this one this is by the way again the CC greg goebel's bread good Greg yep yeah chef crafted edibles let me get scissors and open it and down the hatch it'll go hopefully this doesn't taste like trees I don't even know like where to cut this to be honest there's like a little zip [Music] thing but all right we're gonna open this mmm smells good doesn't really smell like Jolly Ranchers it's most kind of more like like gummy candies all right I think they're all kind of uniform in size it looks like they came out of mold so anyone is fun they're like these little like jewel rectangles looks like this I'm excited ready go good okay um dammit why did I buy this with the expectations that were tense and Jolly Ranchers because it doesn't this happened to me another time - when I had like caramel and they didn't taste good either and then last time why I had the gummies in chance good either but at least like with caramels and gummies you didn't shoot them up this is a hard candy and tastes like crap first put in my mouth I tasted like plastic but like not like plastic I wasn't like plastic that taste like nothing had that like chemically like flavor to it like you're not chemically plastics mom and now it's like bitter I kind of like has this weird like it like burns a little bit that house is like gasoline II like taste to it there's a little spice to this I don't know why like I don't know if is like burning or if I said spicy but there's a little like tingly hotness going on on my tongue and down my throat when I swallow I will say the good thing is this is dissolving pretty fast so let me eat the rest of this and wait like an hour and check back hi everyone so it's been about 20 minutes since I ate that jolly rancher that was awful and I do feel a little bit tired but I'm not really exhausted like that time that I had like that ham bomb gummy bear um I will say like I really wish that there were ingredients there was like an ingredients list oh I'm in bed on this Greg apples but there are no ingredients anywhere so I really wish that like Oh God I'm like ruining everything um I wish that they were ingredients so I could see exactly what was in it if there are any like fillers or anything I didn't look at that in this store I just saw the packaging and I was like you Jolly Rancher so um yeah I pretty much wish that I knew exactly what I was ingesting if there are any fillers if there's any melatonin in it or anything um because I'm really not looking for CBD that actually has those fillers and has the melatonin and has you know whatever that makes you like sleepy because that's not really what I'm looking for but I suppose I could look it up on the internet since I'm here editing videos right now in bed so um still feel okay I will check back in another half an hour to see where I am and by the way I don't know if I mentioned this in the video in the beginning of the video but um I am doing this because my ankle still hurts because I'm it's still sprained today is the first day that I decided not to wear the brace and it does hurt a lot a bit from not having the support of the base so that's really what I want to be treating with this right now is this ankle pain that I am feeling so before I start like rambling along because I'm feeling something I'm gonna check back in half an hour all right hello everyone okay final check-in it has been an hour since I consumed the little gem I will say I'm a little bit tired but again I'm not as tired as when I took that hemp mom's gummy bear in a previous video my ankle no longer hurts it hurts like a little bit a little bit but I mean at this point it like doesn't hurt they really doesn't so it pretty much did its jaw and that's all I really asked for so this is pretty much the end of the video I don't know like if this could even be counted as a review but it's a review enough for me because I took it from my ankle and now my ankle doesn't hurt problem solved didn't taste great and although so there's that so until next time I get to try these um thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time bye [Music]", "Bgd-3WVMOBg": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello and welcome back to my channel okay so I was asked to demonstrate the whole candy peaches process and here I have two rather large peaches I have my warm warm water running here and you want your peaches to be pretty firm not soft because once you get them and your candy it's going to soften them up so you want them to be really firm and what we're going to do is just rinse them under warm water my mat over here and then you can dry them with the towel or you can dry them with a paper towel and that's going to be all for the cleaning process because that's how are you gonna do with them it's rinse them in warm water you're gonna blot them dry with whatever item you choose to dry them with or you can sit them out to dry but we are gonna let them dry a little bit more once we put our candy on okay this is going to be the other one and this part will be the bottom part we are going to puncture our peaches from the bottom so they will sit flat and that is going to be our cleaning process I am going to get my four cups of sugar 1 cup Cairo and 1 cup water ready and I will return ok I am back I have everything that I will be using which is my sticks that I will be puncturing my peaches with I am going to do the color purple today and I also have my white sunny-side-up bakery food coloring gel food coloring ok and this is by Chef Masters it is a neon bright purple I have already applied my white gel food coloring into my mixture and have it well combined and I will be adding the purple once it comes to a clear boil or a boiling point because it's not gonna be clear because I've already added my white gel food coloring but once it comes to a boiling point I will be adding my purple I have my cup of water over here to the right and my brush for my sides I'm going to pan over so you can see what I'm doing and we're going to be puncturing try to set it up as straight as you can and this makes a big difference also with your farmer peaches because one so you apply your stick you do not have to worry about it sliding all over the place okay so we're going to puncture and puncture all the way down until you hit the seed we're going to turn this one and try to get it as straight as possible then I go down and puncture all the way till you hit the seed okay and just be very careful with them until you did that way your sticks won't come out okay so that is our puncturing process we are going to wait until our candy comes to a boiling point and we will be adding our gel food coloring neon purple by Chef Masters okay you guys I am back and it has reached a boiling point and we are going to add our jello so I'm going to put a couple of drops until I get the color that I want okay so that looks like it was about two drops and it is working its way in and remember not to stir your candy and there's Nate another drop just to make it a pretty purple and you can also add in flavor once it reaches 250 but I am NOT going to be adding flavor because I'm just doing this for demonstration purposes so we won't be adding flavor today but if you want it you could add grape so it would be a great flavor and I'm just showing you that the purple is working its way around and so it has completely dissolve into the candy okay so we are going to apply our thermometer and wait till this candy reaches okay you guys I came back on really quick to show you I have set here to the side my mold and my metal spoon because once we are finished dipping our peaches we are going to mold up the leftover candy so it will not be wasted and I'm going to show you the candy and this is how the purple is looking right about now and I will return when it reaches 300 okay you guys I am back and it is dipping time see if I can pull you out of it closer so we have a mixture here where we're going to stir it to make sure everything is combined I always start down to my bubbles have subsided okay we are going to we are going to place her on the mat we have a buckle there right once you go back in and pop bubble and we have a couple bows as it might not have dried the way it should okay now we have a couple of others here I'm just getting rid of some of them we are going to do with this leftover candy as to what we always do and create some artwork so even if you have a couple of bubbles you can create some artwork you okay we are going to do this one it's the same exact way now we have some bubbles because I probably didn't let it sit off enough because I usually let them sit out a while before dipping so once you have clean or prepped your peaches just let them sit out a while so they can completely dry and that will get rid of your bubbles and somebody asks me how i coded my candy at one time with the drizzle this is what I did that's how you double drizzle and that's also a way you can't get rid of your bubbles if you don't like them so that is how you double drizzle not sure but that is a double drizzle and scrape your bottom so it's flat and we are going to double drizzle the other one is with and be careful it doesn't get on your yes okay we're going to scrape the bottom and we're going to place her down so those are going to be your devil drizzle peaches and now we are going to add our leftover mixture and to and if you have an extra mole and you have candy left over apply it okay that's gonna be it and we're gonna wait until these cool down and we can pop them out of the mall okay so that is your devil drizzle peach and that's gonna be your other double drizzle peach okay and that is the dipping process of the peaches hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial like always thanks for watching", "CMUFLzmRqhQ": "hi sorry i've been posted in about three weeks but we're gonna be eating a little hard candies halloween themed i know in the daylight but they're

season but you know what they never really tasted that good these are handmade candies and it takes a lot of work to get those images in place seems like all they need to do is upgrade their flavoring and add some citric acid then they'd be delicious well unless you're making cinnamon or peppermint I don't know maybe I've only had the cheap kind because I'm looking in this magazine and these look fancy so I decided since it's my birthday month I'm going to order just random things that I wanted to try and I've watched this YouTube channel called lofty pursuits for a couple of years and it's always interesting to watch how he makes this image candy so I thought you know what I'm gonna order me a couple of these packages to see how they taste it took about three weeks for the package to get here and just when I thought they might have lost my order it showed up in my mailbox and of course I had to start digging right in because I was really curious about this package it's called Thanksgiving leftovers and it's supposed to taste like Thanksgiving food and that is very strange so I had to try it each 2.75 ounce bag costs $5.99 and they come with one of these fresh packets to keep the candy from getting sticky this package is the variety pack and I thought it was a good idea to get this one because then I can try all the different flavors and look at all the cool designs they come in different shapes and sizes somewhere kind of skinny and some are a little bit wider they start out hard in your mouth and then they dissipate where you can crunch them without hurting your teeth that's because of the air that is incorporated into a portion of the candy when he pulls it on the candy hook this one looks like a mug of root beer and I believe this one is a tutti frutti he adds citric acid to a lot of his fruit flavors and it really amps up the flavor and he won't know this one is called police Fox and it was inspired by Doctor Who and it looks like a little TARDIS inside this is a yummy raspberry flavor ignore my fingernails I teach elementary school and I just do my best these are black currant drops and I haven't tried black currant before I don't think but anyway these turned out to be my favorite it was the Thanksgiving leftovers that actually made me bite the bullet in order from lofty pursuits this time couldn't imagine how you could make Thanksgiving food tastes good in a candy so we're gonna try these he made a bunch of image candy and it was so successful that it sold out so quickly that he made it into drop form and he calls them leftovers to be sold after Thanksgiving this one was either cranberry or apple pie and it has sort of a cinnamon eat flavor there's also a merlot in there some I think this one was the buttered corn and it tasted okay it had a buttery flavor with a touch of corn this one I'm pretty sure was peach cobbler can't really go wrong with peach cobbler this one is honey baked ham and yes it tastes like you're sucking on a piece of ham and it sort of lingers in your mouth for a while too I didn't like it at first but it kind of grew on me this one has to be the pecan pie and it was really sweet and caramel II it was okay I guess but this one had to been the stuffing and I could not even finish this one I think it had garlic in it and celery powder I don't know if I got all the flavors that were available but I think this one was a sweet potato casserole and my husband recognized it right away and he liked it so that was kind of a fun little adventure for the taste buds I put them in a candy jar with a couple fresh packets and they didn't really last that long because we ate them pretty quickly so a big thumbs up for lofty pursuits these are fun beautiful colors and some wonderful flavors so I highly recommend thanks for watching", "mLxUczEZzis": "oh how are you doing today we're doing another video of my liking like now and then with the sky camera even is David and then do this we're

for you uh i found the uh cinnamon cream soft caramels the werther's original these are a limited edition they're out right now for the fall i found these and uh there are some other worlds originals that we we haven't tried but i told kevin i said oh no i said let's pair it up with some other cinnamon candy and we can compare the level of the heat and say what the differences are maybe in the cinnamon and uh which one is hotter than the other and so hopefully we will be able to discern between one and the other now we sit down right before the review and kevin said i wonder if we'll be able to taste the difference let's go ahead something just burn off your taste buds yeah then are you gonna be able to taste the next thing i don't know we're gonna give it a try we're gonna say we're gonna try okay so we're trying the newest thing first yes these are the cinnamon creme brothers originals these are hot tamales now these are red hots these are atomic fireballs which i love and then the jolly rancher uh cinnamon hard candies which you also love fire yeah cinnamon tire yeah so the prices i'm gonna give you the prices for everything first the uh werther's creams were uh uh 399 at target the then you wrote down the rest the hot tamales were 98 cents and then the fireballs were 1.98 the jolly ranchers were 248. and the red hots were 98. yeah the same prices so yeah hot tamale and uh uh red hot were both 98 cents so which is a good deal this is these kind of packages what we always call movie theater movie theater because that's what you're taking the movie yes exactly so we're going to try the brothers originals first harvest caramel cinnamon cream sauce caramel let's go ahead if we ever get back to watching movies in the theaters [Music] okay so they're wrapped they're soft yes they're salt go ahead and take one i like them they're soft caramels it says soft and creamy caramel outside and a delicious cinnamon cream on the inside this one sure if we can i don't know if we can five pieces 33 grams is 150 calories can we split get your own that means it must be pretty good i don't know how much was to drive out of it because it has a little softer center i may have pulled from that i didn't but [Applause] i've always loved the texture of their caramels mm-hmm kevin used to buy bags before those original all the time not the caramels the oddies the hard ones yeah the hard candy you would swap one week you better weathers and the next one do you remember what you'd buy them right wrong or something reason oh a lot of reasons um but you wouldn't think so because those are darker chocolate um those are excellent he loved raisin this is very very good the texture the caramel is really good that softer center is almost like a little nougat of goodness in there and um you get a cinnamon flavor in there it really goes well with the caramel you get a cinnamon flavor but it's not hot no i mean it is there you can tell they've used the cinnamon seasoning but it's not hot it doesn't it's not it doesn't burn right so like some of these other things will actually be hot they will actually burn this is not that kind of cinnamon this is a pleasant cinnamon that it it has a creamy cinnamon it's kind of like when you have a like a cinnamon coffee or a coffee with its creamer and it has cinnamon that's what that's like it's very very good definitely worth trying to and some of you might feel a burn from that we didn't but but no i don't think so i can't imagine this is one of those uh little candies that's it's like an indulgence because it's like it's like a grown-up candy because it uh it just tastes like you're eating something expensive when you eat one of these it's very good it's very good so do you want to try red hot or hot tamales do the hot water spicy hot tamales with fierce cinnamon flavor it says well they might be underneath no i don't know do red hot say they're red hots are just cinnamon okay you could probably sauce okay because i haven't had i haven't had a hot tamale in ages the original red hot cinnamon flavor candy so you were that kid the kid that couldn't stand bland you cranked it up at an early age and put hot sauce on everything that's why you love to dive head first into a box of red hots because those little devils spanked your tongue with a shot of hot that took candy to an entirely new experience and now generations later not much has changed red hot still deliver the heat for those that walk on the wild side i love those thank you i love that they spanked your yeah i love that that is awesome uh these are made by ferreira candy company products of mexico yeah they make all kinds of 25 pieces are 60 calories they uh these were the candies we used to now when we were kids you know they didn't have all these other things we would see how many we could put in our mouths like whole handfuls yeah yeah they used to sell them in a little box they'd sell these in a little box and the lemonhead almost like you'd have uh at halloween uh-huh okay you got that big banana chip one i got the biggest one there was that's what i do with food i picked the biggest the one that's most coated it's definitely got more cinnamon than the worthers did but they're not like super super hot they're still very sweet and you end up chewing them up to the they don't hang around long now these i've never now when you were a little kid did you suck on these or did you never buy them you chew them up they don't like that's what i'm saying they don't you chew them up so they really don't last long enough to be really hot for a long time i always chew them yeah i never now i'm sure there's people that put them in their mouth and they suck thought i'm like a man i i'm just not that bad if we were eating a whole handful of them to see if we could handle it right um then then you kind of have to look them in your mouth because you can't chew them see i never did i'm not a boy i think that's a boy thing to challenge each other yeah i never challenged my friends like that's just like the breath sprite we used to how many sprays can you do really ten sprays bianca what's yeah we would say how many can you handle we would yeah burn your mouth off yeah we i never did that with the flood of childhood um in the 80s these are good they're good they do leave a they're they're hotter they're hot it compared to the waters these are hot they don't have any creamy it's a it's a little uh crunch but once you bite into it it's chewy on you once you start kind of chewing it up i got to kind of get the chewy candy sugary kind of right this does not have any blur it just says uh with fierce cinnamon flavor and then it says america's number one cinnamon candy gluten-free fat free um these are always remind me of like the is it good and plenty that the whole the mike and i mike and i that's it mike and i didn't play anybody good play those licorice i don't know these are 16 pieces for 110 calories and they're made by just one so these are made by uh jelly belly which has a jelly bean texture don't who makes shallow dyes no in the same company makes your eyes peeps i don't know peeps that's what i meant i didn't mean jelly belly i meant peeps just born makes peeps those have the same cinnamon as the red hots they might be a touch hotter but it's than sticking your teeth yes the thing about these is they do have that jelly bean texture but since they're bigger than a jelly bean they're you're getting i think more goo in the middle than you would in a jelly bean they do tend to stick in your teeth which may make the cinnamon stay around a little bit longer that's what happens all these little pieces of cinnamon are stuck in your diet i'm thinking it intensifies the cinnamon because it's sticking around longer but i think it's the same level of heat as the i do too the red hot it's almost the same flavor really it's just in a different form it's in a jelly uh gel form okay now these these are tammy loves these she'll eat off she your her dad used to buy these big tubs for her of these like sam's club yeah and um here and there i personally they're small these are much smaller they are small they're not the big ones yeah i used to get the big ones just let me say i never really like these we are going to not eat the whole thing though because it wouldn't take you long we will take it so these are atomic fireballs three pieces are 60 calories they're made by ferreira candy company product of mexico i never ever done so i am gonna eat mine i always bite mine see if you keep in your mouth and you suck on them the layer of cinnamon is very very thick on these so it stays around for a long time and it's it just builds more and more and more i always always bite into mine even the great big ones no wonder you can eat them i will when i have it in my mouth i will like turn it around and around with my teeth in my mouth and get teeth marks all over it and then it softens it up it softens it up like an egg where you can just bite into it i love the crunch that satisfaction when you can crunch that whole thing in your mouth love it it's burning me up oh yeah it's hot but see yours is gone mine's gone mine is still working yeah through the mine still has red still going so it's still building oh yeah i'm sure it's hot i always almost always i could have left my mouth but almost always i've taken out my mouth yeah i've seen i always yeah i always saw kids doing that and i thought wimp adults having to take it out holding your hand wimp he's a wimp because i could always of course leave it in my mouth you know forever but you're chewing it but but i didn't as a kid as a kid i would leave it in my mouth and i the only reason i would take it out is if i wanted to talk to somebody yeah if cheating if you're chewing well i just like to eat now so it's just like food oh it's a is it a reasonable cool i have not had a jolly rancher cinnamon in years and the reason is is because they don't put these in their regular bags anymore no you have to buy them separate you have to buy them separate i guess it's because of allergies or could be or people were getting that to the cherries and getting mad about it i don't know i don't know i have no idea but you you have you you don't get these in a regular bag so i wish i could always love jolly ranchers the textures and we're going to have to get our own oh yeah i'm not splitting wood this is not one you could chew up really fast i've never chewed up jolly ranchers let me say the red hot was definitely hotter than anything else over there unless you i mean the firewall unless you were to stick a whole handful of the red hots in your mouth it was that is a different cinnamon it's not bad but it's different uh this is three pieces or 70 calories these are made by the hershey company so completely different company i feel like that is very different oh it's definitely not the intense like heat now i'm really not getting any heat after the fire after the fireball this is nothing but it's not this is like not even as hot yeah no this is not as hot as the hot tamales this is not as hot as the red hot um i mean there is some there's some heat there when i was really really young these used to seem hot and i don't know if they've changed the formula i'm sure somebody's watching that can tell us that has had these for years are they not as hot as they used to because that i just i think they're about as hot as the um the red hots i think there's some more heat i think the red dots are hotter but that's just me you know i'm just saying because the fireball i'm still got all that heat too um but these don't they're not i'm getting a consistent heat but it's not like i'm it's not building mm-hmm whereas i think the red hots if i were to keep eating right off it and just get hotter and hotter and hotter this is just kept keeping it one that's probably less it's probably more similar to what the caramels are it's more than the caramel in between yeah it's between the caramel because the caramel is not hot no it's a hot water so yeah this does have some heat to it but i think it's it would be the heat level would be these and then these and then these are going to be the same and then if you want the hottest one my favorite um and i just to to tell you which ones we would get again um i would not buy and it's it's it's for my own personal reasons i'm not telling you you will if you buy hot tamales you will like hot tamales if you like hot things i would not get hot tamales again because i don't like the way they stick in my teeth yeah i feel like it's going to damage my teeth yeah so i would not get hot tamales again and i wouldn't get those again no no i would get the jar i don't think they're bad i like them i don't think they're bad at all but when i'm buying something cinnamon i'm buying it and you know what it's just a totally different flavor of it's a different cinnamon flavor it's just different i just yeah i just this is more to me like a cinnamon candy something to enjoy whereas these are are too they're hot so that's not like i can't enjoy it but now i would get all three of these all three of these were my favorite because the red hots they're easy to crunch up and chew they didn't get stuck in my teeth at all the whirlers like i said it's just like a rich indulgence it's like a special treat and then the fireballs are just candy you know the only one that buys the werthers and the jolly ranchers okay so which ones did you like the least the the the red ons and then the hot tamales and the red ones and the barbells because they're hot yeah i wouldn't get any of them so it has nothing to do with texture or are you getting stuck in your teeth well the these i agree i don't like it i don't like but i got i eat jelly beans too i love jelly beans these are different than jelly beans yeah jelly beans do not get stuck in my teeth jelly beans have a uh thicker crisper outer shell and less of the goo in the middle those hot tamales have more goo and they're a lot of the jelly yeah you get more jelly and less outer coating that's what makes them stick in your teeth they do stick here super good yeah but yeah these i wouldn't get these necessary because it's not a candy i would sit there and enjoy eating firewalls i mean the atomic fireballs i would never enjoy you can only afford one because i could suck on these for a long time of course although these are really really those are excellent they're just excellent they're nuts but they're not just cinnamon yeah they're cinnamon with werther's original and a creaminess they're more caramel yes but i thought it would be fun just to compare them with other cinnamon candies i still think for a new product definitely try the world's out of here yes yeah they're really really good so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "GEtFqZg-ck8": "friends Romans countrymen let me introduce you to four candy infusions when start off a bubblegum rum these are really simple but they'll add to your party okay so we drop some bubblegum in it and then we hit it obviously with some rum and you let that bad-boy sit for a little bit okay it's not gonna dissolve as quickly as we did it that's movie magic and then strain it into a glass and there you have it next we have a Jolly Rancher tequila this one dropping the Jolly Ranchers hit that with some tequila and you just let that sit it's all gonna dissolve in a couple hours and that's one of the faster ones it's really easy next up we have marshmallow vodka okay dropping some marshmallows hitting with some vodka alright get a vodka now beautiful shake shake shake shake and let it sit again and they'll dissolve and then you get this nice okay that's nice marshmallow vodka so here we have red hots get the red hearts in there with some whiskey okay and shake let that dissolve okay when you see it doing that she's straining it okay she's actually straining out you know all the little impurities or little chunks in there all right I really like BIA the whiskey one cuz it reminds me a lot of I don't wanna say the particular brand okay but it's a cinnamon whisky brand okay that a lot of you younger guys love to drink alright stay tipsy friends stay tipsy give these a truck [Music]", "4MLu_vzwvF8": "you how's it going guys welcome back to another jhi review and today we're gonna be looking at this really long strand of different Pokemon candies it's almost hard to get it all on camera here but I'm gonna go ahead and cut this up a little bit so it makes it a little bit easier you got Pikachu Eevee and then some Pokemon I don't recognize as all you guys know from my other Pokemon things I reviewed it's kind of hard for me to remember newer ones even though I might have played the game there we go now that these are all organized let's go ahead and take a closer look right here we have a Pikachu pineapple which is a kind of a cute play on words you could chew pineapple and then this is what the back looks like ask some little thing right here almost looks like it might be a gotcha but I don't know if it's actually a gotcha it seems like there's something in this top thing but it'd be kind of weird if there was who knows I'll check it out ten grams of sugar per pack not too bad especially for hard sugar candies now we got ourselves a evey ten point nine grams expires 20 2002 morrow to 2020 and these are lime no melon looks like melon flavor now we got a Pokemon but I don't quite recognize I believe this is the pokemons son legendary let me know in the comments below and this is Cola or soda flavor I believe and then I believe this is from Pokemon moon and this is ramen a flavor ooh I don't know what this guy's from looks to be a ghost type but it's the nefarious grape flavor I am met again I am again met with I'm trying you last alright so let's go in order for the first thing I want to do which I doubt there's anything in here but I'm gonna open up this little pouch right here just to kind of like see what it's all about no there's nothing in here you think there would be I guess it's just holding up on the rack since there's so many things hanging off of it all right let's go ahead and open up the pineapple Iike juice these are what they look like inside they kind of look like pills I'm not gonna lie I want to spell out on my display so this is gonna be when I try see how it tasted I'm gonna be honest at first I thought it tasted a little bit like a vitamin but once I've been kind of settled into my mouth I think it was just the flavor for the pineapple cuz I'm not used to having pineapple flavored things I'm used to having to speak either pineapple I don't think that that's a really popular artificial flavor but after it's settled I kind of gave me a very sweet tarts or Smarties kind of feel to them not bad once you get past the initial flavor the aftertaste is good let's go ahead and move on to evey that out of the way looks like they're all gonna be white actually this one looks like it might be a little bit more bluish let's see how it tastes this one's really good I like this one a lot I do believe that it's melon flavor I could be wrong though but I really do like the flavor this one is pretty good a lot better than the first one that I tried didn't give me that vitamin kind of a flavor to it I think I'm going on the wrong path I think this one's next a zoom in on that real quick I'm getting a lot on a focus these are what these ones look like I believe they look a little bit more Brown than the other ones yeah just a little bit though see how it tastes that is surprisingly very well Cola flavored kind of reminds me of like I know this might sound bad but it's actually not bad it tastes like a flat Coca Cola and I know flat Coca Cola doesn't sound super appetizing or anything but it's actually not bad especially since there's no carbonation so it doesn't feel like it's off you just get that kind of Cola flavor with it that makes any sense let's try these romani flavored ones you know they're really blue looking see how it tastes those hands down are the best one so far and I think if you know me you already know how this one's gonna go time to trap that time to tackle down the infinite well I cannot talk today time to tackle down the infamous grape flavor might leave that tongue tie in just cause it's kind of funny let's open this up of course the only one that gives me trouble with the packaging is that grape flavor alright let's go ahead and try it well oh yeah mmm definitely grape flavored well without having to say this is definitely my least favorite let's put that down zoom in on it real quick this is my top favorite my third favorite my fourth favorite and then I think I'm I think I'm doing this wrong I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do this for you ready best okay top bottom and then everything in between I am NOT very good at talking in this episode I'm having trouble today but yeah no I I actually really liked most of these except obviously the grape one so yeah I huge shout out to my patreon so thank you guys so much for your support you guys are super appreciated if you enjoyed this

you will know that I am NOT great at keeping the promises that I make sometimes although this one still has hope I'm just you know giving you a fair warning if I don't get two to four of this week but anyway some of you may remember that a long ways back I made jello Legos with these molds which did take me a couple of tries but they ended up looking okay and today I figured I should try to get more than one usage out of these $23 Lego molds I decided to take some inspiration from a tipsy bartender and all the other channels that have been doing shot glasses made out of Jolly Ranchers recently and use that same concept to make these Legos instead now there's a couple different ways that I'm considering doing these one of which I am assuming is going to come out the best but I will try a few so let's get right into it now if you are if you are out there that is more intelligent than the YouTube algorithm meaning that you have at least one brain cell and you make any amount of sense at all you would be able to assume that we need a whole lot of Jolly Ranchers for this project if this video gets taken down by YouTube you all know why but what I decided to do was to tump out the entire bag and to separate each of the five colors into their corresponding bulbs while also unwrapping each individual candy piece and this step is just about as fun as this time-lapse looks but once you complete that we can move on to the first method that I will be attempting and that is the double boiler method I've seen people melt down different types of hard candy like this before which is why I think that this might work so I've started with a few of the cherry flavoured because I tended to have the most of those and get even a while to melt down in the bulb and if you guessed that this was going to be a thick sticky mess than you were absolutely correct every single utensil I tried to use to stir this just did not work and got stuck everywhere the candy never really melts down completely to a liquid form it just stays really thick and the second you take it off the heat it thickens up even more so I tried my best to put the mixture in one of the little molds and let it cool down which as you can imagine was also at a C and a half but I guess when I took it out of the fridge it kind of worked a little bit but I think we can do a lot better for method number two all I did was stuffed each mold with different colors of the Jolly Ranchers I used four in each of these blocks which I'm hoping won't be too much or too little and once I had one of those molds completely filled I threw it in a 400 degree oven for about seven to eight minutes that's it for you if you're gonna try to make these things if you see a ton of bubbles in the top of the candy that means your oven is too hot or you left them in for too long but all you really have to do is just go in and try to pop them with a toothpick or a different sharp object just a little bit of extra work so avoid it is possibly but once I had done that that into the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes until it hardened up and these look a ton better they still didn't take perfect shape of the molds they really didn't get all the divots in it and you can kind of see the crevice where all the candy is kind of melted together so I made one more batch like that and they came out just about the same the last thing I want to try with these though is to do the same method but halfway through the baking process put another different mold on top so that way the divots from the top mold will hopefully melt down into the candy so you can stack them together I did a few batches with that method and they came out even better than the last one so I tried to build some stuff with them I tried to make a nice little candy staircase and I guess that came out pretty cool I tried to make a YouTube logo which came out pretty crappy if you ask me honestly and lastly I tried to build a wall with an accurate representation of the theoretical integrity of Donald Trump's [Applause] one last piece of advice I do not recommend being overly aggressive with these or dropping them from any sort of height because they're kind of fragile and will chip a lot being that they're hardened candies they're actually almost on par with being just as fragile as a drama channel's YouTube career but I hope you enjoyed

lofty pursuits and\npublic displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida\nthis is Greg and we're going to be making some hard candy today we're gonna\nbe making candy shamrocks we're gonna make it on this machine that was\nmanufactured in the late 1800s in Philadelphia and we're gonna use some\nshamrock rollers that are of the same age for st. Patrick's Day\nthis is gonna be apple flavored and the sugar is already heated to 310 degrees\nand we're gonna pour it on our candy cooling table and then add some citric\nacid so our apple can have a little bite the sugar already has the flavoring in\nit when I poured it and it's already been colored a sort of forest green\nbecause this video is about the trees of Ireland we think of st. Patrick's days\nthat's celebrated in the United States as an Irish holiday but perhaps it might\nbe better to think of it as an American holiday in Ireland until 1970 pubs were\nclosed all over the island on st. Patrick's Day it was a solemn occasion\nthe parade's the celebrations like that started in the United States and it\nstarted in about 1760 with some Irish soldiers who were serving in the British\nArmy who wanted a parade in New York City because of this I wanted to make\nthe first flavour in this assortment of shamrocks they're gonna be about four to\nseven flavors when we're done in this assortment to be more somber and I\npicked apple because it's actually a connection between apples and Saint\nPatrick in the fifth century when st. Patrick was traveling around Ireland he\ndid good works and one of his good works was in a town called our MA and I hope\nI'm pronouncing that right it's a town in Northern Ireland where he planted an\napple tree and this apple tree is the inspiration of the apple flavor of this\ncandy and the trees of Ireland is the inspiration for the color which is a\nforest green you see Ireland when that st. Patrick\nwas alive was covered with forests and it wasn't until the 1600s then a lot of\nthose rolling fields in Ireland came to be but the trees were cut down some were\ncut down to create more gland to farm well a lot of the trees were cut down to\nmake room for new farms with the growing populations in Ireland the big ones and\nmost of the forests were cut down for the shipbuilding industry which became\ntrue in the 1600s in Ireland it makes me\nwonder how much of the growing green hills we think of Ireland would have\nbeen the Ireland that st. Patrick's would have recognized himself by the\nearly 20th century forests and Ireland covered only 1.5 percent of the island\nthanks to reforestation efforts just during the last hundred years that\npercentages continued to grow and it's now closer to ten percent but that's\nnowhere near what it would have been back in st. Patrick's time you can sort\nof see how important trees were to Irish Life back there just by the number of\ntowns that were named after trees we've now run the candy through the press and\nall that's left to do is to break it up into pieces and if you've ever wondered\nwhy drops are called drops watch on we're still working on this assortment\nand we're trying to do a bunch of cool flavors in this shamrock wallet I'm not\nsure what the final colors of flavors will be but I know we're gonna do an\nIrish cream and we're going to do a Guinness and chocolate and we're going\nto do hopefully a truffle and whiskey flavor as well but we're starting with\nthe somber flavor here today if you want to order this you can go to our website www.PD.net We are located at the Thomasviile Road exit of I-10\nlove to see you. We don't make candy every day but we make it a lot of days\nand we're open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. we serve brunch in the morning ice cream\nthe rest of the day and of course we ever candy and it's all

gotta go to chick-fil-a and the closest chick-fil-a is about an hour away so we took the road trip there and back but anyways i went to dollar general today because i saw on instagram that they had new all peach jolly ranchers oh the south is gonna love this candy i tell you what i wish i was in georgia right now i'd be so hot but honestly my prediction here is it's gonna taste like that artificial peach flavor which i don't mind but i would prefer a real peach any day which is why i question myself why do i make these decisions why do i eat sugary things when i could just eat the real fruit straight up you know what i mean man anyways a cousin she's being a bit quiet i don't understand she's very facetious but anyways um she's going to review this too i guess this might be the last or second last review that she's a part of for a while because she'll go back to pennsylvania i'll go back to virginia but she might be as part of the cookies and cream crispies review that i

them okay well you can like but you gotta oh no she doesn't like them okay well let's see if i like them instantly got that strong artificial peach flavor it's got a bit of a sourness to it this is horrible i don't think it's horrible if you're not used to artificial peach flavor i guess not here kid try this um it's not fantastic but it's not terrible it's just a bit sour it's kind of good it's gross it's not bad but yeah it's not bad again artificial to me i'm gonna give it a seven yeah seven it's a bit sour five and again it's a bit sour wait did i just say that twice it's a bit sour and it's a bit artificial is what i need to say um i don't mean to say it's sour sour sour i mean to say it's sour and artificial but anyways um i feel like i want to repeat groundhog day um but no that's i hope you had fun watching me act like an idiot gross that's not that bad but you gave me yeah let's play it out it's not bad again it's preference i say i prefer a real peach it doesn't taste like but some people like the artificial peach flavor which is fine i mean it does taste like peach yeah it does but it's more like the art you can tell there's an extent where you can tell it's not peach and that's where the artificial light comes in so it's not bad um this is my favorite jaw ranch i've ever had probably not but he's making it rain and jolly ranchers i guess [Music] anyways um go dodgers um i hope you enjoyed this video no you're wasting the jolly ranchers like that okay i hope you enjoyed this video and i'll have more content in the near future all right i'll see y'all", "uHNDsUfjSnc": "[Music] how to make homemade hard candy these days you can buy candies by the bulkan groceries supermarkets and nearby convenience stores but what you are probably not aware of is the fact that you can make your own hard candy at home given the right ingredients in some tools and equipment that you probably already have in your kitchen you can add these old-fashioned hard candies to your gift baskets for a change instead of just putting cupcakes and pastries in them if you are ready to make your own candies at home here are the steps on how to make homemade hard candy 1 prepare the following ingredients and equipment 2 cups of sugar 3/4 cup of hot water 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 1/8 tsp flavoring of your choice food coloring 1 large saucepan 1 candy thermometer greased cookie sheet or candy molds kitchen scissors to make sure that you have the proper temperature for making candies it is crucial to create homemade hard candies in optimal temperatures that is around 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit with low humidity your candy will not turn out successfully if the weather is too hot or extremely humid and rainy even your altitude can affect the outcome of the candy you may need to make adjustments if you live in a high altitude area if you have suboptimal temperature conditions you may want to compensate by cooking the candies 1 to 2 degrees higher than what is recommended in the recipe 3 combine the corn syrup sugar and water in the large saucepan stir the ingredients over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved which takes about 5 minutes afterwards you can leave it alone and let it boil for another five minutes to ensure even heating it is best to do this on a burner that is wider than the saucepan you are using for once your mixture is boiling raise the heat to high to make sure that you are hitting the right temperature attach a candy thermometer to the saucepan however make sure that the thermometer does not touch the base of the saucepan and your pan must be tall enough so that the thermometer does not reach its bottom when hung on the pan lip if you do not have a candy thermometer you may get a glass of ice-cold water to use as your gauge 5 right before the mixture reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit add the food coloring and flavoring to the mixture you do not need to stir the mixture as the boiling action is enough to thoroughly incorporate the color and flavor 6 when the mixture reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit remove it from the high heat immediately or it will burn if you do not have a candy thermometer drop a tiny bit of the candy mixture into the glass of ice cold water if the drop solidifies and floats to the surface then your mixture has reached the required temperature it is okay if the temperature in the saucepan continues rising as long as you were removed it from the heat 7 pour the mixture onto a greased cookie sheet and spread it around the sheet be quick as it will be hard to spread the mixture once it cools down if you want to give your candies a consistent shape you may pour the mixture in candy molds or mini muffin pans do not refrigerate as it will make your candies harden too quickly 8 wait for 30 minutes to an hour for the candy to harden if you used a cookie sheet cut the candy into several pieces using kitchen scissors 9 store the homemade hard candies and paper bags or metal tins learning how to make homemade hard candy is best done during the cold season as it complies with the optimal temperature for making candies during the holiday season you can also wrap these candies individually and include them as part of your gift baskets for your loved ones [Music]", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here

i am with my grandma and my mom and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be putting um these candies drilling ranchers into this silicone molds silicone mold and um we're gonna melt them and um we're gonna put it back in the fridge we're gonna put them in the fridge every night yeah and then um we'll show you the finished hard candies yeah so let's get on with it okay so the first thing that you will need to get get or do is so you'll get a plastic bag and the first jolly ranchers you know that a little goes a long way that's what we're gonna be doing so you're gonna put the jolly ranchers in there without the raptor my mom's gonna get a hammer so we can smash it so first jelly wrench you're going in and that's the first jolly roger in we have a mammoline a blueberry i can't open this without touching it i don't want to edit it but you're the one that's going to be eating them so it's going to be okay so we have the first ones in here you're going to want to seal it very tightly i'm struggling there you go and then once it's sealed what are you going to do just tell them you know once it's sealed we're going to crush it that's the hammer and i'll go and i'll show you what it looks like when it's done okay so we crossed it with the hammer and why did we crush it we crush it so it's in smaller pieces and it melts quicker perfect and you don't have chunks in it right yeah which one you press we're actually gonna do layered ones with blue ones because we have extra of blues we're gonna start with just half of it so half of the amount that we have four inches four and a half because there's nine four jolly ranchers crushed up we didn't actually measure it it just looks about that thick and we are gone how we're gonna put these in the microwave and we're gonna put it in for 60 seconds at 80 percent and try to melt it so we can pour it into the molds and before we do that we're going to get some pam spray and spray it and wipe off any excess so that we can get them out of here after we're done that's funny they can't see what they're doing okay is that good no that's way too much oh yeah all right so that's a lot [Music] we're gonna kind of just wipe off any excess and we don't want it to be a ton but we do want to have that barrier so that it can pop out easily if it bubbles that means it's close to ready like that so we're just gonna be pouring it in yep so we don't want to burn ourselves yeah we are gonna pour it into the bottom quickly so it doesn't cool off and get hard again of a couple of the molds right sophia yeah okay will you keep pouring i'm gonna go or go get me a spatula so when you do this you're gonna want an adult with you but because it's gonna be really hot it's come on and if you mess up an accident um what should you do you should just like if it gets really hard you should put it back in the microwave because it can dry very easily okay can you get rid of those webs yep and pause it please yes okay here's number five it's gonna schedule a bit here's number six i wanna get some scissors and cut the webs that sounds so weird oh no that one's really full i don't think we are gonna add another color to that maybe that one will be all blue yeah okay let's see what this one is the final blue layer okay and you'll have all these super fine candy hairs everywhere that you can eat because they're delicious okay i'm gonna clean this up and start on the next color they're very interested in what's happening no no no no no no no no thank you not frank fun facts or dogs names are hank and june the black ones hank that one's june let's see your face [Music] okay no this is hank the black one thank you okay you get something yeah i wonder if this red and blue one is gonna be purple i guess we're gonna find out huh and just so you know if you don't want them to mix that awfully well don't um you would want them to cool first and then put the other color in candy wipes candy webs it's really hot okay pause it please okay so we have these yeah so we made about eight of them with about 12 jolly ranchers yes so we are gonna now put these in the fridge and let them harden and then we'll show you the final results and we're looking for about 15 minutes in the fridge so um we took them out of the fridge this is what they look like right now are they pop-outable yes they are yes they are yes they are you can pop them out and look they're little pixelated hearts i really like this craft um i was thinking about it for a while um i would recommend doing this because even the string things are delicious

Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make

welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "_5Xt5RU_FfI": "everybody it's me Claire and I once again in my video I have meadow hi last

channel let's go", "dmFGGXRKRac": "[Music] and delight edibles thank you for joining me my name is Liz and today we are gonna be making chewy buttery caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "8D__KieWACI": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel

sour skittles using the cannabis simple syrup [Music] all right guys my cannabis our skittles is done to my left is the sour skittles using discipline and to my right is the cannabis sour skittles using cannabis honey simple syrup now as far as potency definitely it would be the cannabis sour skittles using the distilling so if you can get this lint use that if not just make your cannabis honey simple syrup and um you'll be good to go but uh thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe peace [Music] you", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here

welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "8-3Xe7RMg3w": "So today, we're making a batch of Guava flavoured candy. The design will have three different colours white, black and green. There will be a very beloved animal design inside our candy today. The animal has two colours, black and white. You can take a guess at what we're going to make today. So now I'm mixing in the white colour which is going to be the face of the Panda and background of the candy. The green is going to be the wrap of the candy. Since Panda's like bamboo a lot, we figured to make the outside of the candy green to resemble the bamboo's colour. We put some of the candy in a frying pan... the reason is that it's easier to control when we have many different colours. So now I'm about to put the malic acid into the black part. It's the kind of acid we put in our non-citrus flavours, to make the flavours more robust. So Guava is kind of a sweet flavour, but we still need to put in quite a bit of the malic acid. So now I'm going to pour it out. The candy is very liquidy, that means it's still extremely hot. It's about 180\u00b0 Fahrenheit which is still too hot for us to make a shape with it. So we're going to let it cool down a little more. This big piece is also cooling down, so we're going to check if it's cool enough to put in the acid. We don't want to put the acid in too early, otherwise it will burn and make the candy yellow. The temperature is about right so I'm going to put in the rest of the malic acid. Now let's mix it in. As you can see, the edge of the candy has already cooled down. It makes it easier to separate. I need to separate this really quick, and to be accurate. So later on I'm going to stretch this big yellowish mixture. We're going to make this shiny and white by using a technique we call sugar pulling. So what's she's doing right now, is cooling the candy down with her hands folding them, making sure it has an even temperature all around As you can see, it's no longer as soft as it was earlier. The candy mixture even right now is extremely hot. How do I know? I learned the hard way. Look at my battle scars. [laughs] You will be very surprised... we are working with something extremely dangerous and hot. Right now I'm stretching this big piece on a hook. What I'm doing is called sugar pulling, candy stretching... many different names but basically what I'm doing is folding air into the candy so it will reflect more light The tiny air bubbles also help make the candy very crunchy. What I'm pulling is about 6 Kilograms of sugar. I have to keep pulling this at a steady speed. This is truly quite a workout. A few more stretches, we're almost there. At the end, this big piece is becoming harder to pull, because it is cooling down a little bit. That's why we have to do it really fast, when we get the chance. We're done. Now it's so white and shiny... and it's so fluffy. This is going to be our panda. You may ask, why don't we use the hook again? It's too small for the hook. It will cool down too fast. That's why she'll do it by hand on the table, while still warming the candy. This requires a lot of physical strength as well. I'm just happy to have a break. [laughs] You may notice the black is no longer very dark. It became kind of a silverish grey. But Don't worry, the final result will be very dark, and black. So now I will start to make the panda. We will make his eyes first. So I cut a little piece of white off, let's get a little piece of black - to be his eye ball. You may ask why we're only making one eye, when a real panda has two eyes. Well, in the candy making world, we try to make things that are identical only once. So later on you can see how we turn this one eye into two eyes. To make the piece, I'm applying a little bit of water on it. And then we're going to put the eye ball right in the middle. Then let's wrap the black with the eye white. Then roll it out. Then I'm going to take this black piece right here and make the panda's most important symbol on his face which is his lovely eye shadow. So now we're going to make this one bigger. So we will be able to wrap the eye we just made. So earlier you saw were were applying two pieces of candy together with water. Water is really like a superglue when we make candies. They help two pieces of candy that are a bit cold to stick together. When the candies are hot they just stick on their own. So now we already made one eye for the panda. Now we will turn that one eye into two eyes. It's actually very simple. When we make candies and we need to make multiples of identical pieces we simply stretch it and cut it into the quantity that we want. In this case we're going to seperate the one eye into two eyes. Now I'm going to cut this piece. So as you can see we've already finished the two eyes of the panda. For the nose it's going to be a little downwards triangle. The mouth is going to be two half circles with black outlines on them. Like I said earlier, we're just going to make one piece, then cut that in half. We have our panda's face all assembled. You may not see the entire panda yet, but soon. Now we'll just make his face fatter. It's face is nearly complete, we're just going to make an outline of black, to draw his face. We have to remember to leave some black to make the ear. Now... it's big round face. Now we just have to make it's ear. Now the panda is inside the roll. What's left is to make a final wrap using our green. The reason why we have to constantly roll the candy is that the table is heated. If we don't constantly roll, the candy will become flat and the image inside will become disoriented. So now we're going to stretch this big candy into small pieces that are bitable sized. Now it's about ready, this is how we make it small! Thank you very much for watching the video. My name is Lin. This is a customized lollypop made of real sugar.

Until next time... have a sweet day!", "nehx8ZqAmA8": "hi guys welcome back to the sugar test kitchen today I'm making habanero salted watermelon some of you guys have asked for videos that are longer and unedited so this video is a real-time video and then the next video that I'm uploading is an edited high speed video so choose which one you want to watch or watch both it's all good with me enjoy the video so here I'm adding a mixture of citric and malic acid to make it a little bit tangy without any acids the candies are just gonna taste like nothing in a real fruit you've got tang Ennis what's the same concept in a candy [Music] here I'm adding a new addition to the sugar pantry it's a sea salt from the Jacobson Salt Company that's infused with habaneros it's really salty it's got a little bit of a kick to it it's really nice not as much heat as I wanted so I've also gonna add some habanero powder into it as well which is from Silk Road spice merchants here in Calgary it gives it a really nice heat something that's gonna smack you in the face but still be really nice on the palate you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here I'm pulling half of the sugar until it's shiny and opaque I want it to be quite a bit lighter than the unpooled sugar so it has a nice contrast in the design to the candies it also makes the candies feel a lot nicer in the mouth and gives you the ability to crunch through them if you wanted us crazy people that likes to bite through their candies [Music] [Music] a pattern that I'm going for in these candies is really soft and subtle I like the contrast of a really spicy really intense candy with a subtle soft design that sort of tricks your mind into thinking that you're not gonna be eating something and crazy hot that's gonna make your mouth burn in your eyes water to have the such a contrast is really nice in these candies because it's just a nice baby pink it's it's a nice candy it's so innocent nothing's gonna happen when you eat them it's also a good way to trick your friends into thinking that you're just being really nice and giving them a candy [Music] I actually have a funny story about our spicy candies I have a customer who buys our candies all the time and he has them on his desk but he keeps complaining about his work colleagues who keep stealing his candies it was driving him crazy so one day what he did was he bought our pick-and-mix but also bought some spicy candies and mixed them in with his pick-and-mix because they really don't look any different he could find out who would take his candies when he'd see someone walking through the office with tears streaming down their face because they had a ghost pepper candy or habanero candy that looked just like a nice innocent candy they thought that they were maybe getting a peppermint they're a bit wrong he says he's never had an issue with anybody stealing this candy since of course I do have to add that I don't condone this but desperate times call for desperate measures [Music] while I'm pulling these rods I just want to explain a little bit about how pick-and-mix I've had so many emails and questions asking what is pick-and-mix how does it work and i have people who want to try 18 flavours and the Lord that 18 boxes not understanding that they can mix them and then want interchange so the way that it works is that you pick a box size you can have small medium large or extra large which is coming soon and you pick the flavors that you want to go in that box so say you want salted caramel salted licorice peppermint it's fizzy elderflower with strawberry and fizzy Cola you pick those on our list on the website and then I'll mix those flavors into one box for you just for the cost of one box so you get to try all of those flavors without having to buy a box of every single flavor if you want to buy a box for just one flavor that's completely fine as well that's an option on our website but a picker mix is a way for you to get more freedom and to try as many candies as you like [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] now we have to keep the rods around to stop the count these from being all flat and misshapen the candies are still edible of course if that happens but they're just not as aesthetically pleasing so we like to do this just have to say that chopping these rods was a pain because of the salt in them and the spices they don't cook cleanly like regular candies so they like to chip off in really small pieces and really big pieces that you have to go back in and chop again definitely not my favorite candies to cut they taste really good but boy were they paint [Music] so those of you who stayed to the end of this video thank you so much for watching these candies will definitely be made in our commercial kitchen and they'll be up for sale on our website this Sunday please stay tuned at Stewie's wwg candy com thanks please like and subscribe and have a great day [Music]", "mpIH1DRnK-4": "yoyoyo how's it going snake them back again with another video from vapor abuse and today our video is gonna be reviewing the top eat juices of the month now we're gonna be doing this [ __ ] me in the [ __ ] I love cheese's and now this will be a monthly video introducing five new juices that we have that are going to be on second why babe calm as well as customers feedback if they're top-5 salt Nick's so let's get started alright so topping out at number one of my personal favorite juices is going to be the nasty slow blow nasty slow blow is going to be a pineapple lime soda as well as with a hint of menthol now NASA's been one of my favorite brands from eliquid to when salt became popular and it turned into salt Nick I actually have the nasty slow blow in my Orien and this is probably the best combination the Orion has the perfect amount of flavor and the adjustable airflow to match with this amazing juice so taking a few hits off these off this device to just tell y'all personal feedback on the juice so with this juice it is a menthol based juice and you don't really get a lot of it with the nasty since it is considered a low mint juice but that is still it's a pineapple soda and I do taste that the pineapple I don't really taste the lime in this juice but the pineapple is the better flavor so this juice to me is gonna be number one on my list with all of the features features so coming in at number two I'm gonna have this aqua mist this Alchemist is gonna be a green apple peach in Kiwi this is personally one of my favorite aqua juices I do use aqua a lot I did a video on the zero when I did my video on the zero I used aqua mist to tell you how I thought about it so what I look for in an e juice is the fact that what their flavor description says so aqua said that aqua mist is going to be a green apple peach and kiwi and to me all three flavors were there it was 100% correct each flavor was brought out in the vapor production as well as the taste the green apple the peach and the Kiwi was all there and the flavor was amazing my juice coming in at number three is actually a customer preference and all their feedback telling me on how great this juice is and this is going to be naked 100 lava flow this is gonna be a strawberry pineapple coconut so kind of like a strawberry pi\u00f1a colada I'm personally not a big fan on coconut flavored juices but I have tried this a couple of times and when I did the flavor was really on point they did a good job mixing it it is a 50/50 VG PG which is in my opinion one of the best salt licks you can get the main focus on this was the strawberry and to me the strawberry is way more powerful than the coconut and the pineapple which in my opinion is a plus I've personally heard that a lot of people like this juice just because they want a pi\u00f1a colada juice and there isn't really another juice mates making this video I also realized this is our last one in store this juice is so popular that we can't even keep it in the store often we usually sell about 10 to 15 bottles of this a day which is the most popular in all three of our stores online second white vape we you're always sold out of this and we have to wait for our new shipment to come in so try this wallets in stock that's big what there's no plant called there's no yeah but I think the Jolly Ranchers are blue raspberry that's based on one I don't know it's like a blueberry that's got a raspberry we're out here boggling minds I know so coming in at number four is gonna be the air factory blue razz this air factory blue razz reminds me of a Jolly Rancher that is the blue raspberry flavored and to me that is my favorite color Jolly Rancher I don't know about y'all you can comment your favorite Jolly Rancher down in the comment section but this is my favorite hard candy flavored juice this is more of the sweeter one flavored juice not the multi mixed fruits so to me this is an original flavor and the flavor is really brought out in certain devices like the soaring air the flavor is really strong in it the readout which I do have is the flavor is really strong in this with this juice so if hard candy is your cup of tea then go ahead and give air factory blue razz a shot you will not be disappointed I promise I guarantee it last but not least we have the mr. salty cotton candy mr. salty cotton candy is actually our number two seller on our website secondlife.com it is the most popular eliquid you can find this in a twenty-five and a forty-five milligram nicotine which a lot of you do like as a pro the lower the nicotine sometimes you don't want 50 sometimes you want 25 sometimes you want 35 which is very hard to come by but mr. salty is one of those brands that does do that so that in my opinion is a very big plus but cotton candy takes me back it tastes like the circus cotton candy that I used to go when I was five years old and go get cotton candy with my mom and dad at the circus it's got the blue raspberry taste as long with a strawberry taste so to me that's kind of my favorite fruits mine I know blue-raspberry isn't a fruit but I do like the candies that are blue razz so to me blue raspberry and strawberry two of my top favorite flavors so this to me is one of my favorite juices as well as our most popular on our website so that was my top five favorite juices of 2018 and I'm very excited to see what 2019 has to bring for us so thank you very much for watching our video please like and subscribe leave a comment down in the comment section of what you want

sonic but today I worry i'm doing a sour o meter which is awesome i can tonight look um this one is screaming salad green apple so I'm gonna get I'm gonna see what is inside it is it look like this hey toes Bailey sallu I'd say you guys like this just a balmy doing some more videos on minecraft robots any sort like that please leave it like in the description or some views does it matter see you all and that's one goodbye", "4_oVVh4XCP4": "[Music] [Music] ahoy there crew and welcome to the shooting i'm your captain shea bernard and today we're going to be trying some aiki eye candy my cousin um gave me these like asian candies you guys can see this there's a couple of different ones here but like yeah there's a couple of different flavors i think once pineapple i think one's melon we got a strawberry and looks like apple i think but uh yeah we're gonna try these let's see what they're like apparently like these are like little hard candies so right yeah interesting like false yeah see hmm that's pretty good i think that's apple very sweet but also has like a kind of an odd flavor to it interesting okay so that apple one not half bad had a little bit of a a weird like after flavor like it tasted a little off like a little weird i don't really know how to explain it i want to say chemically but maybe not i don't feel like that's correct it just tastes odd to me [Music] let's try the pineapple see if i can get it open there we go just a yellow ball i really taste like pineapple holy [ __ ] a little sour but like a lot of [ __ ] pineapple okay that's a lot of [ __ ] pineapple holy [ __ ] damn there's a lot of [ __ ] pineapple okay i'm used to like candies from other places usually having like subtle flavors not that i was like [ __ ] a face full of [ __ ] pineapple holy [ __ ] like i don't mind pineapple it's definitely not on my list of favorite flavors and i kind of tend to stray away from it a bit that was way too much for me to handle like that's too much pineapple for me to enjoy okay let's try melon i tend to like melon things so this one's a little different i think this is from a different company like the other three are all from um dake i think it's how it's pronounced see that but yeah this one i think is from a different company but this is supposed to be melon very melon flavor very button not sure if i like it not subtle very powerful i honestly might say that it might rival some american candies from like flavor like it's just [ __ ] packed full of flavor okay i'm gonna drop that chill wrapper there we go okay not really big on the melon it's not bad just a lot of melon like a face [ __ ] full of melon okay damn it's good just too much i think for me personally not bad though if you like melon or pineapple i would definitely suggest these like i don't mind melon but like it's a lot of melon flavor i do like though a lot a lot a lot is strawberry that's the last one that we have here so let's try strawberry this is a lot a lot of strawberry i'm gonna enjoy it i have a feeling that i really like it i do say one thing i like about these candies it's just a small thing but they're just like spheres of candy like it's not like like i don't know it's just like a small thing when it comes to like candy i don't know i just i like those shaped like almost like a perfect sphere i don't know it's it's kind of satisfying to me oddly enough the strawberry is really mellow it's not very powerful it's good it doesn't taste like like american strawberry candy it doesn't really taste like strawberries really which is really sweet it has like subtle notes of strawberry in there it tastes more like sugary sweet overall overall i'd give those candies probably like a like a seven out of ten they're not bad the pineapple and the melon are definitely extremely potent and powerful so much that it is not for me because it's just too much like they're just two flavors that like i'm not really super keen on and with them being as potent as they are it's just too much for me but if you guys like those flavors i would highly suggest this i didn't really like the apple at all like i said it kind of tasted funky and then on top of that the um the strawberry didn't really taste too much like strawberries at least the way that i imagine like strawberry candy in america so i guess that being like what i'm used to it doesn't taste like that so maybe it's just a difference of like cultural region or something i have no idea but either way like these were pretty decent candies overall and they all had like very potent flavors so honestly they're not bad candies so if you guys want to try them i'd definitely suggest hunting it down and nah daikey is about d-a-k-e-y-i you guys want to look it up should also be in the title of this description of the video so you guys want to look into it i suggested and uh thanks to my cousin for helping me out with these i appreciate it this was really cool i enjoyed trying these and uh i can see why she really likes these too like the the pineapple and the melon especially like those two had some like kicking flavors so i would definitely be recommending these to a couple of my friends who i know really enjoy like tropical flavors like that so anyway thank you guys for watching if you want to check out more videos like this check out my destitutorium playlist there's a bunch of food review stuff there if you guys want to check that out thank you for watching we'll see you at the journey's end tata you", "qG-Ac48CyVU": "what's up friends welcome back today i will be showing you how to make infused pixie sticks the powder inside of these can also be used to dip your suckers into to eat by itself and if you add a lot of citric acid you can get it so sour that it's even more sour than warheads which is kind of how i like mine in this video i'm also going to be showing you guys how to infuse the sugar but if you already have infused sugar or don't need to know how to make it you can skip to six minutes in this video to get right to making the pixie sticks [Music] to make the infused sugar you're going to need half a cup of tincture and one and one quarter cup of granulated sugar start by pouring your sugar into a large dish and then pour your tincture on top and stir it all together i felt like mine was too liquidy so i added another quarter cup of sugar and then stirred that some more after i added the sugar the consistency was much better you could definitely still see the grains instead of it being mostly liquid like it was before um if you guys aren't sure about how much sugar to use if you find it's too liquidy just keep adding a few spoonfuls of sugar until you get a consistency closer to something like this then we need to evaporate all the alcohol off of this sugar so we're going to preheat our oven to the lowest temperature that it can go for me that's 170 degrees and we're going to place it into the oven leaving the oven door open and i'm also having a fan just to help with air circulation because you are having alcohol in the oven you have to be very very very careful to make sure to never close the oven door and to always have good airflow then i'm going to set the timer for about 10 minutes and every 10 or 15 minutes i'm going to come back and stir the mixture this is what mine is looking like after the first 10 minutes so i'm just going to stir it and try to kind of scrape down the sides and i'm gonna have to do this quite a few times like i said every 10 to 15 minutes just come and stir it so because i am making pixie sticks um i want to flavor my sugar so i want two different flavors so i'm just going to get another baking dish and pour part of this mixture into it and then i'm going to add a flavoring oil to each dish now we want to do this earlier in the process so we can help with the evaporation of the liquid but it doesn't really matter if you put it in the first 15 minutes the second 15 minutes or anything like that just try and put it while there's still liquid in there so that it can evaporate with the rest of the liquid then we'll just put it right back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes again we're going to have to repeat the process of in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it at a stir put it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it out to stir until it has returned to its original grainy sand consistency so at this point the sugar has been in the oven for about 45 minutes i think and is still a little bit too liquidy so again we're going to stir it and then put it back in the oven for a bit and continue to do this until we get a nice consistency so after about an hour and a half it was pretty much all good i did leave it sitting out um for a couple hours just to dry off any extra moisture and then here is what it looked like you can see it definitely made some clumps so we are going to break those up and each of these dishes are different flavors for me but um one is bubble gum and one is watermelon so i don't really mind if i'm using the same utensils because the flavors kind of go together but yeah so i'm just going to scrape all the sugar off the bottom of the dish and then we are going to put it in a blender to um make it nice and refined so i'm just pouring some of this sugar into my blender and we're going to try and grind it down into a finer texture unfortunately i don't know if it's because i put too much sugar that might be the problem um i it wouldn't really grind like the the blender wouldn't really get it to um like mix i don't know it just it wasn't working very well for me so i decided to use a food processor instead but i have a feeling if i did smaller amounts in the blender it probably would have worked a little bit better so using the food presser helped a ton it was coming out very very nicely you can see the texture is beautiful and i just continued to do this for all of my sugar until it was all ground down nicely i do want to mention that humidity plays a very important part in being able to make this sugar properly i luckily have air conditioning in my apartment so i set it really high so we could dry out the space as much as possible if it's too humid your sugar will clump so just try to avoid that if you can otherwise maybe just use extra sugar where i live in canada is not very humid at all so it's not something that i've really had to worry about but for those of you who do maybe you can leave some advice in the comments to help others out as well so at this point the sugar is pretty much done if you're going to use it for other purposes just store it in a airtight container um but for us we're going to be making pixie sticks so let's move on to what we need to make that our first and most important ingredient is the sugar that we just made we're also going to need some icing sugar some citric acid some kool-aid packets or some flavoring oils and some food coloring so this is 24 hours after i made the sugar and even though i did grind it down to a fine texture you can see it clumped up once again probably due to the moisture in the air i'm not sure um so we're just going to reprocess them i separated them into three bowls because i'm gonna do three separate colors and then we're going to start with the first one and place it into a food processor so i'm just pouring it in there and i'm going to grind it down first just to see how it's going to look and then we can add our other ingredients so it looks beautiful you can see it is so fine and not clumpy at all and then we're going to add our citric acid if you want to be sour just start out with um a teaspoon or so and blend it together see how it tastes and then add more as desired you can make it as sour as you like i'm also going to be adding some food coloring to mine i'm adding blue this is gel food coloring and i do have some issues using this as you will see as the video goes on at this point you can also add some kool-aid packages for your flavoring if desired i've already flavored mine with flavoring oils when i made the sugar but kool-aid packages work very well also and they have citric acid in them so if you don't have citric acid at home it'll help to get that sourness so you can see here my food coloring is not mixing at all it's just kind of clumping so i'm not sure why it's happening just yet but i have a suspicion that it's to do with lack of moisture so i'm just going to continue on with how i'd make these regularly and just see if maybe it binds so i'm just adding some icing sugar and this helps with the texture it kind of gives it like that baby bottle pop fine sugary texture that's really nice you don't need to use icing sugar um but it does help with the taste the texture and it also helps for people who live in more humid climates at this point the food coloring has still not properly mixed in so i decided it's due to the lack of moisture so i added my gel food coloring to a couple drops of water to create essentially liquid food coloring just a regular kind of kind you'd buy at a grocery store which i'm assuming most people that's what they would be using anyway so you probably shouldn't have this issue gel food coloring is just what i usually have on hand um but yeah adding a couple drops of water to the gel food coloring definitely really helped because clearly it looks very beautiful um and it mixed very nicely so i'm very happy with that now i'm just scraping the bottom to make sure everything is properly incorporated as well as adding some more citric acid so that it's extra sour and then i'm going to mix it a final time and then once that's done i'm going to pour it back into its bowl and set it aside until we have our other colors now i'm starting on my next one so same process adding the sugar adding some citric acid if you want to add your kool-aid packets you can do so now and then adding the food coloring for myself i am adding some water with my food coloring before i add it so like i said i'd let this sugar sit over 24 hours after i made it before i added um the food coloring and this whole process here today um but after i made my initial batch of sugar i did make some pink and i used my regular gel pink food coloring and i had absolutely no issues getting it to bind which is why i think it was because of the lack of water because the sugar still had a little bit of moisture in it yesterday but 24 hours from then which is now it was dried out more so that little bit of water added with the food coloring helps to restore that moisture now it looks like some of the food coloring got stuck on the bottom with the sugar so i'm just scraping it around to get everything mixed and then adding some powdered sugar the measurement is not really um well i didn't measure it i just kind of put spoonfuls into my taste but if you are looking for a measurement i would say use about half the amount of regular sugar for the powdered sugar so if you used one cup of regular sugar maybe use half a cup or less of powdered sugar but again it can be to taste or you don't even need to use powdered sugar if you don't want to [Music] now i'm just adding in a little bit of yellow food coloring just because i want to be a little bit more neon looking and then mixing it together you can see i have to scrape the bottom a little bit there um but yeah i think that the color turned out a little bit too green i kind of wanted to be more of a lighter green but that's okay anyway it still looks cool i was hoping i'd be able to lighten it by adding in some more sugar to dilute the color but it didn't really help that much and then that's done you can add in more citric acid or more sugar you can just adjust it to according to how you like it so then i'm just pouring that into its bowl and then i also have the blue one that i just made and then a pink one that i made yesterday and now it is time for the fun part which is filling up our pixie stix [Music] now we're going to prepare our pixie stick straws and we're going to seal the bottom of them using this bag sealer thing that i just bought i'm also going to show you guys later how to close them without one of these um i did just get this egg sealer thing but it works really well like look how great that straw looks um i think it was like 10 or 15 on amazon i'll post the link um but i am new to it like i literally just got it so you guys can probably see i will struggle a little bit but after the first few straws i got a hang of it better and then they were very easy to quickly seal now we're going to fill up the straws with their sour sugar powder dust whatever you call it um and i'm using this squeeze bottle to get it in there so i bought a tip that is slightly bigger than the size of my straw and i just put the straw in and hold it inside of that tip and then just shake it up and down and it comes out really nicely um the easiest way to do this would to just be buy bigger straws and then you can just use like a paper funnel to get it into the straw but if you already have these tools at home this works like the best it just it's not really worth it to go and buy it if you can just do bigger straws in a paper funnel then i just filled up all my straws using a variety of colors it was kind of annoying because i had to switch the tip every single time i did it if i want to change colors yeah just fill them up to however you like they can be all one color all different colors um and mine are flavored sour watermelon and bubble gum but they actually taste really good just with the sugar and citric acid like they don't even need flavoring okay now that all of my straws are done i'm just going to take my little sealer and close the tips of all of them now i'm going to show you guys how to seal the straws without a bake sealer so you're going to take an oven mitt or a folded dish cloth and then put a piece of tin foil on it put your hand inside of it sorry i didn't get this in the camera that well um put your hand inside of it and sort of shape it into like a little mitt like that with the dish cloth underneath to protect your hand now you're going to place the straw in your tin foil mitt hand and use a lighter to quickly light the other end then once it's lit you're going to quickly switch it over to the other side and squish it down holding it to seal it and then take it out see that looks pretty good so you definitely don't need to go and buy the sealer for this you could just use a lighter and some tinfoil and it seals very nicely the blue powder reminded me so much of baby bottle pops and it really like had that taste too i don't know i think it just because i used more powdered sugar in that one but i thought it would be really good dipped in or to dip suckers in there so i took these little bags and filled them up with some of each of the powders and then put a sucker in there these are just regular suckers because it's what i had on hand but if you really wanted to up them you could use a infused sucker and you can clearly see i'm thinking very hard about what color would go best i chose the dark one i hope that was the best color combination um i really like the way that the the red contrasts with the pink powder but yeah i think they all look adorable the green one's a little bit too green for me but i also really like all the colors mixed together so i did a mix of all the colors and then i'm just putting them into this little container because you don't need obviously those little bags to enjoy this you could also just put it into whatever you want and dip your sucker in there and i absolutely love how pretty all those colors look together once everything is done try to store it in a dry area so maybe keep them in a sealed bag or container to keep any excess moisture and they should last for quite a while i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did and please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching have a wonderful day [Music]", "WMjjy8RZsGE": "hello I'm Doug and this is the taste insensibility channel and today on black licorice review number 20 we're looking at Gilliam's old-fashioned sanzu drops whatever that means we're also looking at Albert Ian albiric young candy drops that have words on it in Italian that make me take mints and licorice so that's what we're looking at today if you like the black licorice reviews that you've been seeing here on this channel please give this video a thumbs up please subscribe to the channel please click that don't like on to get notified whenever new ones are released Mondays and Thursdays so on the front that makes it look like why they should stick must be licorice roots on the front okay so it's licorice treats that's what the  it is so this is gonna be interesting and different usually I just speed up the tuning when I do the editing but honestly sucking or licking these little hard candies so I guess through the magic of editing you won't really see much of that here it goes little sugary coating on the outside getting here that hard candy knocking around on my teeth I am getting it hints of some anise flavor no aroma in the bag so either it's not anise or the acid really volatile it's going to talk to my sugary candy now that I really get into it it's a bit more bitterness that's making me think it might be liquorice extract and so it's very subtle and even though I'm not sucking on a hard candy it's not overly sweet it's not like a big wad of sugar even though probably it's just a big wad of sugar so the bitterness or the licorice flavor is counter balancing the sweetness of the sugar pretty well so this is a mild flavor people have done like licorice might be able to tolerate this it's kind of a rootbeer quality to it also bouncing around between three or four notes the licorice extract with bitterness and a little anise sometimes and root beer or something okay so I don't need to do another one I just scrunch up this when I move on okay so I'm going to find the RIP in the bag here and dump out a couple of these meter fairly similar not the mince makes it quite a difference I'm gonna burn all flavor profile okay quite a few things ahead minutes and licorice in them both some teas or like that I think I've had other candies so and these aren't just plain little balls or drops they have have some sort of fruity shape or leaf or something kind of x-gen to a mold so here goes the minty licorice from Italy oh wow nice rich flavor it's minty but it doesn't jump out and overwhelm everything I can't tell if it's licorice or anise flavor we see a pink beating us hope show Garrick wake us up essential oil of Chanukah larry mint extract of liquorice tank now anise that's a nice a fist to cated adult kind of candy the mint is subtle the licorice is subtle but it's still rich and flavorful and a good combination so I'm thinking things would function pretty well as cough drops or something to keep your mouth busy while you're listening to something or sitting waiting for things to happen in some context these are fairly interesting and this one's more interesting than this one I found this at a Cracker Barrel this line Gillian law old-fashioned candies is a whole line of different flavors they're all pretty much artificial and I was thinking not very interesting and this one I found out of Italy in New York City so I went to the candy section to look for licorice flavored things and found quite a few so this is the hard candy which is quite a bit different than the other licorice candies so that's why these two are together here I kind of just had two hard candies in the title this drop is going away slowly I don't want to crunch it up it's a nice flavor so I'll just keep it rattling around in my mouth as I sign off we will get back to black chewy candy like most of these things back up here in the next review so those stay tuned for that and come back for more you", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more

"dz_kXhdui8k": "hey guys welcome back to the sugar test kitchen today we're going to be making ginger hard candies well be testing out a new flavor oil that I ordered it's supposed to be a lot stronger than the last one that I use so hopefully it's good let's see as you can see here the sugar is already colored and flavored the darker color turned into more of a grey today I was going for a brown but you never know when you work him in all natural colors and flavors how they're gonna react together I've had some Reds turn into neon Pink's which I didn't think was possible so that's the fun of the Test Kitchen I can actually see what the bigger batch is gonna turn into when I make it as you can see I am pulling the sugar right now so it becomes white and opaque it'll make making the better mouthfeel and it looks good in the candies today the image that I'm going for inside of the candy is a heart that will have a center of white and a darker outline and then the whole candy will be wrapped in the darkest sugar let's watch it happen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] while I'm making the candy let's talk about ginger it's one of our traditional flavors here at sugar I've never been a big fan of it personally but this new flavor all is converted me I love the candies now I'm gonna this whole test batch I'm pretty sure of it most of it myself which isn't good for anyone we get requests from ginger all the time usually by pregnant women are people who suffer with nausea some swear by it some say that it really helps and others say that it didn't help but everyone agrees that it tastes good which is the main thing but if it helps someone who's feeling crappy then hey that's a bonus [Music] it's hard to see here but this part will actually be the heart inside of the candies [Music] this is a rookie mistake that I did here that I haven't done in ages I didn't leave enough of the dark sugar to completely encase the whole thing so some of it is clearer and some of its opaque it's just not even when I make the bigger batch of these I learn from that mistake [Music] now I'm sizing down the candy into individual ruts [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now I'm keeping the rods round I've broken a rod in half to show you the design it's blurry but you get the idea [Music] [Music] now what cuts in the cool drug into individual candies on the anvil I wish I could cut them this quickly in real life it would make things go back much faster [Music] side note I totally chose this music because it reminded me of the opening theme song of Bob's Burgers [Music] I know this wasn't the color I was going for but I'm kind of in love with the gray that it came out with time to see the finished product I'm in love with these candies I think they look really cool and sophisticated very much a grown-up candy you'll be able to buy the finished batch of these candies on January the 14th which is Sunday on wwg can be calm thank you for watching please don't forget to

no I overlay my favorite it was really really really chewy like it was a hard candy than a soft candy which I mentioned before is not my favorite which if you're into her candy she might be your thing but as some of us mentioned it even look kind of awkward when I was eating it like it was definitely a little big for my liking overall the medicated aspect of it I mean I didn't really get a lot out of it I don't know maybe if her candies are not my way to get medicated it seems that the brownie has been the only thing that's giving me a really good kick yeah I also have a really high tolerance I've noticed so that could be the other reason why but if you ever lower lower tolerance maybe these could be something that you could try and let me know if they work for you because they definitely didn't really work for me whatever reason but I'd love to hear your feedback on it and if someone else had a different experience maybe let me know I don't know very odd it's not even like I was eating a whole bunch before that they would maybe get absorbed I did also mention that I am on my period so that has been known to have a little bit of an effect with females well a lot of effect apparently because apparently we need to smoke a lot more and consume a lot more when it is her time of the month for whatever reason thank you mother nature but yeah overall they were bad I went about get them again no probably not um as I said I'm just all about the soft I just keep saying brownie I really wanted to be a brownie apparently it's the fudge I really really like the fudge so far that has been my favorite but yeah I have a few more things to try so stay tuned and hopefully I'll be able to get some more stuff and keep reviewing I also do have another exciting interview coming up possibly later on early next week I'm in the process of kind of putting together that review because it's a little bit longer and I'm kind of getting that one together but I'm first gonna do an unboxing of it yeah stay tuned and if you have any questions or any concerns or if you aren't sure of words or from it is on the announcements on the kanima means page if you aren't part of the group

everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade rock candy we recently made a cake Penguins of Madagascar that used lots of rock candy and I was reading through the comments and people were asking of ways that they could make it themselves at home so I put together this video for you so let's get started so we don't need many ingredients to make the raw candy we need just 1 cup of water 3 cups of white granulated sugar now these parts are optional I've just got some colouring you can also use food coloring for this I have gel paste out in front and I also have some different flavorings and you can use them or omit them it just depends if you want your rock candy to be flavored and then we're going to be growing the rock candy on these little wooden sticks you could also use popsicle sticks or you could also use cake pop sticks so the first thing we're going to do is bring our cup of water to a boil which is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit so once the water is boiling just turn it down slightly and then by the 1/2 cup we're going to add the sugar so I'm just going to add 1/2 cup here and probably start off with a cup here and then I'm just going to stir it and I'm going to keep stirring and letting the sugar in here dissolve while I'm stirring it we're gonna get the 3 cups of water in or sorry the 3 cups of sugar into the water which is going to saturate it and that's going to be how the rock candy forms so I'm just gonna keep stirring and adding the sugar and it looks like it's dissolved from that first addition so I'm just going to add some more and then keep going so I have all of my sugar in it's nice and thick and the sugar is dissolved into the water mixture so now I'm going to just give it a final couple stirs and I'm going to set it to the side for about 15 minutes to let it cool and in the meantime I'm going to set up the where the rock candy is going to grow so what we need to do next is give a surface for the rock candy to grow on so I'm taking my wooden sticks and I'm just dipping them into the water here just dipping the stick and making it wet and then I'm going to roll it in this white extra sugar so you don't need too much you can tap it off and this is just going to give the rock candy something to stick to and so like I said it's gonna help it grow so just stick it in the water and then dip it into the sugar so we're gonna let those dry and wait for our mixture to slightly cool so what I've got set up are small narrow glasses and if you you can use anything that's kind of like long and cylinder like this in order to help grow the rock candy and what you're going to do is if you want one to be color just gonna put a drop in to the bottom you don't need very much because it is quite a small amount so I've got some blue and some pink coming in here and if you want coloring or sorry if you want flavoring if you want to have one flavour for all of your rock candy you could put it in while before you take it off the heat but I want to show you how to make different flavors so I'm just going to put a little drop as small as I can get here into that blue one there and then change the flavor and put another drop in the second one so this third one that's on my right here I'm just going to leave it plain because the clear rock candy also looks kind of cool so I've transferred my sugar mixture to a container that I can pour from and the mixture is still hot you just want to make sure you've given it a little time to cool down slightly so we're going to do is just pour into my containers here and then I'll give them a stir so I'm filling it you want to leave a little bit of room for this for the stick to go in there and just give it a little stir so it mixes up all of the color and the flavor I'm just going to repeat that with all three and then I'll show you what to do with the sticks so what I have are large clothes pegs you could also use the regular sized ones these ones are just like because they have a little hole in the middle which just happens to fit perfectly with the stick so what you want to do now is you want to put the stick right into the center of the mixture but you don't want it to touch the bottom so what I did is I just go down to the bottom so I can feel the bottom and then bring it back up a bit because if you put your stick too low then the candy won't be able to grow as far as you want it to grow so that's as simple as it is and then you're gonna leave them for at least two to three days in order for any candy to grow and some of mine I left for a couple of weeks and so I'm going to be bringing those ones out to show you and I will show you how to get them out of the container after this so these rock candy growths have been growing for about two weeks and what you want to do at that point is take them off take off the little clothes cake and then the surface is hard so you just want to break it and you can do that with just a butter knife and make sure that you're not breaking it right by the stick and then you want to dump the excess out here like that and then inside you can see that the rock candy has grown around the little post here but unless you're really lucky you might have problem getting it out so what I've had success with is just holding hot water from the tap along the bottom of my container here and then gently prying it away once it gets a little bit soft so I'm going to go and do that and I'll show you the final product so I have the piece of blue rock candy out now and it's all ready to be eaten and I'm going to take the rest of mine out as well and I'll be back to show you all the finished colors so there you go everybody how to make your own homemade rock candy it was a pretty simple tutorial today but something that's really cool that you may not have done before so I hope you enjoyed it and you learn something new so thanks for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you all again next time you", "N2jSf_b7bTg": "they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an o avi and II a why oh and you again they create a yellow background and red trim", "2QMXLRUbvkU": "[Music] welcome back to free Mike here we are making watermelon infused it well cannabis infused watermelon candies today hard candies so let's do this so I got everything ready here is one and a half cups of infused light corn syrup how you doing today Russell what are you guys smoking on anything good hey guys doing some watermelon infused candy today because I don't know how it happened but I got a phone call this morning saying that we are completely out of edibles at the dispensary which is crazy we should not be out of it this is a third different cup of infused butter so I use infused whipped butter and infused corn syrup and we infused this with a pretty even dose of indica and sativa this is three 1/2 cups of sugar plain water it has a little little watermelon flavoring in it hey guys I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of stir this up so we can look in the pot so I have infused corn syrup and infused butter in here as well as sugar water I'm the only thing I have left to add is the flavoring so what I'm gonna do is mix this really good and start bringing it to a boil and infuse but tired yeah this this will give you a kind of a head high as well as a body high you will get the euphoria with these candies I use I use an actual indica and sativa so it is a broke up trim of actual sativa and indica it's not hybrids so these are 2 together a pure indica and eight peer sativa put together to give us a pretty even body head high pain medicine this should calm your body down from any of the anxiety shakes tremors things like that do it yeah you know I think we all have stronger moments at times I call the chemo fog because I think chemo did more to my memory than anything so now that I have all of this really good and mixed up I can actually put Meister away and just go ahead and let it boil so right now you can really smell the cannabis you can smell the sweetness you can smell that but you don't really smell the watermelon yet because in to the mix this is super concentrated watermelon concentrate that I will put it that I'll be putting in here so basically I'm gonna put this on the stove I have my candy thermometer in here I want this to reach about 320 degrees and I don't want it to reach that fast I want to do it kind of slow because as it's working its way up what'll end up happening is it'll boil the water off that I added into the mixture boiling that water off allows for the mixture to activate itself and in fully infuse without burning it and that's very important so we want to keep this a butter between 250 and 300 but I do want it to hit 300 once and then I'm gonna bring it back down hey Kevin how you doing today you smell you actually spelled my name the way Nikola Tesla spells his name so that's the male version of Nicola the female version of Nicola is a C instead of a cane so it's Nico LA instead of n I K so you actually spelled Nicola like Nikola Tesla so just so you know and if you ever really have a problem remembering you how does how to pronounce my name just think of Nikola Tesla because we do we both pronounce it the same way well he did pronounce it anyway when he was what sorry I believe in a big Tesla fan Nikola Tesla fan nut car I like cars that go fast so today when we're doing our candies everybody has asked me how I make my candies the smaller sizes because finding some of the candy molds are kind of difficult so for those of us that are using cannabis that we dab quite often I'm sure all of us have seen the little containers so these goes straight into the plastic containers it's just a little silicone thing then you have your little silicone containers like this I use these particular ones I take and I wash them all up really good and then I use them as my candy molds so it's easier all I have to do is line a cookie sheet with them and then I can put them in each one oh it's no problem Kevin don't worry about it I just find it interesting most people spell my name like Nikola Tesla because he's he's famous but it's no worries no worries at all pretty much from this point on you really don't need to stir to too much you're gonna let this roll into a boil and you're gonna also keep a very close eye on your thermometer so I have this set where I don't want it to go over three hundred and fourteen degrees right now it is at two hundred and fifty-five degrees as the steam goes up you'll see all the water evaporating out of here and that's when you'll see the temperatures start to rise which is really nice it gives you a good clean infusion without burning your cannabis all it smells great can we do eat it the smell will be really really good when I add the watermelon flavoring in on this now for those of you that are kind of watching this they're like okay most people have everything in and cook it and do it the way that they just do it all at one time the reason why I separate my flavoring away from the rest of my candy mixture when I'm cooking it it's because I don't want to burn the flavoring because you can the flavoring is very very easy to burn and to singe and it doesn't taste very good once you've done that so you have to be careful hi um english-only sorry I know a little bit of other languages but not enough to really do much so but one of the things that you'll start noticing with your candy mixture is you're letting it go ahead and boil you don't need to constantly stir but you'll see that the mixture inside the bubbles will start getting a very clear Brown clean look to it and that's when you're gonna start noticing that the water is pretty much going away the earth evaporating out like it's supposed to you're gonna start noticing that your temperature is gonna keep going up a little bit more quickly so you're gonna want to keep an eye on that but again you do want the mixture to hit 300 degrees once and by once it doesn't mean it needs to be in the 300 degrees for a long period of time a short period of time is fine so today I'm gonna do this a little differently I'm gonna use it if you different types of molds I'm gonna use my dad containers as a mold and show you how I do it with that I'm gonna make some bunny butts for Easter with the watermelon candies and then I'm gonna make some squares so that's basically what I do is I just get silicon containers it's easy I don't have to worry about anything I don't worry about melting my pot or melting anything into it it works it works good so as you can see I am nicely putting it in there you can see that the bubbles are it's a full boil very clear we are evaporating that water out of there we are sitting at about 241 degrees so at this point you can just let it sit here and let it cook off while you're doing that you can set up your molds and it cookie sheet especially if you're using your your dad containers it's easier if you set them all out on a cookie sheet first now I always recommended you it with the plastic or silicone containers and the reasoning for that is because it's harder to break if they don't melt with glass trying to get the candy out you will break the glass I've seen it done a million times so stick with more of a silicone type of a mold I just do this basically what happens is you can just take and pop the candy right out so it works really really well so I just pretty much get my mold ready to go and set them up on the counter because once this process gets going and setting look at taking those candy off the heat it's going to cool very quickly so I need to have my sandy area ready to go so as you can see I have my area set here I have these all set out I have a silicon tray here in case I want to make shatter shatter candy I'll lay them in here let it harden and then break it that's how you make shatter candy so that's how I have all of this set up I don't know if I'll use them all yet but at least they're there okay we're sitting at two hundred and fifty-two degrees so we want to hit this to at least three hundreds one time so I need to just keep letting it go I don't need to stir it beyond this point until it put my flavor in with this I used I'm using super concentrated watermelon flavoring all of the recipes will be up on the website too so that we you can refer back to the website anytime you need to look at it with this I do most of my candy says a is a heavier infusion slowly I can eat them throughout the day and use them as pain medication so I use both and infused corn syrup and infuse butter in my candies so I'm looking at about 70 milligrams per piece of candy to make it safe so it's it's a decent milligram there you can eat one you can eat two even meet three depending on how bad the pain is or how uncomfortable you are they're gonna be amazing cuz wait till I send you some because I'm definitely sending near some or we'll get you over here we need to get you over here and so we do a video with you sweetie yeah guys let her know there are Miranda Lynn you tell her she needs to get over here and we gotta cook cuz get your butt over here we got some infusions to do because I got new pot art I got a new book new stuffs to play with check this one out haha we're gonna be doing some serious brownie infusions yep so I'm just gonna keep the boil boil boil so you'll see it the color becomes richer and darker and clearer it's not a hazy coloring here at all so I'm just gonna let that go ahead and you really don't need to stir it at this point I'm trying to make sure that I get as much of it off of the sides of the pan as possible because I didn't use my little wet sweat my wet flap to clean off the side so I'm trying to make sure I don't have any crystallization so that's the only reason why I'm stirring is to keep my candy from crystallizing but here you can see how pretty it is see the color in there so these won't be a real red they'll be kind of a brownish red color but they will tasty yummy okay so we are up to 264 degrees as you will notice the less as the steam starts evaporating is we have less and less steam you're gonna notice that my temperature gauge is going to go up significantly quicker and that's a good thing because it's letting me know that I've got most the water out of my candy and that I will be moving to the next step here soon I just want to get all of that back in there so I am not even going to think about putting my watermelon flavoring into this until I've hit the 300 degrees possibly 320 and that's when I'm gonna put my water on flavoring in here because then I'm just gonna let it cook a little while longer and take it off the heat it'll be ready to be put into it it's mulch so we are up to 270 so as you see the whit as the water keeps evaporating out the temperature the Blessed water the quicker that temperature is gonna rise so once you hit about 250 degrees and you start noticing that it's going to rise you're gonna state this pot don't walk away from it because I've watched people walk away from these pots at this point and within three minutes they've burnt it because it's gone well over 320 degrees we do not want this to ever reach over 320 degrees if that happens you will have burned your cannabis in here and it has it will have a burnt taste to it it is not yummy so be careful here we are less than a minute later and we're at we're at 282 degrees so you'll see 284 degrees now so it does jump pretty significantly quick once we get to this point yeah I believe they ran out of edibles shame shame shame I mean I'm glad there's enough I'm glad people like the animals but tell me before we run out so you'll see how it stays rich and dark right now you get you really get more of the sweets cannabis buttery scent to it so it has a very sweet smell you can definitely smell a smell the butter and and the cannabis in there kind of a fruity flavor kinda or scent to it oh I wish you could bottle the scent and send it off to you guys what we're also going to be doing the root beer of candies again - we have just reached our mark that's why that a beeper went off on us so now it's time to get this in there ready oh yeah lovely so this is oh wow you can smell the watermelon Wow Wow oh my god guys you can smell this watermelon something fierce oh and it is red look at this love love love love now I have this off the heat at this point I can add it back to the heat oh wow Oh YUM so young a little warm but really good so I'm gonna throw this back on the heat for just a couple of minutes that you take a look at what it looks like in there now I want the fire off simply because I just want to keep this warm enough okay so now I'm just wanting to kind of take a Scooby and I'm just gonna let it drip into the little molds and yes it does make a mess and then really all I'm doing is just filling them up one of the fun things about doing it this way however is that I make a whole bunch of little drips on to the pan and then I'm going to use those little drips as as decorators decoration on other stuff so these ones are all filled [Music] we can redo it sweetie you can also take these and put them in a bottle to make it a little bit easier I'm trying to do this quickly so because they can be little hardened in the pot sorry I'll look up here in a second so here's this tricky now we're going to move to a beat next ready oh my god they smell so good this is the first time I've used the strawberry or the watermelon recipe on this my bunny boots so I'll probably give a few bunny bucks away for Easter this year just because bunny butts are fun so those are the bunny butts well I have good flavor to it too it has a really good watermelon cannabis flavor to it so not only can you taste the watermelon but you can taste the cannabis Oh yummy yummy yummy oh I don't probably spin any sweetie you don't waste cannabis no no actually all of the hairs and stuff that you see that I pull off I will be using those in another type of candy so all of this leftover stuff fits in here I will still be using see all the little strings I love making candy I just love cooking I don't eat but I like to cook go figure however I'll tell you what as far as eating and stuff when it with my eating disorder hard candy really helps me for some reason it doesn't bother me to use hard candy I don't feel like it's doing an evening I don't feel like it's hurting me but I still use hard candy all the time I've known several people with eating disorders that can't because their eating disorder doesn't allow them to and by that is really simple they just it's a it's a mind over matter thing that it will actually make them throw up when they need something like that so it kind of sucks so hard candies like this help a lot so if you'll see when you make stuff like this what I can do is since it's still pliable and movable I can actually take this and turn it into like a flower like a rosebud and kind of and I'll show you it later but what you do is you take your candy you get it warm make like a little rosebud put a hole in here and then you can smoke through it and still get the flavor of your candy oh my god that's good Wow oh yeah I'm using this recipe again oh that's really good flavor too so that's just as easy as it is then you just pick all of this up so would you see that's all of the fun stuff that I'll play with with my candy and that'll be for what I'm doing my Easter candies and stuff I'll take some of these to decorate the Easter eggs and things like that for when we give it mmm so yummy so it's really that simple to do these candies um they're done I'm just gonna put in the refrigerator let them cool off then I'll pop them out and show you guys what they look like so thanks guys I will be back later have a great day [Music]", "aB_7ybNekGU": "as you know I'm an old man I'm getting up there in years you sir there's a lot of gray up here and in here not quite 60 yep I'm close but it occurred to me the other day that there are a lot of things that I've never done before and and one of them was make candy so that changes today well hello there old man Kelly you're Jeff to my friends in Utah me Jeff um let me tell you something about myself I don't cook I don't even barbecue I know take my man card away this guy doesn't barbecue men are supposed to barbecue so in an effort to broaden my horizons I thought what's something I've never done before and that's meat candy now was thing I was thinking back to when I was a kid we used to have these these flat hard candies that were about I don't know four or five inches by an inch and I'm really thin they were covered with plastic and you peel the plastic off they were delicious there was a cinnamon one that I used to always get at our local well it was a pharmacy that right down the road that sold candy and I'd get him there and they thought you've got to be able to make those at home right so I went on the internet I found four or five maybe six people who showed how they make rock-hard candy and I thought I could do that so I took these recipes from different people and sort of combined them and everybody had their own slight different way of doing it though it's all pretty much the same thing and so right now I'm gonna go through how I made some cinnamon rock-hard candy you need sugar I use two cups of sugar for this recipe light corn syrup you're gonna need about two thirds cup about 3/4 cup water is necessary and the flavoring I'm using the cinnamon oil that my wife got from somewhere and doing the powdered sugar for the very end a few other things you might need is a candy thermometer and parchment paper don't use wax paper the wax might melt parchment paper is better okay in my saucepan first I'll add the corn syrup that very thick sticky corn syrup follow that by the sugar that's 2 cups sure and the water with a food coloring just for style turn on to a high heat initially you want a high heat to really get this boiling quick but you have to keep stirring till everything's dissolved you don't want to stop stirring because you don't want it to start burning to the bottom of the pan remember you're a high heat once you get it to a good boil then you're ready to turn down the temperature of Bin's come out to a medium heat and now we're gonna let it simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes and this point we want to use our candy thermometer and now the goal or what we have to do here is get this concoction up to about 300 degrees that's called the hard crack temperature or something like that it's just a little over 300 degrees you can see our temperature's rising quickly but reality this took almost 40 minutes to get to the right temperature and of course a little coffee while we're waiting and our temperature continues to climb to get that's hard crack temperature and I'm not sure if you're supposed to but I kept stirring because I was afraid it would stick and burn and all that stuff and it didn't seem to hurt it we're almost there you can see it hard crack has been reached [Music] okay so we immediately removed from heat we can take up the thermometer this is where we add our flavoring my cinnamon oil I'm gonna add the whole bottle to this and almost immediately the whole house is filled with that cinnamon flavor you can smell it everywhere and you've got to stir it quick because this stuff gets thick and hard next we'll take a baking sheet covered with our parchment paper and we're gonna dump it right on there this thick gooey mess don't get any on you kids have your parents do this that kids don't try this at all because this is very dangerous very hot sticky mess 300 degrees and is too bright to your skin and burn you pretty bad if you're not careful and that's it now we've got to wait for hours before we can break this up and put the powdered sugar on and so we're done it's been four hours since I poured the concoction onto my pan and the nice part is it'll peel right up now look at this it's almost like a clear piece of glass right every so this you should just break it into chunks and look at that broke up nice and now what they say you have to do is cover baking powder because it's still sticky and though I actually like it like that the candy and remember it wasn't covered in baking powder but that had that plastic the plastic over it so I'll cover it with baking powder baking powder add some sweetness so I don't think it needs it and it'll get rid of the stickiness right and so you end up with chunks and all different shapes and sizes and now [Music] pretty tasty does remind me of those fire sticks I you see it as a kid and cinnamon always goes well with coffee so [Music] but it does plastic containers save it for later thank you for watching I hope you appreciated this I tried something new today and I sure enjoyed doing this maybe I'll do candy again in the future find another handy recipe if you've got a candy recipe you think I should try it let me know let's see if we can do it otherwise this is jeff saying so long okay [Music]", "zQ0tOmlX4xc": "hi guys Lee here from FX I just wanted to let you guys know we now have the new CBD candy it's really good for pain relief or any

again this is uh my attempt at a floral designs a traditional Japanese style of Kintaro on me I hope I said that right I don't really know for sure but basically it's a floral design inside a clear wrap so it gets a bit of three dimensionality to it and hopefully it look nice these are small batch card candies that I'm making meaning that the whole size of the batch is four cups of sugar one and a third cups of glucose and one cup of water so it's pretty small it makes this extra challenging for these complicated designs the candy gets cold really fast I think it's hot really fast so it makes it difficult to maintain temperature that you can do more easily when you have a big large batch anyway nevertheless we'll see how it turns out I hope it turns out okay and we'll walk through it right now I'm just adding the color as the candy cools trying to a boil off water in the dye or in the coloring and then also to try to maintain an even temperature by pulling the cool edges into the hot center once that's complete we can start working on pulling it which is what I'm doing now which throughout the mix obviously I'm gonna skip that for the clear because I want that to try to be transparent and the candy I'm just for I tried this a color pattern as a white petal with a purple perimeter and a yellow Center and hopefully that looks okay and we'll see what it turns out it turns out you'll see me manipulating quite a bit of the hot plate here which is just a pancake griddle that I use and I'll you let me take the candy off and on as it gets too hot or too cool but the idea is to try to maintain sort of that playdough type consistency so I can do some molding right now I'm put any little white to the purple color I thought it was a little bit too dark it's hard to judge sometimes with these paste dyes to get the color just right nevertheless here we go now I'm gonna start making the petals so I think I picked six to try to make a six petal flower and each one will be actually white with a full perimeter on the outside and so that's kind of what I'm working on now so first I'm gonna try to make the purple white our combination and then I'll cut it up into six units that I can use to make each one of the petals I also see me rotate the candy every once in a while that's just because it's obably hot on one side and cool on the other I do have a heat lamp this time which sort of helps maintain temperature from above and below but still pretty challenging and I'm gonna try and make each one of these a triangle shape to reflect what a petal might look like so four petals do not overlap with each other um get up to already make the the first here I'll put a bit of clear color in between each one I'll be that well define the edges of the petal in the candy obviously you've notice I've sped this up quite a bit just to try to make the vehicle by faster I'll slow it down a little bit when we get to the final candies to see what they look like but like I said this is my first time I have hopefully have a high hopes but we'll see how it turns out if that by if you're curious and so this is a raspberry flavor it's a flavor I had on hand and this is sort of a trial batch so hopefully it'll taste okay that's a particular mixture it's not it's pretty popular now I'm making the center of the flower I decided to take use yellow and I just wrapped it in a bit of purple so it'd have a purple edge around it now and I'm assembling now the layers of the petals around that yellow core this is the hardest thing to judge size-wise to say do I have enough tell us to cover the entire perimeter and now I'm gonna stretch out the clear and that'll be the wrap for the whole structure as long as I work hot everything sticks together nicely if it cools a little bit sometimes you could put a little water in between the edges and help sort of glue it together didn't have to here so now I've got my chorus cylinder and this one I'll use to stretch out and actually make the small candies which is what I'm doing now is just trying to maintain the cylinder and start stretching it out to pull ropes out essentially if I can then cool down and cut into candies I usually get about six of these out of our exercise [Applause] see I turn light up the light off above because I'd now be trying to cool things down so I don't need the extra heat all right now I'm gonna spend about 10 minutes rolling this candy back and forth to try to maintain its shape as it cools down and then once it gets cool enough I could start breaking up into small bite-sized games I guess you don't technically bite them but you know small candies [Applause] I'm just getting set up here I'm going to turn the camera around here in just a minute so you can kind of see that last piece but really for me having some phases to wait for this to cool that chop them up it's one of the hardest thing factors product pull these a little too early they're a little bit a little softer to cut but they still worked okay I'll see what they look like not bad for my first first try at this I do literally like to clear rap because it gives a lot of dimension and it's hard to see with the camera but you kind of see the edge of how the design is it the middle of the candy which is kind of cool there's just a couple or picked up to show you what they looked like", "XIdIT1-r4pU": "what's up y'all it's your boy G and today I'm gonna show you how to make THC chocolate candies check it out these are the ingredients you're gonna need place right here we got a cure seed oil will open and the sec that's haunt your culture in the cup it's coming in a seventy seven and a half percent THC so we got a camp just spray the mold Nestle Tollhouse the chocolate morsels we have our finalists yeah yeah this is an optional ingredient that last minute anyway you also got like a little pie [Music] kappa chocolate chips [Music] [Music] okay so now puron THC oil [Music] Simon goes next tutorials chocolate chips I'm gonna use about a cup of a cup of chocolate chips 1/2 of a milliliter oh no leader walk around so he's my super super strong super super powerful it was a lot so I wind up doing three quarters of a cup instead of a full cup anyway down [Music] [Music] [Music] oh yeah okay so now [Music] okay so now you're gonna add a little drop on the best thing you could measure me but I would say like I have half a milliliter a half a capful Oh quickest drug that you can do because this stuff is just make sure you don't want no more than that that's the perfect amount stir that in there mix in there first before you put your concentrating in writing down turn down the heat all the way too low make sure we're making this you be patient because you want to make sure you strike you know concentrate in chocolate at the right temperature so it can go into the mold and a perfect temperature so you're concentrating don't it's like they're so careful two minutes okay so now I think this is at the right temperature and we have our concentration different prices different purities [Music] the glass is not everybody is D car now let's say you can you guys can your shadow because just the way you can use wax butter whatever make this stuff we could use rising chips now and don't make the boy yourself with MCT oil but you got to make sure that when you make it you just come decarboxylate whatever type of format [Music] start blowing the molds okay it's filling up there [Music] they see me I don't have patience for this it's easier to pour chocolate into the mold so the chocolate doesn't start stiffening up on I don't know how many chocolates wasn't gonna get starts in the next one we got it like those settle down let's see what we got there it's making more than me expected you really use the rest of this to make sure [Music] [Music] you take this some - off and added something - so this is like the neatest job do you know what made me think that is is because everybody likes camisa so why the gummies was very like such a hick like a big hick when you get this right when you get the edibles right data almost like the best ways [Music] so so cuz I'm out of that big one over there anyone that means we should be the main thing guys is you wanna make sure [Music] even now we still have some leftover chocolate so you scrape that in last one this is how it looks out the freezer so like I told you guys the oil would go away and we definitely needed it things in a condo so let's get our chocolates out face [Music] [Music] hmm goodness gracious its taste so good I would not believe it so all together we got one two three four five six seven eight nine so I got twenty-one chocolates each chocolate is about 70 milligrams apiece [Music] [Music]", "yWvNBBq1Av4": "hi everybody its flower child and I'm coming to you tonight to show you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day

hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review show I only say that because I think I'm the only marijuana edible review show I'm sure if there was another one it would be the preeminent one because it's hard to have a worse one but what are we talking about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the hatch let's stop bitching and complaining and just go ahead and eat it well oh my god that is terrible that is so bad oh [ __ ] me oh there's no like sweetness right on the get-go it's ah it gets worse just that awful awful awful aftertaste oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] these things are terrible but I'll do it for you guys so I'm gonna finish these off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part I don't we'll review actually in this case I'm pretty sure I haven't I'm gonna feel not high at all uh maybe the taste is the most important thing and the taste is [ __ ] sorry for such a bummer sorry to be sitting down and see you guys in two hours peace oh hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the strawberry apple sour belts from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and sorry to get so real with you infused creations I wish I liked your products more I just think that they are garbage thank you so much for watching weeds guys I'm sorry it's been a bummer over of you but hopefully next time we'll find something a little bit better thank you so much for watching peace pretty

[Music] about yourself [Applause] [Music] just like just projects okay", "8WqqJGXaxu8": "hello I'm Shaun editor at screwy monkey calm and today we're looking at ten more bizarre candies from around the world if you checked out our last video I had sent Mario out on a little shopping excursion to find some stuff for us to have fun with during our videos and he brought back some incredibly bizarre candies from all over the world we actually did ten already in the previous video and I thought there were only ten and I was really relieved that I made it through actually eating ten of these interesting things and then I found out they were actually ten more so we're going to do ten more bizarre candies from around the world Mario tell me this is a joke tell me that really are not ten more no we got ten one all right number one this is like a dry ice cream cone giant coupley cozy obviously also from Japan I'm guessing all right this is like bizarre actually it looks like one of those like drumsticks you know like you get from like 7-eleven and the case thing by like see it's like one of those things but if you look really really really close you can actually see it's like it's like freeze-dried let's check it out oh it smells really good though I'm not gonna lie it smells like a brownie like seriously it's mostly I'm just gonna smell it for a while dude that does not look like that that that that picture does not equate to that I don't know what that is Wow yeah so that's what you get when you cut it open let's check that out it tastes like those little little wafer cookies oh yeah it does yeah except in are like a really giant very big scale these are really good actually yeah oh wow I might cut about loss for words I have so much better than I expected it to be I really recommend if you can get your hands on one of these you totally get your hands on one of these this one's the chocolate one and this is this is really amazing you can't stop I forgot to mention in the beginning of this video just like our last video each of the products that we rate just in case you didn't see the last one we are going to rate it either a Sukkot which means put it in your mouth because it's good or we're going to rate it a chuckit which means just get rid of it throughout in the trash wherever because it doesn't belong anywhere near your body and this one is definitely a Sukkot I'm gonna polish the Restless thing off there's there's no way I'm gonna stop eating this like so I finally finished eating that one which means it is time for number two you Turkish Delight is from Turkey all right this is really heavy actually and kind of looks expensive do I have any money left that for this Mario it was decent price okay it looks a little bit like when you coat pieces of cut up chicken in flour so that frightens with me a lot actually but they are vegan so I know there's no chicken in them so that's good I think that the light part of these is that you're delighted if you can actually get them open and get into them these look really incredibly scary is that that's like coated and what I'm guessing is sugar and it is like sealed and they look messy and they're already getting all over my hands so I just like shake that off you definitely don't want to like eat these and then like go get stopped by the cops though because they're gonna ask you where all the white powder all over your fingers and noses may have some explaining to do well here we go I really didn't expect to like these I'm going to be really honest I really thought I would not like these because I really thought they would be kind of gross with the Rose flavor but these are actually really quite good I would definitely eat these again back down and again yeah these are really awesome I think this do be really good actually to give to your significant other I'm like Valentine's Day I'm gonna be really cool candy to give them messy though I'm getting white stuff all over the place but these are really incredibly good and these are definitely a Succot and worth whatever you paid for them but yeah those are really good I still have white powder all over me Wow it's like a it's like a party from the seventies Mario number three Chu it's it's a product that the UK saw back yeah well is it the UK or is it sabaki oh I am going to guess that they're from the UK because there's a website on the side that says dot uk' they're made in Slovakia okay so chew it I've actually heard of these before though Mario because there is like a lot of social media buzz or there was a couple years ago about these so I've actually heard about these before but these are really incredibly cool never had one though so that's actually really pretty awesome I'm gonna guess they're like starburst or something this one is fruit salad flavor which kind of scares me by the way because I'm not quite sure what that means it's like fruit salad flavors like what all fruits it's kind of a multi fruit from the last video it's kind of like um like all flavors I gotta sleep talked with this in my mouth sooo much should be sticking to every bit of my teeth actually they're very chewy that's definitely that's definitely they're named appropriately they definitely got to chew it the fruit salad flavor is pretty good what I'm actually getting though is just the overwhelming taste of pineapple so have you ever had like a pineapple Laffy Taffy it's kind of what they taste like they dragon on the package is incredibly incredibly adorable so I'm gonna give it I'm going to say it's a Sukkot just for the cuteness of the dragon on the package and just because it does a really great pine apple flavor Mario number four click through mochi okay I've had mochi before but not like a candy like a fruit mochi like Kent not like a candy mochi is from Japan right in Taiwan but I'm pretty sure mochi is Japanese it originated from Japan oh but it's made in Taiwan so it says it's orange strawberry and hami melon yeah my melon a my melon I've got no idea what that is by the way my pronunciation and always I'm sure is completely wrong so if you're running across this video and how to pronounce any of these I guarantee you I'm messing everything in one of these up cuz I've never seen them before I got no idea how to pronounce them and I'm generally pretty bad about that anyway but let's take a let's take a look at these Oh check that out they're like filled with air and they're SuperDuper soft in there oh that is awesome I don't know if I can tell what flavors what though it looks like the differentiation like the actual name of the what it is is in Japanese I think so I can't really read so I'm just gonna pick one at random and hope it's melon I can't get over how SuperDuper soft these are Wow it's like I just want to like play with it I just want to like touch it and feel it and play with it oh it actually pulls like something else but I'm not I'm not gonna go there let see what they alright it's got a whiff of the smell oh this one's definitely strawberry oh that's intense wow wow wow oh I don't want to bite it it's so soft here we go oh oh wow yeah so I'm gonna see that pardon my bite mark but it's like fruit filled on the inside and then it's got like a little layer of like cream and then that really really really cool sort of like jelly outside that is really good Wow you know so far I've liked everything in this video which I guess is not necessarily a bad thing but wow these are really good like fruit and milky that's a Sukkot Mario number five it's got a nipple BB pullets again I don't know how to pronounce this BB pulla it's candy from Mexico Mario it's gonna be spicy again definitely sealed how do they see our children to get into these things I mean I don't have any children go around wielding knives but it seems the only way to get into most of these alright so so it's got like a hard candy hard candy nipple I mean that's a only way to really describe this I mean it's tell me that's not a nipple seriously tell me that is not a nipple and then you I don't know how you get it to a hit okay okay we're in I'm sweating Wow okay oh it's got a lock handle okay oh wait did I actually like suck it again yeah what's with all that Mexican candies it's like they're spicy and you gotta suck on them and it's like it's all kind of like naughty tisk I'm nipa l-- I don't like nothing so really it seems like this is just a vehicle to get that out of there like I I don't really think that has much flavor really it's it's a slight again if you remember the last video we had the hands the little sucker a lollipop hand things and they tasted red like you can't really describe the flavor they just tasted like you would imagine bread taste and that's kind of how this tastes like but much more subtle like it doesn't actually taste like much except bread sweet and now it's all it's all coated with whatever that is on the inside and that really just hits like sugar and like a tiny that is even with that spicy I mean like that's kind of well you said was my from it was like Mexican candy is that it was like maybe spicy for the most part this just tastes like sugar I mean it's kind of gross actually kind of just sugar and more sugar and sugar no I'm gonna set it to chuck it it's kind of bad yeah got over that one give me something good Mario number six for future reference black and candy should not really go together okay thanks bonbon noir so the black bonbons obviously Noir is blacks Macedonia seriously next I'm we do one of these please bring a map because I need to look over these places are Macedonia so it says hard filled candies I'm guessing they're licorice cuz they're black this thing dude what is this what's up with that it's like that has got to be the scariest thing I've ever seen on a candy package in my entire life I mean seriously that gave me nightmares I'm gonna go to bed tonight and I'm going to have nightmares that this freakish little smiling kid with the rope on the front it looks kind of like a serial killer in training is going to strangle me and kill me that is not okay I mean check that out that is just that is just freaky I mean that just that's not okay not all right whatsoever let's check these out shame so these are like more like licorice and since I click pushy and hard these are actually really good like I actually really like these a lot yeah there have one whoops here have another that way so these are actually really good I really really like these they're super sweet and super licorice II but they're not like as everyone knew from like the last time like the last licorice candy that we did in the previous video don't stop sorry so as everyone knows from the last licorice candy in the previous video we did they I didn't I'm not a big fan of licorice like I'm really not like I really do not like licorice very much and but these are actually really good like they're very mild licorice flavor um I can actually see myself eating these so suck it it's a Sukkot I never thought I would say that for licorice but this is licorice you should definitely suck Oh Mario I'm ready for my next sweet treat so Driss sorry SIA the dryn SIA said Rin see I said Jorun SIA in 1910 and if I'm butchering that let me know ran mix so these it's as grand mix without colorings so they're not artificially colored that's cool there's a product product at Italy so they're from Italy they're Italian candies how cool looks like they got a lot of fruit flavors on the inside and also a cup of coffee on the package which I really hope there's a copy of flavored one and if not that's cool because I also like fruit - this is really cool there is a lot of variety here there's tons and tons of different things in here I would love to actually taste each and every one of these on camera but alas that's not gonna happen I'm hoping frizzy means it's like fizzy it's like the same thing [Music] that's weird I wish you could feel this like I was a really bizarre texture to it actually it's like really rough oh I don't have a little bit of a it's frizzy okay it is fitting in my mouth well it's like a party going on in there we were going to a party in my mouth it's literally vising in my mouth oh wow that is an awesome sensation this is this is this you know what SCID Rin SIA or have you pronounce your brand name your grand mix simply for the fact that is a party in my mouth and that is an incredibly cool feeling you get a suck it Wow even though I'm no longer at the candy my mouth I can still feel the fizzy going on in that one that's odd anyways I believe it's number eight number eight Mario dude you didn't is it like my birthday or something I mean seriously is it you bought me you got me coffee candy you know I love coffee candy it is like one of my favorite things ever it's tuyas so is it Turkish again Wow we definitely have a lot of Turkish products those look really incredibly good though do anything so I grew up eating coffee candy probably more than I should have as a kid I'm sure it was highly inappropriate and with all the caffeine in the candy and also drinking coffee but it's a whole different story Oh check that out oh just the bag just the bag smells good coffee intense let's see if these are intense I was like the packaging is pretty intense I can't get it open so candy makers from like around the world let's put this shape what what is with this shape is really you can do better there's gotta be a different shape oh really like that is that oh wow that I mean I keep saying well I notice a lot a lot but like wow these are amazing alts like this amazing like just insane these are good that are really really really good I mean very appropriately named too by the way coffee intense because it's that is a very intense coffee flavor Wow I if I could marry a candy it would probably be these cool these are these are definitely a Sukkot definitely a Sukkot and these are also coming home with me these these are these are good these are really good well I feel completely wired now number nine we couldn't afford a whole package of candy pika Gomes peak ergo was more Mexican candy yeah let me guess oh look tamarind my favorite spicy tamarind my favorite like in Mexico is it like Willy Wonka and his tamarind vectoring that's good it seems like I'm just gonna dig in for these because I really seriously doubt I'm gonna like these honestly they're brown little balls like cute it's cute I lost my ball it's actually kind of cute though I mean like this is like little face that's on these I know if you can see a little face it's really kind of adorable but other than that there's not really much to say about these except for a little balls of tamarind with some spice in them I'm sure let's check them out they're sticky these are salty and sweet kind of spicy they get really soft really fast what does that consist mmm oh wow okay so so check out these were originally my first one in my mouth totally totally going to be a chuck it cuz I was not gonna stand for that little flavor in the beginning it's just like spicy and like salt and I don't know what when I get soft you sure like chew it a little bit there you go like that really sweet tamarind like I burst into your mouth well they become really really really good so I'm gonna give this a suck it by surprise it was definitely a Succot number ten number ten which is actually number 20 I'm gonna guess these are not from Mexico Slovenia derp Slovenia also make the UK candy things okay love being less Nick carmly-- why not that sounds right sure it's not but how else would you pronounce that come on incidentally there is the cutest little beaver on the front it's a little beaver oh so so cute and these are hazelnuts so you know they're gonna be really good they're so cute like seriously the little beaver I like I want a poster of like this little beaver like on my wall well it's a squirrel okay next up monkey squirrels or the cutest thing as this court hood is a squirrel a squirrel once I'm hoping this is better than that was seriously tell me that isn't some only play-doh yeah it's also play-doh oh my god this one's a play-doh please don't taste like play-doh please don't play taste a play-doh wall oh god okay oh how disappointing so play-doh tastes better than these do the flavor that is there is kind of kind of gross and just not very good a lot like they smelled like they smell like Plato like they kind of do taste like play-doh and by the way the consistency it's kind of grainy like it's just yeah no sorry squirrel beaver squirrel whatever it sucks too because I was really willing to tell people I finally put a beaver in my mouth I find it's a squirrel these are a chuck it check it check them check them all check it so I hope you've

have an RS snow day the first thing that you have to do is learn how to open one of these packages so there's usually place right up here where you squeeze it and boom there it is microscope packaging is a little different so when this is closed you have to pinch it and then squeeze it open so a lot of the irises are a little thicker and you don't want to break the packaging so I soaked them in a cup of hot water for about two minutes the Terrapin click cartridges can be a little tricky to open you have to pinch and pull and it's real easy because you just dial it up to pull it anything out so what do we put that stuff in a lot of people bake with it but I have a little trick package of starbursts take them flatten it out kind of like this you take the RSO you click out the amount that you want and you just put it on there and roll it up in a ball the Crisco dispensers are a little easier to use but harder to dose see you twist and pull on this and with the plunger you have to push out but not too much make sure you put the dose right in there put that right back on there and then that you have your starburst you roll that up into a ball and there's your nose from the road so that's my little trick on how to make one day with 2dos fine doses to carry with you why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was calling the cattle back that's my easy trick to make as many doses of RSO as you want and why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was the pot calling the cattle back you", "4dDTG6Ti6YM": "hello everybody and welcome to the video that you've all been waiting for how to make sugar-free lollipops first set the oven to 350 degrees have already done that though next is the mixing since these are sugar free will be using xylitol so first to get half a cup of xylitol okay and the next you'll have half a teaspoon of cream of tartar okay guys I screwed up and accidentally put half a tablespoon in but hopefully it'll be fine so yeah okay next will be 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid just in case you're wondering use cream of tartar there sick citric acid fabric okay so yeah here it oh okay so just gonna get that again one time we put too much citric acid in then what you're gonna do is you're gonna mix it all around so then next what we do is we stick this thing and then we stick it like right there like in the middle of the oven and it's pretty hot as you can see 25 minutes hmm so then you cook it for 25 minutes and then you start it yay okay so you have to do this part very quickly so what we're doing is we're putting coconut spray inside I like you know like the lollipop molds right now so then what I got to do is you know like I'm gonna get like one drop of red food coloring and then one drop whoa that's fine it'll do it'll just be it'll just be red then I guess and then no and then the flavor will be Barbie and then I put Barbie and cream in and then you'll need to mix it up and then what we'll do is we're pour it in there okay so we put the liquid in the lollipop molds and we uh put the lollipop sticks there now just let it dry for four hours", "QkpMI_hqoWg": "you you know hit that destroy button

yeah first couple armed agents number heard you guys were scared yesterday tornado warning yeah actually I got an alert on my phone oh yeah first I thought that it was saying I was gonna be I was approaching like my data limit and I was like just for NATO warning oh I was like I don't know I was like I'm not really gonna take it very seriously just because is weird like in this we're pretty close to the city like winds have a very hard time looking up you know next to the city right and also it's Syracuse yeah and I live the Kansas yeah still you get a message it's like there's tornado heading your way but you know there is not there wasn't an actual tornado there's any potential nobody seemed that the rotation on the radar so that's why they were like oh nobody has seen it touchdown but yeah yeah it was like I was like 15 minutes the winds weren't even like super high it was mostly just raining yeah oh man that rain came down yeah that's crazy but I guess if I started hearing like the walls creaking and stuff okay I'll go downstairs but I didn't hear like any wind really I mean I I was like worried about it like that but I was like glued to the window like I wanted for a phone o clock yeah well it said that it was coming from the east so I was like [Music] we didn't go to the basement but then we went down there and we were like why do we come down the basement yeah well our basement was not as fun hopefully the Simpsons are taking yeah oh yeah I played that and wasn't really that fun we got over it pretty quick because they basically you just move and then

didn't have you oh well basically what the want Athiya at the laundromat oh oh well when I went to Milwaukee it was a hat I played some Simpsons game and then I also played the Teenage Mutant Ninja

look at all eight of the pixels this is 16-bit we said this Looney tune for the NES at daycare like we never had one the blouse and I don't know why but I could think about that game so much recently I'm ready to drop like 50 bucks I wish game it was like a Looney Tunes basketball game we used to love project raisin no I remember it was like the airplane game there's like a 2d airplane game Oh oh man yeah and that was awesome and the plates of like great you could like match them up or something yeah do you remember the one the car won and like you'd be wait you're like driving down the highway I think you were trying to like get away from the police or something and there's like a certain the police would catch up to you or something and then there would be like a semi or a semi you know truck and you drive into the bed change your color and you come back out oh no that's like the only part of that game that I've ever taken oh yeah you don't member what game that was oh okay all right so is that kind of all put together then just to walk okay yeah that's candy right there so three and four three and three-quarters just uh first I never make anything one another we did it once before but dreams are hard and pillows wow look at that that looks so cool on the fruit even gonna be able to do like a green green piece like if it's all just talk well it smells so good yeah it does not really good it's got strawberry what's most on the Jolly Rancher like watermelon Jolly Rancher yes always have a work to do great we need someone videotaping me videotaping you guys [Laughter] here yeah chance possible help it maybe we'll just do a green stripe watch your hand oh maybe we did paint body because it's already things okay so it seems it pink by the green stripe can you still make it green though like with mini make green and pink stay really practicing with best bachelor just really try to scrape it yeah virtually invisible are yes spatula you got it Oh like so my glove that's right so we're gonna do green body pick strength right there dude peace that's what we did before hey I know I know I know I know Green Valley thinks it's a modern elements like remember you don't remember how you did it I know we did it that came out good yeah and I think I have I think I wrote down there I think Friday 3:00 and strike what if I put green in here what's gonna happen with this color we want to turn it well you turn this train probably turning brown brown yeah we don't wanna yeah but we still have to have two colors here yeah we'll just leave this color pull it under them take release I know we'd that'd be so controlling crazy doesn't water long before yeah he did green by who did do it and I got my notes if you add green it's gonna overpower well go ahead look at any old snaps and I will do this you know actually I think I do remember reading that flavor yeah I know we did you do that an extra hand here can I make up the next petal we're gonna go ahead make a petal in our life I'll do something here speaking as Steve I'm envisioning it and we did a green body right bones aren't good with their custom well I want thinking green however we do it okay we'll get ready what if you guys just broke off the little tiny piece and then just put in like one drop of food coloring to see what color it changes it to remember being like we only did it one time mix is destined to watermelon this is a brand-new bottle or no we only have the one all right smells good watermelon ewwww yeah no smell really good and you no matter the color it's gonna taste great listen I can turn shop yeah okay so you want to do pink body green stripe I still want to add like a little drop of red so it's a little bit more vibrant a pink because watermelon is more vibrant pink thing did you pull this it's gonna be pale pink we want to take our piece off yes we do Green yep we'll just agree of course this is the part where I wanted max to do it but uh this is this is the part the learning part that I wanted to match is just how much to add yeah and handling the small you've done that before have you sorry you have you've done have you colored small stripes yeah okay I guess back in the basement hmm can you can have that that big blob see you kept custody in a big blob I'll take a little bit more for my straight would you think that us discussing the stripes and get cheers over on your side more drama yeah he's also develop flavor it is great no keep Gary strawberry know like required yes i'm the cut-open and put it my backseat the darker color is just going yes not here won't know the whole thing deployment yeah well no I was wondering if that yeah is it just food coloring yeah this way Brenda right we flavor the whole batch I was just wondering if it's gonna go to Jersey - mind blowing flavor it like two separate dogs like partner flavor that sense they were that sided yeah you know now that you've said that I'm not saying I'll never do that favor what's your flavors would be complimentary no I mean lemon lime a big one right we're in the future now and you can see that they are packaging up peanut butter fill driven candy well I just wanted to let you guys know that we now have whole yeah shirts available because a lot of people in the last video left relieving comments saying that they wanted those shirts and what I was thinking is in the future if you guys really like a certain saying or really want a certain thing on a t-shirt just leave it in the comment section we got enough people requesting it then I can make it on t spring and I will let you guys know in the next video when it's available so what I'm thinking is would be like a limited time only and then once you guys decide you want another shirt then we'll make that and now just like replace those shirts so if you want the whole yeah shirt check out in the description before it goes away back to the rest of the video you do like yellow and green Dan then you might be on something and if we get sick of making the same old flavors over and over we'll get into the two-tone what else could we do too bad this wasn't a live stream huh we access an American classic and then the next one I am breaking bread trying hot dogs fantastic oh that actually didn't ring yeah because I did it before yeah and dad doesn't remember or believe me so I'm just let him have his way I'm surprised like I don't know cuz it was like so pink and you would think good heavens way when you've been married for 35 years which we just celebrated 35 years of bliss yesterday [Music] by number two the first year can be a little awkward like who takes out the garbage who knows of that yeah oh honey I already watched this it was you wouldn't like it was though I wasn't in either so Mac says how you do it oh very good thing well no I was wondering why yours keeps just like flattening out and hers doesn't but I think yours does too well mines getting - remix and quickly cuz it's smaller so it'll get cool off faster he's got more leeway because he's got bigger blob so pretty soon she's gonna start mixing it up pretty well because what but also what he's throwing it on the vocal it mix it a little bit but he does want to be sure not to get on his gloves that's the color on is on most puffs because tired to get out of both of us yeah SoDo with colors sweet are done with colors so next

okay we'll grow into it and then by the third or fourth week now why do you have to keep mixing it I'm just looking at and stuff because I want to see how it is flowing wise put it on the Hulk I gotta

there's a video but there's also a lot of people coming in to the stores from out of town from the YouTube videos oh yeah so people just forget to consider that there well I don't think that like videos necessarily have to do that but basically from the YouTube channel goodness has increased in walk you don't want to know when you get to yes I mean you don't want to squish it up and stuff because then you'll never I'll mess up the stripe so just try to keep it at this one size as if it keeps squishing that yeah I was thinking about that but I'm like well I can't have it be three feet long either how do you keep it and just keep with the same size you just can't really formula moving a lot on me the extra hot now you're getting in my way now you know what it's like want to be in

putter Scott yeah I've done photos got before that was really good you got another very hard candy first the first time I tried the blueberry and oh we had the boys yeah I think the mango one needed

hey there you go you get out of here yep all right well let's get out of here [Music]", "dNfrNTZ5Sz8": "[Music] okay today we're here to review these uh three um they're kind of unusual jelly beans they're flavored like uh normal candies so this is jolly rancher uh jelly beans this one's sour patch kids jelly beans this one is nerds jelly beans let's try this one first this is jolly ranchers i'm not sure if they're the different foods will taste differently really for original flavors this is a purple one red pink orange green purple light blue i think nope i think they do taste all the flavors taste different i mean the colors taste like the flavors and they're all colored like the outsiders colors like the inside not quite as um um the flavors are not quite as prominent as like the jolly rancher flavors but they're pretty close [Applause] actually as you chewing more the flavor comes out more this one's supposed to have five flavors let's see one two three four five so there's red yellow orange green and blue blue raspberry you gotta get past the sugar first and then the sour comes in that one was a lime one that one wasn't as bad as the blue one was red one's pretty sour too that was red berry orange is not as bad [Applause] nothing's not as bad either no they're stuck twicky [Applause] okay these are nerds big chewy nerds let's see only three colors nope that's the same thing i think there's only three colors all right orange four cups these are crunchier on the outside i'm trying to remember what things did i used to eat them all the time what was that one the red one was a little sour yellow's a little sour too nerds are a little sour so yeah these are a little sour these are more sour because they are sour patch kids and then these are just kind of a normal rancher type flavors [Applause] and each of the colors are different flavors so it's not like i don't know you probably could just grab a handful and stick it in your mouth they're they're not that weird flavor is not like uh jelly bellies or sometimes you can get some weird flavors in there but yeah these are all good if you're kind of tired of all the the normal jelly beans where they all taste the same every color tastes the same try getting these instead because they're different and i bought these probably actually i think two of them i bought at uh five below i don't remember which two and then the other one i bought at i think target or something so if you find them they're probably only here for easter so get them all you can or wait till after easter and get them for 75 off so anyways let me take another break with this one i like the sour ones and i'll see you in the next one", "Z1leste59E4": "[Music] I'm Kelly Sonya from just to taste calm and I bet you didn't know that you can make homemade lollipops with just two ingredients but the key to successful candy making at home is having all of your ingredients set out because caramelized sugar waits for no one combine the sugar corn syrup and water in a small saucepan over medium heat you want to bring the sugar to a boil until it reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack stage and then using a pastry brush dipped in water wipe around the sides of the pan to loosen any sugar crystals once the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately submerge the pan in a bowl of ice water and this will stop it from cooking and this is the point when you want to work really quickly because the sugars gonna harden almost instantly pour the sugar into two to three inch circles on your lined baking sheet and then immediately place the lollipop sticks and sprinkles on top and there you have it homemade lollipops just switch up the sprinkles to match your holiday for more recipes and tips check out just to taste calm [Music] you", "059ZsVUl-3A": "hi and welcome to kena basics today we learn how to make rosin lozenges rosin lozenges are cannabis infused honey lemon ginger hard candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you by the Rafah studio smoke shop

candy they are doing mighty candy it is white it is clear and you can totally see it so package up okay so far it kind of looks like a pill cloudy wanted that but you know it's candy so it's safe yes yes yes it smells extremely good it smells very great smells very flowery it smells like a peel of petunias but Nellie for serious I'm not like joking though it smells like wow okay so let's give this whitey candy ago and three two one I mean yes it tastes exactly like a lie to you like that is probably the only candy on the entire planet that has their resemblance to the natural fruit itself because everything else is pretty much artificial flavored but otherwise it's really good it's very sweet it's very tangy taste very sugary it's got a very fruity flavor though my initial thoughts on a 1 to 10 scale is probably about a 9 I don't know it's really good it's got a sour punch to it kind of though cuz a lot easier a little bit of a weird fruit cuz they're from China so you don't find that much in the US but alright I think it's a really great candy it comes in a bag and you can buy it online it comes in a pink bag that literally says lighty candy so you can find it anywhere on the Internet Amazon Google eBay you know places but no that's like she candy and I really do hope that you find it somewhere and that you buy it because it is absolutely amazing so also this is my favorite hard candy ever of all time on the planet just so you know but mighty candy there you have it okay that's the end of our hard candy series and have a fabulous day I", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please check out the herbal infuser

not in that language though", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "xGpXeAUFb3M": "this episode is on eating hard candies like lollipops and Jolly Ranchers those issues related to how they interact with your braces and why we recommend not having them has to do with the crunch factor so the lollipop you can have one of course you take care of all the issues that go along with sugar and cavities but as you lick the lollipop and you get closer to the end you have that piece that you're tempted to crunch with your teeth and if you crunch that on the side that sign of that candy will hit the braces and almost guarantee is almost guaranteed to pop something off namely the brace off the surface of the tooth because the way the brace comes off is it flexes off or bends off the surface of the tooth and the candy when it hits it on a crunch does not Bend and the braces will Bend before the candy does so depending on how careful you are how thin that last piece candy crunch is you could get away with it but that one is probably not one worth the risk there a lot of different options so I hope that makes sense to you have a wonderful day you guys thanks", "dw-avRWzFV4": "welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays confection I'm Greg today I'm driving across country all the way up to Syracuse New York so you can finally hear hi I'm Craig at Hercules candy and we're gonna make hard candy there's so much to know about candy making no one person can know it all so I travel the country and I see other candy makers and I invite you to travel with Greg as we go to see Hercules candy in Syracuse New York [Music] Hercules candy is located in Syracuse New York and Steve and Terry and Craig who's off camera right now run the place and they make wonderful candy and during our Kickstarter campaign we said we'd make a joint video and we never thought we hit that level but this is the video folks and we went up there they know something about making hard candy but not about making image candy and I know absolutely nothing about making chocolate so we thought we'd trade skills I arrived in Syracuse and the GPS takes me up a lovely Street and it points me to a lovely residential house with a sign that says Hercules candy out front I guess I didn't know what to expect I'd seen their videos but I didn't realize it was in the basement of a residential house they're gonna move soon so I sort of feel lucky I got to see this old tradition where they've been making candy since the 1930s the basement is the factory the ground floor is the showroom and they live upstairs more they make the candy just like the Shemp such a mess confectionary I've never made image candy in a kitchen from the 30s so I had to figure out what they had they had a pot to cook it in a table to pour it on and let it cool a hook to pull it on and a heating hood to keep it warm it looks like they had everything but like all things this equipments gonna be different than what I'm used to so let's see what we can do we were both prepared to take notes Terry more than me she had her little notebook ready and I had my notes made for them already drawn out for this project I hope it made it a little easier before I go any further I have to state an element effect steve is a superhero superheroes have superpowers and Steve's is handling corn syrup I use ladles I use cups I transfer it in various ways and some of it always ends up on the floor he takes his bare hands plunges it into the bucket of corn syrup and moves it without dripping with his bare hands into the pot I have no idea how he does this take my word for it steve is a superhero [Music] this beautiful copper pot takes the sugar up to 310 degrees quickly and Steve and I talk about candy making and I discover we have a difference of experience for him making hard candy is not something you do in the summer it gets too sticky and for me I'm from Florida it's practically summer year-round if we hadn't figured out ways around making candy in the summer we wouldn't be in business Steve adds the flavor stirs it in and then the pot goes down to the marble candy cooling table a four inch thick marble table I never actually worked on marble before you can't control its temperature so it does what it wants to do unlike my candy cooling table and if it gets too hot it'll just stay that way until it cools down or until you ice it down to keep the mixing colors familiar to me I brought a whole stack of my little wooden spoons with me to mix the colors in oh it's cooler than in Florida the air temperature in this room might be 65 and I'm used to working at 75 everything's cooling off a lot faster than normal so I got to work fast to add the color into the candy and we do our three sections they're dark orange for the skin our light orange for the middle and our clear that will become the white for the pith of the orange this is the place I normally add citric acid Terri Steve and I decide not to you see citric acid can behave very badly when exposed to marble marble and citric acid can break down a produce carbon dioxide in fact dissolving marble dust or chips into sulfuric acid is how they made seltzer water or the carbonation for seltzer water back in the early days and you can find out more about that on our video about how to make an egg cream we don't want to damage this so we don't use the citric acid but that's okay it may be a bit sweeter than our normal orange but it's going to be delicious because we're flavoring it with pure orange oil just the way we do with lofty pursuits I cut the sugar into its three color blocks and Terry and Steve start flipping them over like experts I guess they are I know there have been jokes made by these guys about how tight the space is down there when there's only three of them well there are six today you can see four on camera and there are two more just coming to watch and to help out [Music] Steve starts the batch on the hook he's pulling it to fold and air bubbles you fold in air bubbles into candy like this it stops being amber and it starts becoming white that's because these little air bubbles reflect light beautifully we need a very white candy for the pith of the orange now what's surprising me here is that we actually made this work this room is so much colder than I'm used to not as cold as they're used to and I have to work much faster than normal for me we need to get this thing off the hook and still be warm enough to do the next couple of stages in the process at lofty I'm used to working with a heating table to keep the candy from cooling too fast but the traditional way to do it is a heating hood I never had that opportunity to work with one when I was learning because we didn't have a gas source in the building we were working with we had a deal with electrical heat a heating table is a very large area that has one temperature and it tapers off very quickly as he get off that area the heating hood has a gradual taper from the back where if the heat sources to the front whether you're working this posed some challenges for the type of image candy that I'm used to making but ends up being a huge advantage for ribbon candy and hopefully I'll show that to you in another video [Music] Terry and I start cutting the candy down the light orange is going to be the triangles in the center of the orange and we need six parts for the design that I do she takes three I take three we even them out and then we have to shape them into the triangles and cool them off and in this environment the cooling them off is not the problem [Music] Steve knows how the candy cools in his shop he comes over and starts flipping the candy I'm used to flipping it because the bottoms warm in the top skull but in this case the bottom and top on one side are cold and the bottom and top on the other side are hot and he's gotta flip it in a different way it's all different everybody's shop has its idiosyncrasies and Hercules candies is no different but I gotta say it's a lot of fun to play with the old equipment Steve earns his stripes by putting stripes in between the pith of the orange slices and we've put in the last slice on the first half and the first half of the image Candy's done the second half he assembles by himself and we are able to put both halves together and end up with the core of the orange [Music] Steve keeps the arms center Moving's that it won't go flat while I pull out the white candy into the outer layer of the pith and we wrap it around the orange slices we repeat the technique we did with the white candy on the orange rind and we end up with a beautiful outer layer then the log is rolled for a bit and we want to take the log in two rods and we pull it down we pinch it off and we stretch it out using gravity as AIRAID if you ever make it to tell a C please visit us at lofty pursuits we're right off i-10 here in Tallahassee and if you can't make it you can still buy our candy we made a batch of this orange and it's in our citrus mix and you can get that at our website www.jfn.co.jp/toho clips are amazing they're hard candies are wonderful and it's always good to have colleagues in the field that you like everybody's changing positions all the time so that everyone can have experience at each step of the process the log is being rolled to keep it round Steve is pulling it out into the lengths without distortion this is the hard part of this project and he's cutting it off in two rods Terry and other people and me at some point end up rolling the logs to keep them cool and round until they are heartened which once again he isn't very hard in this environment he can't tell a little jealous it's hot here in Florida [Music] the candy came out great sometimes if you over pull or under pull the candy or if there's too much stretching and twisting involved it becomes hard to cut but this Candy's cutting beautifully and I cut the first couple of rods and then Steve takes over and he starts learning the process like everybody who's ever learnt this technique has to it's not always as easy as it looks don't worry he'll get his revenge when he tries to teach me how to kill a chocolate mold and I thought that would have been easy I was wrong [Music] and look at how much faster he is after a few dozen rods to cut [Music] and Terry did a great job she picked this up in no time at all and then we were done and we headed upstairs and I went out towards my car with everyone else helping to carry my gear and there was somebody waiting outside apparently he'd seen the live stream he wanted to come by and get some of the hard candy the first person to try it thank you for watching this video we

these are the candies so come check us out or order online at on our cbd website", "J-CQhL5uCwk": "Hey number of you have asked me how I go about making these candies that I post on to Facebook so I thought I would spend a little time here and make a video of me making the latest batch of candy I'm making a Japanese pinwheel design and the flavor in this particular batch is pomegranate that you see me adding to the hot sugar the sugar is about 310 degrees so it's pretty warm it will burn you severely if you're not careful so you gotta be cautious you'll see that I awesome now adding citric acid bring helps bring out the flavor in the candy you don't taste a lot if you don't have some kind of a acidic additive into the sugar now I'm pouring out what looks like four equal pools of sugar the point here is that I want to make four different colors I'm dividing it all up of course they're all have the same flavor in it because I entered it before this step and you're gonna see me go ahead and start to make the colors and I'm gonna use in this particular design this is red adding a little yellow a little blue for my primary colors a little white that's going to be used for it's sort of to reflect and help enhance the colors I'm gonna mix them all here and you'll see that it's boiling a little bit or steaming and the purpose of that is to try to drive off any water water and hard candy is quite the enemy and you're always trying to avoid adding any water or working in humid conditions it turns out this is a nice cold day today so it's a nice day for making candy I mix in the white now it turns out you don't really have to add white coloring if you use white if you just take that amber sugar and pull it long enough it will turn white as it incorporates a bunch of air bubbles it to alecky do with a taffy machine and now what you're seeing is I'm slowly peeling up the sugar is it cools on the edges and moving it into the center of each puddle if you will and that helps even out the temperature and eventually will make it easier for me to mix the colors in throughout each each grouping here you'll notice I've sped this up quite a bit and it's just an effort to make this video go a little faster all in all it's only about 10 minutes or so still pretty darn hot probably up in the mid 200s so it's I am wearing gloves under the blue gloves to help with the heat and you'll see me occasionally just set my hands on the table and that's just to try to help them cool off a bit they get pretty warm you'll see people often wear a really heavy gloves like welders gloves it's tough when it's this hot but I can work pretty quick here and then don't need it now I'm mixing the colors I'm not going to pull them too much I want them to maintain a transparent quality to them and you'll see at the end why that is but you can pull them quite a bit and actually in this case a red weed almost turned pink it would pull enough white into it from from the air bubbles that's incorporated from pulling you see the folks we've worked with a lot of white color they put them on essentially a taffy puller and help drive out or to drive it air bubbles and really generate a nice bright white crisp color in this particular case I mean it'd be that overall bright but I do want to be nice and opaque enough to help reflect the colors I'm gonna use in the design so it turns I don't want just three colors I want six colors and the nice thing about making the three primaries here is if you remember in art school or in high school in art class you can mix your primary colors to get just about any color you want so I'm dividing these into fourths because I'm actually gonna make six colors I guess I'm gonna cut them up here and if you remember of course that when you mix your red and yellow you get orange when you miss your red and blue you get purple and your blue and yellow to get your green and that's what I'm doing right here again I'm just trying to pull it enough to mix the colors evenly you know it's hard to see but in front of me there is a it's actually a pancake griddle I use as a heat plate and that helps slow the cooling down a little bit helps me control temperature the whole art of working with with hard candy is to maintain temperature gives to hot of course it melts you can't do anything with it if it gets too cold it gets brittle and you're done so we work to keep that sort of clay texture or state now I'm going to take each color and I'm gonna make essentially a long a triangle each one a there's going to be a wheel of the pinwheel and on each edge I'll put a little white and that will help divide the colors up when you when you look at the candy of all assembled so I'm gonna go through each color and do this I use this little spatula to helps me make a little nicer cleaner as you just edges almost there you see me occasionally rotate the sugar or in this case I may be taking it off the heat plate because it's getting a little too warm and I'm starting to lose the structure of the triangle and so I can take them off the hot plate and cool them down this way a little bit right now I've got my six triangles I'm gonna start putting together my pinwheel by adding each of the colors together I will give you my design as long as I'm working with them with their hot like this they'll stick together pretty well even if they cool off a little bit you can just run a little bit of water like on a damp cloth across the side of it and it'll act like glue and piece them together but I'm tending to work pretty quick so they're they're still pretty we're pretty good at hue so quality to them all right so now I've got my master role together here and so I'm moving away from maintaining temperature to maintaining structure of the design and I want to keep this round cylinder and first thing I got to do though is make them sort of bite-sized and that's what I'm doing now by stretching the the cylinder out a little bit and that design will be maintained whether it was letters or colors or shape or whatever throughout that whole structure or throughout all those little rods that are being pulled out they're also hot and if they sit too long and they'll go flat so you'll see me constantly rolling two cylinders to keep them from are the rods to keep them from going flat and maintaining their circular structure and that's what I'm doing now this takes a little while because it's going from a pretty warm temperature to you got to get them to they're essentially cooled down so you can crack them lifting it up shows you they're still not quite ready yet cuz they're uh they're deform now I'm getting ready if you kind of cut it out there but I did that for about 20 minutes off and on so now they've pulled down quite a bit I'm going through the process of breaking them into bite-sized pieces you can make these at different sizes I like this size it's about a half an inch and it's a nice bite-sized piece you can of course stretch the cylinders out or the rods out longer and thinner and you get smaller pieces or you can make different sizes whatever you what do you pretty like but this seems to work pretty well and that pot table you did admit of course it's sat for 20 minutes so it's actually cooled down now but I need that hard starch surface to cut against so the pieces essentially crack off and smaller pieces [Music] I'm getting them nearly finished as you might guess the rods that are in the middle of the thing looked the best some of the ones on the end or a little more deformed one way or the other but they all taste great and so he just tend to mix him in and nobody seems to carry to worry too much about it if it was something important I guess she could weed them out but the more careful you are the more uniform your structure is throughout the whole the whole sample set I'm getting to the end we'll cut the rest of these out and I'll let them cool a little bit longer roll them around little bit to kick get any sharp edges off and then I'll pack them up and hand to my friends and family and hopefully they enjoy them and it is a nice flavor and they do seem pretty pretty popular getting towards the end here here is the finished product as they lay it on the table but I really like a bottom though is when you hold them up to the light they really pop have a nice color to them in the light you know hold them up to the Sun or what have you oh that's about it I hope you enjoyed it I hope you have a chance to get some of these they are good I hope you enjoy it let me know I know thanks bye", "aSO-ZBoJ0DQ": "I am gonna be eating one of these very excited these are like hair on that there's these are CBD gummies and I already opened

elizabeth i'm nikki and we are here on our unwrap series to try some candy yum what a great day our candy elizabeth's favorite i love candy shaped his heart because i feel like it's made with love and everything tastes better when it shaped it's a heart i'm i am going to trademark that phrase so jube gel cherry hot hearts by brock's we love the broc's family and um let's just try them because they sell so well i've packed so many of them i've kind of been dying to try them myself you haven't tried them before they're like heart not harder than i thought they would be but more jelly less gummy if that makes i mean i guess they're jupe gel so right that would make sense right they're not a gummy the jew gel i don't know i always compare it to a gummy though because it's not really a jelly [Music] i don't know you just have to try it like if you like those um cherry coins you'll probably like these and marley she'd like the cinnamon marley fan or not a fan this is our mascot today she

unwrapped eating candy day brock cinnamon jube gel uh cherry cinnamon oh we already ate the cinnamon earlier those were good too they come in cinnamon or cherry you choose i like them both so get them have a sweet day", "Xr5Y9wIOR1M": "[Music] hi there welcome to stated his kitchen today I am SuperDuper duper excited because I'm going to show you my best ever recipe which I absolutely love to make I'm showing you how to make my bubblegum flavored lollipops kids absolutely adore eating them but adults have to make them so let's get started get yourself a nice heavy base small pan and in that put 225 grams of glucose syrup I put it in already on top of that you need to put 450 grams of granulated sugar and on top of that 80 mil of cold water now I want to turn on your hob to medium-high and I'm just very gently very very very gently just going to stir in the glucose syrup so it doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan now get a lid and pop it on and set your timer for about four minutes what you want is to self clean aside so everything now is going to bubble up the steam is going to take the sugar off the sides and self-clean the sides so there won't be any crystallization of the sugar the most important thing about making these lollipops is that everything has to be ready before you start so that when your sugar is ready to pour you are ready to you need to get yourself loli molds and lolly sticks I definitely prefer plastic lolly sticks than wooden ones it's important to have a sugar thermometer because you're lonely pops have to get up to 154 degrees we've got ice water here ready to plunge the pan into when the temperature reaches 154 degrees we've got all of sprinkles ready and also all of our flavorings ready they go sugars now bubbling away nicely and the sides are perfectly clean it's probably going to take around ten minutes to get up 254 degrees the hard crack stage at this point you want to keep your fingers well away from this sugar syrup it would not be funny if it goes on your fingers and also if you've got children around make sure you put it on the hob over here 154 we're stopping now okay we're plunging it I've got to plunge it straight into the straight into the ice water because you want to stop the sugar immediately 1:54 you want to stop it immediately from cooking very gently move it around sorry it so important not to let any of the water go into the sugar syrup at this point if you're experienced at lolli making you can pour it directly into the molds but I think it's best for us if you pour it straight into a jug I'll put this in me and the sink I'm putting a strange thing with some hot water in it for this otherwise it'll stick to the sides it'll be a nightmare to get off later so if you put into a jars and then put some hot water in your pan it's gonna make the clear-up process a lot lot easier now it's time to put in your food flavoring um I've decided to use bubble gum today because it's absolutely the children's favorite but there are so many different ones you can choose from in my box I have great watermelon candy floss strawberry coca-cola banana I mean the list is endless today it's bubble gum and in a jug of this size you probably need about 10 tiny drops 1 and then just leave it for a little bit and before you know it the whole thing the whole room is going to smell a bubble gum and it's delightful wait for the bubbles to to subside a little bit and that's time to start your pouring you ready okay be very very very gentle very very very very careful want to take it up just to the top covering your sticks a nice stream going slide it over these little bits here just crossed that they crust up and they could just be peeled off at the end should always try and make lollipops when the weather is quite cold is a perfect time of year for lollipops if it's summer and it's humid it's very very difficult to make lollies because they go with sticky and disgusting let's see if I can try and get another one once it starts getting a little bit thicker if you've got it in a jug like this you could pop the jug in the microwave just until it starts bubbling and then you can reuse it okay to make sure every stick is in correctly now I'm gonna pop this in the microwave for about 10 let's just finish them off so I've managed to get eleven out of that mouth sugar if you wanted to double it and do double the amount of sugar and double them up glucose syrup that's also fine it's now time to decorate you need to it's a little bit of practice this takes a little bit of trial and error because you obviously can't touch your sugar but you need to know when the right time is to put the sprinkles on because if we put the sprinkles on too early but what happen is the heat will just make them melt but you know what it will take a little bit of time but I think these are probably ready now I'm gonna use some of these gorgeous embellishments they're just sugar embellishments and you can pop them on your lollipops and they make them look absolutely fabulous be very very careful when you put them on though pop it down and push it in remember the sugar super hot hey go if you leave it too long to put the embellishments on what will happen is they won't stick at all because there'll be nothing for them to stick to this ones are getting a little bit hard now so you've got to be super quick these are so pretty okay so I've used as embellishments now the rest of them I'm gonna do well you can use any sprinkle you want really it doesn't matter my children really like it when I put millions on them no those millions you can get or nerds they're great as well I'm putting because it's Christmas I'm doing Christmas balls on this one and I think I'll do some stars on this on the others it's basically showing you can use anything really anything you want to use so put a red one and a white one and green one on there green one go white one and a red one on there now what you have to do is give them about ten minutes to set and as soon as they set you can take them out of the molds we've left these to cool for 10 minutes now it's time to take them out and finish cooling on a piece of baking parchment pretty down as you can see the little bits that are touching them it's just falling off the side and you can always just try bit and see if you like them these are without a doubt favorite any kind of kids party or children's gathering even add r72 now we can leave them on the baking parchment until they're cold to the touch and then they're going to go straight into their own individual cellophane bags so when they're being stored they don't stick to each other and also once you add a nice little ribbon on them or they're perfect to give as a gift so there we have it now you know how to make your own tasty gorgeous Christmas lollipops perfect for children at this time of year thank you so much for watching my video if you enjoyed it then please click

let's see we have to try we have goober mustard these are both candies we have black could and licorice we have some delectable flute shoes and the flea would eat the we deeper because it needs

other ones so the next one what you think of that one by the way that would have good flavor to it that was in the big I they expect them to be that big any day but the other 100 second now this one

misfits two-in-one gummies do you think it's really messed up on the print one Jolly Ranchers sour Serge hard candy with sour powder Center it sounds so good to me I had to get those I'm thinking Silvia was the first one to tell me about this she sent me a picture which I always appreciate the misfits were only a dollar for 3.15 ounces but the Andrews were a dollar ninety eight six and a half yeah so for these four sixty calories Mon five or ninety this one has pretty bad yeah we'll try these first standards because these are those are hard these are you get three different flavors you have green apple and cherry you have blue raspberry and watermelon they look cheap nice and you have strawberry and lemon so there's three different ones so which one do you want to try first they smell like it is no good that's the blue Wow okay those are soft revenge tequila I was expecting talk about pulling your braces off I break simplified yourself this first thing I think of okay I didn't mind the flavor that I liked the flavor of it and you didn't like it at all de Jong I was done left the application look horrible yeah I tasted a lot of the blue raspberry when I was chewing it but then you're right you're left with the watermelon they're very very very sticky down there if you want your child's tooth to come out yeah one of these seriously it might work okay what are we doing this to one of you to nachos ah picked green apple and cherry there's two bill like the one screaming for his life while the red one takes him over mm-hmm I like that one oh yeah that one's a lot better mm-hmm they give you the most of strawberry and lemon in this bag you get a lot of strawberry lemon I think if you were the longer these are set out they've got a little echo I feel mom I like that green apple and Jerry did you all like that no there's a chemical fire but women you really taste the lemon [Music] I like Samantha I don't bomb that one a them bear like it because it sticks around for often you keep I think my favorite look like a boat out like a gas I think my favorite was the blue rice very alarming but I really do like that green m1g Rian's I like to have fun cheering and ain't no which one did you like the best ball carrier the one I just had to grab 100 in the car all right green apple and cherry so I didn't think it immediately killed that limit and I think that would last you a long time because they are so chewy I think you can put it in your mouth and just leave it on your tongue for a little while without you know it enjoys me a long time because in the beginning those would get thrown away all right Eggar what flavors are in this but we should we have does it say on the back no it's gonna be probably a blue raspberry and chariot and apples lemon it's still like from ball okay I can't believe it doesn't have so I hadn't grapefruit you can't believe it Israel what like that puts wipers there there's a well there's a little cherry dude well then there's a watermelon Internet Sal is there two different creams mother to the Reds the Reds were there because they're pink and red hey yo he's not gonna read and there's it there is

texture cycle there's a texture for the wall I would eat the sugar free Jolly Ranchers these are just like the sugar free Jolly Rancher same size room they're the same size same texture I think that the flavor of that is a little bit your labor but it's the same texture it's the sugar prince how did I'm not giving you guys cut I didn't get the power I didn't get the power but he got knocked out with this yeah I just think it's about the net cherry Viper was extremely sir I think it's funny that we're both hoping the pink one the pink one I like we subconsciously chose we all know the

strong they'd be very very nice to you level soap on your tongue upsetting your tongue and melt a little bit oh yeah normally you would grab one of these and I would last your wife but since we said

"jSR73GGCec4": "hi I'm making hot cinnamon candy induction type cookware I'm gonna put stone cliff top I'll get it in about five minutes got it set to 465 about this you're taught English I've heard think they don't work very good learning looks fine also put it wherever and like hang up candy thermometer in I put it in three and three fourths cup sugar 1 cup of water and one in the fourth cup of corn syrup I also put in 1 teaspoon of red food color and you look the Nixon needs to go in as a cinnamon oil make sure it's the cinnamon oil food grade I'm waiting for this to get up to 20 here or degrees stuff that about about 50 degrees to go this has been cooking for about 15 points you want to be very careful when you work with this I've bettered a pan lined with foil and i bettered it very well because that's where I'm going to pour it after i stir in my oil my oils right over there and that stuff is very hot so as soon as I I'm going to bring this off our at-home hair I'm going to put right here I muster in my oil I'm entering on my fan and because the fumes supposed to really like kill you see where it's at we still got about 20 degrees it's only a Chester see here it's the billing you do not want to get more of this I make this cinnamon candy most Christmases I'm mainly the one who eats it because I love it ok I'll get back to see one it's about 20", "jkSZSq2uhwE": "hey guys I'm back and one I didn't want to show before is this I'm guessing that's another hard candy got matcha um yuzu and looks just like a Japanese citrus fruit and this is other brown sugar because it says brown sugar on the back or it's what some of my viewers have told me which is the black cane sugar and black cane sugar has a distinct taste to it so long I guess I'll let you know so and because Japan is oh so cool got a little grippy thingy here excuse me okay so we're going to start with a muck ja back so actually kind of cute hold individual bags look at that okay then this up what it looks like it looks better on camera weird okay good it's minty I on cement in here it tastes like a green tea flavored ricola and I still can't tell if I like it or hate it I don't like the mint I don't want the mental thing to it but it doesn't it doesn't go good with a quickly cream teeth but we'll watch us specifically since it has a little rougher taste to it if I wanted a mint I would have eaten a mint coconut okay I try the yuzu yo and again it looks better on camera I guess because the Sun setting that everything's getting kind of pixely so you can't really see all the details of the looks like it was melted okay there's no mention here and it tastes like lemonade candy I like that a lot excuse me I like this one I'll eat this one anytime it's really good it's like a lemon kind of thing like a like a lemon and a grapefruit had a baby I enjoy sucking on this but I just spit it out now don't let your minds travel too much okay make up a little questionable either or since I can't read Japanese I can't tell you what it says smells more like brown sugar okay and again looks a little better on camera actually this one just looks better in general the other way the other side looks terrible okay you could say that all right here you I probably switch my mouth first before I did this you know I can't tell you guys I had to I'm gonna squish my mouth and I'll be right back it's like I can't get that mentally taste from the green tea one out of my mouth if I want to know it would have been mentholated I would have tried that one last but it was a surprise to me and I cannot get rid of that I I feel like I just brushed my teeth I don't feel like good be able to tell you exactly what this is I mean it okay from when I tasted it tastes a very sweet it tastes it tastes account like brown sugar it didn't really have that dark kind of coffee like taste to it um it was still pretty good but I can't I couldn't place my tongue on it sorry guys um but to my viewers who know Japanese well enough to understand the little characters post down and tell me what it is that I'm eating good yeah that was just I didn't like the surprise mint that was just horrible um yeah so sorry guys this is kind of a little fail um um um I blame Japan because they didn't mention the mint so I blamed Japan for this crappy video so okay well um i guess it will see me next week or something um sorry i couldn't because couldn't be any better than it was so I'm gonna take my long goodbyes and out", "JqewtpS08wE": "there are many types of candy in the world caramels chocolates lollies coffee marshmallows however there is one type of candy more unusual than the rest the strawberry shipped hard candy this documentary film is dedicated to an earthing the mysteries of this peculiar sweet in salons and barbershops around the world a bowl of candy is often present x to the cash register the average dimensions of the bill may vary but the bill almost never contains more than 100 pieces of candy here to talk with us about the ratios of candy within this fixed barrel environment is mathematician and statistician juror important from numerous surveys and barber shops and salons across America my team and I have concluded that the standard candies president candy bowls are caramels peppermints and strawberry shaped hard candies these sweets are usually present in a 1 2 3 2 ratio of peppermint to caramel to strawberry shaped hard candy this means that one sixth of the bowl is comprised of caramel one half is comprised of peppermint and the remaining third is comprised of strawberry shaped hard candy however statistics also show you if only 0.0000 0000 1% of the population has ever tasted the candy this means that less than one half of a person has ever sampled the sweet also here to talk about candy statistics is Oprah love Shuang a hair stylist with field experience well I have been in the candy industry for over 10 years now and I've always been a support charity ball however I've always kept track of my purchases even candy purchases and never have I once placed order for strawberry sheriff Callie's but they always seem to dominate the bowl and I have noticed super small nation even though nobody takes any candy it always seems to disappear from the gun a question arises from this elegance where is this candy come from and where is it go to this evidence suggested the canteens never bought in stores never consumed in fact in a recent study conducted by dr. are as Faust who's proven that strawberry candies do not come from shops strawberry tart can is truly disappear and reappear and this activity should be recordable I took a series of videos that monitor cannibals containing only strawberry shaped candies these candies were taken from nearby barbershops and hair salons the footage is stunning as you can see the strawberries gradually disappear over a period of 15 days then reappears suddenly on the 16th this cycle repeats indefinitely this study proves that strawberry shake cod candies are buzzing with supernatural activity one brave soul has considered the sample in one of these candies perhaps she would Lynch the world beyond from which these confections come her name is Geraldine Samantha the testing room in which samantha is sampling the candy is made up of triple reinforced steel and his void of all equipment that could possibly be damaged it appears that the subject has changed form luckily he is locked in secure contained environment what's that oh yes all right it appears that the creature has disappeared oh yes the camera is back online well I didn't ever to make this for now all of a certain is that you must never eat any candies that even vaguely resemble strawberries otherwise you will surely pay the price besides in the Shepherd of an era", "_30uaj8BWMM": "so this video just occurred to me i was i was getting ready to start uploading it editing a few videos i recorded and there's this really interesting candy i'm out of them currently and i normally always have a box of these on me i love them they're from japan i get them off of j list although you'll probably want to go to j box calm family friendly version of the site these are these is just basic like something you'd find old people eating in America hard candies and I got it just because I hadn't tried the really basic flavor by this company now there's I had sake flavor I've had a stir soup flavored miso soup floater I go for interesting stuff and here's some other examples sushi drops yeah and they did they did taste like sushi they're just little white hard candies the these ones were the colors that you see on the box but every every other kind of my beatings been a white hard candy um let's say there's a little website go told chigi room a dot-com go Toto chigi roommate huh well I'll just keep getting them from j-list I don't plan on going to the website up well it's real hard to see on this camera call all kanji so I don't know what's in them probably not the safest thing to do eat something you don't know what's in it but we all do it anyway with fast food and everything else so here's another example this one I had to get all the cameras gone all blurry on me for a second threw it out of focus yep there we go not two drops now i'm not going to show every one of these I've tried I've tried a lot but I had to try not to because supposedly it's acquired taste an acquired taste that only Japanese like and the foreigners can't stain yet it's supposed to be extremely nutritious and served at most Japanese tables so I had to try this they for breakfast at least that I know of probably other times too and when you watch these videos of people would have moved to Japan's an hour's warning it means not too very hard to get used to it took me a while by the end of the box i was enjoying them well 10 10 like the old tins you would find powdered mixes for nestle used to do powdered mixes in these mountains when i was little natto fermented beans so no alcoholic content that I'm aware of I've only had the candy though I'm not gonna say what it tastes like I'm just gonna say most foreign people from America so I guess if you're in Americans Americans you just say that foreign because you know people aren't from Japan and in that sense most non-japanese live in America would have a palette of flavors to select from that would not compare babe their taste buds would not be used to anything like it's fermented even saying that throws you off and leaves you unprepared you've got to be ready if you're going to be eating around others and trying it I would advise against that but be ready with a palate cleanser like pickled ginger that way if you decide after it touches your tongue it's a flavor you can't have in your mouth you can just swallow it real quick popin the pickled ginger and avoid embarrassing yourself or others or making anyone uncomfortable um so it can be a fun kind of I dare you to eat thing for people that aren't used to it don't make fun of it though it is kind of a cultural staple of Japan so it would be really impolite to use it as that in front of Japanese individuals um it is worth getting used to because it does have a lot of health benefits from what I've read and heard really good for you and if you're going to be spending time in Japan there's probably going to be a lot of it around and if you can eat it without embarrassing or annoying or hurting the feelings of Japanese individuals they would probably greatly appreciated be surprised and it would make for an interesting conversation the gaijin or foreigner that eight not telling didn't flinch I can't now I'm fairly confident um I got used to the flavor and and I want to try the real thing I have never seen it on a menu in American restaurant so yeah uh any of you that may have tried not oh please please share your not stories with me and experiences or even if you know someone that did share what they told you and if you tried any of these or the other flavors and if you know what these hard candies I'm talking about our please share your stories they did feature them in the anime grave of fireflies and I think there's a live-action film of that out now um and Jay list or Jay box calm Jay box is the one will not get you in trouble for viewing you you may have something pop up on screen that could cause issue if you're on jail is so make sure you go to the right one both will sell these though candy drops sakuma drops also could we might need fruit I'm not sure I can't remember my Japanese isn't very good this says it actually contains fruit juice I can tell because the English side I am no good with hiragana katakana kanji I'm trying I'm trying my pen pals helping me with some kanji least I think they're conscious you might be teaching me hiragana katakana haven't asked anyway he's funny funny very interesting on flavors the odd flavors make for great little ice breakers and conversations you know with people you having a slow day like one of those still in college had a little trouble staying awake a candy that tastes like sushi or or oyster soup will certainly be interesting and keep you awake and get you back in the moment of listening to whatever lecture what have you so it's it's nice to always have ten of these around really good stuff and they don't go bad easy so storm at room temperature you'll have to put on my fridge or nothing like that hope you enjoyed the video I highly recommend these are fun to eat interesting adventures and usually good I ended up liking all the flavors I've tried thank you for watching", "JrxOGx7sxzo": "[Music] you", "7TxuMNVKbUc": "so today I'm going to show you how to open up some Jolly

gonna be doing an edible review BAM the standard this guy is the hybrid Andrea this guy is pineapple first off let me just tell you guys I cannot find anything about this company online no website is on the box there's no no website I can find it you search their name so I have no idea where these guys come from I have no idea about their background but whatever you guys are using the balm products let's just go on the pineapple which is here in the indica the flavor that these guys have is is is the these guys I can honestly say are the best tasting gummies I've ever had obviously Medicaid they come in these little packets so this is a 200 milligrams so these guys are each 50 there's four of them and they taste they taste like they taste familiar but they are so good I love these also they don't come GUI like that my just melted I didn't make just I absolutely love these got me he's like I'm kind of obsessed I'm never going back they are also generally when it comes to your mood and how you on them you're gonna be kind of happy at least for me and my experiences have been very uplifting and they've been very positive I don't go in any type of cycle as well at least for me they're not overly strong what is really great so if you want something where you're gonna be able to like lay around your house and watch TV these are a perfect choice so if you find yourself in California or if you live in California and you're in the Southern California region at least I know that I see these from time to time and I would pick one up they also are at a really great price especially compared to sake and because you punch I only compare them because they're both gummies these you will find much cheaper again my name is Sarah P thank you so much for watching the channel

going to it just is [Laughter] all right i had such a you know every every time i go to start my stove i have to um light it because it's an rv and uh every time i think i don't know what i'm doing and i know what i'm doing i have identic memory i know what i'm freaking doing but every time like it takes me like three times to light it because because i think i don't know what i'm doing even though i know what i'm doing y'all about that happens to me all right let's do it cheers cheers i'm getting sleepy i'm having like a sleepy t i like i'm ready i didn't even need anything yet i'm gonna throw some pizza in the oven once i get this  out cheers all right let me go grab that out of the oven okay i haven't looked at it but i'm pretty sure i've been in this oven before so what am i talking about i um i can smell it all right there it is nice and brown and i'm gonna i don't know show i'm keeping this let me show you the difference because that's eight seconds because it's not in there that's why where did i put it there it is okay see the difference see the difference all right see how green that is in comparison to that all right it's always a good idea hey lourdes how you doing hey tabby hey andrea [Laughter] shea what's going on all right so it's always a good idea to um to have something to refer back to sometimes sometimes you look at it and you go but you want it to be nice and brown it looks like it's now right like you wouldn't do any why would you do right but yeah it goes brown that's what it is that's the first thing i saw when i made this the first time i was like why does it go brown because you kicked it how you doing girl all right i put this on when i get off a line like the minute i get offline my temperature goes from high high to low low although it gets cool in here it gets way way cooler in here which is magical for me all right so what we're gonna do now is why is it like that ah all right so now what i'm gonna do next is i'm gonna use my butter machine [Music] to make tincture all right now when i'm making tincture if i can i'd much prefer to use fresh herb i would take the herb i would put it into the crock pot with glycerin this is the glycerin that i use this is a vegetable glycerin that i use it's my favorite um i don't like it to come in this bag because that's a but it's but that's what they had so this was this is a gallon uh it's always better to buy more if you know that you're gonna cook a lot so um anyways all right so i am going to be so i would normally do it that way if i had fresh herb i don't have fresh herbs so i did the carving yeah yeah yeah all right so we did the carving which it went into the stove i i grinded it up i put it in the oven on 220 for 40 minutes all right now i'm going to use this this machine because why do why why this does it for you so all i have to do is plug it in and then press on it for tincture and then that cooks i think it's i want to say i want to say that it is um look at this did whenever they give you i swear to you like i don't know why they think the companies think that this is good like you must keep it exactly next to the outlet in order to get this thing to plug in and whatever you need to have a three prong anyways that is with all my thing all of them all my machines all my machines that i cook with freaking they all have the same the same exact one they must have a deal amongst each other all right so what i'm gonna do is um this is gonna i'm gonna put like a little bit about two cups in here of the glycerin because there will be no point me putting two cups of freaking glycerin into a uh into a crock pot it looks like my crock pot is that small but it's not a mess all right i could see down here so just letting y'all know all right what'd i do with the camp what i did with the cat if i leave it up here i will for surely spill it all right easy enough we're gonna dump this in now there's another um there's a there's a medium that you can use it's called um uh lecithin okay you can put that lecithin like uh like a teaspoon and you can throw that in there and let it go ahead and mix with that that's will help the um it will help the marijuana to bond to your medium you could be putting in here anything you could be coconut oil in here extra virgin olive oil you could be sleeping flipping vegetable oil you could be doing butter this process is all the same okay all right all right all right so all i'm gonna do at this point is plug this in hey chad how you doing what's going on that's okay carolyn that's okay that's okay no worries no worries okay so you got replay all right so i'm gonna put this and now i don't know how long this is gonna we're just gonna put that on top like that and i'm gonna plug it in let's see see this is how about how much room i got but i'll be able to let me put it on um [Music] oh no don't go it went too fast all right wait i don't really okay okay listen i'm a little bit stupid sometimes so bear with me all right because i'm seeing it funny all right so when you plug it in i i'm trying to make it so you guys can see it and whatever all right so the select will go on and then it will and then you press start okay so the tincture is four hours all right and that's it the only thing that sucks about this machine it's great for everything except for the fact that it has this horrendous spinning sound which is not it's spinning it's the spinner it's the sound from the spinner but it's like scary a little bit so you kind of have to get used to it i'm just making glycer uh tincture that's it it's great to see you too in here hey christina how you doing sweetheart and i'm not even cooking anything good maybe i could cook something good i was gonna put some pizza in the oven but i do need to make like cake or something i bought cake too i bought you know what i bought i bought um i bought muffins i don't even have any muffins i don't even have my muffin plates what the hell did the top of that thing go i don't know why i don't have that top to this that's so funny i look down and my glycerin's still down there and i don't know i don't see it still don't see the top there's such a mess going on here hey jamie so all right so that's really all there is i mean you know when it comes to cooking with cannabis here's the thing what little dog are you gonna stop me it's gonna stop because he's not hanging on me i found it all you do is clean up a little bit around you freaking mess here all right there you go hi faith how you doing what was i gonna say i was gonna say something about oh okay so cooking with cannabis the the worst part of cooking with cannabis is the beforehand the fact that you have to cook your something for four hours when you put this when you make this like if if you're making just brownies right and well you need something to go with that so you either need to make butter coconut oil or tincture one of the one any one of those would be fine right glyphs with glycerin uh if you do it all in one day it's exhausting but if you make your this is when it comes for what i have in my brain it's better for you to cook with a large amount of cannabis first make your items and then have them ready to go for when you're ready to bake something not baking at all in one day my birthday is soon i don't know when is my birthday oh yeah looking at us in 10 days congratulations what are we congratulations um oh yeah oh yeah i was just on um the last video that i was doing my old girlfriend from when she was a child she has a grandbaby for the first time and i was just like oh my gosh so congratulations to all of you because that's freaking awesome what you see he's gonna wind back there when i got off a line all i did was come here come here he just wants to lay on me that's all he wants is to lay on me he wants to sit like this i give him a little scratch he falls asleep and then that's it and then i can do whatever it is i was doing so if i was watching tv or if i was looking at my phone or whatever it is no this little freaking idiot will whine and cry until he's he's on me i bet i bet i was a fake grandma to um boyfriend's um child and um not his child his child's child and it was yeah it was it was amazing i hopefully it didn't screw me for my own grandchild like my own blood grandchild i don't know what that will be but one day i hope my daughter doesn't think she wants to have children and um but she might want to adopt i was like i don't care if you would die like i don't really care that would be my grandbaby regardless you know what i'm saying that's my grandbaby bro give a [Music] i don't care i don't i don't care i don't care that's my grandbaby that's what i think you know that other grand that other baby was a fake grandbaby and i still treated it like it was my own right this is all he wants this is this is just what he wants here it goes hey what happened here what happened let's see what i don't know what happened but it turned off on me there it is it probably wasn't like i probably had it just unplugged enough well i am so glad that you are getting to enjoy that the the the that's just wonderful wonderful all right so that's the that's the whole lesson like i really don't have more of a lesson than that [Laughter] uh because well all right he actually is a good boy but um my my uh my uh bambi my other dog my well that's not my dog but he was my foster dog he's eight years old and his previous everything freaky he pissed everywhere so when he came in he was pissing everywhere and then he would be he would ah go behind and you know mock because that one mocked so the other one wears a diaper and so this one wears a diaper too i'm keeping my house clean [Laughter] so and you know here's the thing is though i take off his diaper for the most part as long as i haven't like he lets me know when he has to go to the bathroom so i'll let him out and he will hold it the other one won't um so when i take his diaper off there is nothing there but i'm always scared because the uh he'll see what happens is he'll see bambi go and lift his legs up on something even though he's got the diaper on if he doesn't have his diaper on he'll go over right behind it so i'm i'll get screwed i'm trying to get bambi i actually uh wasn't this i don't know if it was this morning or um yesterday morning where i was surprised that bambi did not his his diaper wasn't wet and i was i was very surprised with that right does him don't care him just want to sleep on me that's all he wants he just wants to see and he knows that if he gets into this position that he's kind of golden because i can still work with him and he knows because he's only freaking five pounds i can he can reasonably get away with being stuck in there and me just continuing to do whatever i do all right let's do it cheers and then i'm out um i'm gonna be cooking though too i'm gonna be back tomorrow unless for some reason i wind up getting a date tomorrow night i've been ghosted by this other guy like i can't even believe i've been ghosted by this other guy i'm exhausted listen it's hard to tell people listen here i want to be your wife but i want to have a garden in the basement look at this mess and he'll just sleep there oh see yeah it's the it's him i'd be golden with him like literally if i didn't have that dog this dog would have five stars he doesn't because he's with him he's the perfect single dog um if he had a female he'd be all right like if you in that in when you have get when you put the same breed together you need to put feet a male and a female when you put the the same sex they are not good with each it doesn't matter what breed you use so whenever if you go to put like other it's better to put different breed dogs of the same sex if you're going to put the same sex i used to have a uh i used i used to do dog rescue used to it's in my bio oh that would oh oh oh oh oh you know what that would have sucked like if having a big dog and having to them to go to the bathroom on the floor oh that's rough so i was someone said someone i was looking at the freaking tick tock and you know i'm scrolling through because i'm just looking for anything at this i'm bored and i'm i'm having a weird thing going on over here i am lonely and lonely like lonely i'm just lonely i'm in that lonely space um and someone was talking about um there's a big dog and and they were doing something that she was like i peed in the floor and but i did it in the bathroom it's a big dog i'm like oh my god i can't i like i can't you know what my ex's dog he would lift his leg but he was mocking he wasn't like peeing pain the things that i talked about during my life right so that hap that will now happen every is it like 10 minutes every 10 minutes for the next  four hours i should have did it for tomorrow because with this machine like if i am cooking in my crock pot i can leave it in there overnight you know and just heat it up and then it will be good for me to go to to to um to uh strain it so uh if i you know i'm i'm awake i'm always awake uh what time is it it is nine o'clock i'm for surely going to be awake when this finishes i will go live i'll be exhausted and i'll look like  and i'm different clothes on probably no bra even though look at this i'm freaking hanging out i'm hoping the boy will just freaking jump in my skirt holy i sound so desperate don't i unbelievable yeah that thing's scared yeah so that will go off for the next four hours like that with when i do in the crock pot i just throw it in there after i leave it on high for an hour wait till this the the the herb turns brown then i put it down to low and i keep it on low for like 24 hours to 48 hours it's got a lot of herb in there and a lot of um like i have the whole freaking plant ugh one of my guys told me something about getting like cheap weed from someone and he told me how much it was it was and i was like it was like it's ten dollars cheaper what are you kidding me well i need to find me a sugar baby i'm a well no because i don't want to pay them i don't have the money to deal with that i don't have that kind of money i could probably give them i could probably give them edibles but not even anyways tick tock is terrible it is it's a terrible place uh because well guys are twofold because i create and because of the creating and the watching but ruth ruth so and so and that's bad okay i don't watch tv i only watch tv since this whole pandemic  started uh ruth something died she was in the lgbtq plus community um uh she was the the uh should judge um but it's a great loss be like there were people on tick tock like crying crying that um she has passed away and i'm and i know that they don't know her but she was that impactful to them so like i get it and i'm not making fun of them but at the point at first i was like what are you crying

watermelon Keaney like a alright the Heat's getting that alright um yeah it just doesn't taste bad just tastes like a hard water mom flavored candy of some sorts with some heat attached to it and I was like candy this might be your Holly thing it's getting there sugar is the first ingredient so we're okay those peppers not towards it towards a bomb it's like no sugar corn syrup water artificial flavoring citric acid then ghost pepper so I can handle one it is definitely it's not as bad as the poop that chocolate oh my gosh oh I don't know if that's the same rule is that I should be careful around my we're gonna try buying if that cooks up the heat we'll see you ow sharp Wow dr. Bunty okay first one swallow do you gum all right I mean I could use water right now I honestly like I I want some water but it's not that bad where I need the water I just really am thirsty to begin

with the heat it just says warning choking hazard contains small hard candy that was just too much in my mouth I think that one's not as them I repeat not as bad as the spiciest Hot Shot spiciest chocolate bar the way I would rate it so far on my spicy spectrum so a little spicier than the spicy noodles I nowhere near to the blazing weaning from Buffalo Wild Wings and I say the spicy chocolate that I did that is like through the roof on the spicy spectrum this is a definitely more than a mild spice but not too bad all right well thanks for watching I will have a gummy bear one coming soon I am NOT doing this today though that will be coming soon we'll see how uh if I get too scared I'm excited I'm scared [Music] but anyways um thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed sorry wasn't too like

"3mA2FaNRZ2A": "welcome to 420 rx cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi today I'm making THC infused watermelon lollipops using 1/2 cup of water 1/3 cup of corn syrup 1 full cup of sugar 1/2 teaspoon of lecithin and I'm going to bring that to a boil I'm going to use pink food coloring as well as white for my color I'll carefully place my candy thermometer and continue on a slow boil to 300 degrees once I reach 300 degrees I'll need to move quickly I'll remove from heat add my flavoring add my tincture and mix that well I'll transfer it into my plastic candy funnel and proceeded to fill my silicone mold as the candy cools it is going to start to harden it will set quickly in the molds now I being impatient went ahead and put my molds in the freezer for about 5 minutes once they were sturdy enough to move I'm bringing them out removing them from the molds they turned out perfect fifteen watermelon lollipops made with an alcohol-based tincture enjoy be sure

stop this is my girl right here I'm a pup Kelly tsuyoi say I speak speak good girl anyway so I made these canna butter infused candies and I got the recipe from star Delta nines channel so for any of you who are not subscribed to her be sure to check her out she does a lot of different cooking recipes she has her own girl she's uh she's a wild chick that's for sure but anyway I wanted to do hard candies for the longest [ __ ] time and I just stumbled across this and that was about all four or five days ago and since I made these freakin candies guys I have been fried I have been met so medicated since these things are awesome they taste freakin great so without further ado these here are the lollipops I made them with orange jell-o flavored and they got some icing sugar on them quite a bit more than probably most people would put on them to be honest but I love it and then I made these little swirly candies a lot of it was because it you know it was my first time it's just for me a lot of it was just what's built out all over the cookie molds and stuff but these candies guys it calls for half a cup I believe of yeah half a cup of peanut butter and most recipes that I've been finding trying to find a cookie rest era candy recipe is with like tink stirs and oils and stuff so when I found this I was in my frigging glory and honestly guys they taste good the taste is really good they went raw card like they're rock candies man they're rock candies and if you look it's actually a mustache lollipop these ones are so that's pretty funny but yeah so I got these little molds small ones and I'm in Candy's boat here being a sec both this big so in my opinion if I'm eating candy this size right here it better be able to give me what I want you know I finally know one candy I want to make sure that I'm getting medicated from it and this stuff works great when I came to Cal no friggin way oh no hey so I just dropped this one on the ground so I'm gonna have to eat it

today I gonna make some homemade taffy that uses kool-aid drink mix here we go [Music] so in a large saucepan start off with two and a half cups of white granulated sugar add to that three tablespoons of cornstarch and then whisk those two things together just to make sure that there aren't any lumps in your sugar or lumps in the cornstarch then add one cup of clear or light corn syrup you can use the golden kind as well it just may affect the final color of your candy add to that one in 1/3 cups of water at room temperature and two tablespoons of butter now turn your heat on to medium and begin to stir over medium heat until it starts to boil once it starts to boil you can stop stirring and you need to cook this mixture until it reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit I broke my candy thermometer just moments before making this video so I was using my digital meat thermometer but either way just make sure you get up to 250 degrees Fahrenheit once you reach that temperature remove it from the heat now what I did is I divided this and poured half of the mixture into another saucepan because I wanted to make two flavors of taffy added in one quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract into each of the containers and then I added in a packet of kool-aid drink mix this is the unsweetened kind so I put one packet into one pot and it was orange and the other one I use cherry and Max is helping me out here in the stirring Department if you don't want to use two flavors use two packages of drink mix in one pot and a half a teaspoon of vanilla so once that's stirred in you're going to pour it onto a greased cookie sheet or in this case I'm using one that's been covered with a silicone mat you could spread it out a little bit and then just let it cool you need to let it cool so that you can handle it without burning your hands basically it's going to take about 15 minutes or so then butter your hands and generously because this stuff is sticky and pick up a portion and you're going to pull and this candy and you will see as you pull and stretch and pull and stretch the color of the candy will start to change from a dark red to a lighter kind of a pastel shade as you're adding air into there continue to pull the taffy and when you get a nice pale shade you're going to cut it up into portions using a buttered pair of scissors or a buttered knife or a buttered pizza cutter now just to show you the difference between pulled candy and one that's not pulled I'll show you two here you don't have to pull it if you don't want to the one on the Left hasn't been pulled and the one on the right has so you can see it's a real color change if you don't want to go through the pulling just cut that puddle of candy down the cookie sheet in two pieces and then wrap it in waxed paper wrap in a wax paper twist the ends and you have a nice little piece of taffy I was pretty happy with the way these turned out the flavor is very fruity and it is remarkably like a starburst candy if you've ever had one as a matter of fact it is so similar to a starburst candy I might even put it in the title as homemade starbursts the texture is a little bit softer than a starbursts taffy a little bit softer maybe just a tiny bit too soft could be that I because I was using a meat thermometer I didn't quite get it hot enough and actually formed one into a little square shape so you could see how you could package these like homemade starbursts overall very fruity nice little treat really sticky when you're trying to chew it just like a regular taffy hope you give them a try if you do let me know thanks for watching if you enjoy making your own candy why don't you give these a try homemade lemon gumdrops so go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the About section below the video bye bye", "FYsqZXHVnI8": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida where we make hard candy today we're gonna make some crystal flour candy this time in the shape of a sunflower this batches flavor will be honey this was made originally as a custom order for a wedding but we like the results so much we thought we'd show you it and start making it at lofty pursuits for a little while [Music] the table were pouring the hot sugar on is a special table from the late 1800s it was made specifically for this and we're going to be stirring in our food coloring and adding it we're gonna do this before the table cools the candy down to the point we needed to we needed to behave like a clay not like a liquid we use small wooden spoons to stir in the food coloring and let the water boil off that's in the food coloring this keeps the candy from getting sticky our color pellet today will have three colors brown yellow and green this is a part of our crystal candy series that we started earlier this year [Music] none of the candy is cooled a bit we're gonna cut the colors apart and then fold them on the cooling table to even out the temperature within each piece [Music] sunflowers are fascinating plants and they have attracted the attention of everyone from painters like Van Gogh to scientists one of the reasons I think people like them is they all face the same way in a field it's not one sunflower it's a bunch of them that are amazing and they all face the same way because they are Gila tropic this means they follow the Sun so as they turn to the Sun they all turn in time with each other to like a slow dance of flowers and their petals all open up and they're out they are looking at you sort of like faces and this is one of the things that make them cool and we're gonna try to capture this in our candy and now it's time for me to use the candy makers hook on this I'm gonna take the yellow candy fold it over and pull it again and again to trap air bubbles this is gonna change the nature of the candy it's gonna change its texture and increase its surface area with these little air bubbles this makes it taste better when you eat the candy it's also going to make the color brighter and while it doesn't appear so on this video yet the brightening happens after the candy cools off it's more noticeable the color change when I pulled the brown sugar because I'm going to need to Center the little seeds to be lighter than the outside and when I pull that you'll be able to see its color change as I pull I [Music] mentioned earlier that I needed some green candy too and I haven't made me yet I'm gonna make it on the heating table you see I need such a tiny amount of green if I try to make it on the cooling table the color would spread and I'd end up with more green than I could use so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a little bit of a hot clear candy and add just a drop of green food coloring in it I've done this too a pocket inside the candy and I'm going to fold that over again and again with the pocket sealed and it's gonna sculler this candy besides the sunflower being the only flower that has the name flower in its name it also has other peculiar characteristics it's actually not one flower but a group of flowers if you think of it each flower only makes one seed and a sunflower has a Fibonacci sequence of a spiral of seeds in it when it's done and we end up having multiple seeds in each seed as a flower and those are tiny flowers in the center of the head of the sunflower the yellow petals we think of as the petals of the sunflower are called rays and each of them are a special type of flower in themselves multiple flowers on the flower head I'm making the center of the flower out of a group of cylinders the center of the cylinder is pulled lighter Brown candy and the outside wrap is a dark brown candy the nice thing about candy is I can do multiplication with it in other words I'm going to pull one long log out and cut it in half and keep on pulling it and cutting it it'll get thinner but it'll make all the cylinders that I need and they'll all be roughly the same size [Music] and now to make the raise around the head of the sunflower I'm gonna do this by making one large block of yellow gonna put some clear on one side that's gonna act as a spacer to differentiate the different petals then we're going to take two cold triangles of clear and they're gonna shape the top of the petals as best as I can now I'm only going to make one giant petal and then I'm gonna stretch it and cut it in half and then I'll have two and I'm gonna continue to repeat this until I have enough to wrap around our seeds [Music] you can try this candy for yourself you can get it at www.ppsd.com flowers are native to North America there are two varieties native to South America and because of that it's become the state flower of Kansas but it's been exported and it grows beautifully in some other countries it's actually the national flower of the Ukraine and the Ukraine over there grows more sunflowers and produces more sunflower oil than any other country in the world [Music] all the fluff to do is put on the final wrap but it went into the final wrap I make a clean square edge and I add my green so when I roll it up will have a stem on our sunflower I know I took some liberties here with the brown sunflower seeds real sunflower seeds are black if they're used for oil and blocking gray striped if they're used for eating but gray doesn't show up well in candy and I thought the brown would look better and now to our new piece of equipment to Thomas Mills batch roller well it's new to us they started making this model around 1895 I've got a catalog page from an old catalog from before it and when I found that I was very happy it has been able to do what it was advertised to do back in the late 1800s increased my productivity we can now make more candy with the same number of people and what it does is it rolls the candy it does the job that I used to do there is some templates I have located under those mats I used to protect my table feel carefully you'll see that we're getting ready for candy cane season and those are templates for making candy canes we're not going to be using those today now we have to pull the log of candy into Roth's and I've been calling them rods but the industry term for them is canes this term was borrowed from the glass industry where canes a glass were pulled and cut into beads using a similar technique called Miller Flores I want to take this time to apologize to you for not putting on a video lately we've been very busy making candy and we've been doing a lot of work preparing for a Kickstarter campaign which is now over and was quite successful we're gonna be traveling around the country to shoot some really cool candy making videos for you and if you didn't know about the Kickstarter campaign and want to find out what we're gonna do just go to Kickstarter and check us out I want to personally thank you for all the unbelievable support through that Kickstarter campaign we're gonna be able to do things I never thought we could afford to do thank you so much [Music] the last step of the process is to cut it into pieces and then we can go for the quality control check fortunately I have a group of people here who are happy to volunteer to be my quality control checkers [Music] I think this may be the first time that when somebody saw my candy up close they were actively unsure if they should eat it or just save it as a piece of art [Music] we appreciate you watching our video today if you liked our candy and want to try it for yourself you can go to our website www.youtube.com and Twitter too and if you ever come to Tallahassee we'd love to see you in person we call our candy public displays the confection because we do it in front of the public and you can come ballet we don't make candy all the time but we do make a lot of it and you can see us make candy in Tallahassee thank you for watching you", "1RNX8iI8pmg": "a second arrest in as many weeks local deputies seizing candy laced with marijuana this time a st. Augustine Beach man was arrested after investigators say he received a shipment of drugs in the mail from Colorado where as you know pot is now legal channel 4 Scott Johnson has been talking with police and parents about illegal edibles he's joining us live Scott Tom I also talked to some people in town from Colorado who say this is something they're dealing with out west and now we're seeing it pop up a smattering of it here and there in our area as this stuff seems to be shipped through the mail these are the drugs and if you look at some of the bags close up you can see it's filled with illegal drugs that look like gummy bears and candy the st. Johns County Sheriff's Office arrested Joshua waking who they say was supposed to have the drugs delivered to his home by mail from Colorado deputies seizing thirty five thousand dollars worth of drugs oh dear guess we're robbing Colorado yeah are you surprised no why not well since Colorado passed a law legalizing marijuana um the dispensaries are all over and you know it is a concern about the gummy bears said that looked like that I bumped into Theresa brink who's visiting from Colorado she wasn't surprised to hear this story saying these candies are all over Colorado where marijuana is now legal they're laced to a THC a chemical extracted from marijuana everybody's talked about it because it's such an easy thing that you think your child could easily get confused if they were at a party somewhere or something like that and they didn't know exactly what they were taking parents weren't happy to hear about this showing up in st. Johns County what if my six-year-old twins so what if they took it and something happened or if you got ahold of it I mean it's not safe at all this is the second case like this in st. Johns County this year last week I brought you a similar story when a man was arrested in Atlantic Beach also for having drugs that resembled candy in his vehicle commander Chuck Mulligan with the st. Johns County Sheriff's Office says this should be a reminder for parents particularly around Halloween I don't believe that someone who's doing on a drug trade for for profit if you will in distribution would hand it out freely to children but then again you don't know and that is a concern every year parent should be paying attention during Halloween for their kids candy and what goes in their bag but especially now because my understanding is that Colorado has seen some of these instances and not just Colorado but any of the states that have the legalize marijuana in their states currently that kids are getting their hands on this and the man who's been arrested from st. Augustine Beach is facing charges for possession as well as distribution and sale of narcotics it also faced federal charges because as these apparently were transported through the u.s. mail Scott

to the crowd and to the disciples the teachers of the law and the Pharisees Simeon Moses's see so you must obey them do everything they tell you but do not do what they do and they not practice what they preach they tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift finger to believe them everything they do is done for men to see they make their phylacteries why and the tassels undergarments walls they love the place of water and banquets and those deportes seats in the synagogues they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and how men call the rabbi well she teachers of law and Pharisees you hypocrites you clean the outside puppet dish but inside their own grief and self-indulgence blind Pharisee first clean the inside of the cup and dish and then outside also will weekly woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites you are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside but everything done played in the same way on the outside you appear to be to us righteous but on the inside uniform for poverty and wickedness bangalore dad is blessing to comedian here I'm small Department we're going to start off towards various ones privately then Brad we ask that you would be here right now God keeps us awake keepers of tempo truly open our ears to what you desire to teach us at an individual accomplice be smart enough to apply of pray this in Jesus name Amen unless you've been living under a rock somewhere you have heard something about the arrest on charges being made against a buffet see assuming that everybody hears heard something about that I'm David patient was youth pastor over east brady baptist church he was like oh that position or results in that position back this past July but this past Tuesday he was arrested on having charges of inappropriate relationship with a girl in his youth group and I think it's important you may be clear precisely what those charges are because it's just all kinds of rumors that are floating around to be calm that he's being accused according the affidavit of kissing her when she was 15 and when she was 16 touching her really loved her clothes this past August and it's a scandal that has rocked the Baptist Church we've been praying for the Baptist Church for a while over the situation details have just fun to come out about it though and it's a scandal that has brought this community in general not even thus the church and that's what David did but support for me to tell you who David is to me so that you can understand where this sermon is coming from I've known David and his family for 21 years now and have been friends with the entire family for that time I'm entered him as a youth I was his youth pastor growing up and as he grew older he became one of my closest friends and he's been an older brother to my children and he's been a younger brother to me he's gone on vacation with my family he's lived with us for several months before he got married not only that he was the youth pastor at my brother-in-law's church so to me this situation is about as close as they come and to say that my family has been affected by this would be hitting the under state for the world my family's been devastated by this and my brother off he's been on that borderline nervous breakdown for the past couple of months and one of the things that really makes this situation so painful is that as you grow close to somebody anybody but especially those people that you spent a lot of time you you get an image in your mind of who they really are you just feel like you know deep down you know them you know who they are and then when things like this happen it just shatters that image it just breaks it into a thousand pieces and leaves you picking them up wondering if anything anything at all that you're new real the scripture that I chose this morning to talk about deals with with this it deals with the thought of what is truly inside of a person and when we take a look at Matthew chapter 23 we find that much of this chapter is spending Jesus just tear the Pharisees on one side and write down the other and this section is actually known as the seven was it section because seven times in a section of scripture jesus starts by saying woe to you teachers of the law Pharisees you hypocrites and when you read through this section you can see Jesus's he's really letting them have it you almost kind of feel bad for the Pharisees that were standing there listening to this and if you look at the sec's description most of this section revolves around complaints about the fact that they care more about what the outside of the person looks like what they look like on the outside the people around them then was actually going on on the ends and Susan read first two of those woes this morning here's verse 25 one created for you again what are you teaches a belong Pharisees you hypocrites you clean the outside of the cup of this for the insider full of greed and self-indulgence client Pharisees first going the inside of the competition the outside will also be clean and then the second one woe to you teachers along Pharisees you hypocrites you're like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but it's we're full of dead men's bones and everything unclean in the same way on the outside you appear to people as righteous on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness so if Jesus in their section is giving us two visuals of how it doesn't matter how pretty you make something look on the outside if the inside is still rot you know you know what kind of reminds me I think I've mentioned this before but it reminds me of a box of mystery chocolates you ever get a box of mystery chocolates you know maybe it's Valentine's Day or Christmas and you just get a box of chocolates from somebody with their mystery chocolates because they didn't come with one of those handy dandy little guides inside that tells you what chocolate is where so you know whether these chocolates and they all look the same I mean they do look pretty good cuz they're all chocolate on the outside but what you're not happy because you don't have the guy is you have to play the Russian Roulette chocolate game that's what you have to play you play this game before haven't you and you're fine you're still praying the mystery chocolate prayer don't you because you take it out and look at it you can't tell much I you say oh lord please don't let this be disgusting please don't let it be discussed you can't not eat it you have to eat it but you're really afraid and terrified what might be on the inside and you take it it looks okay you take that first bite and maybe you lucked out you didn't get the bullet you said oh thank you Jesus is coconut it's comforting at home oh that's great that's great so you're confidently go back into the second one and that was your mistake right there you should pull the second one out you take a bite into it it's toothpaste why don't you taste inside Charlotte who put their evil panda but that if you play you play the Russian Roulette chocolate me because every single chocolate it looks good on the outside but what really matters is what they have chosen to fill it with on the inside because it might be something very good or it might be something very very fast and this is what the Pharisees were doing the chocolates i was going to jonathan's this is what the pharisees were doing they were so concerned with looking good on the outside for everybody else to see that they were trying really hard to look good but they really weren't putting any time and effort and then actually being good and actually being the person on the inside that they wanted everybody else on the outside to to see them and think of them as I think in some sense I think we're all mismatched like that I really do because we are so driven by what people think about us we are so motivated to look good when other people see us that we allow that desire to take precedence over actually being a good that's what we do if you understand that it's less about what's actually going on inside here anymore about but everybody else sees on the outside because they've kind of see what's good they've kind of see so we are constantly thinking about how people see us and then we are adjusting our behaviors based upon their perception obvious one was really going on in here just based upon how it appears on the outside and we want to doing or not doing certain things simply based upon what other people around us would think they've all been there having to maybe I don't curse in public because people hear me but Mike swear like a sailor have my own house right maybe if someone else is in a room I won't turn on a particular show but when they're not home anything goes maybe I won't tell the racist joke at church but went on a work how do I one just to get a laugh they've gotta love someone to their face and then talk them on one side down the other one and not listen maybe if a fellow Krishna is in the car I Drive it very tightly and peacefully but if they aren't that I'm much more likely to wait by with one thing some of you I know I know he didn't recognize me in my car I reckon that robot keep up appearances we are about keeping up appearances my dad went to a seminary when he was younger that told him they were list rules it he was a follow one of these rules was that he was not allowed to go see in the movie theater an r-rated movie he could not go to the theater and watch an r-rated movie but he couldn't rent it and bring it home and watch it in his house because they don't want people to see that it wasn't about whether or not it was right around was about what other people saw we are constantly living our lives trying to give off the appearance that we are good people that we are living a good life that life is good that everything is good that we are the model of perfection but inside it's just our almost a way that they appear big everybody gave it to start off this morning I apologize because it is a very emotional subject for me right now but I need to share a little bit more to you so that you can understand what I'm coming from David actually preach in this church not just passed a patient whether the vacation before that on when I went away and he did a good job I mean people really wanted him to come back just because he was a good speaker when he spoke he was great he just spoke at the convocation he aimed the convocation at graduation and when they were done in here just the robbers in a kind who was that again he's really good he sounds like a really good guy and he had an active and growing youth ministry he did it was it was the best in the area and kids youth really came to a saving relationship with Jesus they profess Jesus and were baptized in the Baptist Church new cosmic and on the outside david looked like a model youth pastor but on the inside there was so much tunnel there was just on one and david was suffering and he is suffering from a major mental disorder that costs an extreme pain every single day of his life and his smile and his lap on the outsider it was just an act to cover up what was really going on on the inside I'm not trying to do this to excuse what's happened but I just want you to understand that because of this pain he made several stupid and ungodly decisions which is obviously now suffering consequences of only outside he look good on the inside he was dying and that's one of the many dangers inherent in making yourself look better on the outside that you actually are on the inside because if people could see what you were going through then love you they could support you they could help you they could lift you up but instead of allowing them to see the reality of the situation we put on this chocolate coated exterior and just let everybody believed that everything is okay I'm good we're good we're all doing good and thing is that it's exhausting to try to keep up appearances it is tired to pretend like every single day everything is okay when it's not in every moment when we put on that hard exterior is spent praying and hoping that somebody doesn't see through it that they can't get past and see through it see that exterior that we've created that shows us as this beautiful strong perfect person because then you'll actually see what's going on in the inside god forbid that folks you don't have to lie it's okay to not be okay and I know why we do this I know why we do this it's because we are so quick to point out each other's flaws it's because we are so fast dl crucifying it with the rest of the crowd that we make each other so terrified of messing up so afraid of letting just that crap split open so that they can see who we truly are and when we do that we put so much effort into keeping the outside looking perfect while the inside is just a mess and we become like the Pharisees we spent the whole day cleaning the outside of the bowl a bowl that we ever took time to watch the inside of folks there are two things I want you to learn from this treasure and I want you to learn from David's life for them there are two things that we can do to put an end to this need to put on that perfect shelter covers up or flaws first thing that we can do is to stop judging each other so harshly when brother or sister steps outside of God's desires let us stop yelling hate-filled and self-righteous holier-than-thou speech because we're condemning someone and because their shell broke but God forbid apart as it ever does happen as we're all super hushed just hope we met nobody sees on flawless I'm asking let's find a brother or sister who is hurting and then gently bring them back into the fold with love not punish them we hate as we as Christians tend to do and say I'm asking list let us take down these hard exteriors that we weren't so hard to polish and it may look perfect let us stop lying to each other about who we really are instead let us give each other the opportunity to love to except to embrace who we really are flaws all and by doing this less inspiring each other not to simply make ourselves look good on the outside but to bring these balls down so that we can lovingly help each other truly be the person and we desire everyone to see so I just ask you to take no more eight no more lies I'm telling me you're all worth love fall as a mom let's pray you've got so many times we find ourselves relating to the Pharisees godness so just one more of those moments god I just ask that you help us help us through your scripture and through life lessons to be strong enough to take down an art exterior to open ourselves up to those around us to be willing to look at the inside instead of just the outside so that through your love and a lot of the love of others we might be able to change who we really are not just change we appear to be we pray this in Jesus name", "SM8BVq9khuk": "so i'll do the two big ones first yeah you do i reverse okay the third one third line for this the last citrus lime oh okay yeah and fourth i got mango and cherry um yeah sure i mean cherry cherry sometimes stains the kettle but i think we usually just work right over it anyway so we can just quickly wash it yeah yeah if it's even a problem a mongol and then five cherry and we we gotta do five cherry six is uh pineapple six just right out fine apple oh that sounds like a really good flavor bag a good mix yeah oh you didn't even hear the first one or every lemonade yeah actually yeah she told me about it yeah so when you guys are writing the order what are you guys thinking like why should a certain flavor go before another flavor well like grape goes last because it stains the cuddle so we definitely so like really spread it out yeah i really have to really super clean it and uh some flavors that are just light you can just go as long as you cleaned it out with a spatula or then you can just go over and start up the next batch but if it's not clean enough so a lot of it is just like speed like how quickly you can get through each uh cleaning the kettle and stuff onto the next match yeah i mean it only takes five minutes anyway so it's not a big deal we were doing two big batches 24 pound batches first two of them we're doing strawberry and lemonade in one batch and then we do an orange 24 pound batch because people can't write something you want to write down the shots yeah i just don't want to forget the numbers so are there any other considerations when you're deciding the order no that's that's mainly the idea yeah i'm trying to then try to do the citrus citric acid ones all together too so that so that you know we have it out and we do them all together yeah so it's not so you're like putting ingredients away and then taking them back out throughout the day yeah that way we otherwise we could forget yeah forget to put it because i mean i have never told you guys to let me know when you're about to do something and then come in you guys are already doing it that's never happened we usually just let you know before we even do it oh yeah you come in right every time and everything's perfect yeah so let's do the shots now how many ounces um so with the strawberry lemonade bumping it up to 24 i had 5.7 shots so we can just do five and three quarters if you want but that's for a full batch so then that divided in half is like 2.85 so i don't know if you want to just do three shots you're just mixing me up all right so for strawberry lemonade it should be 2.85 shots but we could just do three shots let's just do two and uh three quarters okay three quarters well then it'll be a little weaker than it normally is no no it literally will be okay you can put a little more on top did you just call me a little i know what you're going for a little chocolate earthquake so what exactly are you doing by doing this so this is called seed tempering you take chocolate that's already tempered shave it up so it melts really quick and then you dump it into untempered chocolate at certain temperature intervals and it helps to build the correct chocolate crystals it's science you know like every time you start bringing up like crystals i'm like yeah this is basically just the right temperature right based in the right way yeah yeah because you've got to bring it down strip it down to completely bare bones and you're like this is the most basic thing it gets so close to the right temperature yeah but but the secret is that like the right crystals are in here and they're kind of like a foundational building block for the crystals that are in the melted chocolate so is there a reason you're putting it behind the wheel um just because i'm superstitious yeah like when we have the belt on it all you can do is put it behind the wheel one scoop at a time yeah um me and your dad are of the mentality that like candy takes time you know i mean you have to let it like slowly go in there when we're adding funnels you want to do it nice and slow so it can like mix together um so i just like to do it like that i've dumped it in before just in a big clump and like it's kind of screwed up my temper so so you think it's better to add it like yeah a little bit at a time but there's only anecdotal evidence there hasn't been too many peer-reviewed articles about this you know i look for them every day at google docs and i never buy nothing yeah no chocolate documents it's the we'll worst fill this up three quarters just a bag of the chips that were too small the chocolate cover yeah these are kind of effie you know like get too small trying to keep them decent sizes yeah once this one could have used this one but there's a few we could use but yeah so you're trying to leave this open in case i need some more but it's good to start work here so for people who are unaware uh what do you have it in the water for the water keeps the chocolate warm so it doesn't harden up on me so i can use it because usually these cuddles are used for mostly um doing handmade candies yeah if i didn't use it you could get cold on me too quick just fill it up with warm water just warm water from the sink and then it keeps the water the chocolate nice and melted so you can take it out of the water to cool it down and then if you need to heat it back up you just put it back in the water yeah let's go wow it's high-tech it's your first time doing it like this right yeah usually i just maybe a ladle or by hand mix all the chips in make sure all the chips are covered up is there a reason you haven't done it like that previously or you just didn't think of it well now that i'm doing another batch i'm going to do the same thing actually in a few minutes as soon as i get these colors i'm going to do the oh yeah actually i've even done a white chocolate bark and a melt chocolate bar yeah we're usually under pressure during the holidays i'll do two but we're very lucky right now and we're selling a lot of candy which yeah actually you guys were telling so much that mom told me to take the videos down to once a week yeah i mean we're very lucky a lot of people aren't that lucky so yeah very grateful there oh yeah i'm very grateful for sure okay this is all covered so i'm gonna take and go to the other park in just a minute now most almonds are made of meat four and eight ounce bags yeah these are little that's why they look so good huh yeah exactly four yeah we gotta put a little nut in there so it looks like they're all about point two pounds yeah or point two ounces point two pounds that'd be really big she just agrees with whatever yeah oh that's 4.2 wow that's good yeah right mm-hmm good good job good job proud of you karen sam what are you doing hey i've been doing brittle for days yeah i'm on my last box of cashew riddle i think i had nine boxes to do and then we're just gonna do this till it's a quarter wave full and then it's gonna be chocolate covered the rest can we do these to eight ounces so he says uh after a certain amount the rest of this box will be yeah for chocolate covered yeah we saved enough for our pecan peanut and cashew for chocolate covered do you guys have a favorite i'm still the traditional peanut girl yeah kara i know what hers is and it's probably i think it's the same as mine wait let's say i'll say it in three one two three yep it's all the same that's what i thought in my opinion it's just the best i'm just the odd boy no the peanut butter one's good though none of them are bad no my mom used to make peanut butter when we were kids so it just springs back no way my mom used to make peanut butter when i was a kid no way oh my god wait karen what about you did your mom make peanut butter when you're a kid all right now you're the odd one now well now you got to see my mom make it yeah so just as good right yeah how big these pieces are in here i don't know that's a big piece don't worry i can take care of that i just speak hamilton it is i would really like to just smash it like crazy but then they britta bits yeah and eventually eventually after they do the chocolate covered there's still be some in here for girdle bits wow that are delicious on ice cream so you guys had many uh curbside orders uh today a couple few of them yeah last week it was wild yeah that's why we're kind of blah today yeah we're all just kind of like because it was wild last week and for mother's day yeah yeah my mom said that orders are finally slowing down because we've been just doing like one one video a week yeah that's all we needed was one video a week yeah yeah kept us busy yeah so it was uh easter and mother's day that's when you guys had a lot of curbside orders and now that there's no well like father's day is coming up when like next month yes junior june yep sure is we still have people that will order mother's day you know late yeah just better late than never that's right i forgot or they just couldn't get there yeah this year all right kara what are you up to wintergreen patties all these oh that's not yes more than that before oh yeah kelly usually does it like when she was here i don't think we have very many so yeah just kind of roll it to get the excess off yeah yep i just rub them later i just wrap them all they don't have to be rubbed that much anyway but i just saved that for later these are all the colors i have try to go for more spring colors since you don't want winter colors like dark green and red people won't want them what colors do you have over here gold purple fuchsia light blue aqua light green lavender uh and this one's i think it's orchid just go back and forth because there's so many trays and i only have so many colors so yeah so you're just doing like i don't know like 30 or something in each one i don't know 20. let's show however i want some amount yup some amount some amount some amounts i think you know what i'll just do them all in this color i think mom would really like that yeah she'd be jumping for joy carrie you did such a good job thanks for not listening to me yeah for the assorted chocolates yep this is uh you can't keep up with them so i'm trying to do this is a faster way to do it except for the raising cups these are still going to be slow just like when we make uh rum raisin and stuff uh creams since that's a slower process yeah because you're putting all these in here because they're kind of they stick together and they stick to your gloves yeah yeah they're all stuck to my glove well i'll do three this fills up a little stock box each time i do three of these trays are you just doing three trays or three trays at a time yeah i'm just doing three trays at a time and only three of each i got to go through a little list of nuts yeah 89 degrees should be fine it's enough so usually you do this by hand right yeah i usually do this on the table and mix them all up by hand and put them in here but we're under pressure to make more quicker yeah that's yeah when you're under pressure that's how you come up with ideas to do things faster yeah oh so yeah i guess this would be completely different because before you would have a puddle throw the raisins in the puddle so it'd be like completely like a little ball and then you drop it in so it's not like you're filling it up with raisins and then putting chocolate on top so do you think that the chocolate will seep down to the bottom all the way oh yeah it does i've got a vibrating table okay i put this on there and it vibrates the chocolate right in right you know close all the spaces and you thought of everything huh i hope so right now so have you done something similar though yeah i've done this already oh you have that no this is something we've done a couple times now because we're under pressure to make them quicker did it work right the first time yeah it's worked great yep this here well we're just taking i don't need this turn this on the ones that like i might be sticking up uh just make sure one more time let's do it all right well i think that's really cool i don't want to subject people to that loud of a noise for too long so i guess we'll just go see what max is up to okay good work dad voila all right youtubers we're back again to see the same thing we've seen at least a thousand times before so don't get too excited well we just record we record what we do in a day so and a lot of what we do in the day is the same yeah and by we i mean you guys that's why we're so good at everything practice makes perfect and you never make any mistakes i uh i've heard that word but i actually still don't know what it means mistake i don't get it i think it's when you take the wrong thing it's oh it's not like when you go to take something but you miss it could be that too yeah man one of these days we gotta buy a dictionary i'm sure yeah google would just not work you have to buy a physical dictionary google google that's a number correct oh you're right yeah come on man don't be silly what if that's why they call it google because it's like a google results or something what do you mean i bet you that's something that ironically enough you can google you know yeah yeah i never thought of that i saw you know on the internet recently somebody was like yeah i told my kids that i'm older than google and i think i'm kidding we're older than google yeah yeah that's true it's fun to take them out back when i was a kid ask james was the hot new thing he talked back to you man i just remember like do you remember getting the first computer in the house and being like we made it it was just like a white cream color huge monitor big tower that had a half a gigabyte of storage and we were happy and we were grateful 500 megs of ram good stuff yeah honestly like so my computer what's going on you saved it that was close it's pretty cool turn that pan up a little bit for anything uh yeah even just a lot of practice with bean robert uh earlier with like that warriors and stuff i was kind of running around a little bit that's where it's all been going i thought i was getting paid a lot recently wait so when you make a mistake it comes out of kara's paycheck and give it to you yeah wow why are you making more mistakes oh man yeah i'm not gonna mess around with that like if i pretend to be yeah right tend to make a mistake and just ruin the whole enrollment all right what what do you think what do you think turn the blower up all right i'm just gonna say yes all right max teach me your ways back again all right so these bags they haven't been full of like really big chips which is actually kind of good i guess for teaching but um so we're looking for chips like this guy is kind of like right on the edge like i'm gonna put that up there but anything smaller than that i wouldn't do yeah um yeah so that's the size thing picking through them it really does get a little arbitrary at a certain point but um you know just remember we're trying we're trying to get the bags done so yeah big chips take up more more space they weigh more you know all that stuff yeah all that good stuff um so then when you put them down like this looks like a pretty flat chip yeah but it's slightly curved so if you put it down and it's curved like facing the belt like you just have to turn it the other way because when it gets to the other side if it's pointing down then when it comes over this this rounded edge it'll get sucked up by the belt okay and that's how we get them eaten up and then we screw up the uh you know the funnel and everything so like even with a guy like this where the front edge is really where i'm always looking yeah that's like kind of if there's pressure on the front edge or whatever i just flip it over okay so just flip it up when in doubt yeah yeah just make sure that it's not pointing down because it will get sucked right in okay so uh yeah i think it's mostly just the size and putting them down the right way all right and uh you know you don't want to have too much gap or anything between them but yeah all right i'll do my worst so you got out of your office yes corporate let you out no corporate does not know that yes keep it under your hat yes do that so here i am teaching caramel cutting to nobody it took me till 4 30 to catch up yeah so i could come out yeah so do you like getting as much as you can down in your office and then being able to come out here and do physical stuff yes sitting in my office hurts my back i would rather be standing than sitting and running around and scaring walls and whatnot yeah did you say that every once in a while it's nice to do something like this where you're like i know how to cut caramel yes i do instead of like how do i fix this thing yes how do i fix my technology my technology's not working today this printer's not working this yeah it's it's nice to produce something to produce something sweet that's what i'm doing feeling like you're being productive so i've definitely done that with like i'm like trying to edit a video and then i run into like this wall with either my computer or the program yes see i run into walls too some physical sometimes yes we're bottlenecks but today my uncooperative software decided to sell some tie-dyed hard candy that we didn't have it said oh yeah you still have eight bags left you sold them and then and then the at the top of the hard candy was like we're not here we're not here we're ghosts of hard candy that happens yeah so we're going to make more next week because you know tomorrow's already taken and then it's going to be chocolate after that and then some more chocolate and you know it's a whole big thing yeah you noticed always a whole big thing but yeah i wish i could do more candy making yeah somebody's got to sit in a chair and click a mouse apparently it's me but all the people i called that just i mean i wanted to call it gay of them to tell them that we didn't have that they're all like really nice about it yeah you said they were apologizing to you they're like oh no no anything you want that's fine it's like no really i'm sorry we didn't have it but you're the one paying for it yeah i'm sorry that our website lied to you again i don't know how to use joe's doohickey i guess he could show me when he comes back yeah but it might be a secret maybe he won't show me yeah this is the old-fashioned way to cut it mm-hmm old school oh you know how to cut caramel i learned that i

everything going on around here and Minnesota with the the protesting and and all that stuff but just kind of been an emotional drain so I've been taking time out to deal with that and just really focus on keeping myself and my family in good spirits and yeah good spirits and just taking care of each other which hope everybody out there is doing as well but with that in mind the show must go on so I got a cool little thing here I'm going to try out today I'll tell you a little bit more about it here just a moment [Music] hello everybody Sam the foodie from Minnesota back finally with another taste testing video I hope everybody's doing okay yeah let's get right into it so today we have an item that I purchased a while ago so hopefully it won't affect the taste but I don't think it would so we have some more candies of course because I've got my sweet tooth so this is from a company called lofty pursuits these are they're called madness and it looks like what they are is just flavored candies these were recommended to me so yeah I decided to purchase them and want to kind of see what they're about I do not have any clue what they're gonna taste like or what the texture or anything is gonna be so I'm gonna open these up let's take a look nice little mylar bag here packaging is great so alright take a smell they've got oak the smell is kind of different I kind of smell like a hint of strawberry in it okay so let's take a look at it so I'm gonna give you guys a little close-up here it just looks like a yeah it's kind of weird yeah I mean a little strawberry but I don't see really yeah well let's give it a try whoa dem are crunchy okay this is still in my mouth a little bit but I'm just gonna kind of leave it there because it's gonna take me a while for it take it a while to this all and stuff so so yeah this is very crunchy definitely not something you chew it to the flavor kind of a strawberry flavor kind of lick it it's not too bad yeah very crunchy so they act remind me of the Hickory Farms strawberry bon bons that you like the meat packs very tasty the flavors great and yeah yeah okay so looking at it looks like serving sizes four pieces certains per container about five so you're looking at about 20 pieces in the mylar bag yeah um total carbs 5.9 grams for every four pieces so definitely carb friendly as long as you eat only eat a couple of them so now you got to give it a rating on a scale of one to five with five being just amazing I got to run out and buy more one being you couldn't pay me to buy more I'm gonna give these a four um it was not over it didn't make my mind explode they were very tasty though I would definitely buy them again so yeah four out of five is what I'm gonna give it so thank you so much for watching this video if you have any ideas for future videos for things for me to test please drop them in the comments please subscribe to channel like the video you know how works on YouTube and you guys stay safe and have an awesome day [Music]", "wHEjz4026Fg": "I've been Friday everybody another hot video coming at you sorry about last week ever didn't have anything to do so just didn't post the video last week so we got something shipped to us real close ghost pepper blue-raspberry arcane unfortunately it didn't send in an ice bag so some of it kind of got melted together so I kind of had to break it up there's gonna be some big pieces in there just cut it out one today six years after the death it's wonderful Wednesday so there ain't really a challenge to this or anything so I just figure I'm gonna put some of it in my mouth trying to go at least five minutes like everything else you know five minutes video it up again so yeah that's what we're gonna do today next week I do have the FAQ you want chip challenge comment so you guys want to tune in to that next week's video it's gonna be amazing don't want to touch those my hands god forbid of wiping on anything as you can see they I kind of melted together there's supposed to be little peppers I had to break them up gotta melt it together that's like three candies there and there's three candies there so maybe just two these chunks of candy right there see if I can hold on my mouth heat them up five minutes we'll try five minutes that'd be good yeah I kind of smash see there's another one that's the four candies there they didn't get here to melt it together I'll show you one of these kids is small to little baby there's three kinis ahead I'm just gonna pop one one side of pop on the other we gotta start the timer and we're just gonna go five minutes for ghost pepper I thought it was a Carolina Reaper but it's okay about two of them in look at that let's have the bag right there peeps I got a text on the bag I'm gonna take some of it in tomorrow I'll see anybody else want some at least tasted blue raspberries got me one of my favorite flavors of candy gummies pink so yeah we're gonna do this about time they're so good what spinning mouth they're so good I'm not really I don't really know the scope and unity writing these candy like that blue rat thing it's amazing I don't know when it's supposed to be good cop that's six can either there was probably not going to be a good video because they actually taste really good and they're not really that hot five minutes of no problem they are made from the flamethrower company who also makes the vat19 stuff put the raid on time I don't really know the right hand leave my homework trying to throw a video out there guys that working I love these they're not that bad at all it's barely even hot [ __ ] love blue wrapper so I mean there's a little bit of some spice but I mean not really I could you gotta get some heat out of them the most interesting blue raspberry it's amazing the first time no problem no problem I'm probably gonna eat these at work tomorrow no problems pop a little campaign but you definitely warm up once though to for next week's video go to one chip challenge thank you watch it pop you won't get burned or every god that's gonna be a good video because I've watched a lot of people do it gonna be crazy it's kind of like nothing it's blue raspberry there's a little bit of Hiva very little it's just like he ate a jalapeno a little bit I was a scared because it's a ghost member but I think a lot of the shooter in the candies taking out a lot of the heat also like I said earlier don't really know the school rating in that's a pretty good I thought when I opened it and I smelled it I couldn't smell igloo wrapper I thought I was gonna be really hot all right to use video it was no challenge with go to the party actually not bad at all definitely one it's been in next week's video probably gonna be literally crazy that he's gonna be I'm seeing people getting crazy on a fatty yeah there's five minutes I mean really simple it's not all finish these no problem so thank you like subscribe tragic regeneration

Friday do the once it challenge all right", "qoFxagGE7Qs": "Oh [Music]", "jl4FyWwQ_8M": "greetings YouTube today I'm gonna do a little experiment featuring Jolly Ranchers so these are leftover Jolly Ranchers that I bought in bulk and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna boil some water and melt those heart candies into a syrup essentially making a Jolly Rancher drink now I looked up some tutorials but they're not face it common-sense stuff but most people have been melting Jolly Ranchers for their alcohol I would prefer to taste the Jolly Rancher rather than alcohol so I'm just gonna boil some water as you can see and melt the candy in it so that it preserves the flavor come back in 5-10 minutes and see how it goes you gotta use a heat resistance cup I'm just gonna use a glass that's thick enough I'm not going to fill it up to the top as you can see so this what I'm using Jolly Rancher hard candy wild berry I dropped three wild strawberries in there and we will see won't we you by Jove made actually work I don't know very cloudy alright alright so here it is fully dissolved here goes smells good smells like Jolly Rancher while strawberry that's pretty good not bad not bad at all I thought it would be less sweet but it actually has a nice amount of concentration you know much like regular soda which has a lot of sugar the concentration at least you can see through it you know there's some drinks out there where you can't see through it because the sugar levels are so high but this is really good it tastes like John winter so this is an authentic Jolly Rancher drink and this is how they make it at the factory so you can make it at home too if you have some leftover Jolly Ranchers in bulk or whatever cuz you know if you have just one piece of Candy's not enough so yeah three pieces of Jolly Ranchers in 6 ounces of water will give you a nice tasty drink alright and it's an actual Jolly Rancher it would actually be actual Jolly Rancher drink because you're using Jolly Rancher candy alright cool so that's my experiment I know you guys like that's superficial thing at the end where I sign send you off so enjoy take 2 makes me jolly makes me rancher what the Jolly Rancher I do ranch and you're jolly and I guess so make you eat Jolly Ranchers and it makes you a jolly rancher that's what it means it's not the person who actually made the candy right that the name after the person who made the candy who would have been a rancher but he was jolly you know so he makes when you eat it you are the one that's the Jolly Rancher right that's good that's good

ah", "2HP314lGe3Y": "and this is part 2 of part 1 so we did the potato chips and we did the v8 we did the japanese red bowl thing it's with caramel and now you got one more thing reason why I want to separately is because it is a variety of candies so we're going to want to make you guys you know I have to sit there for as long as you really need to if you have something to do and you can't watch the whole video you know last one was pretty long and they need a kind of down so this one is a lot different than the other candies that I had for so this one has you know the other ones were like all these different rom the new flavors I'll just we have different soda flavors this one is like wow so we've got like umeboshi flavor ginger um one of them looks like matcha green tea specifically watch up um I think assassin II flavor and then something else in the corner any of you guys could see it what tell me what well I'm pretty sure those are sesame see it's not that's hard to look but I have no clue what that is um close the thing I can really come up as a red bean paste but that's what it looks like inside and we're going to try any matcha green tea I'm not sure exactly what that says it might even say matcha green tea but I might even say something else something ridiculously close that's what looks like mmm both sides they're hard candies mmm anybody ever had green tea ice cream this is delicious Oh ma'am yeah oh good my tongue likes this it's like green tea ice cream minus the extremely creamy part that's still sweet this is really good I gotta spit it out now okay I'll look even have a poly content of each layer and stuff the mystery one what does that say people might find out right after this I might you'll even more confused but she just like the last one a different color coffee brown sugar tastes like coffee and brown sugar what am i eating it's really good though it tastes like somebody sweeten their coffee with rona sugar that's exactly what it tastes like it's really good mmm two more umeboshi pickled plum yeah I forgot if I mention that to you pickled plum salted plum okay okay so the the little Sesame's are actually in the room I oh she look at that huh do you think of everything don't they mmm you know I'm glad it is a second to last this one's horrible you could days the saltiness I'm with sweetness and you could taste a sesame just slightly amazing with how much how much lesson is in here it certainly takes it very much very well excuse me very well oh I'm disappointed too because that would look so pretty oh that was gross though I almost feel like I need to brush my teeth I guess it's just one of those who all your tastes I like him i boschi though I don't like eating a bowl by like putting them in things that was gross guys I'm sorry look disrespect but that was gross it was really cute mmm okay last but not least a gender yeah it's kind of pretty it's like translucent see my fingers from the other side imagine I've had his a good cough drop as I put it in my mouth no not like a ginger confidence at all you minds me of something I think of I think it's might be pickled ginger does it kind of has that any preserve flavor like if you had the date with you if you eaten ginger and then you've eaten pickled ginger they're pretty different and taste this is like pickled ginger they put in you know sushi

meet my sweet hope you having a good day you been lucky enough to try any of this or anything like that stick in the comments again really into a interested to know what other people's experiences on with them - I mean I'm nailing with vegetables now obviously I do need a slightly higher dosage in mouth but I know also to take a little bit too much whew you can go the other way so you have got be careful [Music] sugaring the more advanced hearsay yeah too much so yeah to explain from last last night's live Bob snake we've got Lana here and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need the pack we're gonna have to have as well what can I say guys Silurian sweets at bloody hour past 10:00 in the morning 114 [ __ ] years old but it's for a good cause Bottoms Up boy bottoms up let's see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that point of view that their portions you don't mean I like the fact they are portion in a way so you can do that I'm still I'm mad I just eat all of them all it won't go basically right long time guys so still on the black cheese but I'm still loving life guys 1190 so please join me peace wonder have a bomb and we'll all get along it's one of those I'll be

make sure comment let me know what you'd like to see upcoming next thank you make sure to subscribe", "GkvKAKLpuqI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen Johns welcome back to the channel today I'm going to be doing another homemade candy recipe I've been having lots of fun making homemade candy and this one is super fun to play with and eat now I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade saltwater taffy so what we're going to be making is a bubble gum this is the one I've got going on right now and we're also going to do birthday cake funfetti and we're going to do cotton candy so like I said I have lots of homemade candy ideas up I'll put the playlist in the description box for you for that now let's get started on this tutorial to make our taffy we're going to be using 1 tablespoon of butter we're going to use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and we need 1/2 of a cup of water it can just be at room temperature we need 1 cup of granulated sugar we need 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to need a quarter to half a teaspoon of sea salt so that's our taffy base now to make it bubblegum flavor we're going to be using a little bit of pink gel paste and one DRAM of bubble gum candy flavoring so I've got a pot here and I've got my corn syrup already in it so you just want to make sure you've got that a nice big pot because the candy will bubble up so I'm going to put all of my ingredients into the pot here and at any point you can turn your heat up to a medium high now when you're making candy probably the most important part is to make sure that you do get it to the proper temperature so I'm going to be using a candy thermometer to do so and what I'm going to be looking for is a temperature put around 255 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm just going to pop in some of my color now and a little bit of the I'm going to drop this whole DRAM in that's what one of these little things is called so I'm putting that all flavoring of that bubblegum in there turning my temperature up and then I'm going to a stir it while I've got it here on the pot and once I've got this all stirred and the butter has melted I'll put my can a thermometer in at that point so once the butter has melted and everything has been mixed together nicely you're going to take your candy thermometer and you just want to set it into the pot and we're going to wait until it gets to 255 degrees that's gonna make nice and chewy toffee and it will still be like like melts in your mouth pretty much you can do it a little bit heart hotter if you want to about 260 to 265 if you want it to be a little bit firmer when the toffee has come to temperature you can remove the thermometer and then down here beside my pot I have a buttered dish here and it's just a cake pan or like a bread pan I'm going to take my hot toffee and I'm going to pour it into my pan and then I'm going to let it cool until I'm able to handle it once the candy has cooled to a temperature that you can handle it just peel it out of your pan and it will should still be a little bit warm because you want to be able to work it and so I'm just gonna move that out of the way so we've got a nice big chunk of taffy here and you can see that the color is still just kind of like that clear look but what we're going to do is we're going to pull it so I'm just pulling it apart and putting it back together so just see we're gonna completely just keep pulling and pulling and pulling for about 15 minutes you get a lovely far forearm workout from this and what this is doing is putting some air into it so we're aerating the candy and the color is going to change and it's going to become a nice kind of like opaque pink so we're just going to pull and Bowl and Bowl until I've got to the it all pulled and you'll also know that when you've reached that kind of like the end that it will be that light color and it will be really difficult for you to pull at that point so when you're done pulling your taffy will be really stiff and it's going to be shiny and a nice light opaque you can see how the color completely changed and then what you want to do is just kind of pull it into a rope or just bite-size like kind of what you want to your bite-size pieces to be and then I'm going to take buttered scissors and I'm we're just going to cut pieces out into whatever size you can roll them up into a ball or whatever shape you want to do whenever you're doing with the taffy you want to make sure that everything is buttered like my gloves are buttered and the scissors are buttered I've just got a piece of wax paper here that I've rolled up and I'm just going to pinch the ends and roll the ends and then that's how you can serve your candy so to make our cotton candy taffy we're going to be using 1 tablespoon of butter we need 1 tablespoon of a corn starch and what I'm going to add in is some of the blue cotton candy and you can just probably go to a cup of it it's totally optional if you can't find it or you can make your own we need 1/2 a cup of water we need 1 cup of granulated sugar 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to be using 1/2 of a teaspoon of sea salt and this is pretty much the same recipe as our taffy base from our bubblegum but to make it the cotton candy we're going to add a little bit of the blue and we're going to add some cotton candy flavoring so we've got a large pot again and I've got the corn syrup already in there and I'm going to take out just the blue you could put in the pink cotton candy as well if you really wanted to I just want to kind of stay with that color theme so I'm gonna pop a little bit of some blue gel paste you could also use regular food coloring if you want some cotton candy flavoring smells deliciously sweet and some of course more sugar what else is cotton candy than sugar and we've got our sea salt and some water and while I've got this mixing you'll see that it just disintegrates like that beautiful color turn up your heat to about medium-high and add everything else in as well and then I'm just going to mix everything together and then pop my candy thermometer in once my butter has melted and I'm going to heat it to 255 Fahrenheit once the candy has come to temperature you can remove the thermometer and I'm just popping it into like a hot water tall vase and then take the candy and you're going to pour it into a buttered bread pan or anything flat you want to make sure that it is heat proof though you don't want to put it into anything plastic because obviously the candy is extremely hot at this point and make sure you don't touch it either so I'm going to let this cool until we can pull it so I've buttered my gloves and I've let the candy cool so I can handle it just using a spatula or a spoon or something you can grab that taffy out of the pan and then all we're going to do again is just pull and stretch it till it comes a nice blue color and we're going to do that for about 15 to 20 minutes once we pulled the taffy completely we can take buttered scissors and cut off our pieces it's super satisfying to cut it the taffy has changed into a beautiful pastel color then you're going to take a piece of wax paper and just put the taffy into the center of it and then taking a small piece of cotton candy I'm using the pink cotton candy now because I want that different color and I'm just going to wrap it up and then serve it with this little piece of cotton candy it's going to add extra flavor and it adds that little extra pop of color as well so just twist the wax paper around and then your taffy is ready to serve so to make our third kind of taffy we're going to be doing funfetti so we're going to need one tablespoon of butter and we're using our standard recipe here for the taffy so we've got 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of water and then I've got some wonderful colorful jimmies here you can use any kind of sprinkles that you want too I've got 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to be using some clear vanilla extract if you want to make it vanilla birthday cake flavor that's what I'm going to be doing to make it that nice cool funfetti and we're going to need 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and we need some sea salt and I've got half a teaspoon so I've got my corn syrup here in my pot and I'm going to take 1 tablespoon of the vanilla extract and I'm going to pour that into there as well turn my temperature up to medium-high and just like with all the other recipes I'm going to add in my ingredients so I've got my sugar there and my sea salt and my water now you can add in coloring like we did for the other varieties if you want to this one I was going to leave with kind of like the vanilla coloring to it and pop in that butter and then just give it a stir and again we're heating it to 255 degrees Fahrenheit once our funfetti taffy has come to temperature I'm going to take my pot pour it into my buttered dish again so get all of that good stuff in there and then I'm going to take my sprinkles and I'm just going to sprinkle them gently on top and you want to do it before the taffy sets and you want to make sure that they're sprinkled on top of here and they'll just like kind of move around and then we're gonna wait again for it to solidify and be able to be handled once the funfetti toffee has cooled we can dig it out with a spatula and then we are going to pretty much mix the sprinkles in at this part at this point and then what we're going to do is it is going to aerate and is going to change color and we'll have a beautiful funfetti color to it we're going to pull it for about 15 minutes once we're finished pulling you'll see it's nice and light and you can see those awesome chunks of sprinkles in there I used the jimmies that I did just because I find that when I'm making cakes with the jimmies that these ones don't run in color and I really definitely didn't want the color to run here I wanted to make sure that we had a regular kind of white look to it so if you're going to wrap these ones up you don't have to wrap the saltwater taffy up but it does kind of add that authentic look to it and I'm just going to add a couple of extra sprinkles into the little package here and then just roll it up with the little wax paper and twist the ends and we've got our saltwater funfetti taffy so I'm gonna be back to tell you what I kind of thought general opinion of all three different flavors so there you go everybody how to make salt water taffy with three different flavors now the cotton candy one was definitely delicious with that additional cotton candy chunk that I put in and the funfetti was my favorite looking one at looks like a birthday cake how fun is that and the bubble gum one I could have taken her leaving it but the bubble gum is always everybody loves bubble gum flavor right so but I would have gone with the funfetti if I could only choose one let me know in the comments which one you think you would like the best and I also want to know which candy do you want me to try making next time I love making the homemade candies so give me a suggestion thanks so much for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys all again next time", "-9em9kqHLDY": "yo what up guys mr. reefer here bringing you another video review on another product today I got these magic pebbles you heard it right magic pebbles they're definitely very magical the reason they're magical is because they are infused with 100 milligrams of THC so you know they're definitely magic anyways today I got you guys this video review of the pebbles because I love these these are these just jumped to the top of my list of edibles that's up there with spot suits drink legal drink there's there's a bunch of other books that I haven't made complete videos for but this is I'm glad I'm doing this now because this is definitely one of the top 5 I would say at least for edibles these are amazing I picked these up yesterday on our daily walk with our dog me and my fiance walk our dog to our pot store and because they love her there so she's kind of famous anyways we've been getting these pre-rolls there and I just haven't had a chance to even buy any other type of like even flour or especially in our edibles so I'm glad I picked these up picked them up for 25 bucks so we got ten pieces of ten milligrams equaling a hundred milligrams of THC so each individual serving is Timnath two milligrams and I gotta say these work fast like stupid fast like it took us it takes us half an hour to walk to and from the pot store so hat we ate one outside you know we're not supposed to obviously but we ate one each outside while we were walking here before we start walking here from the pot store tip to our home and it took us I want to say like 25 to 30 minutes to get home and by the time we were home we were just [ __ ] the lid like we were ready to just have a good time and we ended up actually going to the pool afterwards our apartments which was actually pretty nice because I took another another one of these magic pebbles and while I was at the pool and we were just gone just terribly gone we're just there this I couldn't believe how fast and how hard these actually hit me don't get me wrong they're not gonna knock you on your ass it's not strong like that but it was strong to where I felt it immediately after like 30 minutes which for me is good because I mean for anybody is good why would you want to wait any longer for your high right but I feel like with me it'll both usually take up to like an hour something like that from what I noticed forty minutes to like an hour but never as fast as these and these were amazing they taste these I got these blue raspberry ones that actually taste like the little lollipops you get from you know your your doctor or your barber or whatever you know just have like a bow out of out there and the front by the desk and you just like take one at the bank you know those little lollipops little dum-dums it tastes just like that this blue raspberry but I have I'll show this right quick so if you wanna if you feel like you're reading through all through all this you can just pause it actually have I will read part of this they actually describe how they do the cannabis extraction for the edibles on here I says the cannabis extract is uh I can't even talk right now I'm so high about to eat another one by the way but anyways it says right here it's extracted using BHO i winterize with ethanol and then it's distilled leaving no residual solvents so they say they grow with passion and extract with position so it's just a magical experience and it really is I really do enjoy these and these taste so amazing and they look I mean they just looked like candy you know I had to open one because it is trouble with the wrapper I do have trouble with the wrapper I do have to use two hands and since I am recording this I need one hand so I just had to pre open it man these are these are amazing they and let me just show them the light here of the Sun my baby like and you can see the blue where these don't taste don't have an overwhelming taste of THC it tastes just it there's like small hints or whatever but it's not actual it isn't it doesn't over overwhelm and that's what that's what I really like about this and edible because I love weed but I do not love though we taste and it and most of the most like there's some dry like brownies out there that just tastes like straight up ass I'm not for that these are so much better so I would definitely recommend getting these blue raspberry good flavor just go ahead and start eating that but yeah my review are you afraid oh sorry I'm just trying to the flavor I can't describe it's just like a small hint of like marijuana but the rest is just blueberry just straight-up and they're pretty good so yeah I love these definitely gonna be picking up some more 2010 425 it's not a bad deal yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video because I'm about to enjoy this candy Almighty really another one I check these guys out man magic kitchen they were in the Southeast Washington area I Northwest Washington area I don't know I said southeast give these guys to try magic kitchen they got pebbles I think they carry there's different types of flavors for sure they got like pineapple

yeah that's it for this video man I'm gonna go roller joint finish this edible and then get high some more alright guys see you guys later stay lifted lift it is for", "YfvV3eknOA4": "these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended he pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimeters long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L & O of B and E a why oh and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops", "1zZV8VnNShI": "okay fellow youtubers this is DM Blair wolf and today's video is gonna be on this tiny little green lollipop well I was at the Harrisburg East Mall yesterday and a friend of mine Ted owns the supplemental store east coast supplements in there and he got these they're called chronic Tandy what it is is it's got ten milligrams of CBD and it has o G cush terpenes in it so it's an all-around wellness candy okay but as small as it is in this little city CBD it has in it I think it might be more geared towards like little kids maybe for like seizures or or a DD or even just wellness in some way because ten milligrams isn't a lot for an adult I would think cuz I personally need it probably the whole case of pops to be okay because I think it comes with like twenty or so in a case so I would probably need two or three hundred milligrams of this stuff but we're gonna open it up we're gonna try it out and see what it tastes like and see if we can get any you wouldn't get any wellness out of it okay so just give me a moment I'll rip this sucker open and we'll see what's in it cheers pop first off Wow I smells like an OG plant rate right allogram holy moly doesn't seem to be any low chunkies or anything yet so I guess it's just straight candy that's like flavor right off that's like you stuck the whole plant right in your mouth holy moly [Music] it tastes good yeah yeah I think it tastes great there's definitely terpenes in it you can taste them right off the candy itself has room it was sort of a like a sweet flavor to it I don't know if it's my imagination but I feel something well I was gonna get to that I actually even though it's only 10 milligrams I definitely feel calmer and that was just a little lick that I did well or someone who doesn't ingest or take CBD in a lot the sights a little bit could probably be you know you'll probably be beneficial do you like calming or making you are relaxed be another thing like your kids run around the house bouncing off the walls like a Gibbon throwing Legos everywhere you've been one of these little pops be like your kid you know son daughter child have a lollipop it's definitely appeasing in flavor I mean like the more I eat it the more I want to eat it I mean totally is when I was a kid I probably just want to ask for another that like definitely is like peanuts chronic candy is that it definitely has a a sense of appeal in its flavor okay like I can say that like if I were to take like marijuana or so forth and put it in my mouth I would be like this definitely has flavor and I could say that when you do it if you don't continuously lick it it goes away like I felt something but now because I ain't continuously doing it yeah it's not doing anything anymore yeah you probably have to ingest a whole pot like it's supposed to be one dose but one does for who wonder what type of people would benefit from this like I said like maybe like people with seizures because CBD supposed to be great for seizures and focusing concentrating relaxation just watch them move like children it's a pop yeah ten milligrams I feel it but I don't think it'll last long not for me cuz I'm you know kids like fifth my size it'd probably be like hey I'm ready to watch Sesame Street hey bring on the spongebob I'm ready for cartoons is it snack time yet so let's go through our daily thing here first we'll say that one one two five one being and five being presentation what it looks like what definitely looks appealing ain't a person in the world unlike a pop so due to four and a half it was a little bit bigger around maybe a five because then it'd be more appealing flavor would it taste like right off the bat man it's like you put the whole plant in your mouth so I give this sucker a five color I'm not so big on the color could have been yellow like a lemon maybe put some kind of flavor in it just not just strength terpenes in the CBD but you definitely know it's in there effectiveness I feel it I don't feel it like like when I used like the flowery products like the CBD blunt or the bubble bag hash and that's a BAM in your face you're you know I'm medicated this is just an underlining feeling that definitely is calming and medically it's good so those three things combined and the price is nice um I was giving this one for free to try it but if I remember correctly on the box here were like two bucks apiece I think I think there was like 10 or 20 in the box and he had like two or three more boxes you could just maybe buy a whole box for 20 bucks or something it's probably gonna be a big deal especially for since I work here at that new Nannan it's [ __ ] stressful working in there sometimes cuz there's definitely a cultural gap so being able to calm down and being able to focus yeah I'm sterile these are your mouth at work no probably never know I know so if you have any questions or comments if you've tried these before or you know a different flavor or a different company or a place where you can Vicki's wholesale or even ones that are stronger 20 I think a 50 milligram one of these would definitely be more adult in a in a in a dose cuz I know when you buy just like the hemp bombs those pills are like three pills for 60 milligrams total you take all three of them pills you know you took them so if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them down below thumbs up like subscribe comment comment comment meanwhile while you're commenting I'm gonna finish this lollipop so till next time guys have a great calming relaxing medicated day", "seNQ8rexqKM": "[Music] untamed fruit flavor Jolly Rancher [Music]", "kmhKbpFIVqw": "hey

"J6U1PGdUAZo": "hey this is Cathy from Cathy cooks for you and welcome back to my kitchen and welcome to my dear friend Margaret thank you it's wonderful to be here I'm so excited I'm so glad you're here and I'm so glad that she texted me about three weeks ago asking if I'd ever made hurricane e and you want to give it away as gifts this year correct yes for Christmas gifts for friends and family well hopefully don't watch this [Applause] [Music] all right so our ingredients are very simple sugar Karo syrup water and then you can buy these little things they're called a dram it's little things are flavoring online or at a craft store or I've even seen them at some big-box stores so I'm gonna let you start stirring now getting this to the hard crack stage which takes the directions say about 20 minutes it can take longer depends on what if you've used a gas or electric you know gas is really gonna get you a lot higher than feet quicker so it just matters so we are just going to do this process let it get to a hard crack stage the directions say to 300 degrees so we have a candy thermometer here the market are up and we're just going to put this on the edge in hard crack stage you need some ice water and what you're going to do is you're going to test it so you're just going to dip the spoon in and drizzle it in your cold water and then that candy in there you should be able to pick it up and you just crack and you know you'll see that when we do it sometimes [Music] crunchy [Music] now we wait again but it didn't take 20 minutes the recipe said 20 minutes but I don't think that was 20 minutes - you don't think so no and then so now we're kind of deceptive wait and for it to start to cool so eventually you kind of just touch it every now and then because now the hard part is we have to pick it up and handle it but make sure you have your DRAM bottle open so that you can pour that in really quick because those are really hard to get open to see what's awesome so I edited that part out but I'll tell you now okay we're getting there let me see if I can pick up an edge okay so I can pick up an edge so can I have a pair of scissors and let's see let's see if I can get it's a little not ready yet it's kind of ready and sometimes that you know you're just you don't work fast enough and you're just gonna have to crack it and that's okay you just crack it and put it in the powdered sugar and no one's gonna say this piece of it have cute edges they're just gonna be so thrilled that you made them something from scratch especially hard candy everybody does cookies right margaret's right Margaret is thinking outside the box and can impress everybody with this well I'm glad to buy or get it oh this is thick stuff over here yeah make sure before you even start to have a level surface that way you won't have these really thick pieces you almost need safety goggles yeah kitchen scissors yeah pieces are flying I'm serious some goggles may be necessary [Music] okay we're all cooled off now we're going to put the candy in the colander just get rid of all that extra powdered sugar and we're just going to shake it up and then we're going to put in our cute jars we got to try it thank you oh the Sharpie is amazing crunchy would you guys we got crunchy you hear the crunch that's what you want the crunch and that's how you make it now make sure you don't burn your sugar you do not leave the mixture on the stove you don't walk away and go and do the dishes and you stay there the entire time and you keep checking earth did not get the 300 degrees it got to the hard crack stage before 300 degrees thank you so much for watching Thank You Margaret for coming there you Cathy it was awesome and so do you think that you could have done this without being taught how is it easier being shown how than just reading it it was absolutely you walk me through these steps but now I do feel confident that I can go make some other flavors and I'll add that to my jar yes and so we'll have a variety for finally finishes project yes awesome so thank you so much and check out all my other episodes I'm Cathy cooks for you on YouTube or Cathy cooks be calm Thanks Thank You Margaret [Music] you", "oklheGf1QoI": "hi Scott hey guys today we're going to review a little foxes glacier licorice good stuff really good stuff delicious tasty has a real nice juicy flavor that comes through a little sticky I had this one for a while I've been waiting to do this review very sticky it's great i mean the flavor here is fantastic right now it has good gooey outer coating but it gets to a very very hard candy it's not like an like a normal licorice is this this deep anise flavor is nice tasty not too salty not to sourish licorice flavor but has like a berry not a fruity berry but just this like this maybe it isn't fruity better Barry but this flavor that comes through at the end that is just it is outright delightful it's just delicious there is a big big problem with this candy I mean I want to stress it again this candy is great tasting I love this now at this point I could say something like I could eat this all day but the fact of the matter is is if you suck on it you have to eat it all day it lasts forever and it's just a little too big I'm going to be slightly disgusting right now it hasn't changed it's the second sighs and it's too big to sit in your mouth was talking with Johnny about it and we're talking about jolly rancher which we really like and jolly ranchers a flit a candy that's kind of the same size it kind of last as long but you can keep it in your mouth it's a fruity tangy flavor this is still licorice I can literally I think it would take me about a half an hour to suck through one of these and it's just too long it's so long that it actually makes this a candy that I haven't eaten too much had about three of these is probably my fourth and again I will go back it is delicious it is a great taste in candy it just takes way way way too long to get through it this point you figured it was shrink I don't feel like it's gained mass in my mouth it's been tough for me it's been tough to enjoy this candy in your playroom that's their train table I will give this a wow I almost want to give it two different two different our ratings so i would give it a nine or a ten even almost for flavor it is really great but i am not eating these candies and that is are indicative of candy I don't like so I i have to say kind of don't like this candy I'm gonna give it a six all around because it just takes too long to get through it but definitely go out and try and another thing thing that I really think that uh the people of our foxes could not could do if you guys meet this candy in a little Tim much smaller like little wafers I need these all day long but item separately I'd take a little break can't take a break with this one ten about that big at high 30 of them in there do it Scotty Candy Girls be good eat that candy you", "mQoEVg6V5hw": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'll be reviewing my Dunlop's I already actually ever took them out on the box but um every bit to you so I'm gonna review it and in the back I asked them to leave their display but that's okay and the other the lies have them the pack here or you might feel like when they're back they have fun this cool like things section that you can collect and that's the one that I have is hard candies they have hard candies um marshmallows what's this I don't know what's like a missus glazed donuts and Brittany's fresh fruit so I'm trying to take them out okay so we got our mom's behalf like this template here oops and the behind the top plate when I buy it they actually have fun hidden it snap a serious tree and a serious one money and looks like that people took a bottle the collectors fun and I real the template the template they have like this cool looking like designs it says wasabi miss so happy Oh leaves peppers and all in peppers and olives young peas are young banana save room for dessert cupcake ice cream with what you know just roll with it I'm sweet say cheese [Music] acai berry' there's like so many writings here does no one around spelling my god this in here so first character here just this very squishy and I buy this like six letters papers here there's a secret message I don't know put this in there but I promise that never explode a thicker message like that oh my gosh what's the secret message Dini I don't know about that but we have is really really cool so we have three num noms down here and it looks really gorgeous see all the gorgeous I don't think you can really see that but there's a few tools that we have for the bowl and we have a scooper and it was like a poopy scooper it says nothing else at the top I'm gonna show you that hope you can see that normal writing there like at the top of the spoon handle yep it's right there the bowl is really clear and they also say num noms in the middle there I believe you can see that I guess American school okay so I'm gonna show you each of their names so first looks like we've got Gabby gray she smells like grape and I believe she's like the peppermint candy but she doesn't smells like pepper Muriel's who knows she didn't smell something my committee but she smells like grape and I really love they really still like me I just got them they still hold the smell even though I bought us like two years ago and just good next we have curtain II kami she smells like great honestly wait no I mean she smells like cotton candy it smells really good but she had this pink and blue color it looks like she has purple and blue but I promise it smells this one is pink not purple love me a mango she has a stronger smell than anybody else how do one I have the lamest smell at the least male the least smell is this one I can really smell the cotton candy you only smell them a little bit but this wasn't really still like hope their scent I really loved that and yeah and then of course we got our stamp it get in there okay so this is the stamp and this is the thing here to stamp it it's a little bit squishy now butter it's not sticky it feels like a little rubbery and solid thing there and we got the lid here and then they show you what this my mom's thing what the ship is gonna be it's also said that it sounds like melon and this is it smells this one's even stronger than this one so I should we do want to have a lamest not because it's imposing whereas plastic rubber and plastic but this I still have the labels now that's really weird and where's how to step in here tail and the tail was a little too squishy and feels like gummy you guys should totally feel this if you have these let's see what this one this this one the bottom of the NAM I mean not this one didn't fit the nominee they're not gonna fit on the coordinate candy her name hardly candy right um this is me I mingle but I believe they don't feel this looks like a little harder than our usual then the usual numbness this feels a little bit softer and squishier show you my Gabby gray yeah burger grab room Gabby grape has the most softest and squish here squishiest and let's see if this thing does mom do actually fit do me a mango oops [Music] fit in there I think so and it does fit so if something is soft like this they don't fit the coordinate candy because Courtney candy is like one heart nom nom and let's see if it fits Gabby gray this one she the norm should fit the Gabby gray was it really hard no it should fit but I guess I guess my hands not working yet yep it does but because you don't know pulling gosh it's a little tricky to put it on but it should fit yep I think it did it did fit closer look up Gabby great Courtney candy Luke's just um just her tongue sticking out plus let's see if I can you smile camera to make it just make if you can see the tossing some time I came out don't really you so very sorry about that in this meow mango because I'm using soon I don't use camera she looks really gorgeous there and then let's see if you can stack them I just wanted just want to see and in the guy be grape here I was going to start corny candy see if I can suck them I think I did wait I'm gonna put her [Music] very cool okay so now I'm just going to tidy my set I really love the packaging it just looks really cool and I feels like I just feel a little bad I just throw them so I'm just going to cheat them for the rest of my life alone now okay so this is my number you saw the box looks really cool and I feel like I want to eat them I love candies but I'm allergic to marshmallows so I don't think that I would really want to buy these okay so if you're gonna store you have these small

think I'd be like 527 degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit I mean it was 310 or it's hot it does some pretty huh we bit liquid candy that's what it looks like if you ever wondered what liquid candy looked like now's your chance that's it like it wouldn't be that tasty right now probably taste okay but I don't know if you'd be able to taste it cuz I probably burn your taste buds oh well you can't take it to the hospital till we're doing salt so we ask you to refrain yeah finding out okay you don't to rush anything either how old's at Copper Kettle oh yeah I think everything down here is I know number on it Steve spearmint how much you write down how much is your secret recipes piles yep he's out of here let's see well he didn't write it down you've been doing the writing tournament a tivo match Zak top secret information and showing everybody yeah I named the last video recipe because I I know that nobody's gonna take the recipe actually try it unless they're crazy enough to try it but hey we give them the recipe if they want to do it fries at home and you know just make a video show us twelve pounds is three quarters so okay Benny is give me one one full shot one shot one shot okay with you shots down here yeah as the vapors rise enough yes it's not quite as office what is it again Fermo caramel still smells really good though the kind of friendlier meant hmm I think I actually mean like it more than I've ever met Wow my favorite spot those dope headers newer they just extra shiny extra Shockey they're definitely not no it was awesome bought a new Joe cutter in quite some time oh I don't know if I'm worth it I want new butter knives just a whole the whole thing mushrooms for you so the last video made a lot of people had questions about aha why Marvel table and then we have a metal table over here so what's the reason for both of those things this is used for candy making so it conducts the deep better and fewer hot spots so more evenly spread eat yes like it'll cool it down but not too fast I cool it down slow enough right okay right that sounds good but if you're down the metal at high slow down really fast right um them at the metal really is just a counter yeah so you wouldn't I mean if you had like a metal table unless it was like one of those steel-jacketed yeah that's team jacket whatever alright cool donkey yeah what people will have marble counters but that's not really that's not really candy making time yeah that's just a counter a counters how much would like a huge slab of marble like this go for today not like back in the 50s when it was taken down somebody actually just gave us a slab of marble um oh no we gave her some candy but she hid this slab of marble is by half the size of this steep would you say what's the invasion okay just all bomber Wilson was getting rid of it it was an on top of like a buffet table type of thing is she she put on Craigslist for free nobody took it so she thought hey I'll call some candy makers so you're dead and bred and went over there nature of her we're gonna use a play not sure but he want to say no on that later on wishes bad yes yeah but I haven't not needed the need not have it cuz like we could get rid of it for lunch then you just feel dumb exactly never tired and dumb figure something maybe we could just make a tiny island in the kitchen you know it's good for rolling out pie crusts and kneading bread dough are you know stubbing your toe in the middle the night and the way the bathroom till if you like up to the extract that's gonna be very yeah but there's got to be legs this can't be like a floating marble table mmm you're right I mean I don't know why she would give him that away for free heavy patenting that I'd be something like Harry Potter was I was watching It's Always Sunny before I came down and Charlie just he found he found something that he thought was cool that somebody already made and is it God we got a patent this I don't know if you know Pat it's work clearly because you can't do that you can't patent something turn it I bought this the patent it sounds like he used to get himself a 3d printer yeah you can start patenting things like 3d printer mm-hmm buy it patent it I'll never see it coming that's how you do them mmm are you beating it like that I'm doing my best to keep the color inside it's not going to work I guarantee I will make a mess I'm trying to not to trying to not to trying to not to make a mess God do not to make a mess it won't work as you can see mm-hmm that's gonna pretty good job over here huh yeah because the clear stop doesn't leak out I'm good all over the marble countertop mom come on don't worry I don't worry we got a backup I have a special solution I used the glue the color from here it's called h2o yeah works like a charm it's your patent oh that's a good idea the hydrant oxygen ratio just right are you doing okay quickly because it's hot nope oh I just like to do things kind of quickly to see scores that will be done quicker be done more quickly more quickly or even even dad what's your technique right now waiting he's excellent that yeah so tell me what are you looking for for the droop test dad it doesn't go too fast you gotta go slower lymphocytes going too slow then what happens then it's too cool get a start over then you're in trouble my guns are really popping in this shot oh I should have worn a tank top sun's out guns out Suns away guns out that's how it goes right sun's out guns out sunsetting no guns out nope gun show's over folks there's nothing to see here we'll have to have you flex buy that by the end of this video okay if you insist candymaker guns should have one take down yeah biggest regret it you really owe your wife no you just regret of your wife okay I'm gonna go in front of the heater if nobody objects all right okay see ya the candy eater your mom's a rubble yeah confectionery rubble that's up close and personal other bubbles the blob it's still hot a little burn yet the clicker probably would I can't touch it because you know we're good idea also you know health code violations and whatnot that kind of thing you have to go to the hospital and you don't have time for that now ain't nobody got time for that got time for that not about that life you are pretty hit by marca oh I am Bobby did this last time you better come up with new new shapes the double candy cane it's a heart okay that's what it's both it's like those optical illusions where you can see wherever you like a butterfly clover I can't get any of these samurais like a new charades that she's rock candy sure he ups candy blob it's a stick oh I'm like oh this is the interesting part right here now the candy hammer that candy making only but wait there's more candy only for candy honey well I want something to use it for something else you try anything on the handle hands off hmm stand on the other ten my stripe anyway okay I got both you guys in the shot hashtag artsy mom what are you looking at so inquisitively the camera just to make some numbers all security cameras they crash a lot really well the cameras don't crash software on a tablet crash numbers are still moving so you change your technique like partway through just when it gets more droopy just loss to her to talk well you do that sometimes a wax yeah that means to get whacked you've been talking too much stuck that just ready up on yep this is fun was it good shot convincing I'm look like you're having fun - yeah this takes a lot of concentration I get to tap it again please hold on now it's a nice set me white you got one there my same closes hair yeah almost it's even worse that needle where you talk about his hair or the candy the candy don't make me laugh too much I'll drop it near whack can you catch it you're whack yeah it's ready to come off it's a big old pile of candy you have a method dear madness then punch it and roll it punch it roll it rotate it punch it rolling bread rotate punch it roll it okay that's too much thinking thank you that no mom Oh strike Oh soon to be to where you get something like that look at that those broke where'd you get another pair to the store dough the next set of the toilet store actually I don't know it I know where we go Steve I don't know there's not even a name out here never looked for him so then used to print name done stuff way back one no they stick out like a giant there yeah these just to be hair cutting scissors yeah yeah don't worry we back in the day oh I didn't want no I think I watched whose head your car Giants Hagrid yes it's really a half-time juster somewhere I guess you'd probably even bigger scissors if it was real John first yeah giant scissors I would then I might try I'm like a restaurant supply yeah or I could Google of candy-making scissors or I could call another candy maker mm-hmm that's done you know I YouTube like other ribbon candy videos and like candy cane videos and they pretty much just like they do every most of everything just the same up until this point and then they just once they pull that out they just feed it into like a machine they don't they don't have another person hooking it manually oh the same thing with ribbon candy they have up yeah yeah yeah just put it through machine so can you tell all the folks at home exactly what you're doing when you're well the first thing I'm doing here and trying to make a first couple other kind of ugly yep this point has to be this point pointing in and then we might give it another little twist into the barbershop whole thing go in there and straighten it out Oh golly not all usually apron came untied perfect I try to keep a perfect cane here so that I can kind of gauge his are getting too big or too little and don't let them know that's my perfect cane so that side and that side to both both corners and basically pointing it and that's just so it doesn't do the packaging yeah any other reasons no I want to make them look uniform ish yeah I just try to do things the same way anytime and then maybe they look the same if I'm super lucky you're super lucky this is a little bit more forgiving than ribbon candy yeah buy a little eating a lot right yeah I do there is no wiggle room with the ribbon candy unless you have a machine which we don't huh yeah do you what's your name Terry or some people call her Terry the Machine Andrews rihanna's all ice cream mom oh yeah I call you Terry the Machine Andrea knows all the time hey ter the machine and Rianna's how cool I was work today TMA that's our initials please to be my thumb to the mole or anything else you guys want people to know about candy canes wish I'd made my stripes a little bit smaller I think that when I get towards the end of the batch we're going to get some bonding yeah what's your favorite candy to make we have one what a great answer that doesn't have a favorite anything I said you like the NFL or a college football better and he said he can't pick and I said what's your favorite NFL team and he said well I like a lot of them he likes the Giants the Patriots in the bills and I said which one's your favorite said well I don't know they're all good and most of the time when they're whenever even like in the Super Bowl I asked him which team you want twenty says well I don't know I just want to see a good game that's dad did you want to tell people what you're doing exactly over here dad well I'm keeping enough keeping it nice and warm in front of the heater and then shining up with my gloves patent clubs shiny keep a nice triangle shape they go so they will stay a good soft temperature like over here it's not very shiny and then as it goes down as you rub your gloves long it definitely gets a lot shinier yep nothing but a glove over so just rotating it and rubbing it you hope that's the life the life of a candy maker the Billabong Steve you just got to keep adjusting it I get shorter or longer thicker yeah later your mom told me if I'm making a little too much never mind said goes and then the peanuts just hold them up know what the peanuts just hold up",

more videos and reviews and interviews and such", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "_A-UYOhjjVo": "hey hi how are you I'm

branches special treasures golden butter toffee sounds rich here's the wrapper it might be dark but let's give this a try but yeah this is rich you all think a little bit more cuz that's what i do when i do can you use so they know what it looks like okay mmm this thing is sure rich hang on i'm just uploading the warmness lifting up the thing i used to film i seen give that away yet but wow this definitely is a good toffee you toffee is really addictive hmm the right amount of sugar and butter combined to make dis rich treat I have to give this a 10 out of 10 for sure alright it's time to review the second one I've been done with the first one so this is wretches butterscotch candy hard candy sounds really good actually one of the best most rich hard candies I've ever tasted it's basically a low-quality toffee there's like no butter or dairy in it it's just flavored it's just like it's like you know a dum-dum sucker that's like top I mean like toffee or butterscotch flavor dumb sucker it pretty much taste like that except this actually tastes better than one about to try this not bad but the toffee is a lot better dub the top is a lot richer creamier buttery versus a second candy that's basically sugar in the form of candy flavored with butterscotch hmm I'll give this a 9 out of 10 not bad but not the best mmm oh look at the time I um got to go see you my next review good night", "MTIKA7N-UAU": "okay what is those guys we're back at the murder rate or four of 380 video and today I'm trying sour Jolly Ranchers and as you can see I have one in my mouth right

everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "N1apCzxOBZU": "everybody just having some Jolly Ranchers hard candy they're good bad for your teeth but they taste awesome

i'm built like that i feel different so okay so keep making me a little sweaty though i forgot how painful this was it's okay i'm okay it's spicy but it's not like too much where i can't handle it okay now it's like kind of hot because like they're almost gone well maybe we should incorporate something else like a little game in the mix it may be a would you rather go ahead i should download the app don't make i don't know what i just said why is it hurt nobody take one too hmm but i'm gonna have the spinner design i'm a little light-headed i'm gonna have the spinner decide which one i'm taking what am i supposed to do about it you signed up for your [ __ ] look i'm i'm taking this the hottest one because what i did was not enough so it wasn't because those aren't hot and apparently it got spicy it does it doesn't it does you literally you literally even said that the more you suck on it the spicier it gets yeah get that spicy it still got spicy i didn't say it was that i didn't say it was the spiciest [ __ ] in the world i just said no you don't have to you don't have to no because he thinks it's so spicy well because i'm about to take the same one you're taking and i also did mine and you you put style on your first one so that's what i was just saying cause it's nasty not spicy okay i still finished it anyways i'm taking this these gross things okay sure anyways i'm

like i want to eat some normal bowls yeah because you if you eat them all at once it tastes like [ __ ] but if you eat them one at a time they taste good as far as this on uh the the reaper on the scale of one to ten i mean they pretty much tell you that [ __ ] is hot as [ __ ] so definitely definitely up there i think that's it we might film a little reaction video after this but as far as
