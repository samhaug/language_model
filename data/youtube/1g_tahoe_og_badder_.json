{"jXVwff5Qre4": "hey youtube what's up alex here back again with another quick video and this time we have something that i haven't had in a while on this channel which is some calypso and i forgot to mention calypso is a very good brand i did not brand i didn't mention it uh there's a few brands i had didn't mention rhythm calypso that are excellent brands cresco's good pretty much this is sums it up i like almost everything i get from ryzeri almost all products all brands are pretty good the only brand i really take issue with is g leaf on their cured products because it's pretty low quality stuff but the price would the price would explain that it being only 60 dollars a gram the cheapest of all the waxes you could get i mean terrapin is 55 but terrapin's even better than g leaf in my opinion just my opinion you know people have their own some people like g leaf the ones that i've seen to always get were kind of funky tasting but aside from that i forgot to mention calypso on my last video they are very good quality stuff this gram was eighty dollars for the gram which is red on par with rhythms rhythm is also eighty dollars a gram tahoe og it's like 88 percent thc each of that zoom in there okay let's get it open i haven't had this one yet and i have i did have tahoe og and moxie from an llr liquid live resin cartridge but i never had i don't think tahoe og and any other brands that i could think of but uh so without further ado let's get it open it's got this little they got this little sticker that they seal their bottom with here that's sometimes hard to get off it's a little sticker right here on the bottom there we go and then it pops right up they got the little square jars with the clear bottoms tahoe og sugar it's always good to check your orders because when i did uh come out of ryze they accidentally gave me the tahoe og butter instead of the sugar and i had to go back in and exchange it and get the sugar because the sugar is 88 thc and the butter was only 73. mmm smells nice there it is it is a sugar tahoe oh g by calypso live sugar this is alive so it's gonna have lots of flavor bursting out of it well let's get a dab of this sugar and i'll let you know it's hard that's nice let's get a dab on my tool here that's a nice big dab of this tahoe og on there nice size dab it's sugar so you gotta remember it's it's more dense than a crumble or batter i even think is more dense than the batter so let's get this heated up let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section i heat this rig up and uh i said let me know what you guys are smoking on do a dab of this my puffco is charging right now so i don't really want to i'll wait till later i'll let you know what it tastes like in the puffco down in the descriptions i'll just do a few dabs with you guys here for this tahoe og let me see what the uh the top terpene is looks like it's bmercine at 1.4 then carpotholine carpilline 1.03 yeah lima lean 1.1 i always look look for the lima lean myself i like uh that nice lemony kind of taste so i try to always find the ones with the high limolene or pianine peony whatever you know one of those uh i try to stay away from the high mercine unless it's got lots of other like if it's got a lot of peony in it a lot of limo lean and then it's got a lot of mercy and it's not but if it's just mercing for some reason and not enough nothing of the other stuff it seems like it tastes kind of weird funky earthy taste that i don't like so i try to grab the waxes that have high lima lean or peony or something like that it's all preference you guys know it's whatever you guys like whatever makes you feel good whatever brands you know there's so many brands out there now and ryze right now has a huge selection of dabs waxes sugars butters they got a lot in there cheers tahoe og sugar yeah nice very nice taste very good taste as you can see that was a big cloud really smooth a little cough but not too bad it's kind of smooth got a nice taste to it they said calypso is they're pretty good i like calypso i like rhythm i like cresco i like them all i even like uh there was one other g leaf that was good it was uh orange cookies i had that i thought was was good i liked it a lot but usually you gotta stick with the live for the flavor you want you know really good flavor the live concentrates have the better flavor over the dry it seems like but the dry so like primes dry resin dry stuff is really good um yeah it's all preference though guys you guys know that whatever you guys like this is good though i like this i'm gonna do another dab you see we got seven minutes oh maybe i won't i don't want to make the video too long so yeah that is it tahoe oh g sugar by calypso give you another look at the box tahoe og sugar by calypso yeah i would have to say it's a thumbs up for me guys the smell is great the taste tasted great 88 percent i'll probably do another dab or two here off of camera another dab i'll throw that one on there oh might as well do it what the heck we'll make the video a little longer i'll do this another dab with you guys hang in there guys we're doing another dab tahoe og we'll do another one they say it's best to keep the videos under eight minutes because people don't really want to watch long videos but what the hell this one's eight minutes we're gonna go a little over eight minutes try to keep them around ten minutes we'll do another dab and uh of this tahoe og by calypso yeah it's pretty good man i forgot to mention calypso yeah they're good man i even had their car they're live resin cartridges are really good too i wouldn't say their distillate is good but their live resin is really good all right let me set my timer here 45 seconds yeah tahoe og live sugar yeah this is nice i said i had it moxie i had a tahoe og live resin cartridge before and that was pretty good too but i think this is the first time i've actually had the dabs of some tahoe oh g pretty good said let me know what you guys are dabbing on let me know what you guys got from from rise this uh i'm assuming arise because there ain't too many other dispensaries in pennsylvania well there is probably liberty down there near philly i think there's other ones but the ones only we only got rise up here in erie pa cheers tahoe og big hit cloud i hate to blow it right at my camera but if i don't you guys don't get to see them nice big clouds tastes good and as you can see that big of a hit not very much cough it's really smooth this tahoe og is very nice thumbs up i'm gonna wrap this up very nice flavor and uh yeah let me like i said give me a like subscribe if you're not subscribed uh hit the bell notification and you will get the uh notified when i do uh upload new videos and you guys have a good one and i will see you guys on the next one", "WODZqdJiE-I": "you Tahoe's really tahoe algae and it's another one that algae mixes it's uh that's they'll keep taking OG is the mother and I'll put different fathers with it and the Tahoe G makes somebody done Obama's Tahoe G is pure indigo it's pretty good when you don't like it myself

you're on your P's and keys if you're not it goes down significantly [Music] pros of Tahoe G as you can sell it anywhere it goes it's got a great bag appeal it's a good weed killer TAC ratio it's become one of these top-shelf brands that all the clubs down here have to have or they can't play con is it's a pain that has to grow it takes a broader room it's a little slower and you have to really be on your thing you could lose a crop fast with it and it doesn't all mature at the same time this is one of the ones it's very ethnically dominant you want to harvest it tip down [Music] you", "ENA1aOvK3Lk": "it's going on YouTube first off I like to thank God for allowing me to embark on this endeavor here in Denver Colorado in today's episode we have a stream review and it's from kind love and it is bumper for Tahoe og now this to me I feel there's a steeple I really should have done this video a long time ago but you know I really didn't find the Tahoe G that I really wanted review and so I found this one shout out to kind of for making a fine product without further ado let's go ahead and check out these buds don't burn up on a bamboo mat from stop them from a nap that I've done a bit above boom from Tahoe G know if you know anything about these buds you know it is some way go something that will get your head hot definitely will take away that appetite I mean if you're a [ __ ] like I can't eat I can't eat well it'll definitely make you [ __ ] eat so much it you will definitely have an appetite this is also a touch lock it's definitely one that does have that like a full-body sensation I really do like the feeling of it it's very strong I've actually been smoking this all day it's definitely one that I wouldn't recommend for all day but I did decide to do it all day because um it's one of those days where I had a you know really nothing to do so I decided to just to go ahead and you know test it out the full way you know see if I could get any other type of experiences but to be honest with you it's been it's been a great high except for the fact that right now now later on in the day it's later on in the day I feel a little bit tired but if you look at these buds they actually look like like it to be honest to me it looks like they they dip them like if it's caviar or something I mean they're very very shiny in fact I mean like I always say the camera never does it justice I mean you were here you could definitely tell that these are very kicked up caked up buds although these buds look small there were bigger buds in there it's just the bud tender was just grabbing whatever you wanted usually I tell them you know if I can get me notice all big bud and you know do that for me but this time I was just so excited a you know just to go back into Cana they had so many nice trains I just wanted to check them all out that he already had a bag Deb pardon me even uh you know not even knowing it you know but a shout to kind of I mean they're doing their thing this one is one that I feel is like my perfect like night time if I feel like I can't go to sleep this is one that I'm picking up for sure it has a very pungent smell the first aroma I like to you know automatically is like a very very very sour lemon its pungent I mean it's less about break one up and see if we can zoom real quick and see if we can see a little bit of inside oh it's even lighter growing in size pretty cool right open anymore now you can see my finger you could tell this thing is take it smell it one more time nothing but lemon a little bit of lime and lime peel very sour sour enough to make you like salivate your mouth starts to water it's definitely one that does make your eyes red I believe I'm impressed with the product that came out of con love I can't say that anymore that's why I'm probably seeing their name quite a bit this one right here was very spectacular I think I I think I would have enjoyed myself more instead of pacing myself just to have you know smoked the fat blonde you know later on the night but I didn't know if you know how heavy it was gonna be he said it was the you know it was a heavy girl but I really doubt like oh okay well let me go ahead and sample it throughout the day I should have done that it's definitely one that Nina will have me catch like I don't wanna do [ __ ] now I'm just gonna be honest with you I just don't wanna do [ __ ] shout to everybody for being patient with me I'm actually making some transitions as we speak hopefully I'm actually gonna get some sponsorship and being able to show you all some more string reviews also you know I actually made a move to a home thank God shout out to the people that helped me with that you know who you are and more reviews coming on but this one right here definitely if you're in the area of kind love holla at them please pick this up Tahoe og it is excellent well let's go ahead and sample these Bloods I can't just end it like that no no no I do a little bit more busting as well but this one I'm very impressed with I feel like right now everything's a little sluggish to begin with but you know I hadn't smoked for about an hour I try to you know not so Brooke for the video because obviously I knew how I felt about it I could discuss it but I really wanted to give you a little bit of insight on camera so let's go ahead and take that first poll automatically I mean you can taste it is cinnamon a little bit of ginger it also has like a clove taste I don't know if you've ever smoked a closed cigarette I really don't smoke cigarettes but I have tried a closed cigarette and the event that you smoke cigarettes it has that clove taste also it has like it's kind of like a watermelon but it's I want to say did now a lot of people won't know what I'm talking about but if you've ever eaten watermelon it's the white skin I don't know if you know what I'm talking about but after you get down with the watermelon sometimes you might get to the skin or the actual you know ending of it and it tastes like that so it has a little bit of that watermelon slash you know it's not very sweep a bitter taste this one right here I mean the first hit automatically I'm coming back to that feeling of you know couch lock it's definitely bringing my eyes down focused as well as I feel like I feel like the the tint in my eyes I always like to give that in the blacks in my eyes like all the black colors are starting to get really dark and I really like that because if my eyes are really bad and so this one's really good for it hopefully I can find a hybrid of this because I would love to you know have this mixed with something else where I don't have to you know feel like I'm on a sedative all day this one definitely is that feeling of a sedative so if you're looking for that it's definitely one for you let me go ahead and get that second pool second pool definitely uh I got the camera effect you know I had my eyes flash taste is still there same taste but you know one thing I wanted to add I didn't add in the beginning or you know when I first started talking about it is that it does have kind of like um I don't want to say it's like a honey taste but it has a kind of like a in-between of honey molasses but it sits on that sweet like nectar it's definitely like a nectar like some sort of nectar but sweet like that and I wanted to you know bring that in now because I don't want to say that you know it just all of a sudden popped up no it's been there but it's like really sweet but it's it's it's almost at the end the exhale is where you really taste it with the second hit I definitely feel like it was going to my tongue I feel my eyes being more sharp but I do also feel them going lower I definitely start to get a little bit of a dry mouth sensation even though it's still my second pool let's go ahead and hit the third pole sue is talking about oh yeah this is that type of weed that definitely gets you even higher and higher when you hit it second hit I mean a little bit of the on the burn in you know obviously is getting down the bottom in the bowl but I definitely taste a lot of lime more more like the lime lime peel um it's definitely one that I can to be honest with you I could by smoke this all day except for the fact that you know I got [ __ ] to do all day and this is definitely a strain that uh has you on a couch lock but if y'all are ever in the area and gonna need a strain like this please head over to kinda show them some love because this [ __ ] right here is some fire once again it's your boy chief chief local if you have any questions comments or concerns holler at your boy if not your boys up peace", "hZiLVmDAyiM": "what's up YouTube air Explorer we have another shrine medium this is

bucks let me use that royalty free stuff man so i don't get strikes on my channel because nobody likes strikes so it's all my other youtube content creators hit my boy up he's got you covered what we have on the table today is a little bit of the old tahoe og we got that live resin sugar baby coming in strong from moxie ah screwed up screwed up i didn't have it out i forgot i forgot that means this video is going to be a long boy moxie here we go here we go where's the tao oh gee where are we here we go tahoe g live resin sugar let's get into this love us some sugar so as far as cannabinoids go we have thc coming in at 0.63 percent uh thc a coming in at 84.27 percent cbga at 1.43 cbg at 0.80 percent delta 8 thc at 0.44 for a total cannabinoid profile of 87.57 percent not too shabby not too shabby indeed let's get into the terps real quick we have beta pine 0.004 beta-mercine 0.359 limonene 0.331 osamine 0.027 terpenaline 0.060 lenovolt 0.348 essential alcohol 0.133 [Music] alpha cedrini 0.507 beta-carry filing 2.277 oh beta car coming in heavy uh alpha humaline 0.516 transner at all 0.060 and alpha busy bolo at 0.147 not doing the math do it yourself it's not it's not what i'm about i'm not a math guy i will throw like i started doing this in the last video i don't know if you guys like it and appreciate it but i will always from now on throw up the total cannabinoid percentage just somewhere on the screen up here somewhere but uh yeah it's coming in pretty heavy with the beta carrier filings so it should be earthy and oh humulin we got a good amount of humorline and alpha cedrini so this one should be a an earthy one we're gonna find out aren't we we're gonna find out my monitor is a garbage can and it always breaks down on me there we go i'm gonna bring you all in for the close-ups here make sure that that stayed on me it did let's get rid of that little box bring it on down bring it on down let's get a smell test a little sniff sniff sniff [Music] oh yeah that's got some pepper to it whoa that's peppery that's got like a oh that's yeah yeah that's pepper [Music] it's got some pepper a little bit of the like uh nuttiness [Music] the limonene is coming in too through like through it all you can still get a little bit of that lemon lime oh man that's a good smeller that's good on the nose got some serious boulders in here let's see if i can show them off focus oh you could do better than that there it is there it is look at those freaking i know it's sugar or whatever but those are like diamonds to me look at that camera hates to focus on stuff that's close up but yep very nice consistency definitely got a few chalkers in here just chunkers uh yeah this is a this should be ex exciting you don't get a lot of peppery stuff i don't at least come across it very often especially with moxie moxie's all about them that fruit and fruity profiles so this is definitely a different one um definitely probably gonna hit a little different so let's go little tahoe oh gee this stuff's a little hard to show on the spoon because it's gonna fall the hell off let's get it [Music] oh yeah that's got that straight peppery earthy and then a little bit of lime and lemon in there it's weird it's weird to get that citrusy kick after a nice earthy peppery funk it's definitely got that dankness to it a little bit of that like basement dankness that funky like yeah just straight funk that's good stuff right there oh move it around a little try for another close-up here oh yeah there it is there she goes that stuff is pretty it's not the kind of thing you want to really turn on its side you saw it move a big old boulder fell down on me and break it up a little bit going for a second hit [Music] stuff is super nice if you're into them earthy tones it's got a little bit of that like nuttiness to it um not a lot though i would say you get more of a pepper and then like uh lemon lime after that but like a faint hint of the beta car nuttiness i would call it not too much though because i hate it like if if it was there if it was overwhelmingly there this would not be a strain that i like but the pepperiness of this is very it's different it's refreshing it's it's exotic [Laughter] [Music] [Music] oh man it's very good i wouldn't say it's like one of my favorite flavors of all time because i'm more of a fruity guy like i like the tangy the lemon the lime but this is if you're into that earthy dank like funk this is it [Music] definitely has that like cushiness about [Music] it i wouldn't say it's my favorite og strain that moxie has but it's definitely definitely strong [Music] definitely feel it behind the eyes um green box so we got a hybrid so we're going to get a little bit of both ends as far as effects but definitely very chilling relaxed very cushy i would say um probably leaning more towards the indica side of the strain um or of the two indica hybrid i would say that's probably where it is [Music] definitely strong strong on effects uh and that peppery flavor it's very nice it's not like incense because some sometimes earthy comes through in like an incense like a funky incense like frankincense and myrrh this is not that is it like a pepper mill this is like ground pepper it's got that spice to it and then right after that spiciness you get a little bit of like citrusy nuttiness stuff going on it's kind of like a fight between the nuttiness and the citrusy like the limonene and the mercin and carrie and the beta car are dueling it out but i feel like it's it's got more of a citrus note to it than it does a nutty note but the nutty note is still there literally just cleaned the e-nail and the banger and everything up so we're definitely getting nice clean rips yeah this stuff is definitely bomb our own effects i'll give it that i think it falls a little short for me on flavor but if you're the kind of person who's into a peppery earthy cushy funk this is like probably like right where you're at so making me feel like i can crack all my parts that's the thing i get i get nice and stoned um start to loosen up and all kinds of my elbows will crack my knees will crack i'll be able to crack my back if i turn my head my neck will crack it's just everything starts to relax and fall in line and all my joints start to just do their thing then i can finally re relax and wind down and enjoy the rest of my day so this is definitely good for that [Music] um as far as price it's the half g um 50 bucks but everywhere almost everywhere like lately i've been driving to all kinds of dispensaries all over the place philly out to like wilkes-barre like just crazy places all over and i would say probably 70 of the dispensaries in the pennsylvania market right now have deals on not only half grams but whole grams and two grams because they're out now so like you can find these half grams for between 40 and 45 bucks you can find whole grams between 80 and 85. i haven't gotten a two gram bucket yet but i plan on it not sure how much they are but i'm sure you can get a decent deal on those too so if we're being honest at this point moxie moxie's price point kind of dropped um for like just due to sales uh i don't know i don't get it but i am loving it because i can get high quality meds for the same price as some not so high quality meds you know what i mean so i've been riding that train for a hot minute if i if i come across a place where i can't find a good sale or a good deal i might fold and buy like something else but i haven't come across that really there's only really one place that isn't doing any type of moxie deals and i'm not going to call them out by name they know who they are and i don't feel like it's right to call like call you out by name but yeah there's like one place that i've been to in the last two weeks that is not running fantastic sales on moxie products so be on the lookout i've been saying it i'm gonna keep saying it moxie's on sale all over the place it's like christmas out there i'm telling you it's an awesome deal especially for some medicine that's like top notch i'm gonna do another dab so we can even get into it so price it is what it is wherever you're at uh effects this stuff is great it's got me rambling like a fool talking about stuff i probably never talk about so like a good balance between indica and sativa because i'm not having a hard time making words come out of my mouth so sativa's there but at the same time i'm very chill eyelids are very relaxed um very little pain in this hand like little to no pain so yeah it's a bomber it's a bomber for sure um i would say effects it gets a 10 out of 10 looks and smell smells crazy smells great and it's been sitting out still peppery but it's starting to get more fruity like the more air that hits still got that pepperiness it's like that cushy peppery funk so 10 out of 10 on looks and smell only thing i really can't give it a 10 out of 10 on is the the flavor but it's really a personal preference thing so like i feel like across the board this stuff is killer unless you're uh more of a citrusy like if you like less of an earth tone concentrate taste and more of a sweet citrusy taste this one might not be for you if you don't like peppery things if you're not big into like something that's got a little little kick of funky like dank pepper this might not be for you honestly i don't hate it i just wish there was a little bit like if there was zero nut taste at all and just that limonene lemon lime kick this would be killer because it would taste like lemon limes with pepper so it would almost be like a lemon pepper but with a little kick of lime in there but on the back end you get that little bit of peanut not a fan of [Laughter] it's still good though like makes your mouth water definitely like kicks in the back end with lemon lime but it's got that pepperiness up front makes it a little bit different and then like just a little bit of like peanutty aftertaste it's not even in the hit it's like after you're done taking the hit it kind of like leaves that that peanutty beta uh what is it it's either beta car or mercy one of those two tastes like peanuts a little it's like my least favorite of the terps but still like it not a hater i like all the terps i think they all have their place and when you mix them together you get crazy crazy things like space pop and root beer float and pina colada mango kush strawberry fields like those are like that's just blending of terps at its best it's like flavor just tuned in by like somebody who knows how to tune in flavors it's crazy but yeah anyway this stuff has got me i'm lit i don't even remember is that three hits now two hits nights i'm lit game over guys this stuff if it doesn't get a 10 out of 10 it gets a 9.9 the only reason being it might not be the flavor for you it might not be that peppery funky person but if you're a true weed smoker if you're a true cannabis lover if you love the cannabis plant and all its glory and you love all the flavors that it comes in you'll get over it you'll see how this is you'll you'll know why this is so good and for those of you that love earth tone funky og cushy like just flavorful like weird a little bit of pepper [Applause] but yeah this one's for you 100 um if you like the videos hit the thumbs up if you see me at a dispensary legit say hello i'm out there i'm driving around i'm going to dispensaries i'm trying to talk to all of you while i'm out there i

this is turkey Tuesday episode 7 today I'm reviewing the Tahoe og live resin from SD vestments here in San Diego once again vestments coming through the firehouse concentrates no idea is making this but again it is absolute flame to get a chance to check out vestments definitely do that I think I'll leave maps they have a funky different name and they gets timeless healing patience group so if you're trying to find them on weed maps I think that's the way to find one there but but yeah as the best meds on Instagram and this stuff is absolutely flame it's pretty rare that they do a live resin or for their house runs usually they're just enough runs and they're super fresh nope runs for sure but it's they usually don't label them live presents and this stuff definitely labeled live resin and it is clearly a lie present it tastes really really fresh yeah skunky this Tahoe cut is really really strong dark and when I think a Tahoe I think of like tiny dark skunky og flavors it's like a really really really strong kind of OG I think I like Todd over sfv but we really don't see much 200g here in San Diego we see a lot more sfb down here and the Tahoe is one of those pets of OG where there's not really like a definitive Tahoe og cut I feel like at this point it's been grown so much by so many people that you know one Tahoe cush that you get from one place could be very different to another one I've said I'm gonna go in on a debbie has a church together [Music] this one is really skunky mm - donkey so so good like ice it really is a treat to get fresh wax when you really know well you know it's fresh it's kind of like having a fresh doughnut if you've ever had a fresh doughnut like right out of the fryer when it's still hot there's nothing better nothing fresh wax like that this live present is a treat yeah my second dive ready to go you're already the consistency on this stuff is a kind of what I expect from a live resin like not too sappy to where you can't get it off the parchment by any means so it's perfectly able to snap off a parchment and they always use a Reynolds at best meds which is a win by the way any extract artists watching this using cheap parchment is the worst a lot of times I get parchment it's just a dirt cheap and getting getting the wax off of it it's almost like it's a notebook paper I transfer it onto a piece of Reynolds immediately and I usually lose some wax in the process because there's some that just won't come off the paper so ex tractors out there please use Reynolds or just don't skimp on the parchment it's yeah please please yeah that's it I'm gonna go in on a second down here of the Tahoe og live president best investments here in 70 years dark tiny og overtones but just gas just that og gas mmm yeah really really quick man I'm so tired of having this light make me sweat I swear I think I need to get like an air conditioning unit but then I feel like a little air conditioning you didn't hear it make a bunch of noise while I'm filming or a fan or something like that like I have fans and stuff but you can't have that going way of filming so like I need I just need someone like swinging a palm leaf do something could just stand and swing a palm leaf all I had why dude ABS on camera that'd be fantastic yeah yeah yeah I'd wanna put up a wanted ad you know someone could just swing a pong but palm leaf well I do too have yeah it'd be great oh man to describe the buzz from this stuff I would say it is the definitive full-body high definitely an indica back into it but really top to bottom I feel it behind my eyes I feel it in my head shoulders really am i back here resting on my chair but yeah all the way to my toes definitely I just the full-body buzz it is a really really really potent extract this live resin I've had a few different waxes here on my desk and dabbing this stuff will cut the high from this stuff cuts right through everything else I've had flavor-wise so I think the terpenes really really have a lot to do with the buzz on this stuff I mean it's got there's that touristy Tahoe's dark skunky funk and the gas is just so strong and every time every time I dab it I'm just just won't and yeah loving that well guys thank you for tuning in to another Turkey tuesday's than episode 7 the CCC 4:20 my name is chase", "X-1U3zLNqoY": "yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i do got a weed review it's coming to you by original intelligence i have done a few reviews for them in the past if you haven't seen them go ahead and go check them out but today we are reviewing the tahoe og i think there was a misprint because i'm pretty sure this is supposed to be uh say og on it right there because on all the labels i see online they have the og and it doesn't here so original intelligence you got a misprint but anyways we're going to be reviewing the tahoe og by original intelligence it's coming to you at a 26 on the thc and no cbd zero i got this at manzanita in merced california it's a dispensary manzanita as you can see there it looks really good but like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the bud check it out as you can see there it looks really good this is an indica as well the tahoe og i tried to look online like what the crosses are or anything like that about it but i couldn't really find any information like that so if anybody knows drop it in the comments section let's get a shotgun in i usually do it at the end let's do it at the beginning start this [ __ ] off with a bang whoa hope everybody's having a great day smoking on something good let's go cheers everybody ah wow okay the tahoe og by original intelligence i do got my original intelligent shirt on they got some dope ass gear they actually sent this to me uh when i did a review for them like eight months ago i mean i pay for this weed they're not giving me this weed for free or anything and all my reviews are 100 honest i don't give anybody better reviews you know because they give me a [ __ ] shirt or anything like that so i got a bomb load pack cheers the tahoe og so okay first initial thought it does give you that lung expansion that i'm looking for in a good indica instantly like you know drops my eyes a little bit the smoothness is there it didn't [ __ ] my throat up it's not harsh the flavor is solid it's not like you know it's not a crazy flavor but it's good it's not bad at all but like always two for the review get that stealth smoke out of there that should all affect your next bongle you leave some smoke sitting down here you go take your next bonnet that that smoke gets stale and it [ __ ] up your bong hit like totally [ __ ] it up so the tahoe og off first hit i i do like this strain it it is very solid and where i got this at manzanita in merced california i want to say the it cost me it was between 40 and 50 for the eighth uh not a bad price for this product this product is very good so far i think everything that i've reviewed for original intelligence i've liked i don't think i've smoked anything from them so far that was a bust okay let's get the second one in so i can see how i really like this let's see what the the real effects are cheers yeah this is definitely a solid indica tahoe og i don't think i've smoked any tahoe og before from any other cultivator or company that i can remember this is the first time that i can remember smoking it and i'm not disappointed i like the strain it has that indica punch i'm looking for it gives you that that lung expansion my eyes drop down it's pretty solid i think i got enough let's calculate it up price between 40 and 50 bucks that's not bad for for this company that is a great price the look and the smell of this strain looks really good these buds are small and i really do like a bigger nug but they don't look bad for small nugs they look you know damn good the taste is solid typical og you know nothing crazy you know good but it's it's a solid flavor solid taste the smoothness is there it doesn't [ __ ] up your throat at all i really like that about it and the high is definitely there as well it's not like a a weak strain i'd say this is a strong you know stronger up there for me so overall for the tahoe og i'm gonna have to give it the even eight i'm giving it the even eight it's the eight overall i like it it's just you know it's nothing it's nothing too crazy but it's definitely worth trying out and i do like it maybe i have to try it again with some like bigger nugs next time but i recommend trying it if you guys haven't the tahoe og by original intelligence that was my review hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] you", "_cBnbmY67EU": "[Music] alright you might have seen the intro already but I wanted to open this because I'm actually outside Blake's house and the lighting in his room isn't the best and he's always playing music so I figure I just opened this right now and the only reason I want to do this right now is begin not at home is because I actually want them to try it as well you know I want to share with them I want them to know what they think of it you know I'm saying so I wanted to do the opening right now and then I will do the review at home by myself later on so if you do see me like you know in a car and then a mouse that's what happened guys we're just gonna be looking at it okay so this was bought at phenols I believe it was $28 and it's white Tahoe cookies and it's live resin butter know what threw me off was filled is usually a lot more expensive but then when they said butter I was like oh you know I'm saying because when it comes to the type of concentrate that actually costs a lot of money because butter is part of like the easiest concentrate to make other than probably rosin you know rosin very simple but you do need expensive gear and stuff the butter is generally pretty easy you know I'm saying so that's why it was only like 25 dollars a gram I noticed that the THC percentage is pretty low but like I said it doesn't really matter about just THC you know there's other things involved and it's live resin so it should be some terpenes up in there to kick it up a notch so let's just open this I don't want to just kind of keep the box nice and Christine for the what I'd a bit or a later I might just rip it cuz [ __ ] it gets a box right care about a box but yeah why Tahoe cookies has been I've talked about it on this channel before oh wow very very nice I've tried some of the fields stuff before as well I have never tried their cartridge though what the hell what off the bat I really like the packaging this is very very easy sheet look at this [ __ ] you could [ __ ] have this on like a shoe design you know and be dope that's pretty [ __ ] dope dice oh wow it looks like wow I'm actually pretty surprised I wasn't expecting this I haven't empty said butter I thought it'd be like a crumble ish but it's like a light color which I really enjoy okay 20 I'm gonna say $28 maybe 27 I don't know around there but Wow okay excu a look at it first let me get the thumbnail get the thumbnails always yeah alright guys back at my house I am going to continue the review of this field extract white Tahoe cookies no I'm saying if I already opened the box and all that before I went to play Xcel's but now that we're at home we're gonna finish this review off drop the bat low very very nice packaging I did not keep the dab tool that it came with I gave it to Blake but this slip is pretty good like yeah they were actually impressed like I gave money a hit and then he was like I'm about to go there right now even though he just went to the club like two hours we'll hope that honestly says a lot filled extracts usually is a pretty expensive to you know very very creamy creamy looking we're just gonna take a hit since they're gaming right now I'm probably just gonna mute them for now I'm saying but that was RJ and Ben on the game you know saying so we're gonna take a hit of this and then we're just gonna tell you a little bit more about the product itself I'm saying not bad I'm like oh I feel the extracts usually they have that sauce that kind of looks like a sugar wax sugar sauce see wax you know I'm saying you know boys [Music] [Music] very very clean taste very smooth - for a hit that I just took like that size I usually would be coughing but very very pleasant not to like chirpy but you can definitely taste like a slight hint of like like some cookies you know some very earthy pungent I don't know how else to describe it but it's a very familiar taste and not bad like first price and I've always wanted to do like a field extracts video or another one after that because I kind of did like it it was just too pricey but yes another thing I like to mention is I mentioned this on most of my videos but the price that I get it it's not the price that you're gonna get out depending on where you are so please be aware of that I don't want to steer you in the wrong way you know just because I get it for 29 doesn't that mean you'll get it for you know what hopefully you do get it for 29 and yeah other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video just another product video hope you guys can understand this is pretty good stuff I'm not gonna lie other than that have a great day [Music]", "eFWO70eF5F0": "yo what's going on

but yeah peace y'all", "nxQe6rx4x58": "hey everybody this is Ken eccentric films coming at you with another strain review today I've got some IES Oh Tahoe og it's their select Tahoe cut Tahoe G is one of my all-time favorite strains so I was really excited to see this available on a local menu here in Illinois so without further ado let's get to it genetics wise Tahoe G is a select oh gee cush phenotype and in my personal experience it's always been one of my favorite cuts of OG whenever I've been able to get my hands on it it's known to be a really heavy indica and it's also known to have that classic og smell you know any strain with a strong representation of OG Kush and it's a genetic lineage will have this sort of earthy musky kind of garlic like smell that I would classify as the OG smell and then tahoe typically in my experience on top of that has this sort of lemon nose above all of that alright so let's dive into it let's first check out the looks of this flower so looks-wise as you can see here this is some pretty solid looking bud they were advertised as tahoe OG littles so you know smaller colas no super big nugs or anything like that but there's not too much stem at all in any of this bud which I really like it's all pretty much usable medicine which I dig I would say that is what they mean when they say premium popcorn this is not what that was advertised as but I think that's what the companies are intending to salic there's not going to be too much stem it's just gonna be smaller nugs but you can use pretty much all the nug you know not much of the weight that you're being given is gonna be stem which is you know dealer's oldest trick in the book but yeah as you can see nice orange pistols on this bud nice solid green color overall for looks I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 it's not the most incredible looking bud I've ever seen but it's really solid so moving on to smell I've got to say that smell is the category where I was kind of the most letdown with this but I guess so to say as I mentioned earlier in the video I've always gotten a really awesome like lemon earthy musky smell off of Tahoe og guts and that just wasn't happening with this but the smell is just kind of a generic floral kind of smell pretty minimal smell in general so with that said I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 10 for smell much like the smell the flavor of this Bud is also quite lacking it's not bad at all it's a really smooth smoke so it's not like a quality issue it's just not the tur pious flower I've ever come across and I really love i love me some turkey flower you know I like a good lingering flavor on the palate like after you exhale a hit and you don't get that from this flower you get a really really faint green tea herbal kind of taste which is slightly stronger I will say then the aroma that comes off of the bud so I'm gonna give it a higher taste rating I'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 with all that considered I'd really have to say where it's at for this flower is the effects it's most notable for that it's not the best smelling or best tasting it's not bad in either of those regards it's just faint but um in terms of the effect as I said in the beginning of the video this is a really potent indica at least you know by reputation Tahoe Gia's so I was hoping it would serve that purpose for me and maybe help me sleep sometimes I struggle to fall asleep at night and I guess a lot of people are probably in that situation right now with what's going on in the world but regardless this bud is really good medicine and a great sleep aid for like late at night when you're trying to fall asleep especially if you're someone who struggles with sleeping sometimes like I am so the intended effect I would say is definitely accomplished with this flower so with all that considered I'm going to give it an 8.5 out of 10 for the effect in terms of value as you can see in the title of this video this may be some of the best flower I've been able to find in Illinois so far since cannabis became recreationally legal I purchased seven grams of these Tahoe OG littles the before tax price was 75 and they came out to about 85 bucks so 85 bucks for seven G's again that's still not nearly as good as I could get it on the street in terms of quality or price but it's a step in the right direction for Illinois it's a much better price than I had seen in a lot of other circumstances and as I said the flower was good medicine served its purpose for me other than having faint odor and taste which is something as a cannabis purist and enthusiasts I'm I was looking for it was good medicine so overall for value I'm going to give it an 8 out of 10 it's really solid stuff still the price could be a lot better and we're looking forward to that happening in Illinois but that's about all I have for today guys thanks for tuning in I hope you all are continuing to stay safe and have a great day", "ADCBpqWUC80": "hey youtube what's up alex here back again with another quick video and yes this is another prime video i went and picked up some prime now this is their dry resin and it is their extractors blend now if you don't know what their extractors blend is their extractors blend is a it's a three usually about three strands that they have mixed all together this one is purple haze northern lights and african tie so what happens is they have probably a little bit left of each one of those and they throw it all together into a big batch and called an extractor's blend and yes i got a gram of this extractor's blend it is at 84 t8c and uh there you can see some of the stats again focus there you go extractors blend stats let's get this bad boy open and i will let you know what i think of this extractor's blend by prime i'll throw some in the puffco and i'm also going to do a a little dab so let's get it open we'll throw some in the puffcoat and we'll do a dab of this i'll let you know what i think i did have um some extractors blend before it was a legend of 91 vampire killer and something else was mixed in with it but it was really good and it was called an extractor's blend so i figured oh oh it smells great mmm smells really good and got a nice tangy zesty tangy smell to it good look there that is the extractor's blend and there's a nice look by prime this is a hybrid 84 t8c smells delicious got a nice like zesty orange peel kind of zesty citrusy smell i'm going to throw a nice size gooper into my puffco real quick here that dropped to the bottom but i got my puffcoat charged up so i'm only gonna use the green setting and i'm gonna get a taste i'll probably do a dab with you guys here too while we're here just hanging out grab a dab double tap sesh mode on the puff go let's give it a taste cheers guys a little sizzle sizzle wow wow amazing flavor wow it's got a real citrusy zesty kind of taste that is very good very good taste wow i'm impressed how good that tastes let's give it another taste here double tap sesh mode i got it on green it was a blinker on green wow very nice taste extractors blend purple haze african thai and what was the other one purple haze african tine is one other one i gotta look at the box here oh northern lights yeah so northern lights african tie and purple haze for the extractor's blend by prime very very good you can't go wrong with prime for this was uh 65 but of course i got a 10 discount which brought it down to 58 and then i also had three dollars off in credits so i brought it down to 55 now that is a good price for some prime concentrates let's do a dab of it let's throw some on the tool here and heat the rig up and get a quick dab off the rig too while we're at it let me know what you guys are dabbing on down in the comments section got that ready all right let's heat this up like i said let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section uh this tastes really good let's see what the most prominent terpene is if i can check out what the most uh prominent terpene of this is looks like it's mercine and terpenoline that's probably what that citrusy taste is that terpenoline gives it a nice taste yeah terpene i don't know if i'm even saying them right you guys know what i'm talking about let's get this nice and heated and we'll set my timer and i'll get a quick dab of this and i'll wrap this video up this is really good extractors blend by prime just nice and hot i like to burn off all the old stuff heating this up real quick my banger you guys can see what i'm doing that cool off for about 40 seconds and we'll bang this dab and then we'll be out let me know what you guys are dabbing on down in the comments section this prime is really good let me know what you guys uh what what's your favorite concentrate do you like the live resin or do you like the dry resin go ahead and let me know down in the comments section this is really good tasting but i like prime a lot they're good i like calypso i like rhythm like i said i like a lot of them they're all pretty good man you know even g leaf is hit and miss sometimes you can get a good one there too so take it for what you want take it for a grain of salt whatever you know don't take my word for it try them all yourself see which ones you like which ones you prefer you know how it is here's my timer let's do this dab i don't have my carb cap but oh well that is nice wow very very nice taste and very nice yes i would recommend it prime extractors blend if you do if you haven't tried an extractor's blend before don't be scared to try it it's really good all it is is three different strains mixed together that's why it's called an extractor's blend this is the butter one gram and the taste is phenomenal it is really good all right guys i'm gonna wrap this video up like i said if you liked the little video give me a like subscribe if you're not subscribed hit the bell notification and you will get notified whenever i do post a new video you guys have a good one peace i'm out", "auS2wH-qv6M": "[Music] was a good job welcome to another episode of taste my name is Alvin and today we've got a California legend man Tahoe oh gee let's get in for this profile I hope oh gee not to be confused with a child Tahoe oh gee could so it's a little different so Tahoe og is just a phenotype of the original og cush man much like King Louie the 13th was last week and Tahoe og cush is actually the child of Tahoe og and sfv og cush man so it's a little confusion of confusing but Tahoe og the strain is actually a phenotype of OG Kush but Tahoe og cush is the child of Tahoe og and SF v OG coach man a little confusing but that's where he goes I purchased this over at the Garden of Eden over in Hayward California and man there's only one more strain to go of that icon from when I was back at the bay but there is one more other strain that I did pick up from homey who shall remain nameless man a big shout-out to the flood anyway Garden of Eden over in Hayward man check them out big shout out to my man MC but this here is going to be a 90 attending indicate dominant strain stress insomnia pain depression and appetite are some of the medical ailments that it can help with some of the flavors and smells we should get is an earthiness a little bit of a citrus lemon and then a pine smell to it and so yeah everything sounds good man so let's uh let's get city senses alright so if it senses we always start off with the smell man right over here forgot to mention that it was a grown by Pharaoh farms they always do some good work but let's start off with the smell let's get hopping definitely pine and lemon right out the gate no mistaking that that's for sure this has been sitting for a little bit size a little bit of earthiness to it but definitely lots of pine and lemon no food I'll give it a little break yep even more stronger the pine smells a little bit more pronounced as well as the one yeah man all right so wha let's take a look all right so man take a closer look at it it is a beautiful beautiful dense nug man it is packed with a lot of trichomes and again like I mentioned it is a very intense and that just makes up for a nice fluffy blunt if you rolling it up of course we're gonna rape it and yeah man this is a strain that I would definitely love to press just because of the quantity of all the weed that you're gonna get from it and all the trichomes so the results gotta meet of it but uh with that said let's get pacing all right so that's what it looked like there's only one thing left to do man and that's taste it um but I did break it up and as before any time you break up the bub and you expose more of those tract homes to get a better terpene profile so that pine smelling that lemon smell is just way more prevalent was actually a smoked light of this when I was back home and man this came this became a top favorite I can see why it's popular strange but yeah man I'm gonna get to packing and we gonna get to taste strong time from the initial email like a pine Fung and then a lemon straight lemon on the exhale without one had a lot of lemon and it's very much slight taste not about you guys but I have dogs and I spray pine saw when I clean up any accidents then you can kind of get the fumes you know from the song I mean from the solution and just like that very lemon and pine flavor it's crazy see when I was back home and we were chiefing this yeah it was was all smoke so I didn't get this flavor profile but very strong distinct lemon and pine with just that like a little layering of funky skunk ease to it man this is good I can see why people love this drink it's definitely moving up to one of my tops quickly I may let's get a high-mass time for of eat highs if you are new to these videos men and then have a 5-10 rule when I get high and I smoke for five minutes or wait for five minutes come back to you guys I'll let you know how I feel in my brain let you feel my body any other flavor profiles I may be having go back to the vape smoke or vapor for another five minutes come back at the 10 minute mark and do the same thing all over reason being is that hybrids do change so it's very interesting to see how you can either go from a sativa to a hybrid or a high-intensity Macabre not so Thibodaux an indica or an indica bag to a hybrid man talking about favorite thing so with that said in 5rh also at the five-minute mark man the Tahoe og hits that's for sure yeah man it's strong was an indica straight out the gate you can you can tell there's a little bit of a sativa to it just just because you're not completely stoned to the bone but at the end of the day I gotta say this is a good strain just because of how quick the onset of that it's a stony feeling was you didn't have to wait just a few hits five minutes is all it took man so we're gonna keep at it we're gonna see how if it takes me deeper down that indica route or off we kind of just Betty Coast so y'all are another five yeah ten minute mark it did take me down further that in the corral but you know I do like something about this strain it takes you right to the edge of Stoneman I mean you can feel it in your body I feel it in my eyelids but it gives you just a hint of three more functionality I mean I spent a little bit of sativa otherwise I wouldn't be able to continue with this video man I know that one day we're gonna I'm gonna be tasting a heavy heavy indica and I just be way more punch than I've ever been but this is a very hard-hitting deep indica takes you right to the edge of complete lock lockness couch lock stone enos stone to the bone whatever you want to call it takes you right to the edge but it leaves you with enough sativa characteristics to kind of function so yeah I really appreciated about this strength so I like it so with that said may let's move over to the overview Tahoe og the legendary strain man again not to be confused with its offspring Tahoe og cush that it had bred with SF vog believe Cali connection did that they put those two together the Tahoe G sf vog and then G cush again this one is just the Tahoe Oh G so it is a phenotype of an original og cush great I purchased this over at the Garden of Eden over in Hayward California and this was bred by Pharaoh farms it is a 9210 indica dominant strain stress insomnia pain depression and appetite are some of the things that it can help with let's see here earth lemon and pine flavors and smells are what you can get to it again my particular batch was just a little bit older I just been sitting on a little longer than I'd like to but nonetheless it was still potent and the flavors are still there man so that's a testament to those blowers and the string let's see here at the five-minute mark it did hit me quickly the indica did set in very quick not true heavy again that's that ninety ten did leave you with a little bit of sativa functionality but at the 10 minute mark man that in because I'm it doesn't really really set in like I mentioned it just takes you all the way to the edge but kind of keeps you from jumping completely so if I had to score it on a one to five man I'm gonna give this one a five I like it I like those indicas I like sativas I like the ones where you can get a good kind of feel for that particular string so for example this is a Tahoe oh gee this has characteristics of being a deep indica and as soon as you hit it hit you quick it tells you that I am a deep end because this is what I have about and then it plays with you take you all the way to the edge and then it keeps you from going there man on so it leaves you with a little bit of functionality I definitely would not recommend doing this when you have something active to do this is something for you know you want to watch a movie or you want to you know read a book something to where you want to relax but you just want to have a little a little bit of brain capacity to do something but this is also I can tell a great great strain so yeah on a scale of one to five Tahoe og definitely gets a five man let's wrap it up all right man first and foremost big thank yous and big shoutouts to all my folks that helped me out with this man rocks are a fab Rob Fredo chase one two Rock Martin and

funny thing about prism that i just learned from a subscriber and from the uh bud tender was that alera and prism don't label their package don't label their concentrates so the dispensary tells us you know usually if it's a sativa indica or hybrid i thought by the color of the packaging that's like most brands do they color code the packaging green hybrid blue or so purple is a indica and red is a sativa well alera doesn't do that they do it by by textures so crumble is red uh batter and sugars are bluish green i think and they do it that way now the subscriber had told me that and i looked it up and it was true so i misspoke the other time when i did the review on the banana og x gorilla glue i thought was a sativa because of the red packaging and you know what was weird is it was very energetic and uplifting even though banana og is a hybrid and gorilla glue could be a hybrid or an indica so but this here is a sativa it is golden goat so i want to say thanks to subscriber who told me that and for the troll who was talking [ __ ] in the comments you're out of here i deleted you but for the subscriber that advised me about the packaging stuff thanks a lot guy all right without further ado let's get this review going this is golden goat batter one gram yeah we all got trolls i got trolls too on this channel i just delete them from my channel that's what i do so let's get this open i'll let you know what i think of this golden goat i am going to throw this in the puff go i don't think i'm going to do a dab of it i'm just going to throw some in my puffco here because you know what since i did that video on the puffco i found a newfound love for my puffco again cleaned it out really good today and uh i'm gonna throw some in here i got it nice and charged this is a batter looks like a batter smells good that is golden goat batter let me zoom in on for you look at that batter golden goat batter 78 percent i think it was coming in at let me take a little look-see 76.949 on the thca and 1.327 on the thc thcv is 0.48 percent so now i heard that thcv is an appetite suppressant and it makes you not hungry food for thought anyhow let's get a little uh bit of this batter inside my i'm gonna that's pretty fat that's probably enough for one or two let's do it like this one or two dabs trying to get you guys there you go i'm gonna put that inside the puff go i'm just going to drop it right in there yep yep there you go boom it fell right to the bottom i'm going to throw the lid on like so i do have it on the green setting for uh medium heat double tap sesh mode cheers hmm got a nice flavor very earthy with a piney kind of twist i'm here to do again let's see what the tarps are yeah it's got a lot of uh carpathian it makes it a little peppery it's got a lot of terpenoline in it of course when you see that you know it's a sativa let me zoom in i can show you there you go stats for you prison batter golden goat you can see all the stats there and the terpenes terpene profile yeah it's pretty good i did do two hits off the puffco you know what we are going to do it down it just wouldn't be right if we didn't do a dab off the dab rig of this delicious golden goat it's pretty tasty it's got a nice earthy peppery piney kind of taste very enjoyable yeah very enjoyable so i'm gonna heat it up and we'll do a dab of this on my rig and i'll probably wrap this video up get you another look at it got a nice funky smell to it too real nice funky smell that is the golden goat batter by prism not a live batter cured batter but it still tastes really good get my timer ready so let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comments section on this uh dreary afternoon here in erie pa pennsylvania medical marijuana you know how we do it here so yeah let's do this dab and i'll let you know what i think this is very tasty though it tastes really good out the puffco so that's how you know if it tastes good out the puff go it's definitely going to taste good off of a dab rig hit let me get a hit onto the rig get a hit on here dab tool get a hit there trouble focusing here we go if and i did start doing my dabs at a much lower temperature i were doing i was doing them a little bit too hot lowered it down would help with this new banger because that old banger i had was really shitty and it wouldn't hold the heat in very well this one holds the heat very well so i can give it that 40 45 second cool down get that perfect dab every time let me wrap this video up that is prism golden goat very good very tasty this is a sativa even though the box looks like that you can't go by that with alera but then again even with moxie their sativas are dark purple color for sativa and their indicas are red so yeah i guess other companies they gotta kind of confuse you but yeah so i thought my bad that this was this one this color meant it was a hybrid and that red meant and that red meant that it was a sativa but i guess not they go by textures by their colors so yeah anyhow like share subscribe and uh we said let me know what you guys are dabbing on down in the comment section i always like to know give me a thumbs up if you liked the video and uh tune in for the next one peace i'm out", "6MF_Gblrkdg": "what is up YouTube Alex here back again with another quick review on this Friday here in Erie PA it's

strong tasting you know a lot of flavor to it moxie always does have lots of flavor all right I will wrap this video up it's already at 10 minutes private reserve X skittles live resin batter textures like that of a real like kinda reminds me of wax after it just dried after being hot you know it's kind of gooey a little bit like that I guess this depends on the temperature if I keep it in a cool dry place it'll probably stay a better consistency supposed to keep it in a cool dry place alright guys that's enough I'm feeling it the hits are coming on the THC was 82% THC a is 82% even the THC is 0.23 percent it's got a little bit of a CBG it's got CVG a 1.8 6% so yeah there are some stats for that you guys have a good weekend like I said I know I'm beating it over the head but let me know

great night peace", "mow5rk0y6i8": "[Music] so what is going on everybody welcome back to the channel pines trees a 21 and over medical cannabis review channel out of the state of pennsylvania how's everybody doing today i know i say this a lot you guys are probably getting sick of it but got something crazy special on the table today uh diamonds and sauce i mean it's always a good day when diamonds and sauce comes across the table and it's especially a good day when moxie drops diamonds and sauce so we got a full gram tahoe oh g diamonds and sauce and oh my goodness this stuff terpy terpy terpy terpy it is slap city it it is crazy so tahoe og always has boasted um flavors of grape like grape throughout as far as like you know it's in it's in the description of the flower basically but like i've had plenty of the tahoe og in the past and like it's always real fire and it always tastes really great but i always like my personal like palette could never really pinpoint or find the grapeiness in like the sand or like the the batter you know so like it always tasted fire but i always i always lacked that that hint of grape that they always boast about in the description well let me tell you what the diamonds and sauce has the grape in it it's got that grapeiness it's freaking amazing and it's got that sweet o.g and it's just this one is really strong really really strong so let's get into it um we're gonna talk about it it looks super crazy good it had some boulders in it some sometimes you'll get diamonds and sauce and it'll be like more like sugar and sauce this stuff had literal freaking diamonds like rocks you could put in a ring you'll see it on the close-up this one is special i kept one of the rocks in it in full form so you guys could see like the biggest chunkiest chunkiness rock that came in it but like they were real formed diamonds really nice so let's get into it thc 4.0 percent thc a 81.38 cbga 1.02 percent cbg 0.5 percent and delta 8 thc 0.17 percent for a total cannabinoid profile of 87.37 87 doesn't sound crazy right it's like average you know high 80s low 90s this hit like it was high 90s or it does hit every time i've smoked it so far it has just slapped me like this stuff is strong so let's get into the look of it let's get into the smell smells amazing smells super sweet tiny super gassy it's like tiny gassy funky sweet sweet og like it smells awesome so we can't do much from here so you guys come on over here all right all right let's get into it so smell is amazing um i wouldn't say it's like florally although it is very piney so i guess that is kind of floral pines or trees so yeah it's kind of it's got that it's got a sweet sweet smell to it super pretty to look at check this out this stuff is just chirp heaven chirpy mcturp sauce oh look at it look at that giant look at that giant that thing is huge probably gonna crack that in half and smoke half of it in this video maybe even crack it in half do twos two rips smoke the whole thing i don't know if i can handle it though i'm gonna tell you something about this right so this is this is my story as far as the taco of g goes right pick this up two days ago at the dyspo i was like yeah diamonds and sauce i gotta get it i know i've done tahoe og before as far as review but diamonds and sauce always special always special so i had to pick it up so as i'm sure most of us know when we smoke right when you get nice and lit up you get the munchies you eat food after you eat food you come down right that's like order of operations everybody knows that order of operations smoke eat come down right so i got this stuff i i brought it home i ripped a fat dab right so i was like oh you know i want to try it out i want to get a feel for it flavor through the roof but not only flavor through the roof i was lit like lit right super just medicated zero pain could probably play the sax phone all day if i needed to this hand felt awesome uh so got the munchies right went and picked up tacos right got three tacos big big fat tacos with carnitas in it freaking like authentic like three brothers there's a spot i don't know if you're in this part of pa but you should look it up best tacos you'll ever get right so i ate these tacos right i i house these tacos right and i'm sitting there after like usually after i eat it's it's it's time to smoke again it's always how it goes i get stoned sit around for a little bit enjoy myself get the munchies come down sit around for 15 minutes it's time to smoke again right natural lord of operations i was still ripped off my ass after i ate these tacos i'm talking like three chunking big ass tacos just filled with meat and just you know just the works right the kind of thing that would make you eat your highway you know because that's what you do you eat your highway well this stuff you're not eating this highway i'm telling you right now i ate my ass off and i was still just as ripped after the meal as i was before the meal i like literally i sat down i was like all right i just ate a meal i'm gonna sit down and chill i was like it's it's time to smoke again and then i thought about it and i was like wait a minute i'm super ripped still like it it took me a second to even process the fact that like i was still super duper stoked so this stuff is strong it takes a lot to get me high to the point where i'm gonna stay stoned after i eat a huge meal so like i don't know if it's the terps in this one i don't know if it's like i don't know what it is i'm pretty sure it's the entourage effect of everything but this is a bad mama jama this one is one that i would highly recommend if you're looking for something strong it's gonna stick with you it's gonna like really just put a hurting on you because sometimes that's what you need you just need it to be like that strong strong medicine this is it i don't know if it's because of the sauce because it's diamonds and sauce i don't know if it's like super chirped out actually i do know it is super turfed out here's the here's the numbers terps we got nine point five zero percent so almost ten percent terps beta mars coming in at two point four uh limonene at one point one holy crap beta car 3.3 so like this stuff is packed full of terps so i don't know if it's just this particular combination of terps really made the effects last for me but it was some of the most long-lasting like most enjoyable stuff so if you get a chance pick this up this isn't even going to be like a regular review for me this is just we're talking about how good this is i don't even need to tell you this stuff is gonna be a 10 out of 10. if it gets you stoned to the point where you can eat a meal and still be stoned that is that is a winner [Music] so i don't know if this is on the menu as something that they're gonna continually like come out with tahoe g diamonds and sauce but like sign me up i'm on board for it every time you know what i'm not gonna break up that big boy i'm gonna leave the big boy and i'm just gonna i'm gonna scoop it's just a freaking wet chunk some of those terps if i go for that big one it's not going to be terpy enough like a nice even keeled terpy hit so we're going for the for the broken up stuff but yeah terps all day high in thc but the flavor and the amount of lasting of the effects is what really did it for me like we really set it apart from the rest so let's go cheers and let's get it [Music] [Music] uh iron lung in it we don't stop it's for all those west coast guys that don't know how to take big rips come and see me oh yeah so the flavor the flavor is just crazy like i said it's got it's piney it's got a little bit just a little hint with that limonene in there you get a little bit of a lemon lime flavor but you you get like you get this crazy grapey like awesome grape flavor i have no idea where it comes from but it is so good an unexpected [Music] oh so good let's let's read about it a little bit man it's so good like i wish i got two of these honestly hybrid og phenotype relaxing happy uplifting sedating unique due to its delicious aroma uh boasting champagne and mild grape scents see that's what i'm saying i've been reading this forever i have it literally on paper you know like i have the actual like straight from the facility notes and like i always was wondering like man it always says mild grape scents but like i thought maybe there was something wrong with like my palate because sometimes i don't i don't get some flavors like you know people are different everybody tastes different everybody feels a little different so like i thought maybe it was inside of my palette like my palette wasn't uh whatchamacallit uh wasn't refined enough right to taste it like my palate wasn't refined to the point where i was picking up the subtle flavor of the grape it's not subtle in this it's not subtle at all it's freaking delicious grape pine sweet citrus ah it is a good one it is a great one honestly it is a great one and strong effects uh it's a hybrid it says it's a hybrid but like i get i get heavy indica feels off of it especially due to the fact that it left me stoned after i ate like it it was it was real nice it's always fun to get surprised [Music] yeah this stuff is crazy good like so just oh yeah i know it's expensive i i know i know it's not the most expensive though so when y'all are talking about prices just remember it's not the most expensive in the market and in the market that we live in you pay for your quality and you're definitely buying top quality with this this is freaking just top shelf all day every day this is what i would say the definition of top shelf is it is so good i just you know going in for another [Music] so hit me down in the comments let me know what you guys are smoking on if you're smoking along with me let me know where you're from too i know not everybody is from pa i know got a couple people in cali who watch apparently i have a i have a an audience in russia so says my youtube analytics i have a decent crowd of viewers in russia shout out to russia not really sure why you would watch or who it is it's probably just like one person over there watching it shows up in my analytics but it is a region and or country in which my videos get played so whatever oh all right crazy let's talk about it [Music] man i'm about to sneeze all right i'm good so let's get into it uh the gram 100 bucks 100 bucks is steep for a gram if you're going to pay a hundred bucks for a grant or over 100 bucks for a gram some of these people are charging like 60 bucks for a half gram which is crazy um you want to you want to spend your hundred dollar on a gram that's it's worth it you wanna you wanna make sure your money's going towards something that you're not gonna regret buying in the long run and you're gonna feel like because it's literally costs more than gold per hour per ounce or whatever per gram like because of that you know you want to feel like you're getting a good return on your investment so that being said i feel like this one makes me feel like i got i got my money's worth i got i got what i paid definitely and it's top top shelf like good medicine like feel it in your eyes um feel it in the back your head feel it on the top of your head feel it in the places where you had pain that you do not have pain anymore and honestly you're gonna feel it for a good amount of time not just you know a short amount of time and honestly i think that's the difference between live and cured i feel like cured it's good tastes good sometimes and you know the effects are good but they're never as long lasting as the live stuff i always feel like the diamonds and sauce and stuff is just just a little bit better and for some reason dispatch tahoe og really just sticks around so [Music] that being said if you like the videos hit the thumbs up hit that subscribe i'm lit i'm gonna enjoy the rest of my day um big other big news i gotta i bought concentrates yesterday from a company that never had concentrates on the market and they were only 55 bucks a gram and it's really really good like like surprisingly good for the money the flavor is on point the terps are there you guys just get hype get excited the next one is gonna be something nobody's ever seen before i mean the company's been around but only had flour so like think of a company on the market that you've only seen half flour up until this point that you wish had concentrates well that's what the next video is going to be so be on the lookout i'm probably going to film that one tomorrow because you know i want to get a feel for it i'm going to smoke it it's real good um just it's cured and it's it's like a crumble which is always kind of disappointing in the flavor department but not this stuff the stuff has terps so i'm excited to share it with everybody and i'm excited to have you know a new option on the market uh it's always nice to have a cheaper option that way if you want to go heavy one day if you're like i just wanna dab a whole gram today i'm just gonna dab a gram who cares i'm gonna do like quarter gram dabs half gram dabs just gonna go in you wanna do that with something that's gonna be good but not expensive because you don't wanna you don't wanna smoke a hundred dollar gram in one day do you i mean we all want to i wanna smoke five of these in one day but it's not cost effective so sometimes you know you need that that cheap stuff when you want to really throw down and get like crazy with it so that's what the next one's all about so well see what it's what it is and who it is and uh yeah i will see you guys in the next one [Music] peace you", "j6YDoMSpbrA": "earn me for it's funny here this is the last reply what a few videos I will do about k2 vs. bud versus live resident obviously as y'all know I ain't smoking k2 no more but if I can get that into focus get enough yeah there we go you can see I put the resin in there the book that a resin kept the butter from burning on one side but it completely melted it on this side and I'm way way way more natural high than that stuff but however I do have some dry cake I mean drive the birthday cake and grass roots after this birthday cake dry leaf one gram we got Moxie fibers pause the video because this is 90% yeah that's comparison it's always broken up yeah versus but versus live resin earth man 420 signing out peace", "lh5TKwCoDuc": "[Music] okay what is going on everybody welcome back to the channel pines trees a 21 and over medical cannabis review channel out of the state of pennsylvania how are all you beautiful people doing got a quick one for you i've already opened it up i've been smoking on it for a couple days i felt like it was worth a review i wasn't sure if i would get around to it because i've been super busy lately thanksgivings this week so let's just jump right into it i got some old school flavor i was i was looking at the menu i was like man i want an indica i want something classic i want an old-school classic flavor from back in the day didn't even care if it was fruity or anything i just wanted something that would give me some nostalgia so i saw it on the menu i was like oh man that's good i haven't seen that in a hot second or maybe i just haven't been looking honestly i probably just haven't been looking but today we got some calypso bubba kush bubba yeah it's been like forever since i had some bubba i used to love bubba kush back in the day like 2006 2007 when bubba hit the scene and everybody went crazy for bubba it was one of my faves so it's a live sugar it's kind of saucy i bought it because i thought it was going to have a lot of terps in it because it was low in potency so i was like ah low on potency the place i went to doesn't list the terps on their website shame on you dispensaries if you're not doing that yet list top three turks or just percent of terps not even the terps just percent of thc percent of terps that's all we need to know but anyway let's get into it potency here we go thc thc 3.731 percent thc a 73.942 percent zero all the way down for the rest of it so [Music] 78 thc uh terps we got beta car at the top 1.173 we got beta merce 0.482 beta pines 0.206 alpha pine 0.187 limonene 1.899 nice on the limonene lineal zero point six four nine busy bolo zero point one five four humilian 0.313 and that is it i'll throw a picture up on the screen for you guys [Music] so i've been smoking this for probably two days now and it was quite the surprise i'm not gonna not gonna bs yet um i was expecting it to be a dry sugar it was more like a sugar and sauce very saucy if we're being honest even though the terps are kind of low kind of very saucy still so the most surprising thing about this bubba was that the nose on it is garlic it's got a garlic nose a little bit of that limonene uh in the background but man it smells like gmo like it smells very very gmo to me i love gmo i don't know if that's always been a case with bubba and i just haven't had any but like it smells like some garlicky funk and honestly it tastes just the same it tastes great it's got some lime to it but it also has that funky funky garlic and i love that i'm so into the garlic funkiness right now um for some reason gmo has become like the garlic cookies garlic just all the gmo stuff that's coming out is banging it's like top of the top top of the flavor profile in my opinion like it just has that funk so let's get into it give you guys a look like i said i've been smoking on it so it's not as much as it once was but you still get a good nice visual representation of it very saucy very sugary just super super nice price is a little a little steep 80 bucks for gram always always hurts when you got to pay that 80 bucks for the gram but this stuff is pretty good it's a nice indica it's it put me to sleep honestly every time i've been smoking on this it's basically just rocked me to sleep [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] even though it's like barely touching 80 percent in potency it's surprisingly strong i was not expecting it when you go into a place and you're like oh i'm gonna shop in a way that people just don't shop normally which is trying to find things with low potency that way maybe you get high terps which most people aren't out there doing most people are just thc hunting because you can't really tear punt most most dispensaries menus don't even list terps like that so it's kind of difficult so what i do personally to try to combat that the fact that it is very hard to terr punt any menu that doesn't list terps i look at the thc i try to find something that is a sauce or a sugar or a sugar and sauce or a combination thereof and if it has like between 75 and or under 85 anything under like 85 thc to me that says it should be a little bit higher in terps not always right not at all i actually think i'm wrong more than i'm right but there's no other way to do it there's no other way to hunt terps like unless you've had something and you know it's just smacking with the terps how else are you tarpon [Music] tell me in the comment section below let me know how you hunt for terps let's go in a little puffco peek but yeah i originally didn't know if i would have enough time to do this review sometimes i buy stuff and i have to work so i don't always get everything i buy doesn't always get a review but i felt like this was worth the review just because of how it tastes if you're a gmo person if you like gmo if you like heavy indicas check it out check out calypso's bubba kush i didn't even know club so had bubba [Music] kush [Music] it's so good get that little bit of limonene coming through for a little bit of citrusy goodness but then you get like just smacked with garlic could just be me could be like the way my my palate is right now but like it reminds me something about it reminds me of the grassroots garlic cookie sauce that i had a couple weeks ago something in the flavor is very reminiscent of that [Music] me [Music] so the puffco peak top that was supposed to come last thursday has been caught up due to mail i don't know something usps the new freaking postmaster general is a total douche bucket if i ever meet him in the streets i'm gonna fight him [Music] dudes just made everything screwed up for the mail so something that was supposed to come thursday of last week it is now tuesday still not here um so sorry about that guys we got some dope glass coming we have some dope glass right here though i mean check that custom carb cap out made by dz glass look at that opal look at that opal look at those wags look at the crushed opal in that neck and that down stems neck thing there yeah pop to the side look at that it's so badass can't get enough of this thing but yeah bubba kush live sugar calypso kind of a surprise kind of garlicky kind of nice very stoney very in the couch good amount of pain relief on the arthritis end um but for the most part just like really nice flavor nice and relaxing on the effects can't really can't say anything bad about it because it's just really enjoyable so i give this one a 10 out of 10. it looks great it's saucy it's got turfs not a ton of them but enough that it has a crazy flavor that's all we really care about right as long as the chirps are there and the flavor is good and the effects are strong we're getting our money's worth right so check that out if you get chance bubba push by calypso sugar and or sauce if you can get it i gotta check out their batter butter i don't know if that's high terp stuff but maybe their batter butter has lots of chirps i'm gonna find out we'll find out uh lots of sales this week for thanksgiving get your sale on guys go to the dispensary websites check

they're just not satisfied with what they're doing their painting is just they're just not coming out the way they want and i think if there's a secret to human nature it's the fact that we aren't satisfied we're never satisfied what is up everybody welcome back to the channel pines trees a 21 and over medical cannabis review channel out of the great state of pennsylvania how is everybody doing you know what time it is guys you see the shirt it's been a couple days all i've been doing i feel like all i've been doing lately is moxie reviews but they've been dropping the heat and even when they even in between them dropping the heat i've been picking up on the last heat that they were dropping so like we're just out here we're just getting it man high high quality dabs that's what we're about now so hopefully hopefully hopefully this one is interesting every everybody said this has been out before now it was out last year i didn't i didn't pick up on or maybe it just maybe it just got by me i don't know but today what we have is of course as you can see ah a little bit of moxie and what it is is zod zod zod live resin sugar yeah so new to me but apparently out a year ago zod is supposedly a banger everybody says that they really like zod and i'm excited to give it a shot i gotta pull up the info where we at there we go we got to get them terps up let's get into it zod by moxie kings in the game oh that's a high percentage we got thc a coming in at 87.76 cbga coming in at 2.18 that is a lot of cbga and cbg coming in at 0.89 for a total cannabinoid profile of 90.83 percent yes 90.8 90. i love high high high high percentages of cannabinoids it is my thing love those high percentages let's hope that the terps are just as high let's grab this this will help all right we got alpha pining coming in at 0.032 we have beta pining coming in at 0.084 beta mercine 0.646 limonene 0.642 osamine 0.042 terpinaline 0.359 linalool 0.436 essential alcohol 0.211 uh beta-caryophiline 2.195 that's nice alpha-humaline 0.571 uh karyophylene oxide 0.034 and alpha busy bolo 0.336 so yeah we got some terps we definitely have a decent amount and what is beta carrier filing was the winner in there two plus percent so yeah looking good always so many to read ah it's like the bane of my existence reading that list but you won't hear me complain because they're the best i would rather have too many than not enough some of these companies have like three listed that is not good enough for me let's give her the smell check the smell testaroo okay okay zod all right i see you buddy very like uh floral let's move it around really see if we can because it is like a fresh flower i followed up with that that kick a lemon we got some lemon kick a little bit of gas in there but yeah it's very nice very very oh very floral i've been doing this lately i've been getting all ahead of myself but check this out there we go so that is some very pretty saucy sauce gold gold gold gold yeah that is that gold stuff right there [Music] very nice and sugary it smells so good it's almost like flowers and an orange or like a an orange and a lime almost it's very like citrus and flowers [Music] very fragrant i like it i hope it tastes the same as it smells so yeah i hope you guys are out there dabbing along with me uh big shout out to drew james um all the guys i mean and the ladies what's up chase and sam and just everybody that i know paulie what up uh willie what's up everybody i mean just understand everybody oh oh my goodness oh that's that fire that got me coughing a little bit oh my goodness wow so we got a hybrid on our hands oh wow what's the internet say so this is a hybrid it's kryptonite and viper city og nice those are two killer strains kryptonite is a just a heavy hitting indica viper city og tastes amazing one of the better ogs says it's relaxing sedative euphoric it's good for pain management and anxiety i would i would agree with all of those things this is nice definitely definitely pick up on the kryptonite flavor profile it's definitely a nice indica dominant hybrid very indica dominant [Music] and the flavor is just nuts oh goodness where are my flavor hunters at out there this is one of those ones you're gonna want to pick up on scott my dude scott you might want to go back out to the store and pick up some zod i know i know you just picked up man i know and i know you go heavy on the pickups because you try not to go like i know you're uh not trying to take that trip too often but bro you might have to pick this one up it's a good one i'm not it's got that flavor dude big news pretty sure we finally talked drew into getting an email what up drew gonna get an email stepping into the into the the new age although you do have a you do have a peak so i guess that you you're basically smoking a robot so i guess i can't really say you're you're stepping into the new age you're just stepping into a better era because i'm not a huge fan of smoking on them robots bro i do not like smoking robots oh yeah i gotta put the lid on this we gotta save a little bit of this one wow it kicks it's a slapper it's go [Music] yup i can see that that's special right there i don't call for [ __ ] oh man this one's got me all right so it's tastes a lot like kryptonite because it's kryptonite and viper city og but it's got more of a like it's got that flowery floral thing going on but it's got more of a lemon lime to it it's very sweet but still very like floral which is very nice it smells absolutely amazing this stuff smells crazy like it smells like a you wish you could buy a bouquet of flowers that smelled as good as that like it's what flowers should smell like it's what flowers probably used to smell like before we bread the smells out of flowers shame on us by the way it's got me super stoned because i just brought up the breeding out of the smell of flowers so obviously i'm heavily medicated but yeah the stuff this stuff slaps for sure as far as effects pain free absolutely pain free very chill very mellow very like just relax hang out have a good time listen to some music kick back you know just you know have a good time this stuff is pretty good so let's get down to it as always let's get down to brass tacks do we have to say about it well first off it looks amazing but they always look amazing it's what we've come to learn uh consistency always with the moxie um flavor wise slap city uh if you like kryptonite you'll love this this stuff is on point it's like kryptonite plus an addition of sweet lemon lime you know it's like beautiful floral notes and then lemon lime and it's like almost tropical you know it almost gives you like that feeling of like something tropical and just awesome so yeah this stuff is great looks and smells awesome effects are a 10 out of 10 um the price 50 bucks for a half gram i've been saying it a lot lately and i saw it again i got an email or i saw it on instagram or something uh cures doing a sale i don't know if there's a cure near you cure pa that's a dispensary c-u-r-e i know i pronounce things strange cure but cure is having a sale on moxie right now i'm not positive i don't remember exactly what it was but they're doing something most places are running sales so you'd be hard-pressed to go and find moxie full price at a place right now i feel because i've been going all over and finding that if you're willing to get two half grams you're gonna run into a deal every time almost so i feel like uh maybe it was a wave that started and like took off like a couple places had sales and then those places heard or other places heard that those places were doing what they were doing and they were like we're gonna do that too but it feels like uh like a fire was lit and there's like a sale on moxie just people are realizing like yeah we can we can definitely probably get rid of way more product if we start giving our patients better deals like i also saw like twenty percent off alera products like what i mean i get why because you know it's a lara but if you're into like making your own edibles or turning like shatter or wax into uh oil and then turning that oil into like butter and baking cookies with it and stuff go get your 20 off alera it's not like you're smoking it you're eating it you're not gonna you're not really gonna taste how off they make it as long as the potency is there you can basically decarb out all that badness like if you decarb it all out you could get it all out of there easy so do a little research but some there's some pretty good deals right now out there and if you're the kind of person that does the edibles thing and you want to try making your own caps or something because you saw somebody else who does it or you know people who do it then go grab up that 20 off stuff or if you're looking for really good concentrates i'm sure you can go find moxie right now on sale pick up the zod if you're into an indica heavy hybrid pick up the zod this stuff tastes off the charts but yeah definitely a 10 out of 10 definitely two thumbs up super happy i got this everybody on instagram right now is talking about like if they if you're friends with a bunch of people in the pa medical like i am usually people pick up like pick up the drops as they come you know and everybody you know you go on instagram and you'll see everybody taking pictures of what they got with this drop every person i saw that took a picture of this one had great things to say about it so i was like i had to go get it even though i didn't like have to go get it if you know what i mean like i went and got it because i had i had to try it and it is definitely as strong as everybody says it is it's like but it's not too strong but it's definitely like strong it's not making words hard so like it's definitely got that hybrid there's the sativa there but it's a strong indica but yeah if you like the videos as always hit that like and subscribe button it helps me greatly it costs you nothing but it makes me feel real nice because i know that you guys like the videos and i should just keep cranking on them keep making the videos because people like the videos so i think the next video i'm gonna make is gonna be a little bit more on the educational side um i have a queue of videos i have a bunch of videos right now but like i feel like making an educational video right now would be helpful because i was in a line ordered some you know ordered this actual order and uh there was um in and like you know like my mom's age couple like a woman a man um a husband and wife and they were at the dispensary together and apparently they both had their cards but they like to go in together and shop together and as we were standing in line they were really nice and they were talking to me and i asked them like i was like hey what are you guys like what do you guys like to smoke on are you guys dabbers do you guys like flower do you like into the edibles cause like i'm always curious and most people in that age bracket have the same like response and it's like they love flower they smoke flower but like they want to know what dabs are they don't know what dabs are dabs are scary what are dabs how do i what do i what are the concentrates about that's literally like this gentleman was like i'd really like to know more about what the concentrates are about so i like tried to educate him and tried to like tell him how to how to learn how to consume concentrates but it really dawned on me that i should be making the video that helps those people because i have so many apparatuses at my disposal and i've helped so many other people like buy an email or get good medicines like so i'm i'm gonna start doing an educational series basically and it's gonna start off with just like what are concentrates how do you consume them what are the different methods what's the easiest way what are the more advanced ways that are a little more i would say like an e-nail it's a little more advanced but it's not as wasteful because it doesn't waste as much as say uh like a puffco pen thing because those things they just they eat all your concentrates and then you get a puddle in there and then you throw the thing away and you get in it's just it's very wasteful so i feel like there's a time and a place for a lot of these apparatuses i feel like there's a whole generation of people out there that could use a hand and maybe yeah like i don't know i even even people might even people younger than me people older than me just people just a lot of people don't know and are uneducated on what this is why this is so awesome and what makes it so easy for me to smoke but why is it so scary because other people use a big loud torch that could burn down my house but do i have to do it that way absolutely not you do not have to do it that way so i think we're gonna get into an educational series also i have a bunch of i got a bunch of questions from scott about the differences in thc and thca and all the different terps and all that kind of stuff and i tried to steer him in the right direction and but i should probably answer your questions bro i'm going to answer your questions finally and we're going to get around to that stuff we're also gonna keep cranking out sorry that's how it got me we're gonna keep cranking on the reviews but we're gonna also do some educational stuff and try to help some people because that's more important honestly than telling you whether this is awesome or not because they're all this is i don't i try not to buy crap so like most of what i get is awesome sauce and that's just how i roll so it's time to get past the awesome sauce even though we're going to keep cranking on the awesome sauce we're going to crank out some educational stuff too so if you're into that i hope you stay tuned and i hope you subscribe so you can know when those videos come out and i'm gonna try to help some people and hopefully it becomes a thing and everybody can everybody can do this this is super easy this is plugged in to my wall naughty it's plugged into a surge protector so if i leave this on on accident which i don't ever do if anything were to happen surge protector surge protector and also like this it's it's got it's got a pretty pretty definitive weather it's on or whether it's off it lights up so so like yeah we need more of this stuff we need more people to be educated on like this cost me eighty dollars like this email not not not the whole setup but like the email itself cost this this part right here this part and this part was 80 bucks this part was another 20. uh the bomb we're not gonna even get into the price of because you don't have to have this bond you can have another bond your bone could look like this for like 30 bucks 20 bucks you could have one of these you do not need a multiple thousand dollar mothership you could have a beginner bomb and i can show you what a beginner bomb looks like so we're gonna get into it we're gonna get into it we're gonna get into it so hope you like the review sorry for it being long-winded but when i get when i get super lit i get crazy ideas and we're gonna get into it so i'll see in the next one pick up zod it is it is what i would call inspirational it is like it inspired me it inspired me to want to educate people who don't know so like if you're looking for a smoke that is inspirational pick up zod and i will see you in the next one peace out [Music] just [Music] let's make the most of this", "U4J0S2kmMYE": "and everybody it's a favorite doctor in the house dr. Matthew Roman internal medicine board-certified medical marijuana physician here at Nature's Way medicine if you need a medical marijuana card assessment in Pennsylvania please feel free to set up an appointment on nature's way medicine calm I've got a blog on there as well recently we've hit the 50 thousand patient marker for amounts of patients in Pennsylvania so we've got a lot of people in a thriving industry already we are just blowing the rest of the states out of the water we're really kicking butt we've got some great products so I'm here to review some of that today we are gonna be reviewing sour blueberry by prime wellness as you can see that's got my name on it I'm also a Pennsylvania medical marijuana patient with my own card as well as I'm also a doctor and I specialize in this stuff so let's give it a try shall we we will be using the volcano vaporizer and I am going to be setting it at 320 degrees Fahrenheit that's right why because that's slightly above where THC our active ingredient in this stuff boils it that's the I think it's like 316 and a half or something that I THC boils at I got a check for sure the exact number but anyway earlier today we were trying some Moxie flour and Moxie's a company here in Pennsylvania that's been making some awesome concentrate their flour was kind of but I wasn't really sure if that was because I was using the vaporizer and in Pennsylvania we're not allowed to smoke marijuana so we have to vaporize so I wasn't sure if there was less efficacy because of that or if it was just because the flour was kind of well I do know that Prime has made a couple strains now grown a couple strains and I recently tried some of their other flower product here that I purchased it was called the Afghan double chunk or double Afghan chunk man you know you got good good marijuana when it sounds like ice cream product mm-hmm anybody got any Girl Scout cookie chunk with some vanilla flavor on it oh good all right I'll take some of that Thanks the other popular way to name marijuana strains is of course by fruits or fruit I should say gosh my grammar is off what kind of a doctor am i when i see fruits but you get the point that's where the blueberry comes in and never quite tastes like the fruit though hmm but anyway let's see how strong it is because I know that the double afgan chunk oh I got it right that time was was really killer I mean this stuff was amazing so I highly recommend it is very strong today we will be trying one of their other flower strains the blueberry sour or sour blueberry excuse me sour coming likely from the strain Sour Diesel which is a West Coast as they all are basically today strain I can't wait till some of the East Coast strains start to get developed maybe I can have my hands in that so that we could show the West Coast what's up East versus West mother F oohs yeah you know what's up we're gonna make it like Tupac verse Biggie an East Coast gonna win again oh I said it we're gonna have the best strains one day but for now the West Coast has been dominating it because you know they're way ahead of us unfortunately hmm and so they developed a strain called Sour Diesel and I'm pretty sure I moment you know I'm certain that's where the sour comes from it's probably a mix of Sour Diesel and then this blueberry strain so let's give it a try shall we let me get rid of some of this ABV already been vaped I think that's what we called it John help me out here my co-host on the Tuesday streams was on today and he he he knows the acronym more than I do all right we're gonna dump out some of these already been vaped into my stash container it's there's not much in here you guys are probably thinking it's up to here already for no no there's yeah I could see the bottom to the surface of the bottom you know it's there's nothing in there barely but we're gonna keep adding it together until eventually we'll hopefully bake some brownies or do something with it I don't know teach everybody on the stream so if you like what we're doing here please make sure to subscribe to this channel give the video a thumbs up and make sure to be banging on that subscribe button cuz we use bangers here and those of you who know more about the stream know what I'm talking about and if you don't know what I'm talking about you need to watch it more so make sure to subscribe and bang on that subscribe button alright thumbs up or always good too alright now that I've cleaned this out for the most part let's see what the product looks like I'm gonna come to the other side this is a 360 video here so you can tell that I'm very very futuristic here on the medical marijuana doctor channel this is what we're trying Oh smells like sour D alright got that sour D smell to it some of you who have tried Sour Diesel know exactly what I'm talking about here's the bud looks very light not very dense I like my butt a lot denser let's do the Romans squeeze test it sticks you saw how it's stuck there that's how you know it's high-quality a lot of THC cuz it's sticky icky icky like Snoopy dog says and by Snoopy dog I meant to say snoop dog not Snoopy like the comic guy I don't know I'm I'm gonna weigh this doctor ever and I that's because all the way to all the doctors today are you know Middle Eastern and Indian that's why I'm the way just cuz I'm like super white plus there's few few of us white guys anymore alright anyway yeah we're dealing here off topic as I tend to do let's get this out in front of you guys so you could take a look beautiful well we were gonna talk about is how much percentage this stuff has so the percentage of th C's in here are is twenty point four percent not bad little lower than I think today's Moxie strain which was a San Fernando not San Francisco like I was saying uh how typical of me San Fernando Valley I think that was a twenty two percent or something like that so this is apparently a little weaker but guys where you get the bud from on the plant makes a couple percentage difference which plant you pick from the from the group makes a couple percentage difference the difference between the best plant you know in a plot of plants at the best spot of it pulling that piece off and the crappiest plant in that plot pulling the worst duck butt off of it it's like day and night so you always got to really just focus on the strain itself as a whole not that like there's an entourage effect or anything I'm not saying that I'm just saying you got to feel it out and really just give it a give it a chance even if the percentages are lower it's not all about the percentage all right let's give this stuff a try so we're gonna put it in the shredder as I call it pretty sure that's what it's called it's not a grinders a shredder it shreds it up because we don't wanna a grinder will tend to keep the bud a little bit together still in small pieces it'll grind it into coarse into finer material with a shredder it'll shred it up as fine as possible that's kind of how the teeth of the shredder are made so that you could really just grind it fine and the reason we want to do that is because as you see here we're gonna be filling up this sandwich of screens of metal screens of two metal screens which will blow air through the marijuana that's grinded up and because of that we want as much surface area as all right I think that should do look how fine that is you see take a look and I'm gonna show you the difference too so we'll put this over here and then I'll grab my grinder and we'll compare that to the grinder the grinders are meant for rolling marijuana into the marijuana cigarettes aka joints and blondes things like that because of that you don't want it to be too fine that'll actually mess up the the way the cigarette smokes the joint smokes you want the marijuana to be finer but still relatively coarse compared to this stuff so we'll I'll show you because that way it just smokes better and it's like a it's like a cigarette when you open up the tobacco on a cigarette it's not a powder if it were it would just smoke much worse for many reasons it's long threads we're long pieces like fibers right we call that I forget cancer-causing material well you get the point we want a similar effect with this stuff that's why a lot of grinders have these holes in there now in Pennsylvania we're not a lot of smoke so I haven't I haven't really been using this but what I will point out before I show you how a grinder grinds the stuff up is that look what I found this is the leftover double Afghan chunk baby and look at what I found in here where art thou there it is do you see it yet do you see it yep there it is look at that a little seed Oh somebody tell me legally what I'm allowed to do with this I'm pretty sure I shouldn't burn it burn it it's the devil I can be arrested for a font for having that how in the world did I get a hold of a seed ah that's illegal you're not allowed to have seeds unless you're a grower well I found it in here so I've been keeping it a little bit of my secret you know don't tell anybody guys I'm not gonna grow it don't worry I'll probably end up eating it later hopefully I don't choke on it you know that there's like people who have had plants grow out of their lungs they've choked on seeds and the seed grows in their lung and into a plant highly immunocompromised patients where the immune system has pretty much no possibility of finding anything these people the seed will just grow like a regular warm moist area environment it's disgusting anyway if you're gonna have a plant grow inside you you better at least make it medical marijuana all right that joke was terrible so let's see how this stuff grinds up you know regular grinder as opposed to a shredder the merit Nassim marijuana product see it all fell through and now we can compare it ooh sorry about the noise all right I know it looks relatively fine too but trust me when you put it next to it it's a bit coarser and the fact that this stuff is a bit powdery still compared to this stuff is a testament to the flower being probably too dry to be honest with you guys but anyway you can see a little bit of a difference there's not much of a difference you could probably make him equal by just going like that with your fingers oh this stuff is key fee I gotta say this looks like it's gonna be great so let's stuff it into the into the vaporizer Oh silly me there's a there's another layer there's a section between did I just see six all right by the way yes I have sometimes goofball jokes but you know what I do on the stream is not how I am in the clinic when I'm with a patient may everybody please know that so you've been warned all right can I just whack off on everything in here now huh just kidding mmm all right it's all for comedy sake all right uh let's let's stuff it stop it gosh Oh baby yeah all right I don't know I'm trying to do like a 90s song here ah [ __ ] you know what I'm talking about come on anybody here eighties kids anybody you know that was 90s what I'm talking about ah push it that was like Space Jam wasn't it sometime around then oh boy this stuff is so key fee bikie fee I mean that a lot of the crystals on the outside have you know that's that it seems to be full of those crystals basically all right so we put this thing on the vaporizer has been warmed up for a while now in fact it just turned itself off it's thought I wasn't using it for a while that's good oval you know German mechanics right there thank you stores in Diggle for looking out for me oh I just burned myself that's it I'm gonna sue that company how dare they not put protection against my lips on there all right we're back to the right temperature again so we're gonna put this on top and I almost forgot my little baggie where's my bag for the vaporizer there it is all right let's fill it up 3:20 is as low as you can basically go we're gonna fill this up with some very clear air and see if we can actually get medicated from this temperature from from only 320 I think that's when it has the peak flavor and THC amount with the least amount of smoke and unnecessary byproducts alright let's give it a try shall we this stuff tastes amazing it's like blueberry compare you know combined with sour dee I really like it Wow the flavor is fat it's just great it's almost like a tropical fruity flavor to it it's got a tropical aroma to it Wow we really need to start describing these flavors and aromas in a more consistent pattern I have to admit even though I've used marijuana my whole life I don't have a good grasp on how to describe one particular flavor over another one and I don't think anybody really does I think people just pretend they do oh it's a it's a little bit of a buttery tropical fruit earthy aroma with a tad bit of piney evergreen nuances and a little bit of a G cush aftertaste it's all gone all right fill it up again my friend [Music] it's me the doctor in the house I need to have better posture I'm always slouching oh it's cuz I made my living in my whole life and everything in front of a desk at a desk studying learning reading always hunched over today I'm at the computer oh look at that beautiful thank you volcano you're my only friend oh yeah this is excellent for people with pulmonary problems if you have COPD God that we Roma is so good if you have COPD this is the way you want to inhale and for doctors out there with patients who want to use medical marijuana this is the optimal device ultimately it's the safest most practical vaporization device that you can as you can see you can use it with standard marijuana flour all my other streams you can see some more intense ways of using medical marijuana I like dabbing but this is by far the best for the lungs at a 320 degree temperature I'm still getting medicated albeit a little bit more slowly but nevertheless it's far safer I don't feel like I need to coffee at all I don't feel any irritation this is the way to go so medical marijuana doctors out there if you want to tell your patients how to use this stuff I recommend telling people to use the volcano and I'm not paid by this company either yet Storz and Bickel please call me for some kind of discount on your products thank you hopefully in the future we'll have a link below that you can click to buy the product and in in the future I may have some kind of affiliation with that in fact I probably will be making like a hundred percent of whatever it is you're spending haha I don't know why I just did that kind of laughs but I should stick with the more evil laugh oh all right maybe mr. burns yeah yeah I don't know I'm working on my evil ass huh excellent product all right maybe one more bag now I have a much higher tolerance than those people as you can see I'm basically still functioning just fine it's almost like nothing really happened to me well that's how it will be with most of your patients out there actually once they become familiar with the product with the with the medicine it's like kids and non-alcoholic beverages if you give 14 year olds at a party a bunch of non-alcoholic beer you know what that's gonna make them feel like they are going to be drunk and if you don't tell them that it's non-alcoholic and they continue to live on their lives thinking that day was real alcoholic beer for the rest of the lives that experience was irregular they're drunk they remember that is being drunk yeah I forget where I'm going with this right now but basically marijuana has the same kind of effect I was going somewhere with that but sometimes when you're just on and on and on you just forget what the hell you're talking about you try to babble on for all these hundreds of hours videos and everything makes sense but basically your patients there go okay and now I remember the beat the patients are gonna feel goofy from the marijuana pretty much as long as they think that that's how they're supposed to feel from it but if you treat it as a medicine as something that yeah it gets you high but the high doesn't make you a disordered Ian disoriented it doesn't make you discombobulated just coordinated uncoordinated I should say it doesn't do that stuff it doesn't f with you makes your memory a little bit off sometimes what did I just what was I saying just now where was I going with this just like how you witnessed that pretty much there's a little tiny bit of that you know versus human error in normal memory I think we're just consciously cherry-picking you know what we think marijuana does to us pretty much and so anyway if you treat it in a more responsible way and you tell the patients look yeah you're gonna get high but you can still function normally it doesn't that being high it's it in fact it makes you work better if anything I'm better at concentrating if you if you format it that way even though that may not be true it's a little bit of a fib just as it's a little bit of a fib to tell people that using medical marijuana in combination with physical activity makes the marijuana work better and function better it's a little bit of a fib but it helps direct the way the patient's feel from it and grounds them so that they can get the fullest the most amount of medicine medicinal benefits from it with the least amount of psychological ooh I'm disoriented I'm high from this and my point is I'm using this stuff and I'm still speaking about this in a way that other physicians have never been able to speak about it to the public and to other doctors like yourselves out there if you're a physician and I'm okay I'm doing it and guess what I'm gonna go to sleep happy I have that's because I'm actually helping people in everyday with this stuff instead of putting people on pain meds and stuff like the drug dealer I mean that's give me pain management doctors you know I'm but I can also go to sleep easier because it's a great insomnia medicine and it's good for everything it's a great antidepressant not everything that's a gradient the president greetings I oolitic etc etc especially if you allow it to be and if you format it to be people if you crap it to be and prime it to be that way that's why the indica sativa stuff is all [ __ ] because people get told hey man is an indica this is gonna make it couch lock this is sativa you're gonna be like whoa you could go out and party with this stuff whoa watch out it's like ecstasy people are so we're so influenced by our cycle our psyche and our environment that we're like oh my god he's right I think I'm hallucinating whoa this is the strongest ateva ever that's why you'll never hear anybody go dude I thought that this was an indica what's up with that Geno it's a sativa clearly that doesn't happen because marijuana especially and THC especially its effects pretty much accommodate to the psychological environment and the expectations of the patient as well as the medicinal needs of the body so in that way it's the most unique and amazing medicine of all time by the way that I mentioned to give this video a thumbs up if you liked it yeah and share it with other people so that people can learn about medical marijuana from a physician standpoint and the doctor who's actually been experienced working with this stuff for years now I may look like Doogie Howser like I'm you know eleventeen now big boy but I'm actually the most experienced physician in this stuff probably in the world right now from a clinical standpoint I know there's people out there like Raphael McCool um and things like that you know and people like him I should say who uh who have a lot more experience tons more but they're more based or theory based I'm clinical I apply this in the real world to the patients I talk to them like a real doctor like a real personal friend or sometimes not a friend either sometimes I'm a bit of a you're on to me pain pills buddy and you know it and I'm not gonna let you get by then another day without me telling you that you're pretty much addicted to this stuff fully you know it ain't your fault but anyway I talk to the patients the way you have to and that's part of the clinical job of being a medical marijuana doctor if you want to learn how to be more like me in the clinical setting there will be instructional videos that I will be making in the near future hopefully that will be going out there for sale for physicians so that you can be more customed and more comfortable discussing cannabis use with your patients behind your closed doors don't worry I'll make sure when you tread those waters will be nice and safe I will be your guiding light think of it like a vape pen light just follow it into the distance and bring your wallet it won't be free like these awesome YouTube streams that are live so make sure to like it and hit

the silent films the silent flicks no no no no I'm I'm 2018 I'm like Google AI ahead of everybody I'm like deep thought you know come on guys I'm Tesla SpaceX Elon Musk level except I'm doing this stuff on the medical side I'm on the cutting edge of medicine right now and the edges right here that's it that's me so make sure to share about this stream if you're new year cuz we like people who share this stuff all right I'm not gonna end the stream early or anything I'm just kind of bored it's Sunday night it's 7:30 I'm gonna have to change the battery in a bit for this you know ghetto 360 camera you guys are using but don't worry the cameras gonna get better soon it's there's just a delay on it something about some parts to it being held up in Germany I don't know Germany why are you helping me all right one more bag from you and then we're gonna have to hit the bangers cuz this is just ain't doing it dear Pennsylvania policymakers I'm very desperate for being allowed to smoke marijuana again I was once a patient in Delaware where it was allowed to be smoked and I felt so much better medicated allay than I do with a thing no offense to use Storz and Bickel I'd burn myself again all right oh that's like life - life support yes mouth-to-mouth please oh I'm alive again it's like my spinach call me Popeye where's my olive all right power off let's take a look babe a BB already the base all done alright we'll put it in the pot and this is what it looks like after all that and I do feel medicated look it's basically still completely green so we're gonna put that in here wasted flower a little bit that's okay that would have lasted probably 10 times more of what we just already did maybe that one was a little prematurely thrown in there not sure why I did that could have just saved it in there alright regrets are not necessary if he mo lova regrets you can be a sad person that's for sure let's be happy that we did it the way we did yay all right now I know it's a live stream and you guys are all commenting hey dr.

"welcome to weed which is i'm tatiana I'm tanuki and in continuing our 4 for 22 and joint months we are doing the tahoe OG we got it from the pot zone like I said it was for 420 and it's by dreamcatcher let's get this open and try it oh they put their pretty label over the thingy they are really pretty labels I always feel bad when I destroy labels I'm such a freak I had to break the tube last time there there we go they're like super hard to open it's like super green and kind of I don't know it's got kind of a weird after smell that's familiar but I don't know what it is it's very subtle but a very intense version of the scent if that makes any sense which it probably doesn't okay that's like this thing and it looks like it's another super hard pack which makes them kind of a [ __ ] to smoke actually this one's drawing pretty easily okay that's good to know was it tastes like paper definitively like paper that is a problem we have with the raw papers they taste like paper you can't taste the weed it doesn't make them a bad rolling paper just we'd like to taste the weed a little like soap like homemade like herbally so uh my hands smell like like soap yeah that's weird what you do wash your weed maybe that's why they call it taco alright so we will smoke the rest of this it's not very harsh either that's true sure so we'll smoke the rest and tell you what we think in a minute and we're back so other than an extreme mouth nummy varying mouth numbing yeah and the fact that it tastes like okay one time I used to smoke tobacco one time I accidentally put my role in tobacco through the washer it tastes like my Rolie tobacco did after I dried it all out smoking because tobacco's [ __ ] expensive it tastes like paper soap and just a tiniest hint of like cocoa it's weird but it's not bad it keeps going out and it just did this is like six time it's done it which is super annoying so that is tahoe OG five dollars at the hot zone for early the pet rock

o.g biscotti skywalker og and cherry jubilee mark them all without their lids see if i could taste which one is which and rank them by the flavor of the taste all right killed extracts blind taste terp challenge let's go with the first one here [Music] [Music] um that's nice smooth tape [Music] really clueless how much flavor it is it's gonna be a pure gas on this one we'll go with biscotti [Music] yeah that was the green top all right second down from guild it's not spread out both sides [Music] [Music] [Music] dude that one a little hotter so it's kind of hard to taste let me guess skywalker [Music] all right so that last two they took brett to show you what color it was that is the white sticker there's the next one up at number three [Music] hopefully it's not a hot hit like last one [Music] all right let's go for it [Music] i'm gonna go with venomogee on that one [Music] so i think the birdshit was the best but the one before it was a little hot so i couldn't tell this is better than one before all right here we go the next one this is the blue on the phone [Music] so uh they're all very similar i don't know why i'm getting a little cherry taste from that one i kind of got a little cherry taste from the first one though too so but i didn't pick that for the first one so i'll pick this one cherry jubilee for now [Music] one more to go [Music] final hint fifth one this one's like a little bit more on that saucy type of sugar [Music] [Music] oh last one i have is try fight cookies so i can see it being that i'm gonna put it at fourth for now i might take a hit

can't see it with that light that was all guild extracts let's stay tuned for the results all right time for the results for the guild extracts blind taste turf challenge first we have skywalker og i said skywalker was white [Music] that is why i got that one correct one for one tri-fi cookies it's a trifle with the pink that is green so that one is wrong next we have venom og i said venom was yellow that was blue so that one is wrong cherry jubilee i said was blue i know that one's wrong because blue is right there that was pink which give us the last one which was the scottie butter which was the yellow i said it was the green one out to five correct it's really tough 20 the one that i got right was the one that i kind of took the hot hit on [Music] all right here's the rankings so first place tri-fi cookies place was venomogene third place was biscotti we have skywalker og and i was the only one that i guessed [Music] someone was the one that i took a little hot originally i said it was last but i re-hit it again and i liked it a little better than this one which was the cherry jubilee which came in last but not least these were all half [Music] and grams you have it

unbroken chain that's the one i'm gonna do a review of soon soon and you're gonna see the difference of how excited i am and some people on my comment like i think it was two videos ago they said for me to review some guest bed gardens as well so this one is for you fam oh my gosh and all the other strains that from the last pickup i had not the 500 thing not the the not that video the 500 one but the one before they're all gone so i can't do any mixtures of the sunday driver and [ __ ] they're all gone just do a little ring boom cheers [ __ ] tasty as [ __ ] bro it's crazy that you don't feel like you're smoking weed bro like this is you don't feel anything like after you exhale you feel a little something just a little tingly but look at the edge hopefully y'all can see how good is burning already the that's one puff one puffin it's canoeing a little bit well that's cause of my roll because i did a collage i don't have king size anymore ran out of raw papers and i got to use the one and a quarter from vibes that's another video i'm gonna do i'm gonna do it another video like that i'm gonna do vibes versus raw see which paper burns uh slower because i saw a video on ross page that he had two two fedex joints right and he was talking [ __ ] that some papers are fast burning and some are not so let's see it's a good thing because like you know that raw raw is raw bro like rose been around for so long that rose is gonna be wrong but that's for the other video look at this but i'm already sweating this is awake and bait this is awake and big like i haven't smoked [ __ ] it's eight o'clock in the morning i'm trying to fix this canoe bro you don't cough like i ran out of air like this [ __ ] look at this amazing amazing guest spec gardens bro yo i i can't say nothing y'all are amazing the price is a little higher but it's totally worth it because you get what you paid for bro late because there's some strange that you pay and you're like damn this [ __ ] is not worth it this with this much smoked i'm already eyebrow i already feel high i could put this down and go play some video games and i'll be fine then i'll pick this back up to take a couple more puffs and i'll high again and that's saying a lot but i smoked quite a bit quite too much and for a joint to give me this height but like it's the waking bait too you know so not even that high that high like i'm not you know it's not too puffy you quit this [ __ ] like it's it's just a good smoke a good healthy smoke that you smoke and you want to smoke it again like right after you film and we're going to take a bong rip right after this one too because probably i'm gonna finish like the joint either on live or something because you already know bro the instagrams lives be late late so if y'all if you're ever bored after watching a video online and you don't want to see some more content you already ran out of content go to my instagram bro i got videos for days you probably gonna catch me live because i'm live every day on instagram every day bro i go live on instagram every day especially if i'm off work like this like today bro after this i'm gonna go live i just didn't went live yet because i'm like i gotta do awake and make for the insta for the for the youtube reviewing this stream and the weekend biggest for y'all and now i'm going to grind up some [ __ ] some more of this wow right here what's it called the tahoe champ and we're going to put it in a bomb take a bong rip out of there you gotta get baked to test this strain out but this strain like i already know bro it's amazing i'm gonna show you how the package comes in this flip it around got the strain name everything everything all right ash still burning beautifully the joint doesn't go out does not go out it's just like when you exhale it's just smoothness flavor that's what that at least that's what i'm looking for when i'm smoking a joint something nice and something pleasant that you you don't have to keep lighting it up like you don't have to like it's not harsh when you inhale you know what i mean you know what i mean like you know you smoke gas too you know you know what you smoke come on come on fam i know the people watching me all y'all do is smoke gas that's why y'all watch me because y'all feel the same weight we need to smoke gas bro oh yeah but hell yeah if and over here massachusetts is about to [ __ ] start snowing bro it's already raining tomorrow's gonna snow oh oh just smell bro it's so strong so good any i don't know what it smell like like i'm horrible with like oh it smells like this or it tastes like that like i suck at that [ __ ] this smells like some fire bud bro that's all i can say i feel like if it was in portuguese i'll be able to describe it a bit better you know because like i'm not you know american so i don't know all of your [ __ ] candies and chocolates so like i can mix and match like the flavors the flavor profile to a candy you know i can associate that [ __ ] with an american candy or something it's more like portuguese candy i associate [ __ ] with my like you know with the [ __ ] that i ate in portugal all my life over here like i see like custom grow and [ __ ] like that like when they smoke they associate their weed with stuff that they like tried here that they've tasted here some like [ __ ] candies or some [ __ ] like i've never had that so you know um i can never compare it like they like they do but trust me if i say it's flavorful it's flavorful trust me just go with my word if i tell you to buy this and you come across it buy it then tag me and you're gonna see and you're gonna be like bro top smoker good looks bro you gave me the best advice in my life i needed to try some gas back gardens and now we got the gas bed gardens in the bowl the joint oh it's just getting clogged already not a good thing that's the thing when you roll without a filter bro fire but always wants to clog up thumbnail maybe let's get it all right i could use the cherry of the joint to light the bowl but it's too big of a bowl you know it's not gonna it's gonna [ __ ] it up all right fam cheers let's get this [ __ ] afm beaker the bong water's not dirty i just changed it yesterday night so like i only took a bong rip so this [ __ ] is still good it was last night so i'm not going to switch it [ __ ] it all right toker poker let's get it ah groovy make breathings that's how he does it too breathe in breathe out not the cough hi jesus [ __ ] it oh super it's smooth but like you know it picks up that punch in the chest you know when you clear that chamber that [ __ ] goes straight to your [ __ ] chest yes sir bro oh now this one took me to cloud9 for real that's what i mean bro this like this bud is just a force just a force of nature and if you see the roots that bro go on their website go on their instagram same name guest bed gardens bro you see the roots that they post on the planes it's something stupid bro like it's [ __ ] looks like hair dripping down off the plants and that's roots so you know that's a healthier ass plant you know the more roots that the plant has the healthier it is jesus christ bro some guys future video too i'm going to show you all my grow up it's the second time i'm growing already another video i got to do is review my first bud that i grew i have it right there i gotta review that one and then i'm gonna show you my second grow that is going on right there i'm growing some gmo the clones off the mother plants of my first grow so i took 15 clones out of those

mood i've been really depressed so i'm trying to just rise above it get myself out of that oh for the purposes of tonight's review folks i cleaned up the g pen i cleaned out the rig not only is it fresh water but it has been chilling in the freezer refrigerator for about the last half hour 45 minutes so it's good and chilly it's good and fresh okay let's break into this one rhythm balance live resin strain strain bow total cannabinoids 89.2 percent thc 0 thca 87.3 cbd 0 cbga 1.7 cbg 0.2 total terpenes 7.4 percent mercene 3.4 percent limonene 0.8 percent b car point six percent terpillin point six percent pinene point six percent little all point three percent packaged april 14 2020. expiration 421 2020 obviously one year as they always do so i did a little homework on this one and it wasn't as easy to find as i thought so i came up with three things the first was they said they claimed it was dance hall and blueberry cross that's what i found with the first one don't know where they got that from don't know don't care the next one i found was that each batch is different they're not going to find the same like this batch is this next batch will be different this one says alchemy jack skellington jack the ripper jelly bean and quirkle again i don't know it's you can't find it it's hard to lock down that i wish they had better genetics information so i have no idea those are the things that i found the third like i said the third thing was that none of the batches are the same so either way i was excited i was like ooh strain mo sounds exciting you know sounds like a mixture which is what i like i like hybrids i'm all about my hybrids oh as you can see i haven't cracked into it yet that sticker's still intact we will break the seal together oh so satisfying [Laughter] all right peachy little jar yes i was referring to the color and being silly i do love these jars i do they're perfect size they are the only ones that are the perfect size to fit in the little concentrate pocket on the g pen connect case so i can either take more rhythm concentrate or put my own concentrates in these rhythm jars and pop them in the g pen connect case and take them on the go with me so i do love the g i love rhythm and gti for that that's like the perfect size jar they're not ridiculously big okay let's crack her open oh with some pretty looking stuff i'm gonna crack the light on here let's see hmm that's an interesting nose um hold on just a second let me make sure i smelled that correctly because it almost had a chemical smell at first no no it's um hmm it's it's like citrusy so it could i could see where i got that chemical thought originally it's got a very citrusy odor but not enough to be like overpowering just i like that i really like that smell and if you look at that that's really pretty stuff it's not too bright it's not too dark i mean you can see it's really nice color it it looks fantastic um i picked this one up and i picked up another one that came as a 2 gram bucket i really hope it's good because it's a two gram bucket um if not hey edible time um but yeah let's bust into this here and get a fatty in my freshly cleaned g pen this is crazy we're gonna go in hard yeah we're gonna get a little ridiculous yep i hope everybody has been staying safe doing well my county is one of the counties that is being rolled back to yellow phase for pennsylvania with the corona stuff so they'll be easing my restrictions in my area starting may 8th if all goes according to plan who knows what the hell that's going to mean for me so far nothing's changed we're still in you know crazy lockdown mode and my hours are still [ __ ] up and you know it is what it is but hopefully you guys are making do staying safe staying well staying medicated all right let's crack into her fire it up cheers uh hmm not too shabby i just looked down and noticed the agri-kind button says we're growing i certainly hope so oh sorry i'm just having one of those days uh wow yep oh that was uh yup so it's an interesting flavor not very not very uh overpowering or strong uh oh wow hmm i don't know not too shabby i like it got me feeling a little chill definitely a heady buzz uh okay tell you what i think i think i need another one give it my honest opinion here yeah i think this is doing the trick this is calming me down it's mellowing me out which is what i wanted to do you know it's the end of the day i am excited about my mail call um you know i don't have to work tomorrow which is nice some days i always have off so there is that uh as for what's been bothering me just really rather not get into it it's personal let's just say people suck and sometimes those you trust most can be the ones that are right in your back that's all i'm going to say on that so let's go in for number two shall we oh wow a little bit of throat breath on that one not too shabby not too shabby folks i'm not gonna say it's my favorite thing in the world i'm not most the biggest fan of the flavor um i really like the effects though um yeah very strong um fast acting pain relief let me tell you pain relief i tore or not torb i threw

or some of the other oh geez you know i want to pick it up it's really unique it's not your typical everyday you know dro this is us definitely worthy of being a top-shelf strain for sure oh yeah I

Earth a little bit of fruit yeah Wow very og man its top-notch yeah I'm very impressed with the strain this looks like it's gonna be on there very well cured and well ground mm-hmm and I wanted to mention how helpful they were at the tree of wellness today they found so many deals for us that they had deals that were surpassed the new member deals they had easily 20 strains up on the Shelf of different grades every one of them true to their name the durban poison smelled like durban poison there was no question that the the you know these are legit strains the tree of wellness is definitely buddy going on very impressed very impressed oh nice high to very nice Alexi oh it tastes de vine it is long expanding its lung expanding without being does it does it's not one of them that just punch you in the gut and make you start choking yeah is the expansion seems to creep a little bit deeper Isis the van yes this has got to be one of the best strains I've had yet since I have been smoking weed yeah that's been a long time yes very very good it's certainly worthy of being called tahoe OG yes all the awards everything just fit it perfectly this is a great strain see a very impressed here um I've got to give this the a there's no question I've got to give this a it's just so good it's a smooth it is tasty you know there could be some better bud structure there we can have some bigger more fuller did sir nose yes but you know this stuff is great definitely check them out you got it you gotta go by trigger wellness and see what they got they've got some unbelievable strains they have cataract kush they had a lot we wish we could have got more to review for you guys but we did get a few things so we'll bring you some good treats over the next few days oh yeah that

"sxDIwxJxulA": "i've been hella lagging but uh have a absolute x-trax blue tahoe g and yes i have been using this hologram still like to give a comprehensive review on how i feel about it as this is how is this i think it's from ease like a big i type dispensary so i think more people should be able to access this which is definitely a plus and if my damn battery wants to work then i can actually hit this thing sorry about this whoa well first things first with this absolute extract without even needing a blinker the clouds are just ridiculous oh yeah i gotta give you all some [ __ ] ass information it's across wait what is your crosswalk i guess it's like a balanced uh 50 50 in nickel tahoe og kush and crusted blueberry i thought it was like blue dream and tahoe og but i think blueberry the dream has blueberry in it i could i think it's blueberry and haze i don't know i completely remember for that first hit this blue taco actually tastes like hmm now is there even a way to describe it damn it might just taste the exact way you'd expect it because a blueberry is usually a little uh a little on the earthy very fruity but at the same time it's like damn this is some pungent like this is some weed weed but at the same time tahoe might be one of the gassiest skunky not skunk i think weed is more you think more pine and grass is guitar might be one of the weediest weed terpenes strings flavors taste smells that exists it's just like i think it's even more pungent than like og kush like just some [ __ ] green [ __ ] you know um and the fact that you get that in a cart due to it being some live resin is actually incredible oh and i taste some like blue like blueberry or something it's like oh my god and yeah i could definitely attest to it being a balanced hybrid oh my lord she hit me between the eyes you can feel them getting watery and [ __ ] oh big ol hit that [ __ ] in my whole body too um i'll say trickling down from my head sometimes if i smell like a super strong indicator it might go toes up or some weird [ __ ] but hey that's it's a that's a very very strong car because i've already smoked wax today so nothing should have really elevated me to this point but um this is like a 10 star out of five this is incredible probably top three all time with like bloom farms and uh i don't know maybe some rock garden and i'm not completely sure because rock garden has a lot but i know bloon farms now absolute extracts and select elite live resin those are like the top absolute top of brands and there's actually a lot that are just right there with them um i guess raw garden would be an example of what i just think road garden should maybe like a slight step down because it's not like actual live life rest and it's not dark and [ __ ] you know but uh with that dark live resin oil i don't think they did the cold extract process [ __ ] either uh doesn't mean i don't love my house so i have a few on me right now but he's easy five stars incredible stream i'm not [ __ ] baby", "9pke6JrEmtY": "what's up guys so this is my closet grow right here it's Tahoe gee this is day 67 from seed [ __ ] I was a nine pound hammer then I got a cherry pie and I got another Tahoe Jeannie yeah well I shall think let me know I got this for bitter fruit right again it's ROG day 67", "8EBuIYZDj5w": "hey what's up everybody many cover here today is the 21 of my 4000 watts Tahoe og flower room just to recap this is a 4000 watt sealed room air-cooled Magnum triple-xl Oh Cho reflectors burnin co2 in here for luma tech palace 4000 watt bulbs I've got 45 Tonga og plants in here on 5 gallon room acre pots just watered them very heavily with a ppm of right around a thousand pH was a 5.7 I've got some really bad news actually to tell you guys you know I do not hide stuff when it comes to my grows I try and talk about everything that's happening in them whether they be good or bad and I've got some bad news I was just watering these plants and my trained eye spotted a root a Fed so I continued to water and went back to the spot where I thought I saw that rude aphid and saw two more making that a total of three root aphids in this garden I've seen all right by this plant more about that in a second so I came in here today and I spread the plants out a little bit because if you remember last week's video I basically had the end of the canopy right at the edge of the light then I had kind of a darker spike in the center well this darker spot still is in the center but it's not it doesn't seem to hinder bud development whatsoever I mean the buds right underneath the lights are the same size of the ones right there I did spread the plants out a little bit though because I did have all the pods touching now they're just all you know got between two to four inches between them so I made the canopy longer or from this angle wider right now it's about Oh 9 feet by 7 feet step back here trying to view the whole thing yeah so it's about seven feet from here to there and nine feet from there to there maybe even eight by ten but this is as big as I've ever had a 4000 watt canopy so I really trying to maximize my grams per watt just Tahoe's extremely low yielding plants in my 8000 wild blue rhino fly room I think I got two and a quarter ounces off of my Tahoe plant remember I was doing a phenol hunting there with that room so I had a few different strains yeah like two and a quarter ounces and that's a fully matured well veg plant these plants all veg for 21 days I'll let them go basically just straight up and Kratt each other that would have a very full canopy no holes no whatsoever because I do want to maximize my buds if I could get four pounds off of this bro with 4000 watts I would consider that to be really good for an OG grow I plan on getting six pounds and I have a trick up my sleeve to do that however these Rudy foods proved to be difficult then that might be hindered and I might be back down around four pounds I haven't quite figured out why I have Rudy fits in my garden while watering I was brainstorming we've got a couple different theory of small few first one is the pots that I use for this grow I haven't used a lot of them in about a year beside extra pots the last time I use those pots was right after my 31 string flower room I remember that garden is when I first started to see some rude names in my garden and then the only other room where I had rude Athens was my two rivers I didn't tearooms had it in my 12 strain flour room it was one of the first videos I did a mass upload of when I came back to YouTube it's right at 12 different strains I had a few or David's in there but really barely any to speak of and then the grow before that I'll remember that grow I didn't use five gallon pots I used 10 gallon pots but they grow before that I had some rooted bits and that was my white widow flight room that I had never ended up uploading to YouTube it's not because I have root if it's that I decided not to upload it's actually because I stopped updating the garden after day 28 I basically did day 1 day 7 day 14 then bit day 28 night shots and then after that I had to stop shooting videos in that room so I didn't want to upload a half a room that girl actually turned out to be badass great stuff but it is 10 upload excited to have the full grow but I did have Rudy if it's in that room I remember talking on the forums online while I was doing that room talking about how I was getting rid of the roof ate a Fidel and Suez diatomaceous earth down around the pots and that got all over my pots and kind of made some of them really white because it's a white powder so what I wanted to do this grow and dug some of those pots out of my storage unit I saw that some of them have that white powder on them still so I knew that they were a part of that grow so one theory is that somehow like a Rudy fit egg survived in one of those old pots for like a year and then somehow hatched once I got these plants in here and like more cocoa in water that's one theory another theory is that they possibly came in through my lights I don't see how that could happen because I have a 12-inch max fan pushing the air in to these lights and internal inch max fan pushing air out so I've got like major airflow and for them to be able to like somehow get into the ducting go through the light find some cracks somewhere in order to get out through the light and then into the gardens like knowing how that could happen but just brainstorming the third idea and probably the most likely one is that my friend who has been coming over my house and hanging out quite a bit lately he has a garden that is packed well a month ago it was packed with Rudy because I mean he had bad [ __ ] Rudy it's like the worst I've ever seen and you know he'd come over and hang out at my house I'd go hang out at his house maybe there's a chance like one of them got on me or one of them got on him and then somehow got in this garden so that's probably what happened I've just seen those three after I saw the Rudy fits I continue to inspect while I was watering the plants and I didn't see any more watch I saw one so I've seen a few on this plant and then I saw one right over here is just like crawling on the edge of this pod so that's it so for total obviously they're they're not an issue right now but because we're d-21 and have what five or six more weeks to go I mean rude aphids laying twelve eggs a day can really spread fast so I haven't decided what means I'm going to take to get rid of these things or just trying to control them until it grows over it's a little too early in the grow to be trying to just race the roof brood aphids so I am gonna have to employ some technique in order to minimize their numbers obviously it could put up yellow sticky traps that would help I could throw down some diatomaceous earth like I did in my white widow flight and really that was the best thing or at the time the best thing that I ever used to get rid of him I literally caked the [ __ ] pots in the bottom of the plants and the floor all with diatomaceous earth literally is like all white everywhere was white and you got to keep that stuff dry in order for it to work so like I did a really good watering got a lot of air movement over the top of the pots to dry out the top of the pots hit him hard with diatomaceous earth and after that pretty much actually did not see another rhudi through the rest of the grow the other thing and the most successful thing that I've used for Rudy foods and I remember when Rudy foods were just starting to become popular in gardens you know a couple years ago or a year and a half ago I was one of the first people to get them I got them from a bag of happy frog and I was at the time the only person that I had known of that actually got rid of Rudy foods without destroying all my plants other people that had them ended up having to cut down all their plants in order to get them out of their garden I was the only person I knew that was successful at fighting them off and it's not because I'm any smarter than anyone it's because I'm persistent and pay a lot of attention to detail I don't let anything slide by and what I found is the best product to use for them is the bare tree and trub that you can get a home depot it's like in a blue bottle the liquid they have a powder now but the liquid is what I'd use that stuff works great you put that in your reservoir and drench your pots with that a couple times maybe two three times and you'll be I mean it would be I'd be surprised to be seen either Rudy but that you know when I say that you literally have to cover every square inch of every cubic inch of the medium so when you're watering your plant with that stuff he just kind of water in the center and the sides here are still dry it's not gonna work that's a half-ass job you literally have to get everything soaking wet it would be nice you just spill some over and get it on the floor you know like I'll let it I'll let it drain the way it's like you can see here I've got a little bit of drain to waste going on but with that stuff I mean you drench it hard you get everything with that do that a few times you know two or three times and got a pretty much rid you of the rue David's there is those two products there's bear fruit and citrus and then bare tree and shrub the tree and shrub is a lot more concentrated than the fruit and citrus the fruit and citrus is a lot weaker because it's meant for plants that are consumed by humans whereas a tree and shrub there you don't consume trees and shrubs so they give it a higher dose if you're in bed you could use the tree and shrub and you know it's going to it's going to be a better chance at working with fewer doses where's the fruit and citrus you know it's a lot weaker as of you know as this Drogo's is day 21 and it's almost I'd say it's probably too late to use that on these plants even the the fruit and citrus you know on a lower dose God you know like I don't touch my plants when they go in the flower I don't spray in with anything I don't use any of that [ __ ] by the time they get in flower like you gotta have stuff squared away in veg so you know I could I could drench with that fruit and citrus but it would really be risky having some left over because this is a nine-week strain you know I still would have about six weeks of time before I have that out of the out of the medium and then you know obviously how to flush really well if I did decide to use it so I'm just just trying to figure out whether I want to go about that route and run the risk of having some leftover in the product or if I just want to try and race um or you know the diatomaceous earth or just the sticky traps haven't quite decided but you know I'd say if I am gonna do the route drench day 21 is about the latest you'd want to do it and you'd really have to make sure you're flush in your plans for the rest of the rest of the flour period like watering them really well and getting some getting some runoff every time just to make sure that stuff gets out of it out of the medium so I'm gonna think about this tonight and if I make a decision tomorrow on what I'm going to do exactly before I did mention that I have another trick up my sleeve to try and increase my yield I don't know for sure if it's gonna work but I have purchased what I need to and you know it's not too late right now I'm gonna go ahead and try and set that up so next week you guys to see what I've done otherwise it might just wait till next week to do it but yeah that'll be a surprise for next week's video okay guys have made this plenty long enough I'm gonna sign off for now any questions or comments let me know otherwise this is it for day 21 of my 4000 watt Tahoe G flower room peace", "PjtJ_bTFRM8": "you too what is up here chillin mint chocolate chip from moxie just cleaning this baby all of it was so full of crap all right this [ __ ] as powerful as powerful it's like literally amazing I think it's $96 which is super

don't know I get more lid off of this double tap and burn it down but yeah this is more stronger than the cartridge it's more pure it's not I'm sure there's some type of cut in these carts or got to be something in them to make them I mean I don't know I don't know LLR MLL are cartridges are good not really taste it depends if they're if they don't flavor room like instantly lights you up instantly like just puts a smile on your face I don't know if they sell these and a half gram I don't know oh man sweating shitfire got a great taste that makes me super call hmm but that [ __ ] so strong so strong that it's literally worth the money what's the best dispensary you've been I mean for real they're all the best if they have what you want P and I mean whoever has what you're looking

qur'anic my neighbors are like what the [ __ ] how does do does all day is called [ __ ] had a blast or party here last night then ended up a [ __ ] somewhere far it was wild good time glad to meet new people this is that Chronicle or anything I did a review on it I got a letter from like PA FBI that said if I ever smoke flower on YouTube again like a vaporizer that they will ban my channel maybe prosecute me they're gonna rail me the full fence just to probably prove the people so I mean I'll vaporize and I got the diner vape and [ __ ] but we will show you definitely check it out grab this from good old delta-9 down there Pittsburgh PA I like them too they're they're awesome staff the great people there they actually they know what they're talking about dude waited on me knew every

have no I don't even have a booster in there man but yes nice looking flier and it was really good but see I got the small flower one which this is what I kind of made me mad like I didn't look at the menu but me and bird both said that it didn't it just said chronoed where's this a quarter I think yeah a quarter it was cron old a quarter it said it didn't say small flower though on the on the on the menu it didn't dan I Moxie lights you up it's such a nice just uplifting feeling this is the cartridge now see this cartridge so that wouldn't be is powerful has that wax we just smoked this is like a distillate distillate but I'm 100 percent sure but this is the diced pineapples from Moxie it's coming in like 87 I think it was high is a sativa so here we go a little moon rock buddy that's though I'm so happy like this has more just a total different taste got a different tastes has like a taste like you literally bit into a nice pineapple but yeah I don't know I'm definitely lit after that but no more flower and less were pressing it or vaping it but I'm on Instagram all the time and doing a lot more behind the scenes pa underscore Khushi if you want to check me out on there there's a lot of funny [ __ ] going on there always be doing some different [ __ ] I'm rambling on I'm all freaking stoned up but yeah I might do a live like every Sunday just something little Wow want to say the best cartridges of the week this week for probably uh-huh that tribal Lost Coast tribal diesel from rhythm bomb the purple punch flower and it's Chronicle this Chronicle is good too but the purple punch the bomb in the 8th I don't know about the grams they kind of do some some sneaky some sneaky slash stuff on them quarters sometimes they'll say I don't I mean I like I said I can't prove it I'm not mad but I know it didn't say small flower on the menu but I mean the price for what the price was other than I mean I'm not disappointed I think it was I don't even know what it was but it wasn't it was a good price quarters so we grabbed it and Mac flour was fire lost cars travel diesel was fire the indica blend Terrapin it was okay we I haven't eaten enough of it to actually like get super lit I just haven't been that type of mode lately to lose like two days of my day by sleeping or God knows whatever starting the rain but here in Pittsburgh actually about 15

the same it all looks the same I just don't understand where it all went you know I like literally openness yesterday but whatever we had fun all right the dirty that bangers block just scooping this edge here it is some nice-looking stuff but it literally all tastes the same to me all looks the same it's like um but I have literally 15 different jars of this downstairs different flavors right now on deck and they just literally all taste the same it's like chains out of the murmur a Lavigne wherever it was or the effects different I don't even know to be honest with you don't have to like really sit down a day just smoke one I'll have to do that I got the new I got I actually have the live resin in this and the live sugar in this downstairs and probably one from a half a year ago oh no

guys Rock a wonderful day love you", "lSpGy-L_hqg": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what is up everybody back at it with another one welcome to Pine Street a 21 and over medical cannabis review Channel out of the state of Pennsylvania pine if you're new to the channel thanks for watching if you like what you see do me a favor give it a thumbs up hit that subscribe and comment I love comments especially right now everybody's kind of got a lot of spare time on their hands so if you're looking to talk talk to me through the comments let me know what you're smoking on let me know what you think of the videos and yeah thanks for coming I appreciate every single one here let's turn the email on and get into it so today hopefully we have a slapper today I'm thinking this is gonna come through with some flavor the last one was kind of a letdown a bit of a new company really interested to see what else they come out with but wasn't what I was expecting it to be so but with this here we got some prime live the blue box not the purple box you know the expensive one and yeah it is PT star queen number 12 live resin yeah check that out PT star clean like resin I don't know if that'll focus but I'll I'll let you see it when I bring the camera a little closer let's get into the numbers let's see here cannabinoids THC coming in at zero point zero THC a coming in at eighty four point four one three percent everything else is a 0 th CV CBD CBD a CBD b CB n CB g CB c everything comes in at zero now as far as the terpenes go we have busy bolo coming in at 0.08 for beta car coming in at 0.33 9 beta Merc coming in at 6.50 9% six point five zero nine that is a lot of beta Merc so we can expect this to taste floral clothi kind of earthy even though earthy isn't a very good descriptor in my opinion what does the earth taste like I've never eaten dirt before but that's what I assumed the descriptor of earthy tasting like to me it sounds like tastes like a mouthful of dirt but in reality what it is it's more of like a it's a floral kind of note to the whole thing it brings like a like a flowery floral like vapor almost this kind of like kind of let you ever smell flowers and you know just to have that that vapor that's what the Merc is we got beta Pyne coming in at 0.34 five humans 0.089 limonene coming in at 1.30 three percent so above a percent so 1.3 percent which means we will get a lot of lime in it Linna bull 0.129 terpene allene 0.011 and pining 0.41 four percent so lots of chirps which is what we like to see we like to see you know flavor because that's what Terps are Terps are flavors I can't justify spending the kind of money that the Pennsylvania medical program requires you to spend and not have products that are just punching you in the mouth with flavor so I like to see a lot of Terps so let's get into it well break this open and I guess I should grab the hammer [Music] all right so here's this for you guys hopefully it foap this is pretty good yeah it was pretty quick focus pretty quick focus all right there's that we're gonna give it the old sniff test as always cap came off in the cat oh yeah oh yeah you get a lot of that limonene coming through or what did I say right yep got a lot of that lime in here smells like really gassy sprite and as I like I always consider that gassy smell of lime and pine one of my favorites one of my personal favorites lime lime and pine here is your thing as always they never stick I have seen them stick to other other jars not not medical but other industries in other states with recreational and I have actually seen those lids stick to these jars Prime's just really bad at it so but that's okay cuz they make up for it in crazy crazy flavor look at that that is just crazy looking clear as day no real gold or yellow no real colors just a whole lot of sauce and what looks like sugary diamonds basically but yeah this stuff is not bad not bad let's move it around a little bit kick up some of them Terps so yeah I don't get a ton of the Merc but I do get a lot of the pine in the lime so this should be a slapper this should taste phenomenal PT star dog is probably one of my favorites it's got a crazy flavor to me personally it has like a baja blast mountain dew kind of flavor so I'm hoping this kind of comes through like that does yeah it's a little nice little back la before you guys go ahead and get rid of the auto follow let's get down to it all right let that slow melt grab my capper give you a capper Rooney we're in no hurry that's the joy of an email no hurry so pho here we go [Music] I really did that huh I really just spaced out and dry hit the mother ship I forgot that I just cleaned this the other day and never refilled it [Music] nonetheless that being said I will fill this up in a second but an exceptionally smooth dry hit from a bong with flavors of what I can only describe as sprite it has a truly sprite like taste and I'm gonna say something I don't think I've ever dry hit a bong like that like on accident it's not as bad as you think it is not a smooth but still kind of good [Applause] but yeah this stuff does not taste like the star dog it doesn't have as much of what I like to call like a coconutty taste the star dogs definitely had more of a coconut taste this is just tastes like sprite it's like lemon lime a little bit of pine in there because of the pioneering and [ __ ] but for being honest this just tastes like like sweet sweet sprite like lemon-lime sprite all right so I'm gonna go ahead and try to find some water in this room real quick because you boy don't purposely hit a dry bong ever let's see what we got in here do I got any water oh you do not how do I not have any more oh man that's funny yourself give me five seconds I'll be right back and I'll probably edit this part out it's not sorry about that ah how often can you say that happens oh never for me personally I'm not a accidentally hit a drug long kind of guy but today must have been a super special day for me so as far as flavor I'll have way too much water in it oh yeah we're gonna have to slow hit this alright so as far as flavor it's not as punchy as a lot of the prime stuff is I wouldn't put it I wouldn't put this in the same category as like the orange chem soda or the sour blueberry which is a personal favorite of me and most of the people I know but it is it is more flavorful than a lot of companies that are just as expensive telling you the mothership is so good you can overfill it you still don't pull anything into your mouth makes no sense to me the quality glasses quality --get glass it doesn't matter how you how you stack it bent neck and everything that thing's amazing but yeah anyway let's get down to the ratings let's not make this a 30 minute video like normal um as far as smell smells great give it like a 9 out of 10 smells like lemons and pine trees super super dank I would wear it as cologne if they made it as far as the looks go you already saw the close-up white clear saucy beautiful just south just that south you know like doesn't get much better um as far as flavor it tastes good it tastes like sprite it's got the flavor the flavors are there it's not that it's not there it's just that you know it's not my personal favorite I do like lemon I do like pine and I do like lime but if it tasted a little bit more like it smelled I would like it a little more but it just tastes like sprite like really flavorful like Danks priety concentrates you know but yeah it gets a nine out of ten their price God the price sucks so bad but it's it's what we're paying it's it's the market guys you know like what can we do good grams are between 80 and hundred bucks and it's a sin and shame on people for making it that way but it's what we have to deal with until it becomes better so price we shouldn't even honestly we shouldn't even base things on price unless the price and the quality don't match up you know like if we get an $80 gram and it's absolute Pope then we might talk about the price a little bit but like yeah it's expensive but it delivers like it delivers it does all the things you want it to do and more the high super good super mellow not like rekt not like I want to sink into this chair and do nothing but like you know still still stony still like chill so very nice blended hybrid I would even almost say it's as close to 5050 as a thing can be which is awesome cuz 50/50 blends are like sativa indica 5050 is it's a nice feeling to be stoned but not too stoned like able to do things and function but still medicated and enjoying yourself so I can appreciate that that gets a nice 9 out of 10 like overall I give it a 9 out of 10 because that's about what it is man I mean nothing screams like anything special about it it's 85% so it's not like a hundred percent pure or anything which you know sometimes that like grabs your attention you know it's just overall it's what you would expect from a prime concentrate it's a nine out of ten I would pick it up again definitely like I said not the most flavorful but way more flavor than a lot of other companies on the market so you get what you pay for it's like moxie and prime those are your flavor like they come through and then like right behind prime I would say is uh Cresco they're [ __ ] lime skunk and they're blueberry space cake is phenomenal and they keep coming out with blends now that are pretty good like so J was it so J times space cake it was blueberry space cake so J haze mix and now there's a bio Jesus mix cross with something else which I'm sure it tastes great but those are your three top tier most expensive but also most flavorful companies in my opinion and then there's other companies that are just as expensive but don't really don't really bring the Terps so they kind of in my opinion don't even they're not even in the same category like you can say you're in the same category but you're not and it all comes down to flavor and if you smoke your smoker you'll know some stuff's got zero flavor but it's high and percentage and like THC percent but it's not as enjoyable to smoke as something that's like 85% and punches you in the mouth of flavor so it really comes down to the individual and what they're trying to do is I like to enjoy a thing that I'm partaking in and I like for that thing to do it's intended you know medicate because that's your intentions to medicate so words are hard I got stoned I'm gonna end it now because now I'm just babbling if you like the videos like and subscribe I appreciate everybody we're trucking along I met like 55 almost 60 subs and a couple hundred on Instagram so you know spread the word tell your friends and I appreciate you guys if it wasn't for you guys I wouldn't even bother doing this honestly I would just do other things so thank you for watching and giving me a reason to keep on making these videos so hope you have a good one and hope everybody staying safe peace out day in this [Music]", "FqC29dGtH5A": "whatever YouTube spiritual goal coming that's come at you today with the with a little strain review so today we got Tahoe og here wanted to show it off to you guys this is not stuff I grew this is definitely just got four month from a fellow grower I thought it was on you know worth the worth the video the smell is amazing it's nice and frosty super dense but it's an ounce of this doesn't even look like an ounce to be honest but the scale don't lie so dope it's a dope dope being over here front bud back front but yeah so I wanted to show this off to you guys and might as well do the plant as well so here we got the the new strain pink sunset leather folk is there you are Peter sunset as you can tell I tied her down right there tied her down and then all this stuff right here let me turn off the fan all right so basically all the lower stuff is shooting up now and as you can see the canopy is started form totally different from last week go ahead and check out my last my last video you can see what I'm talking about so in about two weeks two more weeks yeah actually go fill this up ten [ __ ] but totally doable you know get this plant out to here a little bit over there and then flower baby I'm super excited about this stuff being sunset super dope all right he's", "w5OlIpxu0W8": "all right how's it going everybody we're out here we're doing other video training we got for today is Tahoe oh gee and this is it right here we pick the stuff from green Hawk meds the other day really wonderful stuff man Tahoe g9 t10 in the codominance train the team she loves on this can give twenty percent so she's pretty high up there I'm actually strong and as far as the genetics go from what I found on different sites different things but the majority say that this is a OG Kush phenotype but I have read on some sites that this thing was created in the 80s by some ganja guru and this is a cross between sacrum Evelio G and og cush and to be honest I'm kind of believable because this does feel like a nighttime version of sound valley og safonovo G out of Auto G's one of my favorites and when I was medicating with this house like man this does feel like it's a dollar value except it does have that the relax factor on this is strong but it's got that heavy high it's got those happy you for advice which is lowered with you for vibes in this date man well these for me I love it that's what I felt pain relief is nice long lasting I felt like this is probably like good three hours we've been between that's how I felt although I only medicated a few times during the day with this because the relax factor is strong I do save this for the evening time and that's what we medicate it right now late at night because it is mad if I smoke this during the day I'll have a pretty unproductive day so I'll find myself kind of lounging around not wanting to do anything is very unmotivated I wouldn't say I'm super lazy but you are kind of super lazy but that's kind of bad in this state I think you just very unmotivated anyhow we got a nice dab I loaded up right here it was all spiky and everything but because it's so hot out here starting to melt so anyhow let's take a quick dab sure with the Koster leg because there are some cost to this but overall really wonderful strain it tastes great it's got a nice a nice earthy pungency but it's also got a nice little citrusy taste in the background it's kind of on the mild side but it's there you can taste it other than that um don't think I can say that watch out for is the crash and there is some cottonmouth today but I didn't experience how much munchies but I have men on sites that said that this does help with appetite so maybe some folks who does pause the munchies but I didn't experience any munchies [Applause] okay here's a party over there getting party going on over there sounds like Mexican music I can t get some good food over there I wish I was invited anyhow Tahoe oh gee keep topology wonderful stuff sorry about that man some of the things I found out about this drain good for PTSD good for ADHD migraines and PMS those are some of the things that um I thought were worth mentioning but it's great for anxiety wonderful for anxiety if you're shy socially awkward I haven't found a bit of kind of personal overthinks things this is a good straight for that first look for UK before us kind people wanna say you guys for us guys for us kind guys that I'm but it hits quick it feels it don't I would say to me but it does hit quick you feel the effects really wonderful strain right I would totally grab Tahoe gee again man it's a good strain a lot people like its popular and there's good reason why man it's a good strain it's got all kind of good effects too and I love it man and uh I'm a sativa guy but this isn't in the common strain and I like it man I like it mostly because of those it feels like a nighttime version of sfv man and I love that anyhow I guess that's it for the strain nothing to report other than the cottonmouth and the crash but that's funny from what I experienced else yeah have a wonderful day guys", "9B7dLmpAxNw": "yo what is up guys welcome back to another video this your boy and Maddy smokes how is everyone doing today I

the way to the 70 days that it that it's calls for due to uh different reasons this thing is like Frost this thing in the world man look at this we were going in soil Foxfire motion forests and a couple of amendments added to it and then we used a lot nutrient line and trying to break up on the note for you guys see what looks like inside of me [Music] I wish I could let you guys smell this it is unreal it tastes like fruity pebbles OG Froot Loops something like that I mean it's just amazing it really is [Music] it's just Howard this camera is not the greatest and I'll tell you what I'm very very impressed so the best tasting smokes I've ever had that's the Tahoe G from Kelly connection awesome stuff I got feminized seed pack and they popped hundred-percent operate it was awesome bunny well we're spent - what it's all about the genetics guys look all about genetics [Music] chewy sad enough the medication Tahoe oh gee yo-yo", "IwUiAeiYPz4": "hey what's up everybody many Harper here I've really been slacking on my videos lately the last time I updated you in this garden it was day 28 right now it's day 46 so he missed basically day no you know if I upload the day 28 video I know there's a day 28 video on my computer I don't know if I upload to YouTube though anyway so we missed 35 miss 42 but we're at 45 now not flushing these plants yeah I actually had no idea it was day 45 I had to go look and see when my last video was taken but plants are looking fun really good sighs the colas not too big I'm hoping they swell up over the next week because man my last row that I had all those oh geez and stuff and I had six tacos those clothes were literally massive on those paws way more than twice as big as these ones so and then again you know I had six plants under one light in that room this room I have twelve plants in a one light so that might explain something but I as far as my lighting down underneath goes you know the buds around these lights they don't look like two that bigger filling out or anything really doesn't look like anything's happening but maybe it's because I didn't put these lights in here until like day 21 or something like that or 20 or somewhere in there so I think I probably should have these lights in here starting in day one a flower you know I didn't actually buy the lights until the second week of flowering here so my next round that I do in here I'll make sure I have that under lighting put in at day one and I'm sure I'll see a major difference then but I can't imagine I'm gonna get a small yield in this room with all these top colas it's like I'll be able to just cut off the top one foot of foliage and should have a great yield just from that just look at the buds a little bit nice and frosty yummy it's Tahoe G from Kelly connection so it's a good feel of it don't know what else to say if I start flushing these pretty soon I'd like to cut these going on a trip at the end of the month I'd like to cut these probably the 20 late 20th of this month and right now it's what the four fourteenth or 13th or something 13th 14th I don't know so what two more weeks and if today is a 45 that'd be day 59 I might want to take a little bit longer than that I'll see anyway guys I'll stop blabbing just make this video short I just want to give a little update in the garden here everything is looking fantastic really full canopy haven't seen any Rudy aphids whatsoever so I've sucked out it's all taken care of you never have another update about a week or so peace", "GdbE_PL7PGk": "[Music] today we're going to try some tableau G that we got from Bondi wheat online tab oh gee I don't know if it's table or tattle but we're gonna - we're gonna [ __ ] call tavill hey tableau G let me get uh I'm not sure if that's where it was but whatever we gonna put out of here make sure we get it from the top because with buy my weed online before we take a point out we buy my weed online usually the usually the top buds are really good the rest of it's usually garbage so for a review video without a bull from the top so we actually get the tablet the tableau G if we go from the bottom we don't know what the [ __ ] we're gonna get that's how I buy my weed online works they rip you off just so you guys know and in this video they asked me not to do any crude behavior no crude behavior or anything like that so I'm gonna try not to swear so there's gonna be no [ __ ] swear [ __ ] I just I keep [ __ ] swearing [ __ ] hey [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] a-anyway Hey look the Tahoe jeez my clock I thought that was funny I had to do it I just had to do it anyway let's get this back open hey check over the bud it's fine a decent sized bud make sure we go from the top if you don't go from the top and get a good but from the top you're probably not gonna get high hey anyway let's bring this over to the board not too bad looks pretty decent anyway I hope you guys got a good enough look hey I hope you had a good peep I mean if I go over to light here a little more maybe no I don't think it's gonna come in any better than that yeah yeah and yeah we'll call that the middle hey doesn't smell very good smells kind of like mothballs yep a light smell of mothballs that's what I'm smelling anyway I'm gonna grind some of this [ __ ] up and we'll get the show started Hey there it is all grinded up now it smells like a mix of mothballs and dirty old turkey meat you just took out of the fridge anyway let's get this [ __ ] started right hey what's going on dickweeds this is an early morning wake and bake featuring Tahoe from buy my weed online I hope that was good enough Oh the tableau gee I would say it's about decent hopefully you guys can see this Donna wrote it kind of small it should be bigger but here's the reading system shitty decent oh my [ __ ] this is gonna get a decent that's all just a decent it's ok stuff if you're hurting but if I was to you know we pick my strain again I wouldn't pick this kind the reviews that it was really good but the reviews are obviously not true it's not really good its decent and that's all it is is decent it's not even close to an oh my [ __ ] and you can't call it shitty because well I do feel a little bit of a globe you know what I mean it's decent now you never know I make it debt boom another tongue twister hey I was saying you never know I make it I might get down further in the jar and maybe it'll get better but from my experience it's only gonna get worse hey so today I should probably start looking for some dirty old Timmons Street weed so I can actually get [ __ ] baked because I don't think this is gonna get me baked it's only gonna you know it'll help me get by til I find some better stuff that's my rating of tableau G now the smell it smells like mothballs and when you that's when you first take it out of the [ __ ] jar or the container and whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it Hey but then when you grind it up it smells like mothballs and you know after Christmas or Thanksgiving when you take the turkey out of the fridge after it's cooked and it smells like [ __ ] like somebody's [ __ ] in the fridge you know what I mean my god a rotten fart well it smells like that when you grind it up the taste this is the first time I've ever tasted a strain of weed that it tastes like you took it out of the [ __ ] ashtray like I don't smoke anymore but I used to smoke and if you ever put on a smoke and you let half of it sit there for like a [ __ ] half-hour or something and you come back to it later yeah relight it up you know that not so good taste when you light it up you can tell that it was already [ __ ] lit one time well that's the taste you get from this [ __ ] it tastes like that the feel it's an okay feel I guess I mean if I didn't have any weed I guess I'd be thankful that I had this weed but the whole time I was smoking this weed I'd be thinking [ __ ] it's gotta be better weed out there somewhere and I'd be looking for it hey so yeah you know and then smoke it's not very smoky it's not even a thick smoke as you guys seen when I did that bomb toke there a few seconds ago uh it wasn't very much smoke that came out of me I don't even remember how much wood in let's take this to another bomb toke and have a look Hey it goes in pretty smooth but that's what the blonde I don't know what the joint it goes in thick comes up thin you barely see anything in the air and there's a little bit here but it's like disappearing and they taste you know something that's similar to ashtray let's see if there's a refri it gives a nice bonus toke I think I got more smokin on the bonus toke than the original [ __ ] the original toke hey you know what I mean you seen it you judge you judge for yourself um oh yeah give me a second I got it uh I gotta grab something to clean up my balls like back up so yeah if you guys are looking for a good strain of weed it's definitely not Tablo gee I don't know if it's tau tato or touhou hmm we're called it teemo Tahoe I don't know what we're calling it [ __ ] [ __ ] hey I don't know what you call it Tablo G if you have no choice but to go but go to buy my weed online try to get some God's dream crack or orange crush but like I said after you get through the top buds I can't vouch for the bottom of the barrel hey I just know the top buds are always good and I'd buy my weed online they give you shitty stuff underneath they [ __ ] rip you off it seems like a ripoff to me so just so you guys know I will not be ordering from buy my weed

this it's that you know I mean the reviews are all lies this weed is guaranteed to make you want to look for better weed that's what it's guaranteed to do hey just sayin that's my opinion I mean one of you guys out there might think oh man you don't know what you're talkin about this crappy weed is awesome to me well hey you feel like crappy weed right on but I don't and this is crappy and yeah tahoe OG might be good from somewhere else I don't know I've only had it from bottom a weed online and I'm not very impressed and the sponsorship thing with buy my weed online that's [ __ ] over we're done buddy over at buy my weed online Cameron he thinks that by me doing these [ __ ] reviews for him that he gets full control of my [ __ ] channel I can tell me what I could say and what I can't say and he said that I'm too crude and I say all these bad words and stuff and it makes his company look bad you make your own company look bad by selling shitty weed bud so you know [ __ ] you you stupid

review like subscribe and [ __ ] off", "mxeFzz7X9ms": "what's up guys today is day 49 sorry I'm so late on the update kind of hectic I want to make sure I got a video in and showed you the ladies I'm gonna try to do a night shot video as well hopefully I everything is fairly well the ladies don't get quite as shonky about go ahead and take a look and just a second a faraway living in fairly happy with the results still got a week left of flushing soap but they'll chunk up a little more I definitely should have took a lot more off the bottom when I was doing thinning and Molly popping but lesson learned I definitely next time we'll be getting more off when I go ahead and show you why it's really important as well the stuff that I care so under here I've got all the end branches all over that are flopping down and falling down I don't have to cry come in and taya if I would have took all these lowers off I think I would have a lot better development but they're not bad you can see they're still pretty sure gave her some lowers the side did seem to a little bit more so I'm half a day 42 been flushing with fresh water ever since starting to really get some good smell out of these ladies I think overall it should be a pretty successful harvest all definitely like I said try to make a night shot video and then possibly kind of in part of this video say the final product and talk about dried weight and everything so you've got a lot more branches here falling down too so the best way to do it is keep it in your trellis it doesn't fit your trellis chop that [ __ ] out so-sorry was a super president on this grill I'll definitely be oblivious and future growth and definitely we trying to be more involved like I said just I hope these hopefully these ladies will keep on shut camera well so stamps they let you south", "B-SPNUv5jLQ": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today we are gonna be reviewing tao alien by the colorado grow company and if tahoe alien is new to you like it is to me let's go ahead and talk about it this is an indica dominant hybrid it is a 60 40 split that is a cross between uh tahoe oh g and alien kush so oh my gosh you guys this should be really piney that's what i'm expecting just really heavy it's testing out at 26.4 thc so i know this stuff should smack too so before we go ahead and get into this review i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we're gonna take a look at it together okay so what did you think of this tahoe alien here by colorado grove company honestly i thought it looked pretty good and i i unfortunately only have one small little bud left to look at i ground up the other ones and man i'll tell you this even as for this small little bud it's really nice and it's got some good frost coverage it's kind of light in the green color peach nice light peach colored hairs i mean it was trimmed really well now again look at that's just a little popcorn bud that i'm looking at here and it's still pretty malleable so still fairly fresh and god this reminds me of that old school purp smell like if you've had um some old perp genetics you know the smell i'm talking about the perps it's like really floral but like heavy kind of piney oh my gosh it smells so good it's intoxicating i already ground some up oh my gosh like from a smell perspective i'm not joking this could be some of the best smelling herb i've smelled in a long long time i literally just want to keep diving my nose back into this stuff and like to get more it smells that that good the tiny one little nug here still smells that's one tiny nog you guys in there it's still smelling up this jar this stuff is freaking off the charts loud i picked up only a gram of it unfortunately too um i have a feeling this is going to be just a banger here but i want to go ahead and uh get this going because truthfully i feel like this is i'm in for a treat i haven't smelled bud like this in years honestly it's been like five years minimum probably closer to 10 truthfully if i was really being honest it's probably closer to 10 years since i've smelled bud like this like old-school perp my granddaddy oh god it smells so good you guys so today i'm going to have this out of my arizer extreme q desktop vape i got it set to 375 degrees fahrenheit there i'm going to take the whip and the end with the screen on it that's going to go into the bowl that i've been can't get my nose out of and smelling the other end is going to go into my scientific inhalations triple filter bubbler now i'm only using two of the filtration chambers today i've got some brand new distilled water here as well as a brand new organic cotton filter i've left the first chamber which sits in the downstem there um empty typically you'd put some carbon in there and prevent ash from getting the water but we are vaping this stuff today baby i want all that flavor so i can't wait to puff this stuff so if you guys are ready i'm ready let's burn down okay that do you guys i know you can't see it very well but i blew out a lot of vapor and i'm telling you that was buttery smooth like that is buttery smooth that didn't feel like anything going down now i've got like an herbal kind of piney floral taste on my tongue oh my god indicative of those classic perp genetics which is crazy because i know it's tahoe oh gee an alien kush i'm gonna have to look into some of the um you know history but behind the tahoe alien as well as uh excuse me the tahoe as well as the alien just to see if maybe there's some like purple kush in there or whatever but man these terps are great just another that like is so clean it's almost hard to believe i can't tell you the last time that that smoke or vapor in this case has been that smooth very herbal floral and the floral is really up front and center it honestly is a little bit of pine in the undertones there but like that floral taste is really right up in front and center here today it's not like completely coating my mouth but it's nicely coating my mouth um i can't wait to finish puffing this bowl to see what the effects are like so while i'm doing that i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out that tiny little mug under the 25 times the magnification of a macro lens so you get a little bit of a better up close personal view of this stuff so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the tahoe alien by colorado grow company and you guys this is just that nice light lime green color it's got these peach colored hairs that are just perfectly hugging up nice and tight to the bud the buds that i got obviously as you guys see are kind of these popcorn buds but they're still you know the leaves trimmed right up to the bud which is very nice now this stuff isn't super super dense but it's not super fluffy either and you know overall i think this is some really good looking stuff okay so what did you think of the tahoe alien under that macro lens pretty good right not too bad um here's the deal there's a lot i want to talk about with this strain because truthfully it's just been so long since i've had something that was quite like this it's so different and unique than so much of this uh stuff that we're typically um reviewing and it started out floral and i mean i i don't even want to really get into it because it's like this is so deep this is a crazy strain um that i think for me there's just there's a lot going on here there really is there's a lot to dissect and i'm honestly i'm really excited to do that with you guys um so i want to just get right into this review um and kind of go through this with you guys so all the strains i rate from zero to ten obviously zero being the worst ten being the absolute best i will break that review down and rating into four different categories look smell taste and potency i'll assign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories and then i will tally up the total of those four categories at the end and give you guys my final rundown so let's go ahead and start by talking about the look bag appeal or in this case jar appeal of this tahoe alien by the colorado grow company here so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to look at and then we'll go ahead and get into my final rating okay so you've seen it multiple times here's the deal when it comes to look at this stuff it's tough for me because i really don't feel like we had a ton of really big nug representations i mean they gave us kind of these popcorn nugs in this gram which sucks because i couldn't get a really good feel for like just how good it was this jar already reeks again oh my god oh my god it's so awesome but here's the deal from what i can tell here it looks like it's gonna be a 2.0 it's good it's not great there's nothing unbelievably spectacular about this it's nice and light green it's got this uh thin hairs they're very light colored kind of peach colored like you would typically see in a cush pattern uh bud as far as like you know uh uh the way those hairs are kind of like just nice thin perfectly interwoven throughout the bud there um now here's the deal um i want to go ahead and get to the smell because the smell is a 2.5 there's no question about it this stuff is so freaking loud that this tiny nug smells up an entire jar damn damn i'm like this is like special stuff and honestly i wish we had bud that was that floral where you like picked up a gram and it was just like it reaped but like i don't know i have not been seeing it i mean there is some stinky bud but like this stuff is stinky and it's good it smells floral it smells sweet it smells piney it's strong a little lemon even on the back end and the taste that was what i was gonna say like let's get to the taste because the smell is a 2.5 the taste it went from floral and kind of piney to like at the end kind of lemony which is weird because when i was researching this strain it did say a lemon zest that i'm not usually into the lemon strains and it does have a lemon zest there is no question a about it um now for me the taste of it though i don't think it's gonna win any awards i really don't i think it was good but like i don't think this flavor was um something that it's like i it was like oh my god this is a 10 out of 10. and you know it was good it wasn't great um it's a 2 out of 2.5 in the taste department now the potency i really i don't know it could be potentially a 2.5 but for me i think what's waning it back to like a two because it really is i think it's a two you guys see a little redness behind the eyes it's a 60 40. for sure my body is chilled out my mind is definitely slowing down a little bit but very focused um but i'll tell you that it's got this kind of rubber bandy feeling that i'm not a huge fan of it's not really strong and not super prevalent but like that pressure on the head i'm not super fan of it kind of feels artificial like the beanie you've got a beanie on and you know again it's it's good it's not great it's gonna be a 2.0 so if you've been following it's gonna been a two in the look a 2.5 in the smell and then a 2.0 in the taste and a 2.0 in the pot it's an 8.5 for this tahoe alien by the colorado grow company so it is a solid b you guys this stuff is interesting if you want terps that are just going to knock you out and be like wow you want to just keep your nose in the uh jar or the bag that you get it in pick this tahoe alien up i don't think you're gonna be disappointed if not for anything else just to smell this stuff um so colorado grow company killer stuff um 8.5 now with that being said if you have tried this stuff let me know do you guys think an 8.5 is fair for this tahoe alien that's testing out at 26.4 thc let me know in the comments below but also if there's something you guys want to see me review leave that in the comments below and until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon peace [Music]", "qnFEorlOA1Q": "what's going on game ganja vape here another video you know it's always a good run boxing today we're gonna be looking at brass knuckles Tahoe og and as you guys can see we still got the child lock on it because we always got to have it nice and official folks this here off I've been waiting all day for this review but I did not want to rush it before work or on my lunch break as you see you still has the rubber because it's fresh I did not want to rush this review I wanted it to be all as much time as needed much time as needed as you guys see here I'm loving the design it has a little brass knuckle on the front the round tip that I am a big fan though the reason why I'm not really a fan of these tips or because if you screw it in you will have to position the vape in your hand accordingly so that you can have this in your mouth to your preference but my preference with this one would be around just pop popping pop popping pop popping with this one it's like okay I like it to be like this instead of it always being like this because this will sometimes catch on to teeth there you go now you're mates with me riding on your basically biting on it but this one yeah just go in just go in this mess it enough of that it's time to screw this bad boy and show you tight perfecto is it on nothing pins off good thing my pain was off three two one blast off oh my god if you would have seen the plume that just fell all right so first off first rip it tastes a little citrusy nice very nice very nice not overpowering not too much almost like lemon og from can aguru but I like this flavor here it's very nice not too strong it also reminds me of the sfv og from Koenig ooh that one was a very nice strong earthly grass grassy tasting one that's what this really reminds me of and if you go pretty fast with this vaping back to back you will feel a little burn in your throat but I mean it doesn't be expected with the best right what else can I say it's a very good babe so far see those nice strong clouds coming out also love my Atmos pen yeah that's about it for this video that's all I got to say also before I end this video I also gotta give a nice big shout-out to one of my big boss who's really doing his thing I see him on the internet I see him on YouTube doing his thing he's really doing what he say he doing you know AOL Canseco's you know i'ma gonna put his channel down below he's wanted literally probably one of the realest people I've ever seen on YouTube and that's about it for this video guys I don't wanna make it too long but uh thanks for the views like comment share subscribe if you haven't already and just push them in just push the video out there just share it to one person and that's it

on the Tahoe og it's from buy my weed online the reviews say it's good so so we'll see about that I've taken out a bud that's what that's what it looks like there it's a little bit a little bit hard it smells old and like a like a damn basement it smells like that so I'm gonna grind this up and then we'll be back and I'll tell you guys what I think of the Tahoe og okay so we're back little thing there there it is all grinded up um the smell has changed since I grinded it I said it smelled like like wet basement like old stuff it doesn't smell like that anymore it smells like um a dirty old ashtray like you know when you put the I know this cuz they used to smoke years ago so I know what the smell is but when you have a dirty ashtray and you put water in it that smell it comes up that's what I'm smelling I'm gonna try this out and see what this is like I'm I'm hoping it's good because the reviews say they're you know it's fantastic so we'll see let me do all their that's a god-awful taste it doesn't i thought the smell was bad the taste is worse it tastes like something spoiled and you know it well it's not smokey at all usually um there's not even a dirt taste and you know how my reviews are if I if I taste like that dirt taste there there's no dirt taste here whatsoever usually you know Eickhoff at some point there's not even that so I'm I don't know I I really don't know about this I'm a little bit worried now that's my s my smoke stopper I started using that a couple days ago um it's almost like that the taste is something metallic um I don't know how this review is gonna go because so far like I start to feel something there but it's not that great like it's like yeah I know it's like if you were overly tired that's that's how what I'm feeling right now just that little bit of like Oh your eyes get a little bit heavy and yeah you know something like that I'm not feeling like oh [ __ ] this is great [ __ ] because it's not I'm not I'm gonna you know I'll finish inhaling the smoke but I'm it's a little concerning that a you know a beginner like me is not it's not feeling that great I'm gonna rate this right now because I'm just about at the end of this so you know on how we do the writing I should actually show you guys just so hang on I'm gonna finish this okay I'm gonna take you guys wait over here so here's the shitty the decent and the oh my [ __ ] it's like like here it's not at the decent it's not even on the halfway line it's it's right here it's kind of it's a just like you could probably get um I'm gonna put this back over here you could probably get some weed off the street that's better than this stuff I don't know I think that's we'll go with that okay so a smell I've covered first and it smells like old damp basement and that's when you grind it it smells like what ashtray the taste I'm getting from it is a metallic taste it's something that like I'm gonna drink a pop actually to try to to kill the taste it's not very good um the feel feels like maybe you stayed up a little bit longer than you were supposed to and you didn't get that much sleep or whatever the buzz if I know this was like this and this is from buy my weed online so if you see this stuff do not I'm telling you do not don't get it even if it was $99 do not get it even if it was fifty even if you want it I would send it back because it's not that great like that they're not yes and I'm gonna actually because you usually get reef rising whatever there may be one in here but I don't wear that it's all burnt like it's Oh what the [ __ ] it is but they should buy my meat on one shouldn't be saying this is good they shouldn't be they shouldn't even be allowed to sell it like they you know why that's pretty bad as a business that um you know what your products are like and either you know you would think you would know maybe one at least one of the people that are radiant maybe the rest are customers I don't know but maybe um I mean you would think I mean if I was a business owner and I was running a marijuana company I wouldn't just go as much as I you know my customers would be my customers but I would think you would have somebody that you know maybe a couple people that try this [ __ ] and let you know what it's like and if this was me and I had a couple people or whatever usually let's say a couple cuz you know everybody's different but they all came back and they all told me how much garbage something was I wouldn't be selling it I wouldn't do that to my customers but you know buy my weed on line seems like they like to do that so I'm really disappointed with them I I'll be honest with you yeah don't don't buy don't buy it please don't light I mean even if somebody was to buy it for the reason of selling it to somebody or whatever like you know hey if you want your legs broken or you want people like maybe rapping on your door dressing you on the phone saying you know how about it is that's how bad it is because yuck it's not good it's I really don't feel anything different then that I normally would like I'm being honest to God honest to god this stuff is no good it's garbage whoever raided this they must have smoked something better and then you know somebody just wrote down that review because this is this is horrible like you I would I can even say like you'd have to smoke a whole bunch because I don't even think that would do it it's just you should I really don't know what else to to talk to you guys about because it's it's no it's no good so like I said I'm sure you I've made my point clear on this one this is yuck this is [ __ ] like I don't I don't know how a business didn't do this to its customers but hey what do I know right and like I'm I'm not you know white like as much as buy my meat online wanted a channel strictly for them what you know pay if there's somebody out there that wants to make a YouTube video and just make you know do reviews videos for them and not have anything on there because that's what they want that's that's fine hey but how many how many like strains are you gonna have to smoke to actually have a good review like this is [ __ ] don't my opinion is don't even I wouldn't even go on the reviews anymore I you know what I am honest to god true like I'm speaking the truth that you know seriously I mean I'm not ordering from them anymore like can abismo I can honestly say is you're never disappointed with their stuff their stuff is good always good you never ever ever had you know a bad bad strain with them never honestly like never buy my weed hey it's like you're taking a big chance and hey you know what it's your money do what you want but you're taking a chance with them and if you are smoking weed or you know for a medical purpose I wouldn't I'm telling you as somebody that smokes it because it you know helps with headaches this I I wouldn't I I wouldn't I wouldn't do it so that's my review on the Tahoe og it's you're just I'm disappointed so I don't really have much else to say about it my opinion I'm buy my weed online don't go over to cannabis no you're guaranteed good stuff there and I'm telling you honestly no matter what strain I have smoked from there whatever you know what I've even done edibles and no matter what it's good [ __ ] buy my weed online it's like yeah I don't know they're not they're not true to their customers let's say that so and all of that that's it that's all bye", "QTCJnF-Zw9k": "hey what's up guys mini cropper here it's like 4:30 in the morning on Wednesday I guess it's the 18th I mean my last update video my veg 7 of this Tahoe og flower room like Monday night and I guess today is Tuesday night but it's like really early in the morning really but I haven't gone to bed yet anyway I am going through and topping all these plants right now I just wanted to discuss really quickly the technique and kind of thought of what I'm thinking when I'm talking these Tahoe G plants because they are very stretchy you know og plants intend to stretch like hell and these are no exception so you can see here I've actually topped all the plants except for this one here I haven't talked yet it stands about 22 inches tall 22 to 24 inches tall and some of these phones when I had these just in the nursery some of the clones kind of got out of control and stretched a lot and I didn't top them so a lot of the foliage was definitely up off the the cocoa and I had quite a bit of internode spacings like I couldn't chop them the way back because there's literally no nodes to close down to the cocoa so a few of them actually are quite a bit taller than the rest like this one here swings still about 20 inches tall the one behind it still pretty tall so then you see something like this or only 10 inches tall really short they were much taller of course but because they have still a lot of nodes down low as he'll just take most plant off and get that down to be bushy you know I'll have all these tops here ton of them will sprout up for means of course and hopefully to on the inside and maybe three on the inside but some of them my warning I was not able to do that with like that one there you see you know there's like no foliage down there so if I were to chop this thing down there'd be nothing to grow anyway with a few exceptions like that I chopped most of them down quite a bit now one thing I want to mention is today is I guess technically day 9 of edge even though it's really 8:00 to me because I haven't gone to bed yet but up until today these plants have the lighting here I don't have all 4000 Watts turn on these bulbs have been burning at 600 watt mode since I transplanted them so for the past 10 days or nine days it's been on what's like 2400 watts in here not 4000 if I would have had it at 4000 the plants have grown a lot more but I'm sure I would have some light bleaching and a little more stress I'm not really concerned with that because these Tahoe plants I'm just packing and tight anyway so I don't need really fast growth out of them but I just want to make that note that they've been under 2400 watts and not 4000 these bulbs are still at 6-under watt mode I think I'll either flip them to a thousand after I taught them or wait two days I'm gonna have time for a couple days so I'll wait till I get back and it flew to 2000 then anyway just give him a couple days after topping to still stay at 600 watt mode and adjust to the stress of talking them lastly I did just spray them all this morning with as Max they do not have any pests or infestations anything whatsoever they've never had any that but I do it just has a precautionary thing so you can see like the leaves do have a little bit of shine to them you can kind of see a little bit of shine just maybe a few hours ago that I did I sprayed some as on there I do want to note that I do not use as Max to treat for spider mites if I have spider mites I use other products if I have spider mites really badly and they seem to be immune to other products I will mix and as a max every once in a while but I mean rarely do I get spider mites in the first place and when I do I hit them hard with something a lot more powerful and as Max but if you like to spray my plants at least once I usually just once in veg with as Max just as a precautionary and it seems to make the plants kind of happy it turns a little bit green you know it's not definitely not bad for them anyway I'm gonna go ahead and top this plan right here and show you what I was talking about when you're talking these Tahoe G's or a lot of G's that just stretch like crazy this phenotype in particular I hear there are some phenotypes out there that do not stretch quite so badly but this is typical of oh geez to stretch like crazy so I want to be really aggressive here this plant let's say it's 22 inches tall I'm gonna make it about 10 inches tall so I'm gonna take about a foot off of this see here from the bottom of this branch I've got one node coming out here another one right above it and then I've got about two inches of internode spacing with another node three more inches and I'm node here and then three more inches I've got a note here and then a couple more at the top so this span here this whole branch is Oh 17 inches tall and let's say it has a total at this count like this is one let's say one two three nodes four five six seven nodes total I'm gonna go ahead and cut it just get the whole thing in the picture here I'm gonna go ahead and cut it right here snap just like that now I am down to two nodes on this branch see how short that is there's so much I cut off all that so you can see from the actual dirt I cut off more than what I left okay I make a really good clone they're getting to go over to the next branch it's actually four main branches here I just cut one I have a second here a third back here and then this fourth right here so let's just go back to the second one I'm actually gonna remove this family here I would typically do this after I cut but I'm gonna do it now because I want you to see what I'm cutting this is actually shading the two nodes that will become the top of the branch from about to top so I'm just gonna remove that see these are the two nodes that are about to become the top right there I got a split one node to node and all this stretch here that's what Tahoe likes to do and a lot of just like do this tons of stretch that's like five inches of stretch and then a few more notes to talk got it eliminate that you get internode spacing like this in your Tahoe G grow you're gonna end up with nine-foot tall plants at the end of flower snap just like that nice and short again okay so two nodes right there two nodes on that one two notes on that one this piece that I just took off make a good clone let's go to this front branch right here once again I've got two nodes down low one here one there so one to see if I get different angle here yeah there you go one two got all this internode space and actually cuz it's right here and then I have another node shooting off another node somewhere nose up here some people would go ahead and just take out this little tiny top just pinch that little top off so you ain't gonna focus there some people would pinch that off and top it there yeah you can do that but on this strain I wouldn't recommend that actually Oh probably that's a nice tree and I know some growers do that it's a little less stressful for the plant but I I always like to cut off stuff so I would typically top right here go down and take all that off and have myself two nodes right there but because this is an OG [ __ ] it I'm going all the way down here snap just like that so once again let make a really nice double top top clone you know you don't have to top that when you clone that you already have two tops but we're not gonna do that last French this is the dominant branch of the whole plant nice thick stalk you know good 20 to 24 inches tall let's go down here it's got this little node spin it here this little node way down here that'll probably get lollipops in the near future going up here one node coming off another one third fourth fifth six seven eight what do you think I'm gonna deal obviously seem to do it on the other ones cut that right there so it's the whole plant they're just like that and that's I just cut off that's a good 10-inch clone there now at this particular plant since it's got some good development here I'm actually going to go ahead and do a little talking this now so I've got this cut down I had four main stalks now I have eight tops because each branch turn in two but now here this is kind of tall I'm gonna go ahead and cut that right there then I'll have to note zero one two one two one two this one here go ahead and leave that one for now I'm gonna take this one here see what we got going on here yeah you see that you can go ahead and cut right between those and get a double top out of that just got to focus here I got it got a look with the scissors actually be really careful this mean going use my thumbnail there didn't want to strip those nice fresh baby names there so yeah that's my plant now that I've talked it you know I went from really tall length in was some inner roads be seen as long as six inches down a nice little bushy plant now don't get me wrong this thing is gonna stretch like crazy again because it is an OG but I will top it again before I put it in the flour probably just not nearly as aggressive as topping on all these plants today I was pretty aggressive on almost all of them I think this this topping I did today was maybe the third time I've topped them topped them when they're in the cups once and then I think right when I transplanted them you know nine days ago topped and then talking again right now probably bedroom for another week top them and then bedroom for another couple days in the flower but anyway that's my topping video on the Tahoe gee when you've grown these oh geez you got to be really aggressive with your topping guys that way you will get them to Bush out as much as possible because they really like to stretch alright that's it for now peace", "w4dS4PdeqB4": "it what's up guys welcome back to Cartman's Channel I want to show you this

one can do so let's take a look at who makes this this is from a cultivator called 3c farms and they have a nice label you can see they have a sativa - indica scale and you can see this is almost all indica so it's mostly in the co with little bit of sativa and also they give you this the fact that this is OD Kush and SF v OG Kush - and that says the I assume in San Fernando Valley and this flower has let me see if I can see 23 percent THC and this flower was really something uh it's funny as you try flowers and you're looking for the best this flower when I first tried it I tried a little bit I said wow this is strong and I did a little bit more and then I said it was stronger and then after about half an hour of this cup and Tahoe gee I'm like this is one of the strongest flower like runch strong because it kept getting stronger and stronger until I became stupid and I became slower and this flower is not for me my mind was wandering and I would say if you're young and you want to try some of the strongest flowers Tommo oh gee by 3 CC Farms is super strong oh my goodness so we're gonna try a little bit right now out of the vapor Cup and you've got to you see I've got it set to 335 look at what the vapor Cup can do with all the it's just incredible look at all that bait here we go Tahoe oh gee by 3 C farms so this is a heavy og tastes super heavy og tastes see this thing makes so much fake tits at 3:35 incredible but we're looking for the best and what did I stink of Tom oog by 3 C farms and really the cultivator makes a difference in all these reviews it's not just about Tom oh gee it's Tom oh oh gee by 3 C farms this flower is a killer i rated this flower in 8.5 but i'm telling you for the heavy hitters that's looking for something to knock them down this flowers got it going on with 20 to 23 percent THC I'm given the style or an 8.5 but I think some people could consider this thing a 9.5 if you really like heavy flowers this is the doctor for weed

quarter of Tahoe og so I'm going to be doing kind of a strain review on math today I have some of the strain highlights and everything from Leslie so I'll be reading some of that I also picked up my grandma some wet so that'll be fun to try to put that all that side so I got a bolt packed up real quick I just kind of hand around it I have some other button my grinder didn't want to mix them up

weekend smooth I didn't feel the need to call for anything with it kind of piney the flavors on here that it says we're earthy tiny and pungent so yeah that's pretty and it sounds about right the effect you get from its their relaxed sleepy happy fork and hungry medical it's good for really good for insomnia I've done some research on it and everybody's saying this is really really good for smoking before bed it helps you sleep good for pain stress depression and lack of appetite the only negatives really are dry mouth and dry eyes but it's really was anything I guess highlights Tahoe G is a perfect rainy day strain strong and fast acting you may not want to use this strain when you're planning to leave the house great for those suffering from insomnia pain and lack of appetite Tahoe G has made its name for itself among other and because the top nighttime strain it provides an extremely extremely lazy heavy body sensation think the head so it ranges a 40 HDI thing goes up to I think about 22% [Music] [Music] it's really cushy got that straight would you push taste to it kinda nice um sorry I'm kind of Salmonella I'm trying to find what I was looking at earlier that I can't seem to find it is OG Kush it is a indica hybrid it slightly more indica than sativa I want to say I think I saw 60 to 50 so I guess you know I'm it's Thanksgiving I already ate dinner and everything

cannabis on it right there there's a lot of stars and like nebula kind of things on it and then when you open it up inside there's this there's more to be discovered written in here and then you have your glass jar of some really nice hash oil here so you got a 95 for presentation a 93 for product appeal and i gave it a 95 as well for the color of the oil of the x the hash oil in this case it's oh and it tastes divine it's so good color i got even a 95 smell i gave it a 93. there's a combination of like lemon and earth uh tahoe og is a phenotype of og kush so it gets a lot of that same smell a little bit just touch touch different just enough to make a little bit of a difference and give it a different name to give it a 93 for smell the taste is fantastic you can't taste like any additives you just taste like pure cannabis and it's phenomenal i gave it a 94 for taste 97 for potency this did a great job and i'm only taking like little dabs like half the size of a normal dab i want to conserve it and two because it does it doesn't take a lot to get me high off of this which is nice so got 97 for potency even at 95 for experience i really it was pleasant it was great um loved it honestly if it wasn't such a high price like a high price point i would buy more of this on a regular basis but the price point doesn't always make it affordable unless there's those sales going on

stating that they're one of washington's female owned brands and they're also family owned which both of those things are excellent in the cannabis industry but i couldn't find anything specific about their tahoe og or the processes that they use for their solventless hash oil so that's just like something i was curious about 97 for recommend and i gave it a 98 for overall follow constellation

of my 4,000 watts Tahoe og flower room just wanna make a little update video it's been about a week since I made one just to give you an idea what I've done the past week or so while I watered the plants once and that's it this looks pretty good but water again not all the plants need it you can see this pot still moist but I'm gonna hit them all again right now I'm gonna feed them really heavy to trying it some runoff from from each plant and then I probably need to water again for like three to four days this under lighting still not quite noticing any difference in bud size by the light but you know in a couple couple weeks I'll expect to see some of those getting kind of hard we are you know more than halfway done with the grow see if we can get some bud shots here I'm on my iPhone here I don't know how well this works for close-ups but somebody can see some I think I see a crystal somewhere yeah I see one it's another bud these plants don't look great really had this taco magnesium taco and you know every time I've grown Tahoe and actually a lot of oh geez they seem to do this now some here that aren't aren't doing it but them there some are I've been giving them that with some salts trying fix that and it looks like some of the takling just died off you can see it might be a little bit of nutrient burn or just like deadly from when it was talking last of my venomous about 700 parts per million right now I'm gonna give him about a thousand parts-per-million and probably after that I'll give him just like a straight water or something like that but they definitely need to be fed because some of them are pretty getting pretty light in here and I'm really happy with this grow it's just a solid massive canopy of colas I just fantastic yes I'll keep this

into week three we finished all our beneficial weeks one and two they are starting their big bud b-52 had their first meeting of it seem to be liking it pretty well the ladies got pretty tall and here you can see we've got double layers of trellis on since today is day 20 we shouldn't be stretching too much farther which is good did actually end up super cropping a branch here in the back that had got super tall but I think the rest of the buds should be okay shouldn't get too close to light we don't want too much light intensity Tahoe is a really good strain so far to me it's been growing really well definitely got some nice dark lush green color and they're starting to get some frost on the buzz and I am on my new beach and fun so I'm really bad at focusing and super sarios a lot of times which focus for me I guess I just haven't learned the trick of the camera we're sorry about that guys I just got real frickin refocused kinda hard to see how she's swaying in the wind getting some pretty nice but development for day 24 oh gee it's been quite a while since I made a video so I really don't know what to touch on just definitely wanted keep the guys update it finally got some

healed if that now yesterday this one did the same thing from UC probably thought the stretch Navarro like that but i think i think that might even make it banker because that's like you know of course that's like a super profit in which i have two dozen stars I just figured I'd start calling the snake in it you know just just for the hell of it anyway as I can see the Tahoe is looking tremendous it's all looking great Tahoe just looking very good so pretty sure it's more of a but the purple is kind of color on the side of my screen I changed it but I got a lower I got an old lower

i throw a nice fat piece of wax on the [ __ ] scale and there's still a bunch of residue all over this thing let's double check this take the patio off because it's sticky tear piece of wax minus the hair piggy bang 7.48 plus i'll scrape up the residue in there definitely uh seven and a half grams that's a-okay in my book dude i started holding the thing and it started getting like greasy and greasy look how shiny my fingers are look at this finger right here look how shiny it is it started melting on me because i had it in the freezer so i could get it off the parchment paper because it's like that sugar wax that i got before like that shiny sugar oh man it's all over my fingers so sticky and i had nowhere to put it so i ripped out a container real quick it wouldn't even fit in there because the thing was bigger than a freaking damn sand dollar so i [ __ ] packed it this thing is packed like tighter than a [ __ ] sardine squeezing up a bull's ass and it makes it look so dark but this [ __ ] is like probably like a it's it's real real similar to this it's got that same sugar glistened gloss that sugar [ __ ] ah sparkling like glitter look it's got that glitter shine can't wait to try this [ __ ] out [ __ ] yeah residue that i just scraped off the parchment paper love it when it looks like there's almost nothing left there just a little glistening and you scrape it with your dabber or with a [ __ ] razor blade [ __ ] comes right up in a nice [ __ ] fat glistening chunk definitely get a couple dabs off that it's a dab right there definitely definitely get [ __ ] three dabs off that scrape this [ __ ] up put it with the rest let me guy let me know uh if you guys like these reviews that reviews i do every time i get a a strain and uh you guys like if you like seeing me open it up like this and weigh it out and i usually do it every time i uh cop a new strain i mean i've had this strain before but not from this guy so it's a different clipping and different batch of tahoe but definitely it's time to try this [ __ ] i wish i just caught that on them first all step control areas that guy went back to kelly's roast beef food like restaurant got fired he's threatening if he doesn't get his job back he's gonna kill everybody he's hopped up on some sort of drugs and he claims he has a gun i turned the volume up a little bit turned it down last night while i was sleeping there was too much [ __ ] going on i couldn't [ __ ] sleep kept hearing the [ __ ] scanner go off which the guy's an idiot because it's like right next to the mall and the mall is right behind the police station so they're all there instantly this guy's gonna get caught he's [ __ ] harassing the people in the parking lot [ __ ] yelling and [ __ ] idiot shiny glistening beautiful sugar wax the only thing i hate and cannot stand about dabs is that right there every time i dab and it bothers me when i watch old videos because i do it like a thousand times throughout the freaking video always sniffling sniffing and sniffing or if i'm not sniffing blowing my nose these dabs break up your sinuses and [ __ ] and other people spit a lot and sneeze or get runny noses and [ __ ] everybody reacts a little different but for me i don't have like the backed up knowledge and everything but every time i do dabs my nose gets so runny uh i already got the guy shooting florida driver's license charlie five five zero seven nine three eight six zero two one zero that's charlie five five zero seven nine three eight six zero two one zero last name k n c a n n o n first name this shit's kind of like a red rusty color too when it's not so thick who the [ __ ] would go back to their job that they just got fired from if you don't hear me back i'm gonna kill everybody in here that's gonna get you your job back that's that's that's some like mental health issues right there some severe ones because that person's obviously not thinking crazy you don't go barking threats like that and when you do you're either totally off your rocker or you're being legit about your threats you guys seen in the news about the guy that walked in the kennedy compound and sat down with the 16 year old boy and had a bowl of tortellini captain america telling you man people are [ __ ] losing it over here that was down in the cape i live in the north shore that was on the south shore i sat down [ __ ] hung out for over three hours had conversations had a bowl of tortellini a kid went upstairs took a shower left the guy downstairs and family finally calls and they're like uh we don't know who that guy is call the police [ __ ] guy gets arrested has a nut bag saying he was looking for katy perry in the late jfk okay wow good stuff no warrant a valentine under arrest wish they'd save for what wish they'd say if he really had that gun or not then it ups his uh threat to another level there threatening give me my job or i'm gonna kill everybody and you really got a gun on you that ain't gonna be a good thing usually i'm not usually but sometimes they'll say under arrest assault and battery or under arrest uh drugs class whatever c class d you know do you need anything from um kelly usually they say but this one all this one's going to be coming in maybe taxes statement by the girl i think he attacked a girl so easy when you got a big thick container like like it's not a big container but i packed it in here this thing is solid thick it's real easy to go overboard and pluck big big dabs but you know what no need for it at all this is some nice [ __ ] decent wax but the dude i paid for it though i normally pay from this guy that i've been going through 280 for a quarter today it went from 280 to 320 and i was just straight up i don't have 320 i don't have it so he goes all right it's going to be 3 10. you know what i just [ __ ] went there then we had to drive down the road and wait for some girl to drive by and [ __ ] throw her the [ __ ] money i get there he already has it but we got to go pay the person so he's like get in the car i'm like i only got 300 bucks i had 300 left to my name that's all i had he's like you know what [ __ ] they've been [ __ ] pissing me off lately and [ __ ] upping the price and the quality of the buds going down and [ __ ] but the wax is bomb shit's [ __ ] fire fuel suga um so he's like i don't even give a [ __ ] about the ten dollars [ __ ] up i'm like okay whatever [ __ ] went down to the sketch ass spot pulled up just threw the [ __ ] money at her and just drove the [ __ ] away it's whatever so i paid 300 bucks for seven and a half grams probably a little bit more than seven and a half because when i scraped off that [ __ ] parchment paper was at least probably a a point or two at least so a little over seven and a half grams for three bills and [ __ ] last month i got four grams for 100 bucks from my other connect what the [ __ ] huge huge difference in price but there is like a i don't know i gotta do a little bit more dabbing before i can uh honestly say about the potency and uh actual round all around quality of the wax i do like that sugary fiery consistency can't go wrong there but i don't know hard to say i guess it all has to do about personal preference these clips go too quick and i don't have a time to tell you guys everything sometimes good story in the news from the next town over from us go and google or [ __ ] check out uh beverly massachusetts arson fire there's a 19 year old kid that got arrested the other kid the other day broke into a [ __ ] abandoned house with his

actually beefing up see I remember from our week five and a half video which was a week and a half ago this is about six and a half these girls will be bottled a 48 49 I think I'm gonna take the whole

third one that is my next run i'm betting some sour diesel clothes and some tahoe clothes so I could do this again it would have structured our coldest and a bud formation better in the plant nipple late to plant better talk without the light on yeah I want to give a shout out to our be a Jones a recommending that P and K recipe well not the rest of people just simply mentioning it you know I was

y'all see a little bit", "SqF2cx-UgYs": "we are going to review another vape cartridge this is optimum and if you had watched that video you know that this is the first brand that I have purchased a second time simply because I liked it and I wanted one that I liked so this is a different strain however so I'll let you know if I noticed any differences and what the effect of the strain is imma let you know how it tastes right now and that should cover most of the bases and then of course the cost and if I think we should buy it again or not so as far as optimum products I think we should buy it again because I have the last one I had was the sativa this one's an indica and the last strain was Green crack this one is taco og so love the last one hopefully I like this one just as much let's go rundown on the analysis which is the same so the analysis is as follows the strain is Tahoe og the potency analysis is a CBD a zero percent total eighty four point three four percent THC eighty four point three four percent sea wheedies one point zero seven percent in THC zero percent there anything else interesting there harvest a manufacturing date it has a used by a date of November eighth of 2017 but if you watch my review you know that we should be buying these like the day we want to use them of the day after if you want to know why that is check out the video I'm going to crack this open see if anything stands out that I should mention otherwise we're gonna go ahead and throw it on our battery and get to smoking on it so one of the things I love about the optimum cartridges and we'll get a little closer up on this thing you're not gonna stand up in ruin are you okay one of the things I love about these is this top piece like on most of them it's plastic and it feels plastic and this actually feels like metal it may be plastic but it's actually way heavier I never had the top come off like on all these the tops always pop off and I have to move them the one nice thing about that is if I I can line up the mouthpiece in whatever direction I want to for heading purposes to line it up with where the button is and being able to see the smoke but these in particular these Optimum's they are pretty awesome because it's just a high call you this one weighs a lot more than say this one and it's not just that half gram of oil missing it's just you can feel the quality and these optimum cartridges and I really appreciate that I like the extra weight and I was a tube running all the way up and down which none of the others do and maybe that's why it's such highly comes highly recommended and this cartridge was picked up in Auburn at Evergreen market and there is their logo the first thing I love about these is the quality of the cartridge seems to be extremely high and I love the flavor in my last one because it tasted like weed so let's get down and smoking it I'll let you know what this tastes like and the girl told me to sold this to me when I asked her which one she preferred they were both indicas but they only had two of these optimum extracts available and they're both indicas and asked her which one she recommended out of two that were available and she was very gung-ho on Tahoe Tahoe when it came to flavor and effect she said if you want to fall asleep smoke this so we'll see I have a pretty decent tolerance so if it makes me pass out then it definitely I will hit you at least all right let's smoke it and see what she tastes like this brand always produced a lot of smoke too and it hits me pretty good the I've noticed that the two are these five that I like and I actually didn't mention this video we're both kind of harsh which I liked it's a good harsh in the three that didn't really give me two stone well good we're really smooth I don't know if has anything to do with there was just a coincidence Peck hey okay so wow that was one really big hit it tasted not quite as like we'd as the other optimum did the green crack but it doesn't taste super perfumey well not perfume me at all but it doesn't taste like the green crack I'm gonna actually take a smaller hit so I can focus more on the flavor well welcome back everyone it's been about 45 minutes or so and this definitely started hitting I mentioned on the camera even during smoking it that I was already starting to feel it and it probably progressed for about 20-30 minutes when it peaked it it had an indica feel it didn't completely knocked me on my ass but yeah it definitely had a heavier indica type of hide to it I'm about 45 minutes in like I said starting to come down but I still definitely am feeling the effects and it's pretty nice so I took basically two hits off it did hit real fast and it's still kind of going I'm gonna hit it one more time and get back to work but not bad I really like it this optimum extracts is seems to be really quality stuff I would prefer I do think I like that sativa green crackle OH", "CIEQpX2_Ny0": "alright guys sorry it took so long it's been an odd odd day all day project it's now quarter to 12:00 midnight just got home just broke up my [ __ ] just end up getting back with it

not gonna argue I'm not gonna [ __ ] end up with nothing I'll take the floor gives me a few bucks in my pocket and it gives me some [ __ ] wax but it's different it is different than here I'll just let you take a look and I'll surely show and tell okay this is the wax that I just got it looks almost identical by camera to this but they're a lot different this is the shatter that turned to a like a molasses SAP like a buttery SAP that's actually kind of buttered up a little bit here anyway not the best but it's [ __ ] does the trick for me it's good I'm not gonna complain it's not bad this right here is more waxy it is definitely more waxy see how like when I touch it like light peanut butter amber the camera makes out so much darker than when it really is but this is more of like a

wasn't paying attention to a camera like right here see this big chunk right here there's a huge chunk of shatter that didn't butter up like right there's a big chunk of shatter keep digging there's more you gotta move this and you'll see the huge chunk start moving like are you yeah look at that chunk of shatter that didn't but her up it's whatever shit's good it's better than nothing and that's what you got to think of it as sometimes it's better than nothing ain't the best but it's better than nothing alrighty but yeah I just took a dab of this [ __ ] I was gonna wait till tomorrow to do

plant of it and seeing well I've been harvested yeah but it looks like it's going to be an incredibly low yielding and not take up much surface area whatsoever for example I veg to plan for three weeks floured it it's gonna get harvested today but the the width of the canopy of that single plant is no wider than the actual pot that it's in so I decided to do this flower room under 4000 watts and pack the pots in rather than spreading them out doing eight thousand watts so I wanted to avoid having holes in my canopy and since it's a very low yielding strain to waste all the electricity and nutrients and space of an eight thousand watt garden for a full collective garden of Tahoe gee and hardly get anything I figured I put under 4000 watts and get a lower yield but much more efficient grow so that's what I'm doing here I've got a full collective gardens worth of Tahoe cheekbones I just transplanted them today and then water them each with one gallon of nutrients I gave them went to random stuff just veg nutrients for the and now let them sit for probably about a week before I wanted them again I'm gonna do maximum three week bed but probably more like a 14 day veg with these and then flip them into flour the setup of this room it's 4,000 watt garden for magnet reflects el Ojo hoods air-cooled sealed room got a couple oscillating fans in the walls a few of them run in co2 got a carbon scrubber over there in the corner basically all five gallon room acre pots with a bunch of little clones pretty spindle II but that's how Tahoe grows as far as the stocks go you're pretty thick stocks for little clones I mean they're hard they're hard like wood but yeah those are all the plants I've got the lights about 30 inches above the clones and let the clones stretch up a little bit yep the lights pretty much as far as I'll go without this ducting having to be detached I'm actually not cooling the hoods even though I do have the glass in the hoods right now but the co2 is to keep it nice and cool anyway I'll update you guys either in a week or when I get ready to flower but I just wanna let you know that this grow house started piece", "o1qN_u1S1JY": "yeah baby back once

is the only spot I shot that because they truly take care of you as a patient and I've never been treated better so that is my shop spot so we go with the that's got a great flavor to it very punching I would say it's a musky muscular strain I don't think it has it's it's almost like a musky or Kush super strong but Paul I got a little tiny bit taste of almost like a Mick wish taste you know it's like a candy licorice the muskie hits you first then after that you'll taste sweetness it's really really nice stuff check out we deliver on wheat maps oh and another thing oh sorry but I have to check the time the effects of the peanut butter cereal bar were pretty actually it was actually in between heavy and mild I would say and that's for me and I'm somebody who does smoke shatter and stuff like that so for a hundred milligram bar I would not recommend a full bar to most unless you are an avid user of cannabis and or shatter or stronger products because it will more than likely put you to sleep it's really with a good product child edibles really really strong a really really good stuff and to this date I don't think I've actually had product from them that was bad at all super

booth and I thought it was pretty cheap so I decided to try some out I'm gonna open it smell it okay so what it looks like [Music] they put the little peepee on the bottom side the purple punch and you get like a berry smell a sweet smell a little bit of a purple smell the strain is purple punch or punch is a sweet and sedating in the cut dominant hybrid the genetics are Larry og and granddaddy

purple punch you're gonna be trying this let's see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] some of the berry flavor comes through I also get a lot of pine flavors overall flavor-wise I'll probably give this a 3 out of 5 the price is five out of five being at $15 [Music] the cool thing about the strain is it gives you a two punch effect both to the cerebral and to the body this is a perfect strain paired with desserts or as a dessert the effects may help with nausea stress body aches sleeplessness the main flavors that I smell from this is the berry and the sweet I get hence maybe Hensel

"oh I gotta go I gotta go I got it go take that Rihanna song mark our for quack quack", "zCf6vDWgqIM": "[Music] today we're gonna talk about la strongest flowers now that doesn't mean that these are my favorite flowers those that's a separate list my favorite flowers really has flowers on it that can make me grin I talked about to something something or the perma-grin smile those are my favorite flowers but some people they want the strongest flowers possible so I went back through all my flowers and I went to think which ones were the strongest so today we're going to count down the top 10 and then in the end I'm gonna put the the winner for the strongest in the vapor cup and I'm gonna be the winner and enjoy it so coming in at number 10 of the strongest flowers in LA is marathon og this is Nipsey Hussle is namesake and the cultivator is the Cure company this flower has 25% THC and it's an indica and this fire really liked it this is a daily flower daily driver it's strong it's it leaves you clear-headed I really liked it and so if you see marathoner OG is definitely worth the try coming in at number 9 is the sleeper that everyone should try seeks grapes from King's garden this flower is just fantastic I've been trying to rebuy this forever but I can't find this flower anywhere I hope the people from Kings Gardens see this video and know that they should put more of this flower into the market it's a winner this flower has 24 percent THC it's an indica hybrid and this flower also made my favorites list so did marathon OG and this flower is really great if you see it acidic grapes grab it coming in at number eight and these flowers are just getting stronger and stronger it is Hara wanna oh gee from Ames and this is an indica hybrid this flower has 25% hc' I got a hhc dispensary in Van Nuys and they had really heavy hitting flowers down there if you go in there and you talk with the bud tenderness and you tell them you want the heavy hitters they know what it is this is a good flower it's super strong it's not a daytime flower for me this is a nighttime flower but here Awana I always have the saying if you watch the prior videos if nothing else gets just stone because you've been partying all day this one will we're moving up to number seven which was the winner of the list of my favorite flowers in LA actually this is indoor organic Gardens iog Mac won and this flower it's just fantastic if you can fly if you can find it it's such a winner I found a lot of people email me at weed entertainment our info and weed entertainment anyone can you mail me my answer back and this flower will put a smile on your face and that way that's why it was the winner it smiled me this flower is 29% THC and it's a sativa winner this flower is super strong but the flowers coming are even stronger imagine that coming in at number six is the gushers just pleasures and this flower is just fantastic this is the high THC of the whole list this flower is thirty thirty-one point two nine percent THC and this one will make you and all your friends just laugh and laugh this is a great flower this is the high flower with 31% but if you look at this whole list most of these flowers that are the strongest only they're not in the 30s this is the only one in the 30s it's crazy as they charge these high prices for high 30s flowers but I'm telling you it's not better but we're moving on up and at number 5 we have peach punch and peach punch has 24 percent THC it's a hybrid this was the cookie strain I thought had the most punch and so if you like cookies and you want to try one of the strongest flowers or the strongest one I've tried so far peach punches the winter and also I went down to cookies dispensary which is a dispensary of this brand down on Melrose and I asked them what's the strongest flower and the first one they said was peach punch so they think so too but it did so funny as I hear that from someone in the know that's that's involved with this company and that's what I show up with - I know I'm you know I'm in the know so we're moving on up in at number four this flower kicked my ass Tahoe Oh G by 3 C farms this was just too strong for me this is a I think as we get up here all these flowers it's not for me all the ones below this I like them and I probably read bought all of them if I could but this one it's just too strong this flower only 22 percent THC it's a hybrid but if you see Tahoe gene I'm not saying all Tahoe G's because I tried this stream before but it didn't do what this one did this flower is super strong and it comes in at number 4 on the list of LA's top 10 strongest flowers so I'm gonna stick my straw into the vapor Cup and we are gonna set this thing in 3:30 where it is and in the end the winner we're gonna do it so next up at number 3 is the pink runs and if you haven't seen the pink runs video I did you should watch that because this flower really is a funny flower if you have no responsibility that day and you don't care how many mistakes you make maybe this is the flower for you cuz it just messed with my brain and I couldn't remember anything this flowers from fire society it has 21% THC it's a hybrid I would say this is one of the best flowers from fire society too strong for me I'm out on the pink run so I need to be responsible during my day this is for someone who can be irresponsible if you want to be irresponsible try this one we're moving up to number two the second strongest flower that I've tried in LA is from insane it's called Hawaiian runts and the insane Hawaiian runs and this flower would didn't kick my ass I liked it better than a lot of the other runs I thought this flower was really strong and that's why I liked it but it's really strong this is not for lightweights if you're a beginner don't try any of the run strains actually but this one was a killer it's 22% THC it's a hybrid and I got this at dr. green thumbs this is I think the strongest liar I've ever tried out of that place but coming in at number one the grand champion of all the flowers I've tried in LA is Kanna teak runce and this thing called the last one a killer dud the pink rice this one is to kill or the tile oh won't you excuse me this is the killer or killers these were the two really strong ones runts can t can toggle oh gee both of these oh my god this flower 26 percent THC it's a hybrid if you want to try the strongest flowers candy crunch was the winner today we're in we put a straw in already in the vapor Cup you can see I've got it set to 3:30 and want to congratulate can teak it's not easy to grow the strongest flower in LA right and they also got number two on my favorite flowers list with blueberry coffins so Kanna teak really is a grower to look out for if you see their flowers definitely worth the trying so here we go Kanna teak runs out of the vapor Cup at 3:30 Wow so this flower has the og taste makes a lot of ink I'm trying to be careful a little bit want to congratulate Kanna teak again if you want to see vapor Cup you can see it at vapor Cup calm this bait is really great I'm telling you it's a life-changing item you can't well it's not meant to walk around everywhere with it it's meant to walk around your house with it or if you go to a hotel room and the great thing is you can vape on this thing all night and in the morning your hotel or your house or anything it does not stink this thing doesn't leave a sink which is really great for me because I want to vape wherever I want to do it if you want to see the top 10 flowers in La you can see them a tweed entertainment.com thanks for watching the videos we really appreciate it party on my friends [Music]", "8VWUlzVhHHQ": "how's it going out there youtubers

a bit late on the super cropping I was noticing this I waited too long it's too thick to start the super cropping these stems but I did so wanted to let some light in that's a dutch passion the ultimate you're looking at there oh there's another one that one's opened up a lot more than this one nice little canopy on top there that's ace of spades which i think is a male ace of spades female ace of spades another male ASA spades female this one i cloned heavily because i really liked I don't know something ring special about this one in particular to me from the get started off with these purple stocks and so now just I mean I just have to to van Cole is there but two weeks this middle part will be all filled in and it'll be a nice canopy on top there with lotsa heads topped it to a bunch of times so here's another female ace of spades spades by tigi a super cropped top and the middle part is filling in there and then right here we have cali connections butta tahoe OG I know it looks it's looking really scarce right now because I heavily lollipop and I took like three clones off of that one or four yeah I think three so there's like nothing underneath right now see but they're still babies there's still these these plants are only a little over a month old so I'm going to give them a couple more weeks to fill in some more and then I'm going to flip them into 12 12 get get the ball rolling on some buds here the clones I took let's see two clones from plant number one ace of spades I took six from that one special fee know that I said I liked that's number two right there match up to from the fourth plant or it's labeled number four that's a cali connection back there one two three four looks like I got four cuttings from there three from the dutch passion in the back right there and three from the other one so a lot of these clowns are being gifted out consider nail root four of them are going to a friend here another couple are going to another friend and then I'm going to keep a few of each for the next round of flowering buds or flowering plants to go in the tent and then after this i'll be starting more autos and then after i think after this photo run is going to be my last photo run for a while until my situation is different here after that last run I did what the auto mains are in syrup I was really impressed with the yield five ounces from the auto bays are four and a half from the syrup and 70 days and those two plants were sharing light with a target plans so I was really impressed and I think I'm going to stick with the autos for right now because that just chops my time in half you know two months as opposed to waiting for four with the photos because I start from seed every time I don't have I have somebody I can just go to do and pick up clones from or store or anything like that so quick update for today guys thanks for watching until next time peace out", "T4IkRA6mrx8": "it's a very bottom Okla taupe and today we're doing a strain review got two strains here tahoe g and sunset OG they're both fire I believe the sunset oh geez at indica then the Tahoe is a hybrid of sixty percent indica and forty percent of sativa so I can tell them by their song gotta this is the this is the tahoe and dude it looks like trash in the camera go further on this [ __ ] and this is the up the sunset oh gee but we're going to go ahead and give both a [ __ ] test drive um see if we can't get the light on them got a flashlight here so maybe you just shot a casita that's the it's a sunset and then we got the tahoe Tahoes are smaller popcorn ugh so i'll find me too big one and I got faith so I asked if I could get a half eighth of each strain as a hair on that yeah dude like I said it can't really give it justice because the camera just [ __ ] trash on this laptop just [ __ ] garbage but I had like I for some [ __ ] that be better iphone or [ __ ] same phone or something so yeah I got the bigger nug of the tahoe and then a little small nug of the sunset we're just gonna give each a try see how we think of them see what we think of them then ah yeah well let you guys know so I'm gonna go ahead and a tub put in the tahoe OG first and the NOC structure not extremely like hard this sunset ah it's so [ __ ] just danced crazy like this big nug and then like two little other baby dogs was like the half eighth and I got the jefe the sunset we're not since the kaho here we go guys this is the tahoe g and go ahead and give it a try see we think perfectly green hit I take one hit so here we go so it take pretty good I'm just Turner trying to get the flavoring but I definitely a really cushy for sure um what else just gets a real crush real strong tasty though it's [ __ ] tasty but he got background on the tahoe OG like i said it's a it's a hybrid it's 60 in the cuff 40 sativa the strain is cross between OG kush on 10 / narrow see infra narrow Valley OG so that's where I'm getting a coach taste I'm supposing as the OG Kush of the genetics um they said that yeah well that's what it says on that i'm not going to read the whole thing but that's the tahoe g out of a scale of one content give it like a 7.5 it's good on flavor I mean he\u00eds good because it smoked it before the for the video and smoke it on there yourself but uh we're just going to hit this and clear okay well that's clear see right through it she [ __ ] forehead on the other side but uh that's clear we're gonna take I just I mean I got a little baby probably I on me to [ __ ] pic gigantic nugs don't you have a nice one of this I have no idea what's even playing on my TV that's like looking up like what the [ __ ] um hi guys this is the sunset oh gee the genetics on this it's actually its own genetic it's not a cross breeding it's an indica organic indoor so it's indoors indicate organic on the amount of THC is 15.99 percent CB d is 0 point for six percent and CBN is a whole point 5 1 percent so good amount of th e to Ma CBD get my merci bien it's all good here we go the sunset OG personally i'd like to sunset OG over the tahoe because um I'm not sure you know what might be because of uh because it's indica I like just real stony effect or whatnot but let's get this in us don't [ __ ] rambling on yeah I I really the taste it's [ __ ] American life on this first exhale through a fruity like uh I don't know that's good as [ __ ] you know I'm not I'm never really liked when I smoke I smoke and I'm not like thinking of like pinpoint with the flavors but that is [ __ ] good that is tasty for sure I'm really liking that second hit of course it's not going to be tasting good but I [ __ ] man that was that was a good hit for sure that was tasty so Otto uh zero out of ten sometimes you i'ma give it a guy hits me at the flavor good it's a good heavy indica get you nice and stony everything you need you know we need your CBD cbn she teach see all that it's in there it's good you're [ __ ] I mean you're golden ponyboy but I have a little little pinch left of this Tahoe not Tahoe sunset I got a bunch Tahoe down here but I'm probably gonna smoke the tahoe first just because save best for last but here we go this is a another piece of the sunset oh gee love it taste is on point pace is really on point but it's super tasty but one thing you do now is packed another bowl of the tahoe i keep getting mixed up oh [ __ ] know what saputo cheese I have no idea we're just gonna try to redeem an see if like I mean squishy buds and they're sort of drive but you know they're squishy at the same time sorta and it isn't good moisture in it I mean it's not wet but it's not [ __ ] crumbly dry you know it's a good balance um concept this is a little moist I like it a little moist I have no problem with that just uh I don't want to be bone-dry I hate that but we're gonna try to redeem the tahoe see if we can't get another good taste off it here we go guys like I said it's really just uh really just push flavor right when it hits your tongue and other than that you know it the flavor really dims out quick but with the sunset it's like stinks it sticks for a good second I mean you know maybe good five six seconds after you'll be able to taste it and it's fireman I'm loving the sunset so if you can get yourself some stone set oh gee go ahead and get it it's a [ __ ] pretty dang strain Tahoes dank as hell too I mean but it all varies it really does because you can't say that the next guys tahoe OG is gonna be the same as mine cuz it's not it's just not this the look oh that oh yeah like I said next guys sec is not going to be the same as mine so you can't really take my word for it it's just a for entertainment purposes uh unless we're getting like them we're not going from same place be honest I don't do for dispensary so I mean they might not even be Tahoe and sunset ogia what don't you know but that's what i told them i mean we flee and all that it all it all adds up to what is shown here in front of me so i'll take their word for it but that's the review guys hope you liked it i will definitely be making more an upcoming future i'm about to have some good concentrates some named branch i can do reviews on but i like subscribe comment if you [ __ ] don't like it give me a thumbs down I don't care [ __ ] just uh do you man peace y'all", "BGFVTyDt-m4": "[Music] oh yeah guys what up big Dan over here coming at you and yeah you're in another epic location guys oh yeah just toking up a fatty all year alright so check this out guys we're over here out of dedicated 6k Buridan room every single strand in here is different guys there is maybe two there's doubles up a few strains but everything in here is a different strain guys are [ __ ] year and we just want to do some epic epic epic breeding and as you can see I think we accomplished that this time oh yeah we got everything from Rio dankness Ken's gear we got everything up in this [ __ ] holy grails night Tara oh jeez dead diesels phantom stompers phantom face got short little blueberries in there DJ show up blueberries and everything in here is day 21 we got a whole roll of different gauge green gear you can see the super blue dreams super tall touching the friggin lights already we got some mess up these up in there I think we got double ups SF vs a clone only I made it out this way not sure if it's the sub LBC birds you know but so LBC yeah but yeah guys so the basic let me take it though all year all right so the basic the basic thing that we even got these big-ass monsters on the outside so the basic plan for this super humungous breeded project right guys is to let you guys pick what we're gonna cross this whole [ __ ] room at so right now we got the we got pollen saved up and we also have a few live males now yeah I could go in here and I could go do the brush on everything and get a whole bunch of different kinds of crosses and all kinds of may be in stable instability especially if I was like say it hit this branch with a jar of Ken's Kush pollen and then I try to hit that one over there what a different type of pollen and then the fan [ __ ] blows it around I don't know what the [ __ ] going on so I'm not gonna do that [ __ ] I'm gonna bring one male in here I'm just gonna bring one jar of pollen and I'm gonna just do the whole [ __ ] so what we got is the phantom cooking male pollen that we know and trust super super guilt pollen all these makes the hundred percent germination rate seeds and everything's looking great with him so uh we could always use that pollen we got the Ken's OG Kush pollen and we got Ken's GDP pollen so I can make this whole groom either cross with a cookie cross with a perp walk across with OG so so basically like everything in here guys say if it was like down there like the chemtrail we could have purple Kentrell or we could have like a hoe G chem trail or Kentrell cookies fail me oh yeah so yeah let me get now this that's the camera at about eight feet tall over my head all right right where the lights are eight feet this cage right here is that seven feet boom so you can see these are monsters all right the dedication to just take this entire room and hit it with pollen that's a big that's a big dedication guys so I don't want to hear about pollen chucking I don't want to hear about none of that [ __ ] you know we go through extensive extensive germination termination fee no finders all that [ __ ] killing hundreds and hundreds of males so yeah to turn this whole room out and totally waste all these buds and just have all kinds of different seats for the public oh yes take advantage guys take advantage so uh all right so we're gonna do that so you've got to decide on what we're gonna do and also I got a real real real big announcement because everybody and their mother been asking for this [ __ ] [ __ ] now I have people begging and begging for months and man I never wanted

tree right there the main driveway yeah if it says future homes Shady Lane tree farm then that's me trying to give people enough time to jump in on the on the chats as well in the video before I get into this morning's fast on a cool note I added a new Coke machine or another Coke machine into my collection this is a 1960s Cavalier CS 64 yes it's the front loader you open the door dropping your coins and you take a bottle out realized one I like it I've always liked this particular style of machines ever since I was a little kid they used to be one at my father's work at the records studio and it was really cool I used to hang out in the back and watch movies and stuff and if I wanted something to drink walk around and good morning bud rich huh it's always coffee time come on now but uh yeah I've always always wanted one of these style machines and I had the opportunity I picked one up how did it delivered last night actually the guy who was really nice for me and took me about ten minutes maybe and I got it I got it running got it powered up no quite happy about that um it's in the 60s like I've actually I need to do just a little more research like I said I know that the name of the Machine it's a Cavalier cs6 before es so I need to find out exactly the year it's one of the ones that it used to have it too and say I wish somebody didn't take it off on the side of the machine or the mouse yes on the side of the machine are the mounts for the old soda fountain or not sort of found that water fountain that would hook in place you know if people would come over it was kind of a draw you would come over to get a drink out of the water fountain for free you're staring at the Coke machine which usually kind of age ago hmm dig in your pockets and see if you had that quarter to get yourself a you know an eight six six and a half ounce bottle or an eight ounce bottle or of course you know twelve ounce as if they got newer so this now makes for four coke machines plus my old thirties coke cooler nice nice little selection you got there the strains on the one I'm going to be testing today our Tahoe OG Kush crossed with blueberry now you really can't go wrong with those I mean you know that would hit with that type of parents it's it's got to be a winner you would think you know officer for sure we I have the thirties style old coke cooler the floor one you know you walk up and you would open it up this way to take your drink out to of the counter mount soda fountains the actual ones that the soda jerks got their names from you actually have to get it to come out by 80s machine which is up in my drive-in and then the sixties machine that I picked up last night quite happy once I get everything up and running everything fully going here at the compound you know the tree farms operational all the stuff is going and people are people are here I'm gonna contact coke and just be like hey what do you say what's your help a mom and pop out here you know look at all the coke products that I've got won't remember one of the things that I am actually putting together isn't arcade currently I have nine machines in there I am going to be putting in we'll see that's what I'm that's what I'm going to say you see if they want you know if I can get that I know they used to do it all the time I don't know if they still do it as much anymore but I mean nothing ventured nothing gained where sigh here is no but uh I've got like I've seen about the arcade I've got nine machines as it is I am gonna be putting in at least one pinball machine I'd like to do it three or four of them I actually even have somebody and I thought I really think this is a really cool idea I have an individual who who does machines here II fabs him fixes him up he also does to work for people he actually offered to make me my own Connecticut Medical Marijuana critics pinball machine how [ __ ] cool is that [Laughter] [Laughter] oh yeah I know it would have to be all done up of course absolutely absolutely and as far as like that coke glasses goes one of the things I did when I first hunted down my soda fountains because I just I've always wanted one of those I went and I got ahold of it was really hard to find too but I got ahold of a couple of cases of the old vintage coke glasses the ones that are like this big the ones that were actually used for these types these types of fountains so I'll have things set up in the general store eventually so when you know people come in to pay for their Christmas trees or you know I'll pick up a stand or stuff like that or it's summertime and they're just walking around and check things out if they want a soda they can get will actually hook a bubble soda jerk I'm a tall coke from from the soda fountain and put it in one of the original vintage glasses obviously they're not going to be able to keep the glasses but you know I think it'll be get you I mean who does that anymore what place has a soda fountain now the newer ones I don't really count those you know the the the multi tap systems or what you walk up like in Burger King and stuff like that they are fountains don't get me wrong but something like this is fricking sweet actually I'll show you a photo of it hope you guys for a minute this is the fountain I'm talking about I have two of these they're different years different styles one has this control and then the other one looks like this here we go like that notice the handle difference yeah they are they're damn sweet I love these things you actually have to put it and you open it up it has two separate containers inside one you put your syrup in what's going on Gabe thanks for joining us over there facebook land brother what you put your syrup in the other one you put your your ice and stuff in that gets hooked into your your your tank for yourself sir and then you not sell sir but you know damn I'm tripping over my own words they I need to smoke alright we've hit the 15 minute mark I can probably start my class soon but that I hope the lighted hooked up to the tank and then you literally have to go back and forth with the handle thank you it's like literally stuck on the tip of my tongue [Laughter] you have to go back and forth with the handle isit even that won't make you stuck hmm I'd have to save a sativa that won't make you stock now you're talking like you know the real heavy heavy fuzzies heavies all right man you have a good one thanks for joining me today while you're on your way okay all right that's that's what I figured I just want to make sure um let's see off the top of my head I've done a couple of sativas recently that did have you tried most recent screen that AGL put out which is a sativa on its thus Adam aren t well yeah that's that's one of the good properties about indicas on Santa Baron T it's twenty four point eight six Creek correct but some people though actually things can work opposite I've I know people who personally a sativa like a nicety bit to them is something that they smoked at night what they want to go to sleep it's it's weird but they've always been that way so as I was saying the AGL sanam aren t twenty four point eight six it was the Tina Danza I'm trying to push crossed with Georgia pine that really should give you what you're looking for well I mean that looks kind of kind of you know the point behind it ended is to do that have you tried different types to see how each one affects you nice nice okay well you know speaking of I'm gonna do I'm gonna get into today's test so again for the ones who knew I'm gonna be heading up the pure relief lapis the t23 which is a hybrid the 38:41 this is Tahoe OG Kush crossed with blueberry Purple Haze is nice but yes this is Tahoe gee the Tahoe gee cush crossed with blueberries and if you're not familiar with the strange not a problem I've got you covered as always Tahoe OG Kush is Tahoe G is the perfect rainy day strain they say strong and fast-acting you may not want to use this strain when you're planning to leave the house cuz that's a lot of people do get couch lock great for those suffering from insomnia pain or lack of appetite keep those in mind Tahoe OG has made a name for itself amongst other indicates a top nighttime strain it provides an extremely lazy heavy body sensation due to superb reading Tahoe OG embodies all of the typical indicas with an added euphoric sativa light kick which is interesting the strain features an earthy lemon taste and is a phenotype of OG Kush now they say maturing and around ten weeks tahoe gee is a must try for those looking for a great night's sleep hmm absolutely now blueberry anything blueberry I like anything blueberry I always have a true a list cannabis strain blueberries legendary status soared to new heights after claiming the High Times Cannabis Cup in 2004 best indica the long history of the Strand has been traced back into the late 70s when American breeder DJ's short was working with a variety of exotic landrace strains however throughout the decades of blueberries cultivation the genetics have been passed around due in large part to DJ's short working with multiple seed banks and breeders the sweet flavors of fresh blueberries combining with the relaxing effects produce a nice long-lasting sense of euphoria for a lot of people many medical patients appreciate blueberry for its ability to suppress pain and really in stress while connoisseurs and growers admire the strain for its colorful hues and its high THC content mm-hmm yeah breakdown on this particular products we got 20 THCA at 22.8 1% THC at 0.66% CBD a is not applicable CBD is not applicable CBG a has 0.11% CBG not applicable CB n not applicable and then wrapping it up at CBC which is also not applicable [Music] now I do have to point out the one thing I like of pure Leafs pre-rolls versus their plans for your roles alright it's nice it really is like as soon as you crack this tube open you get a lovely lovely whiff and set just coming on up I mean it's not one of the ones that you really have to you know it's it's nice it's enjoyable but you don't have to there pre-rolls I don't have issues with the burn on the pre-roll from key relief the way I do on the ones from Thera plan their plan I've had a pre rolls like side tracks halfway not paying attention to it just puffing on it like you know smoking away I look down on this side and it's in it's burnt way the [ __ ] down and it seems to be like a common problem good morning Scott it seems to be a common problem I don't know oh absolutely I can't stand that I don't know if it's that they're just rolling them too tight yeah I really don't know that's a nice base billet I mean not hacking my brains out as you can see I cheat but why I plan to give a pause there for a second it is it is absolutely has a nice burn to it I've learned what the key relief ones excuse me with the dairy plant ones you need them roll them in your fingers to kind of loosen it up a little bit because if you don't do that you get that [ __ ] canoe that that sidetrack it and then it gets bad nice you can get an eighth of pre-rolls for like 20-something bucks less than $30 you do get a nicer pole absolutely I mean for somebody who's who's you know on a budget doesn't have a lot of cash but needs it like you know if you can't roll maybe you know again I thought I was I've always talked about the pre-rolls of the fact that for the ones well for people who have arthritis well this was just an ace so I got three - this one you know they do H they do quarters you can you know you can go on up I like the pre rolls again as I say because arthritis or if you're somebody who damaged their hands you can't roll you know or you're just someone who can't roll you're good to go you let it really take it out light your little tip and you're off now with these I do notice I feel the kind of here it's not fully here on the sides it's not here in the middle it literally is here I've had people asked about you know what's in the pre rolls you know suffer like I don't like that because I don't know what goes in it first so I'm actually on video taking a free roll sliced it down the side and opened it up and show and everybody what was in it I mean again to me really doesn't make a difference what's going on see how are you thanks for joining it today so me it doesn't really make a difference because if I'm smoking it it's it's all doing the same thing I mean you know yeah it's nice exactly it's nice to sit down hold the bud feel the bud smell abide pull it apart you know there's just there's there's just something about that process it's all part and parcel of that with me you know even though I have my own line of grinders I still people that see me do it many times sit down and break up a bud by hand I like that though it really is it's it to me it helps in the relaxing exactly it helps part of the relaxing process as I'm getting ready to medicate you know it gets me happy it calms me down it's triggering all my senses because as I'm breaking it up the scent the smells and everything they're coming up so I'm like ooh hoo that's really nice oh I can't wait to smoke absolutely absolutely so yes there is something for breaking it up with the fingers there are other times when it's just like man I just want to smoke up so grab the grinder grab a nice bud there we go we're good to go no I even looked at it that way back in the beginning of the program when we were getting alright 14001 was literally ground up it looked like long cut tobacco people were bitching people were complaining up you're pulverizing our product yeah it sucked it really did at the beginning however as I pointed out to many people you know what it kind of actually saved a couple of steps yeah pulling the butt out and breaking it up or having to grind it up and go through it and then do what you had to do you literally were able to get the bottle at the time open it pour out some some weed because you knew it was already ground it was already done for you you just poured poured out what she needed what she wanted and you smoked so yes there was a downside but actually you know depending upon how would you want it to look at it I like this one it's it's it's a nice body feel this whole time I've been talking I've been I've been kind of feeling it and it's not a heavy body feel not a heavy heady not by any means again you see no expansion in the chest whatsoever I mean I haven't once been like I like this one good job Cara leaf I mean again Tahoe og that anything push anything Tahoe og sweet anything blueberry is phenomenal put the two of them together it's like you know it's a match made in heaven but again you could see Barnes perfectly I mean perfectly even so keep up that job there Curly's good job on the Rhonda the rolling and packing not that's why I've showed you this while I've been smoking it literally this thing has not canoed once you can see how perfectly even they burn all the way around yeah I mean you can't get much more even on a joint and I like to there's our pact all the way down I've had a couple of times where it's what I've taken if they're play one out you could literally hold it up like this to the light and you can see a little little gap throw out of coffee so while as I said the ones from Fairplay I have noticed that issue I don't know I'm not sure what it is I don't know if it specifically the type of paper they use or the system they use for packing or what combination of everything I've had stuff through that yeah I don't really I don't understand what it is but it's the Thera plant ones that I've had the issue with I mean I would I've not had it with a bigger relief product not had it with a pretty role from pure leaf at all yeah I like this one absolutely yeah give it a try people see what you think the key release lapis T 23 H 38:41 or just go on in and ask for some 500 gene cross with blueberry 3 rolls I do like that too it's nice and easy to open their product oh sure now that I say that Wow really we'll just have to cut that little part make that my next my next snippet [ __ ] up video look how easy it opens oh the feed stalling yes honestly out of the two I would recommend Carolee for pre-rolls for sure how's the streams working by the way overall like how are things looking over there at Facebook land I know said you were just saying you were having an issue but I don't know if that's on my stream or if that was on your your your end cuz I actually tried moving my my router a little bit to try and help out the issue that I you know I've had before nice body on this one nice body feel for sure fresh coffee cheers all I'll tell you now that my test part is done I want to do it down I have done new dads today I've done nothing but smoke thanks for a lifetime ha what do you mean you zap it what what's happening thanks for the share John I need to go grab a tool I'll be right back hey need to grab a tool what's happening job [Laughter] you told her like that dogs are like that you know as soon as you pet him you move your hand away they want some more but I gotta love him absolutely I mean at one point I had as many dogs as I had people living here at the compound jabs smoke them have you got him what's up Cece how are you is my first dabba today tested a nice pre-roll today from Qi relief so after that test was done I was like I need a dad oh I've always said that I foresaw things going legal in this state about mid of 2018 and I have been sitting back and I've been watching things and I've been seeing how things have been going since you know I got was out of being involved in trying to help move the process along as it were when I was normal in the executive director and yeah it's been slowly going pretty much the way I foresaw it and still do say I think middle of yeah middle of 2018 we're gonna we're gonna get this big announcement let's see if I'm right let's see if I've been right all along I don't know actually hey Cortana is it supposed to snow today gotta love it yeah no it's not snowing here I mean it's gray but it was at about 7:30 quarter to 8:00 this morning that was like 14 degrees out here is it supposed to snow today trying to use the cortana built into my laptop and I don't know I think she caught a contact [Laughter] oh yeah I would imagine for a cat like that it would it wouldn't work out too well it's kind of like our pugs because they're so small and low to the ground we have to pre shovel a path I bet we get cabin fever you can imagine how the animals get but we actually have to shovel a path a little spot or like they'll just go out and they'll kind of trample down an area that's the talks can go because you know I mean they're so low to the ground that this much snow has as their little thing little parts just try to drag it through it so that's not cool [Laughter] well it's funny because the oldest pug likes them he'll lay there and he eats the snow but after a few bites and he's laying in it all of a suddenly he starts shivering so we have to bring him back inside yet every time he goes outside the snow it's the same process all over and over again it's like there's a little treat until it makes them cold we've actually seen we were pretty sure if he kind of got a brain for his once he was eating and then he almost suddenly just stopped and he like kind of stiffened of course still the wife picks him up and she brings them inside but yeah it really seemed like yeah it really seemed like that's what happened well yeah most cats are like that I really don't think I've ever met a cat you know unless it was an outdoor cat you know like feral ones that just have had no choice you know thanks for the light there David thanks for the light there Alan we barely have I mean we have some coverage from snow but there's still a ton of grass speed coming through it it's still early in the winter no I'm looking forward to going like a lot of snow it could be if it was something that you had connected to the TV it could be in the plug or it couldn't be the cord itself that you were using the cable that's honestly the first place I would check is before you go to the hardware side as simple as the easiest the cheapest thing is the cable the connection there you go [Laughter] I still have all of our equipment all the stuffs that apocalypse highway use plus all the equipment that I had before that stuff that I've picked up after that I mean it's all packed up but I still got all this stuff well I mean everybody knew it but three quarters of the equipment actually over three quarters of new equipment that apocalypse I we used was all mine nice thank you and it was a fun time that's for sure again how can you not have fun if you don't doing stuff like that you shouldn't be doing it sure but that's why I don't associate myself around the wrong people to just keep those types of individuals and arms legs because there's gonna be that type of person in life in general it's just gonna happen so people know arm's length learn to work around them and do what you got to do it's so much easier Hey again that's a common thing no one wants to deal with it which you know you shouldn't have to deal with it in a way but in a way it's just it's part and parcel of life I mean [ __ ] like I even say you know my bad times and my bad parts made up and comprised of what I am today so exactly I have tried coffee in a lot of places [Laughter] some of the machines didn't look so hot no but they all it was coffee it was good and its own away I've had some of the ones like I described to you you know what coffee is strong enough to sit up and bark you really need to dial it back you can get the same effects from coffee using less when you make it and you won't get oh sure sure yeah yeah people did saying something that people don't realize is you don't have to use a ton of it to get the same thing out of it and to be able to actually enjoy the flavor enjoy it for what it is which you know you've said you're starting to so mm-hmm it really is now I've been told you that when I first really started drinking in black I was I was really surprised at how flavorful you know each brand each type is and how each one is very unique exactly exactly I mean you know you put in even one spoonful of sugar or just enough creamer or milk or especially some of the flavored ones and yeah yes yes for sure for sure you know there's another thing that when I quit drinking and I quit smoking cigarettes I've really noticed like the flavors coming back so much over the over that you know first a period of time when I had quit now it's just like oh this it literally is yeah like you know a whole whole new world I mean I was tasting stuff before of course but very muted very subtle ah well I stopped drinking in 2010 I quit smoking cigarettes a year to the day in 2011 it is it is absolutely but I'll be quite honest with you what I did was I had my last cigarette at night before I went to bed which you know I always did it was just a ritual you know a nightly ritual thank you have that cigarette before I went to bed got a really good night's sleep now normally you can ask anybody because I'm normally like you know good night Facebook land at 3 in the morning or 3:30 in the morning and hello hello good morning Facebook land maybe forward a half to five five and a half hours later well that particular night I actually slept like you know 8 9 10 hours so when I woke up the next morning I already had that time span of not having the cigarettes not putting nicotine in my system nobody really thinks about it or looks at it that way but I already had that time oh sure absolutely but I already had that time for the frame of not having nicotine in my system so when I woke up I didn't have my cigarette in the morning like I would have normally done I went to cannabis I went to coffee yes my intake of cannabis and my intake of coffee both rose during that time absolutely it's to be expected however they both plateaued and then came down to where I'm at now so it literally was like my own little celebrational thing that I quit the cigarettes a year to the day that I first quit drinking now as everybody knows because I've always been very honest and open about it I mean I made my promise to my family and all my friends when I quit drinking and when I did have my wife slip and fall and take the sip out of the bottle that little over a year ago now I went here on Facebook and I was told people about it and showed the bottle but I also showed the video of me pouring that bottle out because that sip I took after all that time frame did one thing it instilled that I will never go back to alcohol because it tasted so [ __ ] bad the people who were there who saw me pop that bottle up they themselves swore and said the look on my face and that like literally I almost turned a little green you know and mind you this was the stuff that was like you know my lifeblood when I drank everybody knows I was a jack daniel\u00b4s drinker I took the swig I put the bottle down and I spit out a little bit of what was in my mouth and they they even said like the words that came out of my mouth was oh my god that so [ __ ] bad I went from that to actually being more upset at myself for taking that set then I was over the whole situation that caused me to slip and fall and and feel I needed to go back to a bottle so I literally I know I will I'm done with with alcohol I mean it really was like coffee ginger ale absolutely because it's actually good for my my stomach it's good for my condition power aids people though you know water don't drink too much water as people also know but actually not a lot know about that you're supposed to drink X amount of water well you're supposed to drink so much water every day however if you go past and above that amount and you drink it over that water can actually turn to poison in the body and it can make you ill so well yeah I mean I we all grew up hearing you know you're supposed to drink six to eight ounce six to eight eight ounce glasses a day then that was raised so it was like eight or ten up ten glasses a day it's good to drink water absolutely you know especially depending upon the time of the year when our when our systems and our bodies are processing more fluids of course again we all know this but yeah it really is you know if you drink too much of it it can become a poison and it could make you sick so it's always good to have water when you medicate simply because raises your body temperature yeah I never really paid attention to how much I drink in a day I mean I've got some glass like this but let's see hold on let me see if I could find what they say all right they say depends on your size and weight also on your activity level and where you live all the stuffs good for Preston now most of it is good for pressing I should say the best ones I've seen pressed where AGL flour to be quite honest excuse me it's not to say that all of them don't have their their own good to come out of you know a nice squish but yeah AGL's always seem to work out the best the moonshine haze which is a sativa that was the Luna Dean from CPS I like that Neville Neville's rack I believe it is yeah Neville's Red Cross with amnesia haze that was a real nice one if you have not tried that I highly highly recommend to go grab it and let's see a nice indie call indicate that I've done recently which was the indie called W that the butter their new version of a butter which to me was more like a crumble than it was a butter but that's what they called it it was the Mendel breath Oh gkv cross with Mendel montage hybrid is a mixture you have your sativas you have your indicas well somebody took these two and they put them together and in most cases it's a nice match made in heaven you come up with hybrid now again a lot of people don't realize that if you cross certain strains if you cross the wrong strains a certain type of indica with an indica or you know when you smoke them together when you do them together like that it can actually counteract and drop out the effects versus making it a bigger one yes and no on it that really depends upon you is the individual some people that have certain ailments literally their body's process the cannabis gonna remember our body has naturally a natural system in it it's called the indicative system they've only been researching and finding out more and more about this over the last few years this is why cannabis and concentrates worked so well with us and certain ones work better than others because it's working with our natural body it's working with our natural flow it's it's literally you know latching on to things that are already in there that says oh hey I know what you are and I know what what we don't know where you go what we're supposed to do so let's do this together and it's not ignorant it really isn't you know you've learned right along with the rest of us this is one of the things I have said to everyone you know I I started out the same way process of elimination like really I mean knowing what type of just for an example what's going on Charles how are you but this is just for an example if you knew what type of pharmaceutical worked for you for certain ailments and you want to get off of that pharmaceutical using a cannabis based product you can use almost well these these did this or this to my system cannabis is not going to work exactly the same way which is one of the reasons why I tell people try things to see how it works for you however a lot of people do find that by going over and using either a flower or even using a combination of flower concentrates with some edibles that their systems react obviously a much more the positive side then taking those pills than staying on all the other other stuff which has all these other side effects which is one again something I've always brought up and I even used to say it to my own doctor was this one pill could give me five different side effects now you want to give me a second pill that has side effects of its own to try and counteract these side effects to fix the original ailments well now I've got all these say ten things oh absolutely now I've got these ten things going on in my system fighting each other no wonder why you have people absolutely no wonder why you have some people that walk around and feel like they're zombies they literally are because their body just it knows what to do as far as going through the motions in a day but but we've all I've seen individuals who they can't function they really can't you know it's like the memory knows to get up and to walk into ok but I have to go to work and I have to do this or that or the other thing but outside of that they don't have a life and there is no quality there again once you have come over to cannabis once you've come over to cannabis based stuff exactly my wife and I watched a an old friend of ours a woman that seems to work with just become this thing that was your early driven by pills she would go from one doctor to another to another to another until she found the doctor who would do what she wanted which was give her more pills at one point at the end we saw some of the stuff that she was taking we did a little bit of research on him and it was like you know things that they were that normally would be given to like terminally ill patients this woman was a keyboard operator yes absolutely she was a keyboard operator they all worked in an office my wife was the manager so she sat back and saw all these people in front of her this woman would have her fingers on the keyboard and would be nodding out at her desk like if you didn't know better you'd think this lady was was doing heroin but no she was she was just so rapt from all the pills that she was on and for some reason she enjoyed it yeah I kind of shivered shudder and shiver at that because again there's uh there's no there's no life there there's nothing it's it's sad is what it is you know that all these people are allowed to just hand out pills as they see fit you know it's it's amazing to me if I were to go to a doctor today I were to go to a doctor today and complain and just spread out some symptoms by the time I walked out of that offf that office I'd had samples I'd had things and I have a prescription to go get stuff and I can go get that stuff at one of God knows how many pharmacies there are in his town you'd yet you know they've oh absolutely you know because how many how many dispensaries do we have in the state for how many patients come on there's no comparison there yeah I'll stick to my dad's I'll stick to my medicals I'll stick to my flour oh yes oh yes now one thing I do like you know going back on the conversation for a minute cigarettes I and seeing the commercials and seeing how honestly you know over the last few years opening for a few years so many years that people have really smart dumb and really have been dropping them by the droves so it would be phenomenal to see cigarette use completely wiped out in my lifetime now and to the ones who have tried to say well you've given up one drug just to go to another this isn't a drug I know the state of Connecticut called and tried to call this a pharmaceutical bottle by which they can people could call it a drug but very nice so what's on everyone's agenda today and what's happening I gotta work nothing wrong with that working there's a good thing um I may come on for a while tomorrow morning I mean you know it's Saturday at all I won't be doing a test tomorrow but yeah I'll probably come on tomorrow morning I know I know like I told you it really was dependent upon if my plants came through and the people did actually show up here at the compound so I do appreciate the offer nice that's a nice job for hustling thank you my own little piece of heaven right here on earth oh that's good that's good hey any place you can have job security at is definitely a plus that's for sure I have tried that actually wait a minute I think that might even be one of the ones that's still in the bag of stuff I have four upcoming tasks but I'm pretty sure I've tried it before I mean yes yes I would recommend it all for adding on new conditions I know that really it really is a whole process that to go through in order to add things on they have made it a little easier believe it or not they have made it a little easier than in the beginning when the program first started and we literally had you know you could count the conditions on your hands and trying to suggester or get things put in at that time it was it was impossible but they have made it a little easier and you know I'm sorry they make you guys wait you know when certain things seem to get on there quicker than others and don't understand it but it's a process unfortunately it's just that it's state of Connecticut that's just the way they are you know they can you can't even say that they run things by the numbers because they kind of go as they go along but correct crap that's that's what I'm saying it's a whole this whole process it's not just one simple thing of submitting and then having people vote and approve it and then say hooray it's there now you can say it it is [ __ ] absolutely unfortunately that's not the way it works again in this state it's literally it's submitted it's voted okay it goes it goes to this committee who looks and has to break down now you know the whole thing of what it is why is it that this could benefit more so from this versus this and they yeah I don't know why but again it's really just the way that they look at it nice nice well I got anything cuz she really can't go wrong platinum I've had platinum cookies I actually will is some of the shatter that I have which is freaking sweet so hell yeah nice choice I'm gonna jab up nice start close it up shot for today got places to go people to do smoking me forgot him well I am gonna be going up again gotta go

there this is ally hi times concentrate correspondence over the last few years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "LWgvhmustak": "[Music] p2p [Music] then [Music] what's good yoshi boy p2 peeps uh the hair is looking real bummy we don't get that fixed up though anyway real reason why y'all are here today we're going to be checking out some cold cure premium tier 1 hash rosin from punch extracts this is the white tahoe cookies review here is you know just the product itself we got right here percentage-wise we're going with uh 80 chc for those who are curious i don't really see too many uh other um you know things on the ten or ten the percentages but you know here's what we're working with and of course you know i will always include them lovely lovely close-ups and yeah so normally when we're you know dabbing out here i try to get different angles and things like that but we don't really have the other camera and the attachments i have for this camera are kind of on the wonky side today so you know that's just that's just how it goes but today we're going to be dabbing out of two things i got the little ursa rig and for those yes i know it's a dirty banger i just took a whole gram dab out of that last time around um and i don't feel i ain't gonna lie i don't feel like cleaning it just yet i want to take at least like a few more dabs out of it before i clean it because it's literally only seen one or two dabs so you know what i'm saying oh yeah and the we got the b4 with the sit cup for our other hit there but yeah i'm just going to go ahead and get this thing started up heat up this dab and yeah let's go we'll take our first rib i think that should be good there on the heat here we go for our first dab nice little slab like this hope that focuses in all right i think it's hot enough at least it's been i don't really dab too uh hot too often so cheers guys we got nice flavor off that but of course that is not that hot we're gonna fix that so yeah still getting used to the new banger um it's got an opaque bottom so i can't really see when it gets red oh yeah that's nice see we got most of the flavor in that first um rip the flavor here is definitely a little bit more toasted of course that's all that's on me but we're gonna get a really really deep deep flavor off the v4 so all right so i think yep that's all of it we got all of it out of that so okay so of course is cold here um so it's a lot smoother and of course it kind of has that you know really really cool uh taste to it because of that cold cure of course you know i'm just repeating myself now but yeah it's probably one of the smoothest things i've ever dabbed smoked whatever like even really really good indoor doesn't really get this smooth honestly and i've had a lot of good stuff before so yeah i think cold cure is definitely the wave if you're looking for what is the best you know most smooth most potent kind of uh concentrate to smoke or at least thc thing to smoke you're looking at it right here it's definitely some cold cure live frozen and uh yeah i'm not i'm not gonna say you know all other life rosin is bad or other rosin is all bad and all this stuff you know only smoke cold cure i'm definitely not like that uh you know smoke what you like and continue to smoke what you like type things but just saying you know for those who you know have this is expensive i will say that guys so if you don't this is not you're not gonna find this for anything less than like maybe 80 uh 80 if you're lucky honestly because this is normally like 90 dollars a gram so um you know what i mean it's definitely not really for the bargain shopper uh so you know only i would say only buy this if it's a special occasion or you know you can afford it or if this is just within your means type thing or uh you know i'm saying like for example you only smoke one gram and you'd like it to be the best gram you can get then you know you can go look for some cold cure live rosin you know i'd highly suggest but other than that you know what i'm saying this is definitely something that uh if you're looking to save money this is not really for you but it is really really good that flavor is super super deep like i was saying before um i don't think i touched on too many of those notes so let's touch on them a little bit shall we what else first you know it's a little sweet um not too too much though we got a lot of that gassy kind of taste there and yeah we should be able to get a little bit more of that figure profile down now that i've got that hit packed up um but yeah this is maybe my third live rosin premium or premium whatever it is uh their whole thing is premium live rosin or tier one sorry live rosin so that's the whole thing they like to say for it but i think it is really good it is really really really [ __ ] good all three of the grams i've had i think are definitely worth the price although i wouldn't really buy them weekly type thing you know i'm saying i bought them for review purposes i don't know when i'd buy another one maybe to celebrate something but uh we'll see yeah i'm gonna get this hit cooked up so i hope you guys can join me this once again out of the divine tribe v4 um and i got a little stick up attachment on there and we will be doing a video on the v4 soon i know i promised that a really long time ago and i've been really slacking on it but that video will be coming yeah opponency wise guys this is great even after just one dab i'm toasted this might even be the last dab of the video guys so i hope you guys can join me and if you've been watching up to this point please don't forget to leave that like drop a comment and subscribe you know help the homie out cheers everybody oh wow you guys like a garlicky taste to [Music] it not too garlicky though yeah let's show some cookies we got that the nice signature cookies taste in there yeah i'm pretty sure everyone knows what some good cookies taste like um strain wise i'm just cleaning this out a little bit but try to think of any other notes i can think of well you know you got y'all got me here um and honestly i can't really think of anything else right now to say because it's hitting me tough guys this thing rips once again if you're looking for something really really really smooth i would and you haven't tried cold cured live rosin not resin rosin then you should definitely give this a go bruh once again this is the punch extracts white tahoe cookies cold cured batter you know second coal gear we've had here on the channel and yeah cold here and at least in the rosin world this is definitely the future of you know everything i hope one day this becomes the standard and we get these for like you know 30 25 40 you know whatever whatever the price may be just lower than 90 that'd be great in the future um but for now you know i guess i i i guess it's worth the price you know uh i haven't had too many super expensive grams you know i've only i've only had uh you know i concentrate grams over like eighty dollars like on five occasions now so i wouldn't really be able to call myself a an expert in that kind of field where flower is concerned that i think i'm a little bit better off in knowing uh in terms of those kind of price points but this one yeah so if you guys know any other better live rosin than this you guys like you got to let me know so i can give that a go otherwise though this is super super satisfying loving the high it is i believe this is a indica dominant hybrid um so you know that's kind of my alley i kind of normally buy things like that and i kind of like being slumped like that kind of relaxed feel super kit laid back type thing i'm getting that here but i'm also feeling a little social i ain't gonna lie you know maybe it's a little a little bit of the tiny little bit of sativa that lies within the cookies you know cookies don't really have too much sativa in them but you know what i'm saying like they do kind of make you a little talkative sometimes like i mean maybe that's just me but hey um that's all i got for today's video guys i'm super baked so i probably won't get another rip in just yet you know what i'm saying i got a little i got some other things to do today so you know you guys can though catch a bunch of rips on stream if you want and i'll be streaming on youtube tuesdays fridays and then on the weekends it's just kind of whatever whenever saturday sunday whenever like that but yeah tune in for those we do twitch streams as well throughout the week you

girl sideways kind of soon what that's gonna look like but I wanted to shake Isis branch structure down here I trimmed it up a little bit it's a little easier to see in there it's looking pretty good

discussion today i'm going to go over the different types of diamonds and concentrates that i use hopefully this will help you all decide what types you want to use so without further ado we've done it before but i have a lot more selection now let's get started i want to start i'm going to start with i guess the least potent of the bunch and this is going to be girl scout cake live resin full spectrum hash rosin okay let's take a look you see the texture inside you see what it looks like it's not a diamond okay it's a batter i think they call it live rosin actually is what they call this live rosin tasty but not quite as potent as some of the other things i have on the table here the next thing we're going to talk about are the private diamonds that i contract for i get them in a couple of different fashions this is the least expensive i'm able to get and these are what you would call generic diamonds okay and these are i believe i get these uh in indica and then i do a particular uh move if it's a particular purchase or whatever you want to call it what i do is i have 10 or 20 grams of diamonds made for me by a grower i know in 5 gram increments so that's why i'm able to get these rocks of diamonds these are incredibly tasty and incredibly potent when i make a jimmy joint when i use and i talk about putting in my diamonds it's the dry diamonds these have been dried sifted if that if you will to be a little bit more uh i'll pick one up and show you let's take a look at it here this is not going to be your traditional diamond if you can see what that looks like we're going to now look at more traditional commercially available concentrate in diamonds again those are privately contracted by me let's start with raw garden road garden is some of the tastiest in the market and this is live resin hybrid and it's got a 72.9 excuse me a 81.101 thc factor in it let's open this puppy up and take a look at the quality of the diamonds of the live resin now live resin let's understand what it is and why i get it i get it because it's potent okay i'm looking for potency and flavor i get it because it's got both look at that and that is fresh so this is by raw garden raw garden is a very respected brand of concentrates raw garden then we're going to look at socal dabbers orange cookies a sativa open the seal open this bad boy up and take a look and again you're going to see color and texture and you can't smell it with me color texture and odor are going to change dramatically with each selection you can see this one now is light blonde everything's a little bit different and it's engineered that way engineered that way the royal guard was a hybrid as a matter of fact the socal divers is a sativa okay let's keep rolling excellence you've seen me do a lot of dabs with excellence this particular one is 80 thc this is indica cherry gelato black label diamonds you've seen me use this before but again we're going to look at it and we're going to see that inside the way it's put together is totally different see the little rocks the little pebbles that's true diamonds okay true diamonds as compared to a uh what they call a rosin over here live resin i'm sorry and then the previous one we looked at was full spectrum hash rosin now we're getting into the diamonds the real the real deal okay that are stronger this is called connected cannabis and these are batters and again this is on recommendation i'm a diamond guy but this was recommended highly to me take a close look thc 88 thc so as i said each one of these products is going to have a totally different taste flavor and look this almost looks like peanut butter not diamonds okay this is not a diamond but it's a heavy heavy strong concentrate live batter forbidden gushers is the strain name now we're going to go into alien labs alien labs zookeys one one gram live batter again 76 this is cannabis resin essentially live batter is what they call it but i want you to be able to see the difference between all these different things you know each one of these has a unique profile does something different for you each one has a different purpose actually another one that's kind of creamy looking looks like caramel if you will now the key with these and the reason why i'm weaving batters rosins with my diamonds is because everything obviously goes to the same place and i wanted to have an assortment of flavors terpenes if you will so you know i make my own cartridges i fill my own what do i fill them with well i contract for applejack cartridges applejack is the flavor the strain i use is a general indica but i like the apple jack flavor and then i have a large assortment of trinity gold now trinity gold is a brand of concentrate of distiller this is from humboldt solutions you can see the clarity actually of this one interesting you can see a difference just in distillate see that that interesting the color differentiation between the two each one does a different thing they're all here for a different reason the key with maintaining concentrated assortments the way i do having them out and using them is not just for the dab of the day a lot of this goes into my joints i tend to crumble a lot of different things into my jimmies i do use primarily my dry diamonds my dry sift diamonds to crumble in jimmy's but i also like the taste of crumbling in and layering a strip of the rosin or even crumbling in fresh diamonds i hope you enjoyed this discussion about concentrates from diamonds to batter to rosin to distill it we've covered a lot hope it was enjoyable to you thank you so much for listening this has been the real senior stoner cheers", "-EywE3C8TQo": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com back with justin cures for part two of the buddies brand west coast we tour review series for this episode we've got the three bears og cannabis derived terpenes distillate cartridge i've heard it's really good the roommate sells it at mother nature's remedy where we got it it's really delicious so 91.98 on the total cannabinoids and again since i'm an employee of buddy's brand justin here is going to be the official reviewer on behalf of respect my region for this case so thc at 88.5 this is a high potency product brother this is high potency 88.5 yeah that's crazy 91.98 basically 92 cannabinoids i mean terpenes listed on the back coming in hot 3.3 yep uh we got the top three are beta-mercene beta-caryophyllene and beta uh osamine i believe that's how you say it osamine muscle i don't know whatever 0.26 on that one point three seven on the karyophylline and 1.62 on the mercy which makes total sense uh since it's an og three bears og is the string uh i have smoked a different i'm sorry i vaped a different batch of this probably about a month or so ago um and it was around 88 on the total award-winning so we're gonna check it out cannabis single source distillate are you ready yeah i feel like uh you know i'm not a big you know pen smoker but i have definitely tried lots lots just about every brand because it's either been handed to me you saw or give it to me or exactly live residentially like even back in the day when it goes to you know where you don't even want to talk about those times medical days yeah medical you never knew before testing and all that um so but right away i look at the color and i'm like yo this is poe because that color just looks it's so nice very beautiful shade of gold that's for sure so you can just look at the color i'm like this is going to get me uh probably pretty stoned this is good i feel like it's going to be harsh though you think so yeah but what i do want to know though is what's what's the cross on this three bears oh gee though that's what's also kind of missing is because that would usually tell you right the genetics information we want to know i think as consumers we all want to know what g's can vary what what is the original strain right there's there's ogs that are like they come out purple there's og's that are very you know stoney there's you know it ranges it says ingredients distilled kettle oil and canna terps that's it simple as that that's it inhale until desired effect is achieved i always recommend four to six seconds system is safe if you're experienced obviously you know i'll do it around the middle minimum i always also like to say if you're less you know experienced go a little shorter we're talking high potency some good clouds right there shout out to buddy's brand battery okay not harsh at all i was actually expecting to be very harsh wasn't harsh do you get the terps i mean yeah that's like smoking a bowl of lg right there wow yeah that's really nice wow almost almost could trick somebody like if you didn't show me the box and said this was live resin i i could have got dude really could have did me are you just let me try this are you saying yes yeah are you are you thinking yeah no i'm saying no i'm saying that i like i said you might have dude me no i'm not saying you would but i'm saying because it is just it's not harsh and it has very good the terps are like there you can tell it's og but um it does have that it does have that limonene and it does have that carryoffaling not my main i guess it does that but then once once i'm like sitting with it i can tell it's this because the vapor is just different it's different than libraries it doesn't have that sweet or you know like live resin has a rounded hit to the end of it versus something sharper yeah just sharper um that's what i need to do too i always do the hit uh out the nose to really get the turf beam profile second hit here this is your score out of 10 hit opportunity so we review for respect our reason review you know presentation appeal color taste potency wow more information would you recommend your experience i'm definitely stunned i'm definitely stoned and man that knows would you recommend i would to somebody who's a big distillate fan yeah that is that this usually ranges from between 37 and i'll keep you 42 that'll keep you lit at disneyland i'm telling you that much yeah this [ __ ] is potent let me hit this up later i feel a head change i feel it behind my eyes like making my eyes lower i feel on the second hit i was like i'm like going back to what i said i'm like no you couldn't do me you can't do me on it like getting it the second time i'm like yeah you can tell that's some really fire disney what are you thinking really exciting really clean for a distillery pen i'm like man that's i'm surprised uh more people aren't talking about uh i want to ask you that like is you know do those are they flat whoever has them for the club oh really wow okay okay people i just i guess i way more than that yeah and and um certainly sometimes i even get like like what you would call like sweats yeah and i'm not so i think this is just really really good distillate you're right yeah you said it a couple times really really good oh hi i can tell i can tell if i were there's no mirror in front of me but my eyes are red for sure for sure right now um let's let me see from color to to overall to the packaging you know once again hey let me know what the three bears og crosses but man i i'd suggest that over anything when it comes to just a pencil that's uh i don't know how else to give it anything but um nine club 9.5 9.5 a little bit more information could help i can't remember well i appreciate you sharing that review my man you know i personally have reviewed so many of these buddies discipline cards i've tried them i've smoked got 100 100 of them at least and i think as of recently you know whether it's the extraction or the source material i think you know we're just seeing a lot more consistency um but yeah you know adding the strain the genetics and some of that information will be a key addition and let me let me say that that this is very honest for me because this is i've tried i mean i could just name like a bunch and gone to so many events where they're letting you try this try this try this trying whatever flavor they're coming out with and again and again it's like a lot of coffee in the sweats you know a lot of harsh products a lot of harsh product exactly and i believe that's where it comes down to you know single source over multi-source i guess right i don't want to see anything and that's what really sets this apart this product apart because you know it's three bears og when you're smoking it it's like i said tasting a bowl of og kush so hats off to that because i appreciate that that's that's really good for some distilling

cartridges or wax in quite some time now and i've seen that they had white tahoe cookies and for those of you who don't know why tahoe cookies has been on the top five strains of uh the potent strains of all time and i've had this in flower form before but never have i had it in concentrate form so when i seen the opportunity to get it well here's the back story it was actually not on display and they said they didn't have any left and i was going to get some other [ __ ] i think it was like sour sour tangy mango or some [ __ ] and then when she was checking in the fridge apparently they still had some white tahoe cookies so i lucked out [ __ ] happy for that and we're going to be hitting it out of the smoke ski and i'll be playing a video it probably is playing already but a video of me opening the package because it is open but you get to see what it is it's running at about 72.93 thc and uh yeah manufactured date october 5th expiration date october 5th next year or this year so it's definitely uh still pretty much new three months or so um and yeah we're gonna take some fat hits uh i will be getting a melt shot of of the ursa you know what i'm saying so you guys can uh have some eye candy i guess for this video because there will be milkage or not milkage uh meltage melted yet so you've already seen it we're gonna be taking a decent sized dab for the homies that's a big one and we're gonna just hit out the smoke ski so with the smoke ski turn it on five times double click you guys know my method i usually let it chill for the whole um session and just to heat up and then the next one i put that in so but yeah like i said i haven't had urza in a while and right off the bat smelling it it smells really really sweet very earthy very uh i don't know how to put my the name on it to it or like the scent to it but it smells i would say a floral but a candiness towards the end which is weird because i thought white tahoe cookies didn't have any fruity smells but that smells fire i don't know definitely some fruity notes in there but some earthy notes as well so turn that off run that and like i said i'm gonna do some melt shots for you yup oh that smells hell of fire you carve that up time to hit it cheers guys so oh there's still a puddle in there that means you can keep going right off the bat when i'm tasting it very um herbaly taste but not bad you get the sweetness that fruity notes towards the end but a very uh urban taste from the initial hit but not bad i've tasted this taste in most live residents but this one's a bit stronger than usual but still good like a vegetable herby taste you know i'm talking about are we chilling i've been loving this thing it may not give the fattest hits but [ __ ] i'll be getting [ __ ] stoned there's still hell on there hello oh you could really milk this thing there's a learning curve with this there's definitely a huge learning curve but once you know how to use this bad boy like i don't know there's something about it there's something about it where i just keep wanting to [ __ ] use it because it's so dope you know and i've been a guy that was like you know i'm not a e-rig person but [ __ ] man i'm sorry to say i switched over but i do like wax pens as well this doesn't last as long as i would like it to so uh having my gobi on me is still [ __ ] the way you know i'm saying so [Music] cheers [Music] [ __ ] yeah they're still hella no there's no always i was gonna clean it but i'll take one more hit for the people you know it's not every day you get white tahoe cookies in a concentrate form so let's get it let's get it not a big one not as big as that first one but we're gonna get it here definitely something i would buy again uh i've been a fan of white tahoe cookies ever since i tried the flower and also since i've seen it on the list it made me want to get it even more than i've already wanted to you know and it was 27 out the door uh finos so it's definitely not bad and let's just milk that [ __ ] [ __ ] up [Music] cheers guys okay all right the last hit because i know there's still some we're gonna let that show but i spoke about this before how these hits may not be as fast as the wax pens but it's all about what you're accustomed to you build up a tolerance to what device you use i'm used to the go b i'm used to the utility five i'm not used to this so i'm coughing the hits may not look as fat as you would see from the go beer from the other wax pen uh utilian but like i'm telling you i still get high and i feel like i cough more i don't [Music] know cheers guys all right damn i definitely feel it it's because i [ __ ] was taking these long ass hits making me no oxygen in my brain i think i'm lightheaded because of that mostly but i'm definitely feeling the high acetylene oh [ __ ] but yeah it's just easy as that cleaning it oh wow guys that is it for the urza hopefully you did enjoy the video it is definitely a must cop i've always been a fan of urza's products you know i've never had a bad urza like gram of wax or cartridge other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video peace out guys [Music]", "jg_cnsjEEiA": "suitable for the

absolutely gasps no cab tastes legit like og and we're about to take off fat-ass dad obviously you can tell this in a program I've already dabbed it but I got a ticket out with you guys and just give you some feedback on it no cap I haven't had it I've been dabbed it in the wild because I do have quite a few grams to dab it's actually why I like getting multiple grams because I'll be on one I'm a one or two of them so much first I want you guys to take a look at it real quick look at this it's it's literally diamonds the sauce there was sauce but it dried up and it just made these diamonds even bigger bro I said you're not this is all oh [ __ ] this is all one fad like it's just a clump of diamond throw no cap look at those guys can you tell look just straight diamonds look at this edge right oh [ __ ] almost knocked it off fat little diamond dad let's get before this quick dad I want you guys to know each member of the Royal Court and the West Coast cure are two of my favorite brands and say that can life compared to each other and I've tried venom og from 7-10 and it's [ __ ] absolutely out of this world so I have to get the venom og from West Coast cure this is what it's all about this is our dad guys Cheers good morning first half in the mornings and I actually woke up pretty damn late today it's already [ __ ] past 12:00 first dev god I can barely open my eyes just fat eyes dad today don't you guys can see the first doubt of the day was full of [ __ ] diamonds still recovering that's a though Wow you were oh gee flavor light no captions that [ __ ] was very nice and poet like it was smooth obviously I was coughing I always caught very tasty and smooth I mean it that [ __ ] was I really liked it like the og cush likeness of it bro like it was it was very nice yeah I keep it real I'll keep it a buck this I'm intent batter was just a tea we didn't want to poet and stronger bro but this was the sauce / diamond counterpart of it I personally do think that batters take a lot better than diamonds and sugars do like when it comes to potency and like flavor I think they're a lot juicier and stronger and batters than they are in like sugars or diamonds best is my opinion because I've also had some West Coast gear batter and it does it different it does have a more of an impactful taste you know what I'm saying you think do you think that batter has more flavor than sugar or diamonds do I personally do for all this was a fantastic strain you can never go wrong with some og special event emoji you ever see it out on the market go for it make sure it's a good friend if I did you see it from West Coast pear or 710 you better get that [ __ ] it some gas very tiny very be very potent it was strong or smooth and I I feel very high like I feel the body high but for some reason I feel like an indica like a hybrid have my head high - but I feel great like it isn't push so you know can never go wrong with mineralogy any og so if you see it out there

published result videos up for my last round this in the next couple weeks I've just been not making videos so haven't really been doing the whole YouTube thing saying the last few weeks just busy with that harvest so final harvest result videos for the forum cookies grow bananas and blueberry grow the romulan grow and the green crack each link a will be up soon it's be patient I'll get those up but anyway today is day one of my 8 thousand watt multi strand forum I am very excited about this garden not only because the plants are extremely as beautiful and healthiest plants can possibly be but because I will be introducing some of the strains that well they're gonna be making their debut in my videos in this garden so you guys will get to see some some new genetics that you haven't seen me grow before let's just go over this room briefly it is eight thousand watt garden all eight thousand watt bulbs Ivor deluxe HBS stop asking me if they're metal halide they're HPS adjust the white balance so things look like they're natural light instead of you know HP s3 3 K or 3200 so yeah these are HPS anyway a triple Magnum triple XL Oh Cho hoods it's got wall mount fans offsetting wall mount fans around the garden have an intake down there fresh rice coming in down there moving across the plants and then out up here I have the glass out of these hoods so they're just bearable I saw the ducting connected but there's no air flowing between the lights all my plants are in ten gallon pots with pure cocoa they were cut as clones put into the cloning machine when they came out of the cloning machine they were planted into 1 gallon pots with ocean forests Fox from ocean force which people say is a pretty hot soil and you shouldn't use for seedlings or clones but I always use it just straight and my plants handle it just fine so I think as long as your mother plants used to having a lot of nutrients then the clones that come off of it all maybe that's the case because I've gotten clones from other people and put it into ocean forest and they really struggle like they got bad nutrient burn but mine don't because I think they're used to it that's just my theory anyway tomato cages on all the plants there's 44 plants 4 rows of the 11 and they've been benching for right about three weeks in the ten gallon pots they were pre vegging in the lung gallon pots for you know maybe five weeks just under T fives not a lot of lighting just enough to keep them alive and let them kind of start develop good systems they've been topped multiple times and I intended to flip several days ago but didn't get around to taking clones off of some of the strains in time so lights went off officially yesterday and they're they're on now for day one of flower this is a fresh hair grow no co2 just fresh hair moving across the plants let's introduce the strains okay so we've got four rows eleven there's the background that's all Tahoe oh gee okay you guys have even grown that before the next row all Tahoe oh gee so that pull half of the room is going to be very tall lanky Tahoe gee plants these two plants here are Tahoe oh gee along with these two and these two as well that's so 22 23 24 26 27 28 Tahoe Jean and then that one there's 29 Tahoe G so this garden is almost is mostly Tahoe G almost 3/4 500g this plant here is reefer man Romulan installed by itself the only Romulan in the room remember in this start and last time I did all Romney would those the eight thousand watts but for three thousand watts of under lighting okay so Tahoe G and one Romulan this is going to see it really short so definitely gonna be having multiple canopy heights in this garden the Tahoes are gonna stretch and get nice and tall they were topped a week ago and they were all cut back to the second ring of the tomato paint and then grown up here you know seven inches in the past seven days so they're nice and tall now they're gonna get even taller I'm probably gonna have to trellis above the tomato cages in order to stabilize all the plants in here at least the Tahoes so Romulan reef man Romulan moving on these two plants are both platinum animal crackers I've never grown this before I don't even know what it is I'd imagine it's in the animal cookies cross of some sort it grows similar to my form cut but I'd say with some bigger leaves in the form cut but pretty sure it has Girl Scout cookie genetics in it if anyone is familiar with this strain and can give me some information about it I'd like to have it I actually traded these two plans and these two plants for one my plant and banana ogu clones the guy didn't want to get rid of these genetics and you know I don't give out the Platinum banana og but he came to my friend who does all the clones and said hey would you be with your buddy be willing to trade the plantain banana og for for these and I thought about it for a while and said yeah go ahead and make the trade so we've got animal crackers and then the other two that were given to me to him are gorilla glue number four two of them they're two broke loose moving on we have two bay grown Girl Scout cookies this is a Girl Scout cookies for cross popular in the San Francisco Bay Area my friend drove oh my friend forget about it my friend got it in California I guess I can tell you drove down there and God it's not can you tell you who it is we can't get in trouble oh yeah he went down to California and got this big round cup from some again San Frisco Bay Area next to our lemon oh gee we're the excited to grow this it is originally well it comes from warrior extracts down in California next to Argo GOG also from warrior extracts when I got these clones they were absolutely [ __ ] they had three finger leaves one finger leaves that's just a sign of stress and retardation but and they were really tight in a note spacing autoflowering crystal production just a bunch of [ __ ] like we went through a bunch of stress and I grew them out and they've come out of it you know they're they're getting better now I didn't get these directly from warrior extracts I got it from someone else next one these two right here are peyote purple from exotic genetics this is supposed to be the badass you know like the best one super frosty super purple you guys were really gonna like to look at this one but four things around and then lastly is subtools TGS sub cool golden ticket chernobyl cut so this is a specific phenotype of Chernobyl referred to as the golden ticket or the lime Slurpee people call to other things as well but I think more officially it's called the golden ticket cut yeah I'm really excited to grow all these new strains for you guys on camera for the first time and we're gonna have some great bud point in this room because you're going to see some awesome frosty tahoe along with these other one two or three two four five six seven eight strains so to be the eight thousand watt multi-stream flower room abusing all advanced nutrients along with some additives that are not from advanced that I like to use and just really excited about this garden guys these plants are on point the canopy is going to be approximately 20 feet by 8 feet so 8 wide and 20 long and I expect to get between well 1 and 1 and 3/4 pound to 2 pounds per light should be a nice full canopy and awesome grow there's another thing I might as well mention right now I didn't really prepare to think of how to tell you guys this but there's a strong chance that this will be my last grow in this garden along with my two 4000 watt twin 4000 watt gardens both both the two 4000 watt gardens and this 8 thousand watt garden are on the same building and the person that owns the building I mean there's a lot a lot of rentals in this building but the person that owns this song for someone else from what I hear they're not going to be friendly to medical marijuana so at this point this looks like it may be my last row in here but it could be worse they could be trying to shut me down before this garden finishes and before the 4000 watt gardens finish so I'm gonna fight it hard I've hired an attorney to help me at least keep the gardens running and to or keep them delayed until I can actually harvest these gardens because I really don't want to miss out on these gardens are just they're gonna be awesome rounds so I just want to prepare you for that there's a chance that we don't finish this row or the two 4000 watt grouse but at the very best I'd say we're gonna finish them but that'll be it for her alright guys I'm gonna go ahead and cut the video here but really happy to at least give you some information on what's going on and what I'm doing next and should be fun to grow these new strains all right any

Saturday morning so we got you know about 48 hours just hanging straight with the whole root ball and everything let's just take a look at it here so we're hanging here I I hang them whole plant hanging root ball and all what I do is I'll put a two gallon bag over the buds a two gallon ziplock bag then I'll just close it down plate over the stem and then I pulled a plant out that way I don't get any dirt or medium on the plant and then I wrapped that and just like a shopping bag you know I don't think the whole root ball just kind of the primary roots that are there then I hang that on a a now just get a coat hanger you know and just hang that into the closet but I leave all the leaves on except for whatever ones that were obviously dead mostly I'll peel those off right away before I hang it but I leave all the families on for the first 48 hours to let all the sugars transfer I didn't water them for like a day but put them down that kind of really affected one of the plants here but you know we might be in a little trouble there as far as the quality but this one is looking really nice I'm gonna go ahead and give it a little bit of a trim up here and that way it can breathe a little bit better I'm aiming for sixty degrees Fahrenheit in the in the hanging room and sixty degrees humidity I don't like to I don't I don't like to dry it too fast when it's hanging the longer you can get it to dry without getting moldy while it's hanging the better you know some people stay fly up three five seven days that's still you know five days is too short of a time man anything over seven then you're getting into some quality tiering you're gonna lose that smell up in here see if we can do this I got my magnifying lens you can take a look at some of the trikes it's really hard to get in there like yeah here we go I'm hard to see if they're amber or not hurry up let me try something here it's hard to really get a view on the color of them for you and hold the camera steady where it's really focused but I can just tell you that a lot of these are really really milky but they're about 10 20 30 percent amber I'd say about 30 percent amber that's really the best time in my opinion all the everything is really all the CBDs and th these are balanced to where they're supposed to be you know we've got some really nice buds on this on this plant man I'm really happy with this nice dent buds they're not quite as dense as I thought they'd be I mean they were so super dense on the plant and while it's growing but I mean I think that'll be remin you know how they look when it when they dry up so we'll have to see you know we'll follow me along here I got a lot of stuff to do today I gotta give the grow room an overhaul now we're gonna clean out the flowering room and move the veg over and I don't know we might have to do a whole I'm gonna have a problem with my landlord here things are getting a little hairy he's getting upset about the about the plants but uh I think we can call them down if we you know I've got my paperwork i'm a medical grower you guys know that everything is legal I'm at my limits so you know we got the rest of the plants hanging in the closet I'm gonna give you a quick shot on that you know so I just hang them things upside down leaves it a lot as you can see and just get them nice and aired out for these ones came down last night after dark so you get them nice and aired out these are a couple branches off the Big Momma plant that you guys saw these came from the same plant they're here as the other branch that I just showed you there so yep we're doing we're doing pretty good man it is harvest time if you want to look real quick our pineapple express is just getting gigantic in the vegetation room right now under the happy leaf led that we did so well with the first time look at this mama is we gotta clean the grow room out here that is one big plant he's taking off about a 3x5 area right now that's just one mama so we gotta clean this out get the scrub over it and we'll be on our next run it's the Pineapple Express we've got the other clones running we got the clone machine going I don't know if I've showed that yet they're coming show that a great stopper peace train [ __ ] the government a bunch of deep 13 clones no these are pineapple express clones going in the hot water that I built this weekend so I think you're gonna be trying to build some more of those in the other vegetative plant I got it the bigger the mama g13 you've got some cuttings from that already they're healthy so we'll be lollipop knees and strong in these this week and we'll have videos of that you know it's my next run in here and I don't I'm not really afraid now to do some proper heavy manicuring and you know some breaking of the branches to get them in that straw properly a baby got a little tiny baby bottle flower in here yeah this is how big it is not even followed my hand I don't know stop growing leaves turn yellow I put a pinch of epson salt in there yesterday morning and now the leaves are back start coming green again and we got some more growth on the bottom but I mean look at the roots on this baby we got good roots you know so ever since I put that air stone in there we're getting some really nice rose here's our other g13 that I've been but this thing is probably about six months old it's just really been an experiment for whatever purpose I don't know I taking up Runa my grow room I'm probably embarrassed to say that it's how old it is but it's come it's gone and stopped up I've really just kind of messed with it quite a bit just to just to kind of see what would happen you know where I got some broken branches these are the plants where I'm not afraid to mess with them and just see what happens if I do little techniques that I read about that I'm not so sure about you know I'm not I'm not so worried about this plant dying it's taken a lot of abuse and it keeps coming back and now I've got the air stone in there this was our original cracky experiment no it's probably like two and a half months old but still it should be the same size as that pineapple Express if I took care of it the right way and we got some new baby see things going in here with that the polisher and what was that other one I forgot oh that's astro dog that one's looking really good Pollard's got this characteristic where the leaves kind of like curl up I don't know it's kind of strange I've been watering it properly and everything you know it's just it uh my buddy told me the same thing happened to him so I don't know be interesting to see how that comes out so yes this is good ground indoor if it's a call for your growing needs we're in Rutland Vermont very local July is coming soon and it's a good girl roads into gmail dot subscribe my channel and I like to subscribe you", "dFUjPA_v87M": "what's going on everybody welcome back to language training we're at six weeks in six days right now and these are the plans it's all good that's okay pH all right three days ago you put it right here on the side it's a little teaspoon mixing water so like share subscribe leave a comment I get back to you guys", "2FaTc9W0Kiw": "hello everybody sar has been a while but I've been busy doing some other stuff for them for the business lately and I just wanted to take a break from the videos cuz it is a it is time consuming putting them all together learning everything about a specific strain just to be able to voice that correctly back to you guys so today we are getting back into it you can see that we have some of our material right here this is going to be a rhino supply concentrate this is an alien oh gee pho wax as you can see super good company super nice people great customer service skills and just all-around moves their product and keeps customers happy so without further ado not to be um so let's see if we can get some close-ups of this in here so oops no it is very like gummy like and just kind of has a grainy texture but at the same time has that great that great elasticity to it so that's really great this isn't actually and actually this was actually a very very good run for this wax so without further ado but we'll take a dad for you guys already got one done up here for me a little baby want to start everything off right Cheers appreciate it guys very soft very smooth with this alien og you do get that that og type taste from it on that lemon that piney taste that comes from a lot of oh geez this is a indica hybrid so it is a cross between an indica and sativa but it is in academia so the cross is gonna be Tahoe og which I've also smoked so I went ahead and grabbed that out for you guys so we've got Tahoe G shatter so Tahoe G and a lean Kush are the two that come together to make a van og so with that little bit of an explanation this seedling or seed clone did come from the California Bay Area and ever since then it is kind of spread its way across and made its way out into the west and and I'm not sure if it's on the up on the East Coast per se but so this plant also can test as high as 28 percent THC so good good plan really good subtle soft kind of high does its I would say it's a good beginner one but not a lot because it is a very very heavy indica this is gonna be good for beginners and stuff like that because it is very soft and it is kind of a creeper and it slowly brings you in and doesn't just bang you're high like those are the good ones those are the good ones but you don't want to do those if you're not a beginner so um we'll do a little bit of talking but in between this day I'll take another one but someone explained weed a little bit in this video I think I'm gonna make a whole video for itself about weed but cannabis THC CBD all these names it's very confusing but the simplest thing you can remember is that THC is a psychoactive part THC is psychoactive makes you feel high up here and CBD is a complete non psychoactive it actually does the opposite of THC and counteracts THC so that is is what a lot of people talk about them additionally used and that's what we want to focus on when we're talking about medical or we're talking about other stuff because THC does help does help some some diseases or problems that you might have in your life or there's anxiety depression whether you know you have you have you know multiple sclerosis whether you have epilepsy when whatever you have it can help with a lot of different things so with that being said make sure that you know what you're talking about and before you go knocking people or before you knock what we do make sure that that that you yourself are ready to talk in the context of cannabis because it is a very different world and if you don't know what you're talking about you can get stuff mixed up its science its chemicals it's a lot survivors tetrahydrocannabinol cannabidiol can cannabis can all this candy candy candy cane so HMDA right over no we will take another dad for you guys hang put you down Cheers yep super lemony super potty all right guys well without further ado we're leaving pet no I'm just kidding guys but for real shout out to Rhino supply again hooking me up good deals on that go check it out if you haven't yet and you're in Denver and that's gonna be all for this episode guys I enjoy everybody watching I appreciate it thanks peace", "bKIJaBpBieE": "hello youtube this is my from mmm this is an update on the dream train from a grow big nose is there every got prep

to serenity vape today i want to talk about triangle trading companies delta 8 thc cartridges these are these are really cool i've got one here in a kang vape th-710 it's a nice little drop system vaporizer works really well this is something that's refined from the cannabis sativa plant and put back together but unlike some of the delta 8 thc cartridges that have come before it this is purely extracted from it is entirely from a cannabis plant that has less than 0.3 thc what that means is that not only is the product legal there's zero risk of it containing anything other than delta a thc and the 50 milligrams of terpenes that they put in to give it the same kind of effect that you would get in flour or you know a cartridge that you would get out of a dispensary the quality is good this is really cool it's it still gives you a kind of high it it's pretty strong actually it's less so than your typical your old school marijuana or the kind of carts that you'll get out of the dispensary it's safe it's just delta 8 thc 950 milligrams of it and then they add 50 milligrams of terpenes which make it much like the strain that's on the label for example this is pineapple kush and having had regular pineapple kush and having had this i'd say the experience is spot on i've tried some other strains like maui wowie which has an amazing effect and flavor i was was very awake for it it's one of the things that happens for me i right now i really like their hybrid sour space candy takes away the pain takes away any stomach discomfort i have and i'm chill the the anti-medic or rather anti-nausea stops you from vomiting uh effects of this delta eight thc it it's so effective you know it's not like i went out and i had a bunch of junk food and overheat and tried it you know but what they found about two years ago when they studied this on juvenile chemo patients was that they administered it two hours before chemo and then every six hours after the chemo it completely stopped vomiting for these kids they were able to keep their food down they were able to work through the day you know they were able to go through the rest of their day for me somebody who has celiac and ibs this is this is great you know i could be you know perfectly following my diet and i hear this about people with crohn's too where you know they're doing everything right but sometimes you just need something extra it works for that it works for anxiety it works for pain some of the strains are mellower but for the price point you know you're paying 45 for a one gram cartridge so something that i would say is just a step below medical grade it's it's pretty good especially if you can't afford a medical marijuana license um sometimes there's some serious hoops that you have to jump through to get one and not everybody who needs the assistance that medical marijuana can provide is gonna be able to get a license or a marijuana card whatever you want to call it green card i'm somebody who is very strongly affected by my marijuana and you know 25 to 35 thc and a strain of flour means i can enjoy very little before i might start feeling paranoid or too sluggish to do anything you know like getting couch locked every so often is nice but i not a huge fan i don't feel couch locked with these um i don't feel even like the beginning phases of paranoia you know that that kind of automat like mechanical paranoia that sometimes happens when you smoke like it just there's nothing you know it's not that you don't it's not that you have something in the background that's bothering you it's just boom that doesn't happen with these cartridges i've tried three of their strains so far i started out with the pineapple kush which comes in this nice little package um you can see their qr code on the back the pineapple cush i really liked for its more mellow uplifting effects uh i wasn't like boom boom boom distracted and all over the place the maui was delicious very strong you know i felt like locked in place not because my body was was melting you know as had as has happened on some some indicos i've had but just because my head was buzzing so much and what i've been vaping over the last few days is their sour space candy this so far might actually be my favorite i'm the twist in between on that one um i do get the beneficial effects of the indica i my you know any physical pain i have is turned way down uh and i'm somebody who has fibromyalgia so even on a good day i might be in pain so having something like this uh waiting at home when i'm not at work or even if i am is good for me because i can still focus mostly but my pain is negligible for somebody who has arthritis or fibromyalgia or any other widespread pain disorder i think this is really good as a product the other strain i'm thinking of trying is actually their northern lights remember northern lights putting me out and one customer has told me that they had just one hit off of the northern lights and they were out deep asleep about half an hour they slept through the entire night worked really well for them for me there's not enough of a difference to rush out and go to a dispensary this this cuts the mustard for me now it doesn't cut it for everybody and you'll still find stronger medicine at a dispensary but if that's not an option for you these are really good and even if you can go to a dispensary you might actually be saving money and getting similar enough of an effect or exactly what you need out of these cards thanks to triangle trading company for reaching out to us we really hope that you guys keep doing this i really want to try some of your other strains like headband for example so this is jonathan from serenityvape thanks for

multiscreen fire room just firstly i'm going to go over the room and the configuration we have for magnum XXX el Ojo hoods for brand new bulbs in there the bolts be empowered by my ford digital lumatek palace on the wall they're being controlled by a Titan Helios 3 i also have a titan outlet once co2 monitor here with a green air 24 cubic foot per hour co2 generator hooked up to natural gas line 3 16 inch ecoplus wall mount fans tubac stands out on the floor one there then one on the other corner blown this way I have an eight-inch fresh filter with a to g k+ fan just scrubbing to dehumidifiers one like 55 pint here or 150 pine I think it is and then a 65 pint up there in the corner then I have 12,000 BTU mini split AC unit which also dehumidifiers so will not have any humidity issues in this room all my valise will turn up to super Lemon mode so I'm really pushing like 4400 Watson here because I each one of those ads ten percent so I basically got 4 1100 watt bulbs even though the really 1001 wolves configuration the plants we have 24 plants all in five gallon room acre pots with sunshine ultra core 42 inch tomato cages on all the plants we have four rows of six plants one two three four plants have all been lollipop once and topped three times they've edge for a full three weeks all them except for this plant here in the corner which is an ak-47 I threw it in about nine days after the rest of the plant so it's really only gotten the tuning vegetarian not going to be able to manage the canopy in here really well because this AK is obviously behind as it is it's a very short plant it's not going to stretch much at all so this is going to be just a little runt in the room but it's still going to be good still get some weight off there but just a lot shorter veg time on that one also it hasn't received any Benny's I don't think i gave Benny's to all the other plants when I transplanted them but because I did this one over a week late I didn't give it any but i'll give them some probably somewhere around some one week two or three so to get some then you can see the stocks pretty small compared to the other ones okay let's go over the strains so it's a little confusing but this is a multistream grow we have AK 47 here burmese kush here this thing is going to stretch like crazy I've cut it back a ton scroll the fastest out of all the strains in the room so ak-47 ramiz kush probably the tallest plant probably the shortest plant right next to each other now I will reconfigure the plants after the stretch finishes around week three try and get the taller plants by each other in the shore plants by each other that way I can adjust the lights accordingly without having the lights too close to one plant or too far away from another so a que from Syria seeds for meez Kush and then these four right here one two three four so that one two three four platinum but banana OG Kush from right seeds okay and that comprises this quadrant of the room this six plants so out of these six we have Burmese AK and then for platinum bananas the next quadrant of six plants up there under that light all six of them tahoe OG easy enough figure they're all stretched about be about the same height they can stay underneath one light and i can adjust that light to a suit that those particular plants let's go to this quadrant of plants these six these three one two three fire OG these two black mingle couche from riot and then that thrown up there is pre 98 bubba cross with Seoul assassins crew cut number 3 purple OG Kush also from riot so once again for this quadrant we got black mega cush black metal kush the sack 98 cross and then three fires the last quadrant those six back there all the sack 98 same as this one here same as same as that one so that's sack 98 and those six are all set 90 that's soul assassins crew purple OG Kush cut number 3 cross with pre 98 bubba I just call it sec 98 I don't remember if I have multiple phenotypes in there or if they're all the same phenotype I'll check back on that but I don't remember for sure so that's the grow we have one two three four five six seven different strains in here 24 plants anyway I just topped the plants for the last time about four days ago venge for invention for another couple days drench them all with just fresh water which I typically do not do before flower but I did flush them and turn the lights off for like 36 hours and now the lights just came on about 10 minutes ago for the first day of flower 21 day veg period lollipops once topped about three times I will go ahead and lollipop them again around somewhere between d 14 and 8 21 gonna get an automatic watering system hooked up in here I don't have anything for a right well I have it all the parts for it but nothing in this room because I really want to get this room on auto watering it's going to be really hard to crawl through here once they're all filled out I should not have bedroom for as long as I did you can see the plants are all pretty big this could be very thick canopy I could have gotten away with the bench period five to seven days shorter and still had a full canopy but just didn't get around to the flipping them in a flower so anyway we're going to start it off here this trip you really can grow haven't done a multi strain this big or this many strains what boys is 66 strains one two three four five six seven strains haven't done seven strains in one room and quite a long time so I look forward to sharing this with you guys anyway this is day one a flower any questions comments to let me know otherwise i'll give you another update at day 7 piece", "SfEw1nJHflo": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell

honestly if i've never seen this on p2p's channel i probably would have never got it but he recommended it and he said it was [ __ ] very very good for its price let me say right now i paid 21 out the door at flavors for this which is pretty good for a full gram and uh yeah if you couldn't tell from the title it is batter chips which is uh some type of concentrate form that i've never heard of or maybe it's something that i've seen before but maybe just in a different shape or something in chip form i guess i'll be playing a video right now so you can see me open it but as you can see i already opened it already um but not bad the packaging is all there uh not bad at all lemon bon bon is the strain and i believe it's running at about 82.23 thc total thc doesn't show the total cannabinoids zero percent cbd manufactured september first not bad call and uh hashtag grassroots all that stuff and uh i mean you can take a look at it looks pretty good not bad not the greatest looking wax but not bad smells like some creamy butterness smells sort of minty in a way it's going to be the first wax video where i actually use this bad boy so should be a good one i want to also get a melt milk shot so guys that's going on i will be hold on let's see how i can do this it's really hard to see should be enough you press this twice oh [ __ ] all right take this off yeah sorry my table is dusty just let it twice you let that heat up a little heat up or something and we'll wait until this pauses i mean uh vibrates and then press it again and i'll put the the wax in there let that go it's a cold start this is the sick cup guys so you wait until that goes you press it again double press it and give it about 15 seconds you just drop that bad boy in there you could actually do it right now if you want there you go so first taste very creamy as you would get from uh buttery types of concentrates uh so far no lemon taste but not bad for what it is um a little bit disappointed i thought there would be some citrusy notes in here but nonetheless still good for twenty one dollars really can't beat it uh but yeah let's take another hit of this so with this there's a lot more in here now that was a small hit right let's be honest [Music] cheers oh so with this bad boy you're not going to get those fat oh that was creamy you're not going to get the fat hitch you would get from a wax pan or you know a real dab but the taste will be there and the clouds are all right i'm not going to lie they're all right they're decent let me see if i could one hand it and then blow it towards the to light and show you that we don't [ __ ] around here whoo like this so so yeah i'm definitely still getting fat hits just not fatter than you're used to or that i'm used to i'm gonna pack one more hit and enjoy it and we're gonna call it a video as far as this goes 21 for some shaman extracts p2 peeps is right you know this is fire for the price you really can't go wrong and uh i guess i know what batter chips means now you know it's just butter just pieces of butter or batter but we're going to pack it again or compare it again as you can see i've been using this bad boy like don't get me wrong i'm still using the gobi as well you know it's just if i don't want to bring this one you know this is just huge compared to the the gobi but i think that's my cue like this may not look like all all that like the smoke-wise but i don't know why it's making me cough maybe the it's just hitting right i don't know why cheers i usually try i usually don't cough that much you know i'll restrict it or hold it back it's not really me holding me back or holding it back it's more of a technique that i've seen or that just works for me you know when i take a deep breath and it just the coughing sensation leaves but this one i don't know like this and vaporizers be making me cough on some different [ __ ] like vaporizers as in like vaping weed like it's supposed to be healthier but sometimes i just cough from those but yeah let me take this last hit of this i'm definitely high i like to say that this is awake and big for me so uh i believe lemon is most of the time sativa so i should be good let's just let this heat up and take this last hit and then call the date hopefully you did enjoy the video hopefully you've been enjoying the videos you know uh yeah just i've been appreciating it so from the bottom of my heart as much as i say this i mean every time i appreciate you guys and uh you know you're part of the reason why i keep doing this you know obviously you know when i started it wasn't just you guys it was myself but now it's you and myself you know what i'm saying so cheers i've been taking real good care of my [ __ ] you know you got through you gotcha but yeah that is probably going to be the end of the video hopefully but yeah that's going to be the end of the video hopefully you did enjoy it check out shaman extracts it's definitely something that is is pretty good for its price you know what i'm saying so other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace [Music] you", "0VEpE3AdzeU": "what's up guys I'm back again and we're gonna show you what we have from the harvest just a little sample of each let's start off with the GDP from Woody's now this is woody GDP this is from loud seeds what it says on the information it says it is a Buerkle strain crossed with big bud and this phenotype that I grew came out to be real dominant in big bed it's not a bad thing came out real good real good sativa really like mango we smell great medicine out there then we move on to the next contender she is the Tahoe og from Kelly connections - sloppy German job on this one this was more of like an earthy you know type as a you know that you could taste like a remnant so that you could eat it has like earthy taste like of soil a little bit of the cush /og taste we go bud Cisco's right there pretty nice boom and then the other phenotype my favorite phenotype I've gotten from the Cali connection Tahoe geez this one came on just like the one showed in my strain reviews for my first harvest stuff is gorgeous it's very tasty I love it so ding this is my nighttime medicine where I want to go to sleep some purple hues and there stuff it is awesome definite time show always been top shelf I just wish there was the / I'm really looking for a purple strain the next one we got is the Jack the Ripper there's some real lemony smell on this one covered in light on chairs pulled all this stuff at day 70 everything I just showed you harvested at day 70 flowering that's from TGA seeds TGA sub cool this is the Jack the Ripper I love it I wish I had this under more direct light it was kind of growing off to the side so it didn't grow as Poland dances the other one but such a great lemon pine smell legit stuff right there so I just want to show you guys how it came out would it look like I care now for about a week and I'm loving it it was a pain waiting for it to dry though gotta hate that part and that uh I just been real busy lately uh I'll try to get stuff updated message that can lately after about a month or so I'll be updating a lot more often you ready later guys", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could

it looks really clean it crumbles really easily when you press against it with your tool it just falls apart it starts to crumble so it's stable it's a nice yellow color it's on the drier side as you can see I already took some out of it Mars og is definitely an indica the reason why it's given its name is in reference to its growing conditions these planetary strains usually begin growing indoors and are then later moved outdoors to complete the growth cycle in a more natural condition the end result is a dense bud with high flower to leaf ratio that produces a really heavy effect it's really Hardy with a thick taste of pungent smell marzocchi is definitely something you want to have in your medicine cabinet for pain and insomnia right away when you smell it you get a sweet tiny OG like smell kind of like a diesel fuel II smell to it too right away when you open this container of butter you smell the earthiness that pungency that's normal to oh jeez that woodsy smell very sweet pleasant smell and for me I get a little bit of a almost like a diesel II smell to this alright enough of the smelling let's take a big down let's try so please do not attempt anything in this video at home this video was intended only for adults is legal for me to be dealing with the substance it may not be legal for you please do not attempt this at home do not do anything illegal [Music] [Music] this sweetness really comes through and also that also that piney is I get a lot of the earthiness and the woodsy kind of smell on the inhale and the exhale with the strain definitely on exhale I get a lot of the sweetness it's very sweet very pleasant experience right away I feel my entire body relaxed that's typical for OG strains and how I react to them a few myself not super sleepy but I can probably fall asleep if I laid down just close my eyes and relax definitely uplifted this strain is an excellent one for people who are coming home after a long day at work or if you just studied a bunch and you just want to relax now or you did all your work for the day and it's time to relax definitely check out this Mars og by down to DAB extracts in terms of price I give this

"3BkjxJtjs3Y": "okay cool so today we've got some Sasquatch snap from 3ce Farms shout out to mad at 3c and reddit the cannabis cafe for making it happen actually I've heard about this I can't remember who commented in one of the videos from 3c but they said try the Sasquatch sap it's awesome it's one of my favorites so yeah I'm really looking forward to get into this so let's go ahead and take a tour around the jar here who got sasquatch sap he's watching us back there according to the little meter here this is almost a hybrid it's more probably of a sativa leaning hybrid than a full sativa government's always watching us so watch out be warned fairly alright and then here's the testing panel here so it looks like we're coming in at twenty three point six eight percent total cannabinoids and then you guys can do the math there on the THC if you want I'm not gonna do that right now I don't have a calculator and I'm not a human computer so in any case here we go there's Sasquatch looking angry SAP dripping on his face what I really like about the top of these jars is they always have the cross listed so it's like I'm not familiar with Sasquatch SAP what is that it's Kem sister cross with Chaco Diesel cross with sour dub which I guess is gorilla glue number four still you know I'm not too familiar with those strains but at least there's a heritage there and on other ones I've seen I am familiar with them so it's kind of helpful info they're pretty cool in any case let's go ahead and pop this jar there's the seal let's watch it break together boom alright and there we go looking pretty awesome ready to jump out of the jar these flowers are friendly no seal on top for our protection but yeah let's go ahead and just dump this out let me see I was it's a is he champion ooh these nodes you feelin nice and dense even though they're kind of flat I'm gonna leave that you see ya there's a bigger nug in here let me try to fish him out wow these trikes are pretty impressive though I'm just gonna put that one there cuz I saw the trikes on the bottom of this one and that just made me say wow like that just a second ago when we did one more out of here sorry if this is a little longer than usual they're kind of flat that's what's interesting about the structure here it's like look how it's like a flat nug you know but definitely impressive nonetheless looks like a little fox tailing there on the back mmm and this has it does have a must eNOS to it a little bit of rubber kind of like a new rubber smell cat of the sweetness in the background there yeah I'm very interesting flavor profile or smell profile rather hard to pick it all apart right now in this few seconds that I have with you guys but yeah very interesting and just the Tri coordination is really really nice like I just wanted to throw one more on there cuz look at this guy he's just full of trikes so beautiful looking nugs weirdly flat I guess that's what I think that's what I would say that's something I notice about them but but interesting nonetheless this one even has I'm not trying to make this go longer than it needs to it's a very tiny nut but it has a little bit of a blue hue to it even from my enormous fingers there I noticed that so yeah pretty cool very interesting looking and yeah not a lot of familiarity with these genetics myself but very impressive and smells interesting so looking forward to seeing how this smokes", "LYO4xCOkZ0I": "the following concept may not be suitable for the ages of 18 and 21 and under please know that every cannabis item and

member of the royal family i still am yet to review the live residence disease which i will do and i called it i legit said it in that video months before they released this [ __ ] that they were gonna do it and they did which is the smartest thing they can do because live resin is a new wave but we're not we're not here to talk about that we're here to take this dab of this orange crush let's do this [ __ ] it's time i'm about to dab i got it right here that's dizzy batter i'm sorry it's dizzy rosin batter i can't wait you guys know i love these [ __ ] citrus flavors so i had to get the orange crush and orange crush if you guys did not know orange crush is actually a classic strain ladies and gentlemen cheers first time try and stizzy concentrate oh my god this is amazing everything i expect from something with a name that has orange in it holy [ __ ] this is comparable okay you guys wow i am shook oh my god i'm not lying to you guys when i say i'm absolutely in shock this stuff is definitely comparable to stizzy i mean see i'm loaded i meant to say definitely comparable to 710 it has an incredible potency it's only 73 thc i'm [ __ ] high though and that [ __ ] overwhelmed me in citrusy flavor definitely tastes a lot more like orange than what it smells like and that's a fact and i love that because it always takes you by surprise when you dab it so all props all shouts out this disney you can [ __ ] see i am beyond high but i gotta do it for you guys another one let's just dab of the gas again ladies and gentlemen cheers to you all oh my god i i'm [ __ ] loaded oh my god yes dizzy is wow i am just so shook on how crazy good their concentrates are like don't get me wrong i've always noticed dizzy's a good brand but personally me like i think they do have the best distillate but i'm not a good fan like a good fan i'm not a big fan of distillate in general so the fact that i gave their constant because their weed is amazing absolutely amazing definitely on the 710 level of flower and so are their concentrates not going to cut i mean their rosin is beautiful so yeah i [ __ ] with this [ __ ] so so far because you you guys know you need to try more than one thing in order to understand the brand with that being said i now basically bring this review to a conclusion thank you all you guys already know what to do like comment subscribe feel free to

rise and Erie today and grab me some goji goji goji goji one gram of the go GOG I did pay a hefty $96 for one gram of this go GOG by Moxie yeah 96 bucks do they are taxing but as you guys know Moxie is fired probably the best that's the best concentrate you can get his moxie I liking the best probably prime and pharmaceutical rx so right there in a close second as far as quality Moxie's the best go GOG and I said and this is coming in at a total of ninety point five nine percent cannabinoids eighty seven point seven five THC a right there let's get this bad boy open get a few dabs I did get me a new torch I bought the torch with the the automatic lighter on it igniter pretty good these work way better then them little tiny torches butane ones you buy it head chops they're like that big they suck and then you go out and like it leaked just to last you at least a couple weeks even for heavy dabbers maybe a month if you don't have much but I go to them about every couple of weeks cuz I be dabbing heavy so it was that all right go GOG one gram of the sugar [Music] cool funky funky look at the go GOG sugar as one DRAM as a nice hefty pile there looks like a gram to me get you another zoom in close-up look at that that is go GOG buy Moxie 90% cannabinoids a couple dabs of this and let you know what I think of the go GOG I did have this before so I you know that's so I know it's good is I had it before it was really good was one of the first ones I've ever bought by Moxie was go GOG when I first got my medical marijuana card that's true story so this is my little works good get the snow he's a little fast let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know if you've had the go GOG by Moxie before I like to burn off a lot of the old stuff get it red hot and burn off down a little [ __ ] yeah this is coming in this is a hybrid we got to tell you that it was packaged on 514 of 2020 so really fresh got stuff we set my little timer here yeah so 514 it was packaged it's pretty fresh live resident sugar not too big of a DAB a little dab you try it out small go small first Cheers go GOG buy moxie Wow got a nice very nice flavor it kind of reminds me a little bit of the Alpine og similar to that with a little bit more pining this to it it almost tastes like the lemon OG x Alpine OG it's kind of close to that kind of similar to that for me but this has a lot more like heightening flavor to that very good though go GOG very nice let me get another dab and use my other dab tool over here switch up to a cold tool we'll get it a nice that's a little bit fatter a little fatter bugger there on there look at that one we do that one now that's a pretty fat one decent size I'm so used to having a lighter I always go to reach for my lighter because I just got this like yesterday and I'm still new to me that I don't need a lighter anymore because mostly I use vape pens and now with this no lighter needed anymore kinda I always go for a reach for my lighter and I'm like wait something different do another job that you dived for you guys on this video I don't want to make it too long and it said it was a hybrid go gog giving you the basics one gram I paid $96 for the gram I did have five dollars off eight points so I paid ninety one dollars for some reason the grams are priced $96 really uneven number for some reason but it's how they do it at least eerie rise that's how they do it nice and hot set what timer I like sitting a timer because it gives me an exact I know that when I heat my when I heat my thing one over here a bowl up to red-hot that forty seconds gives me a perfect cooldown time you know trial and error so depends though if you get a cheat that's a cheap banger if you get a better quality banger probably might stay hotter longer but I bought this one for seven dollars a smoker friendly yeah Cheers let me know what you guys are smoking on smoking on the go GOG by moxie excellent that's got a really good flavor but really like pop and the flavor pops highly recommended if you haven't tried it try it go GOG by Moxie it's fire that when I'm really feeling it after doing that second dad it's coming

we're going to take a look at the veg tent and see what is going on it's been a few weeks since I've taken a video on and let anybody know what's really going on here I rearranged my entire veg tent area to allow more spacing in between plants and for some new babies that I got going starting here I'm all right start off here on the left from seed plush Barry this is my flesh very um one female that I had she is now a big giant bush and ready for some rate for some topping and cropping great plant excellent blackberry smell on it with I don't know it's like a hint of musty blackberry it's amazing I've got two phenotypes of my jackpot Royale unfortunately it looks like both phenotypes and hydro are a no-go I went ahead and obviously we put him in hydro last night I had to change my number two jackpot Royale out into a I put a critical push in its spot so we're going to up the strains the strain count here instead of I believe six strains were now at seven in hydro which is going to be a challenge because they all like different nutrient feedings is what it looks like some of these out the way on one of my phenotypes I've got a weird a weird leaf pattern thing is happening here this one I believe is the is the weird one um it's gone off and produced these single [ __ ] bladed leaves same nutrients as everybody else no no deviants no variants all the same everybody's getting the same the same five gallon bucket and we lost gotten through a little bit of shock with her on the other one looks okay didn't really have any have her and he suffer any one finger leaves which was really interesting I wasn't expecting keep get out the way doing this video here my pajamas man i just woke up it's like 9am this right here is sagar matt the seed strawberry delight strawberry diesel it's called delight because the diesel is very light it's a very strawberry dominant um next over here is my Barney's farm critical cushion critical cush this baby is a stinker anse he's got a crazy stink definitely has the OG sent to her arm so I decided to pick pick one of those clones since they're rooted BAM a whole bunch of rooted clones down there went ahead and just grabbed a couple took the best one and I put her in the hydro in spot of a jackpot Royale number two after 12 hours she's very happy back here is what is this buddha tahoe OG probably going to be my new mama or maybe not it was a stressed clone and i don't want to deal with the stress plant so i might just donate it off to a patient who wants to run a dirt dirt buddha to a hot food at tahoe it's also known as Peter tahoe OG if you're curious um i went ahead this is one of the bubbles that was in hydro I can see how crappy it looks I transplanted it out and into soil it just was not taking the not I wouldn't say that not taking the nutrients it wasn't taking the watering cycle as it as well as it should I have it dripping for 15 minutes every three hours and they're only for internet pots in it seems that some of the Bubba just get to water soap to water logged in you know I had that problem of my very first grow but every three hours i'm having a watering cycle and i'm still getting issues so i changed it out to every four hours now oh this is a confidential cheese I've been holding for a long time it had root so I just threw it in the soil I'm not expecting to keep it just give it away and these are the two we just started out here this is world of seeds afgan kush rider feminized and autoflower strain um just started at this past three or four days ago and this one also is another autoflower since I have so much in in photo period straight strains I might as well switch to a few autos that I could just leave in this veg tent for their entire life cycle this is a 70 days from seed finisher just like the other one this is Barney's farm auto blue mammoth it's uh basically otherwise you want to call it if you check the genetics it's a blueberry AK it's a ak-47 cross with blueberry across with a ruderalis so I don't know what the big deal is for auto blue mammoth I guess it grows big a big plant i'm not sure but blueberry AK would have been sufficient enough of a name to call it alright put these back number what is this number one which is still good in hydro which will be taken out today and switched off with another strain so you got plush berry strawberry delight critical cush and to jackpot royale phenotypes buddha tahoe OG new mama confidential cheese bubba kush and my two auto flowers auto blue mammoth and afghan kush rider in the [ __ ] can't all right i mean close this up real quick well not really close just move without foot way and we're going to talk about the flower room um so many variances in in strain height it's crazy we are running the pH perfect line up I am right now running the micro grill bloom with b-52 and voodoo juice I'm also using hi girls I'm 10 mils per gallon in place of their sins design if you do then do the math and check all your check the online stuff they're very similar just a few ingredients difference between them and they both do about the same job so that's something to know also Rhino skin from the events nutrients is the same exact stuff from botanicare called silica blast so you can use that instead those are just some things I've learned after doing some research also final phase it's the same thing as flora clean or any other flushing solution so you can use any one you want and all right let's get into it there's all the it's all my advanced stuff here now but candies all my flowering stuff over here not even being used yet my carrel bloom and then on my gin hydro that i use for soil right now oh that's more bottles back there but let's talk about other [ __ ] this right here is cali connection 398 bubba original mother from seed 3-gallon grow bag Fox Farm soil doing a regular feeding schedule of general hydroponics three-part nutrients with a couple of boosters um take a look she's all right she's coming back after being cloned my clones are pretty heavy in the last run it's nice to see her make a nice recovery here next one over we have cali connection budo tahoe OG otherwise known as pure tahoe OG very big bushy plant and she also is coming back from being cloned very nice easy breezy I could pull three clones right there off that little branch nice and move her out the way like I said I have some clones down here is just a variation of all my strains the back tre is all buddha tahoe OG um critical cush critical cush pre 98 bubba pre 98 bubba and six strawberry diesels um I believe these are what a Buddha Tahoe a Buddha Tahoe g from the last round these are all like the secondary branching this just did not look good enough to use and take the last soil plant video and move into the hydro after this this is reserved a probiotic confidential cheese on the gas stock my lights none on this video and I apologize arm very slow and veg this is super LA confidential dominant phenotype we're talking almost 0 node stretch I didn't [ __ ] crazy this thing's got no stretch amazing lease just thick broad dark green and a heavy pine ish kind of smell um very nice plant very big I will probably have to take this one and put her outside to finish she clones fine but take a pan over there's her babies and that one these three um very slow and veg they have almost just no growth one set of leaves has come out since I planted them extremely slow I'm not pleased with that everything else is looking fairly okay we have our GDPs over here they're healthy reaching up for this guy now finally after a [ __ ] week the biggest ones in here these four and that one these are the plush berry I'm obviously it's the tall phenotype of the larger and more indica dominant larger yielding phenotype which is cool but it wasn't the one I was looking for I'm more of you know the short stinky funky danki stuff but it still smells crazy we're going to go with it here's the ones that replaced right here is a critical khush from Barney's farm this is jackpot Royale number one definitely suffering an over watering problem you can see the discoloration and the leaf this is a telltale sign of over-watering not a nutrient deficiency you can see the tips are fine they're starting to yellow on the leaves curl down which is the over-watering that's as simple as that i can tell i got that I after so many years of growing this is a pre 98 bubba i just put her in there one of her other bubbles the original did not make it so we've lost a few but dealing with all new strains got to learn how they operate how they grow and so it's just a challenge everything will be topped in here to get it more along the lines of maybe an even canopy along with the with the Buddha Tahoe over here over here or the or the arm pre 98 sigh should say because they're the my main priority in here the cali connection and the sub cool stuff arm that's why i titled it in the video so the buddha tahoe OG pre 98 bubba and the plush barrier my focal points in this girl my second areas will be the the granddaddy Purple's the confidential cheese and now the critical push which is right here doing amazing after 12 hours so looks like she's a keeper there all right so that's Hydra we got what a buddha tahoe OG buddha tahoe OG do a back row plus very plush very confident to cheese granddaddy purple granddaddy purple gdp gdp vetting purple confidence cheese plush grade + burying buddha tahoe buddha tahoe buddha tahoe blush berry Buddha tahoe 398 398 confidence of cheese granddaddy purple granddaddy purple buddha tahoe g as this pre 98 bubba a critical cush jackpot Royale which I'm probably going to take out and switch tied on the lady a strawberry pre 98 bubba and one more blue tahoe OG so that's everything in hydro six about 10 inches tall on the biggest ones and about five or six on the small ones and that's the video um 12 minutes long had a lot to explain lots of strains and ph is hanging in there 582 581 perfect right where I want it to be ah alright guys it's been about it in this little long last video but you taking a video every 10 days on this grill or so hope y'all enjoyed rate comment subscribe let me know what you think if you have any questions please please feel free to ask I will try to answer them as fast as possible for everyone who asks alright that's about it as I always say at the end of my videos peace out and always grow your own", "DGgLALjkyLs": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com here today with a quick west coast week 2 review featuring alpine vapor and their gmo times bp9 hybrid live resin cannabis oil it's a vape cartridge it's a one gram 1000 milligram vape cartridge and my oh my i'm excited to try this i vape live resin every day i dab live resin about every other day and this is a limited edition run um from from alpine one of california's premier cannabis uh extraction companies and so i'm going to read a little bit about the packaging and kind of share some information i've got a battery here um we're going to dive right in so it says here our limited edition cartridges are craft candidates at its finest they're made using only pure live resin from sun grown cannabis these small batch releases are true to the natural aroma of the plant and are an exploration and taste outside the norm instructions you our cartridges are designed for use with 510 batteries inhale for two to four seconds for maximum flavor use at the lowest voltage setting on your alpine bakery now unfortunately on a previous review video i did use the battery at the lowest setting and it wasn't powerful enough to really really give the car what i would consider as the best representation of itself so i'm going to honestly move it up one twist on the voltage here for the battery so that way i can get slightly slightly warmer than the lowest temperature to make this really rip in terms of the gmo times the bp9 i do have a little bit of information it says gmo times banana punch number nine a true hybrid cut with cannabis cup lineage of purple punch banana og and gmo so this is going to be punchy og and gmo it says this cultivator yeah this cultivator is a great blend of sweet and sour with undertones of gas tropical fruit and curried spice that's a big claim so we're gonna see if i get that earthy spicy punchiness here we go how do i wanna i don't really wanna i don't really want to open it up from the top and ruin that beautiful stickers oh came right out there we go check it out all right so we've got we've got some terps in the jar here and the two i like it when it comes to the cartridge we've got a white ceramic and glass cart i love it we've got some nice chunky holes on the bottom right here that's where that pull is going to come through and be kind of sucking in the oil for lack of a better way to put it 510 thread brand new battery here literally brand new not even using the one that i used the other day this one is quite literally unopened all right beautiful packaging nice chunky battery here all right so one two three four five hits to turn it on branded it's on the lowest setting now i'll rip it just to show them that i just don't believe this battery is the right one at the lowest setting for this cartridge so i'm gonna do it it's not on too tight but it is sealed here we go chris you ready moment of truth absolutely nothing yet one two three four five try it again all right that's a five second rip right there kind of light in terms of the vapor and the flavor although it was there i didn't actually get enough of an inhale to really taste that much terps and so i'm going to go a seven second rip again on the lowest temperature try to give it another chance at 2.6 volts here we go all right so on that one a little bit more turks a little bit bigger cloud and what i'm really tasting is this light floral spice i'm getting a little bit of pine and a little bit of berry flavor the fact that i can get some actual good flavor on this lowest setting without a major cloud i think it's impressive um i am going to twist this over to let's call it one line two lines we're gonna go up to three volts here and we're going to see what that does maybe it maybe it burns it maybe it doesn't here we go it's definitely a different flavor and taste experience in terms of how it ends up in your mouth i feel like at a slightly higher temperature it gets a little bit more on the earthy spicy side comparatively to the light and floral so we've done three hits here i talked about that on the first hit you i gave it a second chance with the seven second uh blinker right there and then on this last one we turn it up to three volts three hits let's see what i'm thinking here for a score out of ten presentation appeal color taste potency i think this is really coming through and hitting nice um what i what i'd really like to see is some of the genetics information that's on you know the piece of paper need to make it on this i want to see the terpene profile i want to see some of that strain lineage and information it helps the consumer know what kind of high we're about to experience um in this box the presentation is very attractive i like i like the sticker i like the label i like the black and the shiny metallic i'm really attracted to this the color of the oil looks great um is this the best battery for this cartridge i don't believe so um the big my least favorite thing is the battery it doesn't match i don't think it powers this vape cartridge the right way um i've had better experiences with c cells classic just draw and pull on it um and so all things considered um would i recommend it yes more information there's solid information on here i'd like to know more about the genetics and the lineage and the terps um but with all that said i'm sitting here thinking this is an 8.75 it's a very solid high score i definitely believe that this is 100 sun grown flower cannabis you know pure live resin there's no distillate there's no popcorny experience to this no taste no that kind of flavor um but yeah the battery in my opinion is just really holding this experience back and so um we'll use this we'll use this battery again for the next review and i'm going to bring another battery on again to see if i get a better or different experience but for now let me know what you guys think 8.75 is my score big thank you to alpine vapor for working with this on the respect my region west coast we tour and don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel y'all i'll see you all down the road appreciate you guys peace",

sunday", "lWN6rBtSDoU": "[Music] hello friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy confusing place you call your local dispensary today we're going to take a look at a fairly confusing product um confusing in its origins not so much in its purpose uh it's a good old-fashioned 510 vape cartridge today uh so nothing too crazy there this is a 510 vape cartridge from hush cannabis concentrate it's about as basic packaging as i've ever seen for a legal um cartridge i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach uh haven dispensary in belmont shore uh and i think with taxes it was a little over thirty dollars so thirty one thirty two 32 something like that so really affordable uh quite cheap for a one gram cartridge uh and one that has a pretty high th c percent uh at 87.07 this larry og uh cartridge which is rocking pretty high especially again for that very cheap price point uh i am almost certain that it is just distillate in here maybe some added terpenes but this isn't live resin this is anything fancy this is uh easy strong quick to make manufacture cheap manufacturer distillate nothing wrong with distillate but all the extra cannabinoids and all that is uh foregone to get max thc percentage uh so as i said uh at the beginning confusing product i i sometimes sometimes like to do my due diligence and look up the companies i'm reviewing before time ahead of things to kind of get an idea of what they're all about and i don't really know where to find uh hush it's one of those confusing conglomerates uh weed conglomerates that you know um is run by large investor groups that have a billion different brand names uh and it's just hard to know uh who's responsible if this vape cartridge uh were to give you some popcorn lung not that that's going to be the case for legal cartridges ice it's got to be tested to be in a store um but uh this uh very austere packaging and cheap price point and very shady online uh presence doesn't instill you with a whole lot of confidence uh so what what's so strange about it well there is a hush canna website which has their logo on it and just a bunch of dead links and then like all those like shitty um old squarespace sites that you've seen it's just a bunch of dead links and uh abandoned pages like there's a testing link that doesn't actually go anywhere uh and even more distressing when you click some links on hush's place uh chrome pops up with a hey they're trying to steal some information with you uh from you warning so i don't know uh and then also on the packaging it does have another website uh halocanna.com which really has pretty much the same kind of sort of boilerplate text that hush does but it also seems slightly more professional but doesn't say the name hush anywhere it's very confusing uh and it all looks just a little bit shady uh but again uh you know it's lab tested it's good to go just thought i would fill you in on all the little bit of weirdness with hush so let's go ahead and stop yammering let's shut up and let's get to the product review here uh nice i actually do not knock it for the uh very restrained packaging we'll call it um i doesn't need a lot of materials it should be a very easy thing to make manufacture and not produce a lot of waste so no harm there just doesn't have a lot of information on it um okay well we've got a cheap plastic acrylic tip ah i've seen these cart designs before i'm pretty sure the all of the cheapest carts i've had have this exact very same design i wish i knew who was the manufacturer maybe it's pro canna uh cheap materials all around like shitty glue job there uh and then the oil itself uh let's be honest looks okay but not great um it's a little cloudy uh it's just not as pure of a it's not that beautiful piss yellow that you really want from a nice distillate but uh it's the proof is gonna be in the hits so let's give this larry og uh 87 thc from hush a shot not bad not bad draws are you can even kind of hear it whistling it's there's something a little bit misaligned there bigger hits than i would have thought but it's coming through just fine um not the the easiest draws in terms of uh you kind of have to pull a little bit but you do get big hits uh once you start pulling the oil itself um feels really potent uh it is 87 thc this does feel like a distillate um with some added terpenes it feels like it's got some like just very generic heavy indica type terpenes the piney sort of taste to it not bad um not bad at all uh it is better than i thought it was gonna be to be honest yeah it's fine um i mean there are definite compromises here being a cart at this price point uh everything is slightly compromised it's not the best quality oil it's not it's shitty materials and it's working fine uh cheap packaging and a sort of mystery origin uh of where it comes from but all in all it's for the price it is not bad it is dare i say even i would i would even give it a thumbs up at this price point with as strong as the soil is knowing all those caveats but guys um these cheap carts are the ones that are the most likely to uh have all kinds of issues that pop up uh after you use them a couple of times so i'm gonna review this whole hush larry og one gram it'll probably take me about five days or so to get through it uh and then i'll come back to you guys as soon as i do and we'll make sure that uh no additional compromises problems uh issues arise uh over these next uh couple of days that we're enjoying this and uh but for now it's a uh positive experience for hush again compromises but you uh are getting a pretty good deal so guys that's going to do it for this first half of this review stick tight i'll be right back here in just a bit give you those wrap-up thoughts [Music] welcome back to weeks guys it has been five days since i first started with hush and their one gram larry og cartridge is a little bit of oil left here uh and that's because i did have some serious trouble here at the end getting some draws i suspect that that might be a problem uh with these very cheap cartridge designs you tend to get a lot of clogging and resistance towards the end and that is certainly true with this one at this point it's way too much effort to sort of extract anything uh left in there and that's been true for the past day or so i'd say probably i don't know 20 or so of the product that is in here uh is going to be unless you use it all very very quickly and it doesn't have time to build up any of that sort of uh junk or deposit in there you're probably gonna have some troubles drawing from it it's not terrible uh and it is a very good uh price but uh with that cheap price are gonna come some compromises and one of those is that like you're just gonna keep drawing and drawing and drawing and not a lot is gonna happen let's see if we can sort of replicate that here with a little bit that's left so yeah it kind of took a really long draw to there to get that heating element engaged uh and then like some of these cartridge designs here at the end when you're mixing so much air in uh with not a lot of um oil you tend to get that hot burning thing and that is the case here as well all together i'm gonna give it a pretty decent review it's not um it does have its flaws but at the price point um you are willing to forgive some of those flaws uh it is not a cartridge that i'm gonna come back to personally uh it's just a little bit too much of a headache for me but if you are on a big budget and you want a cartridge that's gonna be a decent oil uh pretty potent and it's gonna get the job mostly done and you don't have a lot of money you might want to look at hush but for us it's gonna be um you know there are better things out there but uh again it's not a total total thumbs downer just a bit of a mixed bag and with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on weeps that's going to do it for our hush larry og review i appreciate anybody making it here to the very very end and as always stay high but more importantly stay healthy we'll see if our next review goodbye", "ArWJTZgPOss": "let's grow new mexico wanted to bring you a real quick flower update here we have the closest to being finished which is the ghost train haze it's not a good color to it I know the canopy could be better but it's still pretty pretty decent it's way too far away zoom in on my visa one year the buds look pretty good but the formation and so on and so forth overall the plant as a whole is a hot mess but should provide some pretty good meds didn't quite fill in the hole 4 by 4 space I had it in a two-by-four space and then I stretched it out and unfortunately it it didn't fill out like I had wanted it to however the next one in line I did take some time to go ahead and get the canopy right and this is the sour diesel and it starts about right here and it's this 4 by 4 quadrant under a 1000 watt HPS with a raptor hood air-cooled insulated ducting and then here we had a catastrophe I had a critical that was scrog doubt under the four-by-four it's a piece of it coming off of here that's getting pretty big it's going through it stretch it's trying to push the you know tops that are all spread out through the canopy here this i'll probably just tie down to hear what not but that's the critical I think it's probably critical plus i got it from the dispensary and they just called it critical and then in oh what happened is I had a catastrophe I had it under a four by four but I a in super cropping I took the pliers and just crush the hell out of the stem let's see if we can get down take a look yeah there was I get out the way [ __ ] and this whole terminal branch it was like a quarter of the damn plant it it got broken off and all the pieces just died I tried to save it real quick but I didn't it's almost done with this stretch so it's time to lollipop that one the other two have been lollipops really well ghost train haze and sour diesel both are in 10 gallon smart pots with ocean forest play that route webs crazy right looking good man I'm pretty impressed with the ghost train haze but the flower time is just a little too much for me so I didn't take any cuts or anything got some really special surprises on the channel haven't done a veg update in a really long time but I recently got some new genetics that I'm pretty excited about so all my old stuff is being phased out and going to run all new stuff so what I did is I just took the plant and readjusted it to half of the four by four so it's in a two by four space and then I put another plant in in this two by four space and this plant consists of buddha tahoe OG and those are my four plants we got buddha tahoe OG we got critical Sour Diesel and ghost train please see if we can see like look at this bud [ __ ] is [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] deve and get something like this can't touch the phone while i'm [ __ ] holding it to make it focus let's see camera game [ __ ] get you a good bud here we go that's the go straight A's it almost looks ready but I just did a I just did a [ __ ] a spray and I don't know you know anytime you [ __ ] spray all the [ __ ] pistols get burnt off I spray with the lights off and everything but it seems to not matter it still [ __ ] up so what the [ __ ] is that it's weird it looks weird on the camera but looks fine in real life it's crazy yeah and to be honest with you with buds like this I'm not even really too impressed with the ghost train haze it grew really well in veg and shadeland this is looking like it's already done and the buds are [ __ ] nothing so I'm just going to give it a little while longer and [ __ ] in we'll see where it goes i'll keep you guys updated hopefully we'll be able to have some really good ghost train hayes really soon lay it all over the place all right she'll

instagram is already live so if you guys are not following it go follow it everything is going to be down in the description for you guys hey until next time peace", "7m53NS7xYRo": "they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n in gradients as you probably already know youtube has very strict community guidelines so if you're not 18 please [ __ ] off of my video thank you let's have a nice day what is going on guys tony robb here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video we're up in my car and we're about to review the wiz khalifa og by pure1 and just thinking about it i could have done this in my room because like vape cartridges don't smell that much but before i start this video i just want to give you guys a little disclaimer to watch out for fake cartridges when i looked up the pure one wiz khalifa og i had seen that there's a lot of people out there that had been scammed with fake cartridges so when buying a [ __ ] cartridge buy it from a reputable source and just don't buy it from somebody who's super [ __ ] shady so please watch out and with that out of the way if you guys want to see more vape cartridge videos drop a like hit that subscribe button check out all my social media links are in the description down below and without further ado let's get this video started whoop all right guys we got the pure one wiz khalifa oh g over here which is a indica strain i got 1 000 milligrams which is equivalent to 1 grams of concentrate and i bought this from a reputable source so i don't want you guys saying in the comments down below that this is a fake cartridge and just looking at the packaging the package is very beautiful you know with that gold tint on the side um with the warning label on the back which i will be reading for you guys on the back of this package it says wiz khalifa og the best hitting ceramic cartridge disposable cartridge 1 000 milligrams it says ingredients and i just want to [ __ ] point out which kind of scares me you know because i just said that this isn't a fake card they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n ingredients whatever in the ingredients it says cannabis oil natural terpenes all right instructions for use screw the cartridge onto the battery to ensure the best vaping we strongly recommend the pure one battery blah blah blah that's just advertising obviously for the brand inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat they're not saying how many times you should inhale and exhale repeat but i'm assuming like three to four times should get you gently or modestly baked um if you want to take it to a whole other level obviously you're gonna spam the [ __ ] cartridge up until you can't feel your brain but i would not necessarily recommend that as a natural product the color of the oil may have a slight variation without sacrificing quality prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat will cause the cartridge to leak now the government warning this product contains cannabis a schedule one controlled substance which is not the case in canada because it is 100 percent legal keep out of reach of children and animals cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient the intoxicating effects of cannabis products may be delayed up to two hours i have never taken a cartridge where the delay is two hours it is generally like two minutes right like very rarely no actually it is i think impossible to smoke a joint or hit a cart and the effects hit you in two hours it's not inedible right cannabis use while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful consumption of cannabis products impairs your ability to drive and operate machinery please use extreme caution and then there's the final warning which is not the government warning this product can expose you to chemicals including pulagon which is known in the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm for more information go to www.whatever blah blah blah blah and then you have like the purevape website and purevape instagram with that out of the way we're gonna open up the box over here and i don't want to destroy it right because it is a very beautiful box so i'm just assuming you either push it up ah yeah wow a beautiful push feature wow and i could keep this because this is actually a beautiful packaging so i'm gonna put that on the side and now we got the pure vape cartridge wow the color of it looks amazing like it's not too clear right but it's not too brown it's a right in between color we got one full gram but we got it over here and this is what it looks like it is kind of transparent if you put it up in the sunlight honestly and the color isn't too dark right it's not the darkest i've seen but it's not the lightest color and it is obviously not the same color as the packaging as they said on the back the color may be different blah blah blah blah blah we got the vape cartridge turned on now and i will be putting it oh i turned it off oh [ __ ] i will be putting it on the lowest setting and going to medium and then going to high and i will be telling you guys like what best setting to hit it because there's different types of vape cartridges where if you hit it on a high setting it just burns completely the car other vape cartridges if you hit it on the low setting it just does not hit and sometimes you know the middle setting just doesn't work so you got to try it out all right i'm on the blue setting which is the lowest setting and we're just going to follow the instructions that are on the package so for best use inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat so like i was saying i'm gonna inhale for three seconds exhale repeat three times for each temperature setting and then i'll be able to judge which setting is the best and tell you guys if it actually tastes good and then finally i'll take [ __ ] blinker because i know everybody wants me to take [ __ ] blinkers right but now the moment that you guys have been waiting for let's take the first three second puff so let's get it guys cheers what the [ __ ] [Music] why did that taste like dry pasta that wasn't the taste i was expecting what the [ __ ] like it literally caught me by surprise bro like i was expecting some sort of like stronger taste because it is like an indica and i was expecting like something you know a little fruity because like you know wiz khalifa og kind of a tropical fruity taste you know but no it tastes like dried [ __ ] pasta but i'll be taking another puff because like i said we're gonna repeat three times on each temperature setting so without further ado let's get it cheers guys okay on that second puff a little bit more fruity maybe needed a little bit time to you know heat up and activate um there's not much of that like you know tingling sense in the back of your ears and like inside of your eyeballs when you're hitting a cart there's not much of that to be honest with that second puff there's like a mix of like dried pasta and like fruity taste so i'll be taking the third and final puff on the lowest temperature setting so cheers guys well i'm just gonna be 100 honest after three rounds on the low temperature it did start to kick for me right i feel as if this was like a productive type of indica buzz because it's not really a body buzz it's not gonna like slouch you it's not gonna get you tired it's kind of like one of those productive ass buzzes in my opinion that's how it's feeling right but we will keep going up with the temperatures but we're on the [ __ ] red setting so that's the medium setting so let's see what the medium heat see if this shit's gonna start smacking and yeah let's get it guys cheers nice three second hit and wow okay the taste is way smoother so with a low temperature low setting it tastes like [ __ ] dry pasta with this it's just a fruity taste to it honestly it's maybe because the combustion is a little quicker but yeah i'm going to take the second puff on this one because it was super not harsh so cheers guys [Music] them three second puffs are very blessed [Music] overall this [ __ ] started to hit man you know the indica feeling is starting to creep up slowly maturely upon me right and i did get a full night of sleep so i'm not tired in that sense alright we will take the third and final puff of the medium setting let's get it guys cheers got that one all right so just overall the key difference with the medium setting is that the hit is a little smoother and it tastes a lot less like [ __ ] ala dente spaghetti you know what i mean so we're going to be moving on to the final heating temperature with the which is the highest temperature of the battery so we're going to be taking the three puffs off of this if there's a key difference or there's something to add i'll add it or else it's gonna be like some sort of i don't know three puff montage or whatever but let's get it guys cheers okay yeah i do have something to add with the high temp you can really taste the full amount the full flavor you know what i mean which is pretty sick so medium and high is better for for this strain there's like i said some other strains they prefer i guess low temperature to hit better but with the wuz khalifa og is tasting pretty pretty good so we'll take the second puff cheers guys nothing to add on that second puff so we'll go directly to the third one cheers just overall nine puffs in it really fries you like nine puffs in i was expecting to be a little slumped like a little you know all right guys this is future robin and i'm currently doing the outro because i just checked my computer checked the gopro and i just cannot find the rest of the video like for some reason it's just completely deleted maybe it got corrupted i don't know but i will be taking the blinker because obviously i promised you guys a blinker so i'm not gonna beat around the bush too much cheers guys alright this is like post post editing rob and i just gotta say that like i did hit a blinker i tried my absolute best to put my finger in a certain type of way where the camera would capture the actual blinking but like my dumbass kept my finger in front of the light so it did not appear in the video so you guys gotta take my word for it that i actually did hit a blinker and like i wouldn't be coughing uncontrollably and not being able to hold on the hit if i didn't take a blinker trust me on that take my word for it this is like post post editing rob i'm like on some omnipresent [ __ ] yeah okay i think i'm gonna leave now but god damn like i was saying the strain is very very like uplifting and it's not like a super indica for some reason like this train doesn't get you couch locked it doesn't give you that natural indica feeling it really uplifts you and it kind of gives you a boost of energy like i just took a blinker and i'm feeling up and at it right and i've been awake for like five six hours but besides the fact that the word ingredients is misspelled i really didn't join this cart and i do hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like please and hit that subscribe button if you haven't already check out all my social media

blue dreams out there red cups put them in half a gallons kind of separated who i thought was gonna be females by the signs they were showing me this is one of them so this is blue dream number seven did some high stress training on it she already showed signs that she's curving back towards the light this one right here is blue dream number four so i triple top this so she a little stocky triple top what i mean see the one two three these are side shoes that grew up so it's number four this one is number three i should train that she's already bending towards the light already so this time i in the soil when i transplanted them i used some micros and oculus um i put some extra perlite and a happy frog this one right here i attempted to hst it i stress train it but it broke it just snapped it was it was devastating but you see that hole in the stem that's a calcium deficiency so everything happens for a reason now i know i gotta ramp up for my calcium uptake with the ladies um i'm using an extra for the gods so the antidote for that situation demetrius destiny it's liquid calcium baby got some fire straight in here too so i'm gonna hit them with this that's why i look a little droopy before i transplanted them the soil was moist so i didn't water them in oh i got one more up here this is number seven she's thirsty but i had the hot shoes trained her but it's not looking good i don't know see after i water her this is a og kush it's a recent clone that i got it's going to be in the greenhouse run and take clones off of it of course this is a daryl jones flow anybody calling

show me anything yet stress train them anyway got faith it might be a female it's another one kind of overdid it with this one that's because of the lack of calcium it's not building that cell structure in the clone dome we got clones from sour diesel b one side with these would be was flowering she was just like real limp like you know popcorn bugs when i dried it smoked some it was more dank than sour diesel a i got them from the same bag so now cloning this out these would be because the clone i took out of it was when she was in flower she went through a revenge this is her coming

potential these girls are 24 25 days old so they're in the third week let me see if she can see she got a little trite build up coming up not as much as the sour diesel hey all right back there that's the tahoe oh gee from seed it's tower number one planted ten of them only two germinated i was a female one was a male the male i killed him but i kept one of his clones i might just want some tahoe og pollen i know this one we're looking at is a sativa i ran her last last run my first cycle someone that tastes like citrus like tape orange lime citrus dead ahead this is hold on one second this is oh this is the same sativa this is her clone but this is a clone from the first mother that i got when the mother was in flower so she had to go through a revenge process it took about five weeks for her to get through that then about four weeks a flower of veggie and time and then i threw her in the flower but she's looking good this is all one plant so shout out to the social grow network i'm showing you guys what's going on it's one of the claw things i was talking about look like upside down taco on my early growth on some of them just another plant i got that i put my lights up um flushed them out so hopefully that'll remedy them and i just start my feeding again sour diesel b this is bumblebee she's two weeks ahead of everybody all right youtube captain crunch blueberry that's what it smells like striking i put it in here to sex so she ahead of everybody so i know how her mother gonna look real frosty humidity a little low gotta get my humidity oh that's good gotta get my humidifier going 1000 watt dimmable ballast set at 600. inline duck fan fan just pitching me smoking this about this", "R8mx6POvAMc": "all right guys so as you can see I planted them all about I'd say about an inch and as you guys can tell they all did pop I was wrong so they all did pop they all do you have hotel so six hours six perfect germination rate and all I did was put them in a little capsule guys with RO water nothing else I did not have to do anything else but that and perfect germination rate great seats great dark looking seeds as you guys can tell they're really nice really nice seeds guys so I think we're gonna have some really good stuff the smokiness is the mother is a very good yield err it's a very sativa like /the LA Confidential looked a bit sativa too but had an awesome smell to it so can't wait see boy made girl", "qQzVOg1exis": "insanity sherbert life", "g6hAu6I9PqQ": "what's up you tube it's your boy t-top second day karen i'm burping them right now just

"future what's going on I'm gonna give you guys some night shots these plants come down tomorrow you where the dogs are living line everything smaller we're on ours it's hard to do [ __ ] with these these camera balls somebody's dog sir really really large they're falling every word about the double screen everything next time set up a lower net here and then hollering it top so the bugs don't lean on each other start falling over shouldn't be too bad to trim which these are pretty easy when it comes to that here's the SoCal Master Kush this one just fallen operator work sir I just gotta test their plant through in there these are all that subbies ones that I showed you before and these lots of around these tables very classic og knows the ones that have smelted before you know what I'm talking about this whole section just busted past the net really nice and for us to do great Calix production super stinky the GDP Kennish this GDP not so huge on this thing super dent quality she won't grow nowheres near this big and soil there's another one earlier here a lot of guys grow the strain in soil and little tiny notes the rock world GDP doesn't look like the same strength then the serious the Blue Dream it's gonna have one of these inside the room nice achieve a smooth and the GDP is a monster I'm not really wanted and none of these strains we wanted so kill anymore unless you once you're growing on geez that's pretty much it some more sfv nothing they're not wanted they're just it's not worth it for the for the grower to to grow these strains between power and chores and just everything else it's just not worth it at the end there's don't like how Harry she stayed the whole time she's not as solid as this years just string her up like crazy all these garden ties everywhere she was a mess she's a really really big yield or so see I just don't think we were a higher scale than me the platinum and the others this is all smb2 a small table Australia's extremely fun to grow you really gotta have a room that has controlled there at all time I can't grow this you know your battle ants have a heat issues or you don't have air conditioning that can you get any of that on this room's got to be completely in line there's still room for improvement here as far as mass mastering the magnesium levels of their strength you got it no Allen it just right these ones I grew a little bit bigger I'm gonna tag all the ones on these two tables see if they yield more than the other ones that a flowered shorter everybody seems to draw their own juice pretty small seems like the less heads you end up with you know if you go between four and six heads you'll end up with way like huge no just like baseball sized dogs the more dogs the plant has more it's gotta feed so you end up with smaller dogs and you draw them bigger so cows are so picky that uh we really got a have everything dialed in if you want to survive when it comes to growing out here it's not wrong for our over here everything's flushed out real nice and that the smaller large at the bottom here not too bad with the again you can see the trichome development and good straight legs are pulled too so I said nice I keep my nice 72 73 degrees you know towards the end I I drop it down to around 70 and that's what the running co2 what everything seems like if you you know up the up the temperature even with the co2 the way the they say the plants were supposed to work with absorbing the co2 the stomata opens up at a certain temperature not this straight the other strain yes G nope alright guys only what everything looks like before comes down enjoy any comments or anything leaving the box though", "B02lfzQV_ds": "hey how's everybody doing at our Sheila here having game at you guys with a video in a while got a lot of things going on why don't you give you guys a shot of the garden I know the pitch kind of little messed up my lights are so high man these things just they went outrageous give you guys kind of an idea let's see I'm I mean everything is getting out of control tahoe here the other tiles came down everything looking great shot to the dope cub saturday night had a great time went over Brett sunday morning shot a video just everything's looking good in here ma'am sorry just haven't been able to get you guys all these updates on these groves I'm really not a person that likes to do the perpetual garden but it seems like that's what's been going on since I got in here I'm really trying to get it down and doing everything at the same time but I'm trying to finish off the dough cheese that the tahoe geez that i got from cali connected Bret maverick kicked on for me so we basically took cuttings and started and started flowering them to see what they're going to do and i didn't get a chance to flip them for a minute so they were like three feet before i flip them and this is what we look so let me go through here and tell you what we got right here this is the tahoe phenome number fino number five which is really good nice like it's got that it's got a little bit of the few lee smell to it a little bit more of a fruity smell got to go through here and tie step pull off some dead leaves to the left of her we got a purple arrow that I kind of just was it was too big for the bed Jerry and I really didn't want to repot it so I just doing the flower she's looking good right here we got a cincy star living a little thirsty she's nice good at same thing with her as she was in the flower room for too long and I just couldn't really do anything with it with her soft holder in here just popped into flour right here we're looking at a purple arrow non top just let it go looking good already getting Shrike doubt looking really nice and then over here we got the rascal OG first time growing it out never done it before I got to get a different light here for you guys I can't I don't like these lights anymores to yellow but yeah this is a really nice plant took a lot of cuttings off it this was the mom that i had so i was just gonna go flower out and see what she does it's supposed to be the high CBD enriched one here we've got another another tile this is let's see me know number six same same structure same smell a little bit more fuel in this one really nice plan overall feeding or 25 mils of flores 15 a design are no two of his on because i'm in flower 10 to the can design 15 of the boost to girls girls getting big she started breaking branches everything is looking great and I think Brett may have got a Larry makes that cuz man this [ __ ] right here man this right here oh this is fire I cannot wait to smoke this it is so [ __ ] this smells like a sour freakin diesel I don't know what what it is but i'm thinking maybe brett may have he was thinking maybe he got a Larry mixed up with it so I'm gonna have to flower some Larry's out to see cuz man this is the one I want but it's labeled as a tahoe number tile number two you know bread he's pretty good with labeling stuff so but just look at that I mean this is the mud at the bottom has been hanging and is rock hard just covered in trikes and just has the greatest fuelly smell to it and then here I'm really excited because it's the first time we've ever done it but we've got this can of tonic here really good producer on me out look at the look at this thing I came to get the camera back far enough to get the whole thing in the shot it's probably a good four feet wide and you see i'm only running the three lights me and i need to spread them out i got them too close together but I just haven't had time to do anything so I'm going to get all that worked out this week but I mean this can of tonic crazy I'll be doing this again then we got a purple arrow there right there in the middle I said apologize again for the light and then here we go got the last I ho and this one was the number five I think already shows your guns which is looking great crazy nice and hard nuts but you can tell that all those ones are the same and then I took number one and number four down number one was purple and number four just has a dank smell and just looks really no doubt and nice so yeah my just want to give you guys a little look at the garden see what I'm doing running these hurt pots you ever run it again don't like them they all right but I just like my numbers hands better something on a rock in but yeah i'll be trying to bring you guys some more updates gonna get this warehouse off situated away may y'all have a good day take it easy man I had a happy good for 20 doke up was sick I'll let y'all later Lonnie", "avlYCguphSQ": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or I don't show you my personal information all right yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you um I have another court review for you guys in this video I'm actually doing a kind live resin again if you guys see my like last review I did a Arnold Palmer this is [ __ ] fire I haven't really smoked on the car too much besides for when I did the review because I'm trying I'm if you got yeah if you guys didn't know I'm going to ET see you in like two weeks like what is it May 17th so Loki trying to save this car gonna feel others for you wanna go easy because this car is like I said in that review it taste so far like it actually tastes like Arnold Palmer like it actually tastes like [ __ ] you're smoking lemonade and iced tea like I don't know it's [ __ ] fire but um this video we're gonna be reviewing true Oh G and this brand I mean not this brand um this flavour or strain or whatever you really want to call it I know it's kind of been I don't know if you want to say it's there one of the classics or originals or whatever but I know it's been around for like a really really long time like I seem like a YouTube video somewhere I forget the dudes Shanno or I would shout him out but um it was posted like literally four years ago and he was a reviewing kind live resin and it was true oh gee so yes that's just like a little proof that the true og flavor has been around for a while but I don't know this is my review so I'm gonna give you my thoughts opinions my honest review everything I had to say about it the Arnold Palmer one was a hybrid I think that was like I said sativa dominant hybrid if I'm correct and then the true oh geez I got heavy indica up here and the guy so just looking at the two parts they can look at the two you can already see you can see huge color difference that Arnold Palmer it's like a lot more like clear a lot more [ __ ] yeah a little gold you know what I mean the true OG is like that darker I don't want to say Brown but like like dark gold I don't know this I know it's throw some fire whatever this lit because I don't know I've known about this brand forever so I know it's a fire this lit the only thing that I don't like about them well I don't know I mean they're a little pricey they're like what 62 bucks for the four grand quarter there's like this brand right here I have some of review out on these like if you wanna go check them out too these are [ __ ] stupid fires but there's $70 for the full Graham Carter so these are a little bit cheaper than these but these are definitely more fire in my opinion there was a those are stupid fire but 70 bucks for a gram I can't really justify buying that you know what I mean the only reason I even bought these was because there was a buy one get one for a book I'd rather because I can get two grams of like actual concentrate like shatter for the price of one of the years you know and I'd rather have like actual wax but I don't know these are just good for like when you're going to raves like concerts or you know what I mean it's not like oh nice but yes you know you see the color difference but if you want to see review on the Arnold Palmer one go check that video out but like I said with the one true orgy in this video so let's just go over the packaging a little bit I can't waste too much time on it kind libraries and Ruo Jie yeah pretty basic the side of it says organic blah blah blah and then kind that's new ritual every video I have to [ __ ] drop something but it's you guys but if you guys have been watching my reviews dude I don't know why but I [ __ ] drop my cards and have you [ __ ] video for some reason but if you guys want to do some more research from the brand its kind concentrate song right there so check them out then it has like that Arizona warning on the side apartment of services coming back I don't mean just all that [ __ ] it has to say to cover their ass and that was it see another sticker right here oh it says uh natural sources supposedly they marketed as natural and organic so that's pretty far I don't know how true that is says solvent free natural and organic right there in the bottom two I don't know one of the one of the cons like that like if you wanted to make like a pros and cons list about these cards I mean I guess it's not really too big of a deal but as long as it's a thousand milligrams you know what I mean but I always loved it one like like I said on this large carts it says the THC percentage on the bottom I always love that these um Clank these cards the kind I don't at least from what I'm seeing I don't see any percentages it doesn't say what it's what it's tested at I mean as long as it's a thousand milligrams I guess it really doesn't matter you know what I mean so also what I not just noticed too briefly real quick I'm gonna get this out of the way and I'm we're gonna open this card of this Arnold Palmer one where's a harvested on for eleven nineteen so this is like some fresh or all right here this is brand new this one right here is harvested on eleven twenty eighteen so it's a little bit older a couple more months old I don't really think that has anything to do with the quality of it but I mean that's just pretty cool know when I got a fresh card you know I mean yeah besides for that let's just hop into the rest of this video so let's open this up oh gee off the top then it comes in these little plastic things not the nose in the box that's weird so when you take it out of the box that's you're greeted with you get this nice nice looking cart also another thing that I really like about these cards I mean I know a lot of cards have them so it's not only just this car like a lot like a lot of different brands do it well I mean I don't know I guess it's just all personal preference and also kind of depends on the battery you have but they're gonna say like the white accidents that use just because like when I put it on them this guy pin that I have just like blue one white I don't know it just looks so sick you know what I mean but um here's the quality the oil real quick so you guys could see the clarity of it in color let me find the bubble so there's the bubbler that you can see the consistency of it right there so it looks pretty thick it looks like it's barely even moving um if you guys haven't seen my past reviews I always say tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of the oil to lucas's even though this is my review and you guys are watching my review I'm like really really interested to know what you guys think of it too so make sure you tell me don't blow me comments what you guys think of it oh I think the other one was a little bit like the Arnold Palmer was a little bit thicker than this one is this one it's actually like moving up slowly the Arnold Palmer one was barely even moving but this is actually slighted input I don't know it's still really big oil that's a really good sign this is what it looks like on the pen it's a pretty big pin though I mean like so yeah this is a pretty big pin that's like the only downside of it like especially when you have a four grand card on it it's like good like I don't know six inches maybe you don't [ __ ] know how big that is but um here's the quality of the oil one more time for you guys stupid clear like you see just a little dark that's literally like the only thing I could say about it but besides I mean like the color that the color has to do a lot of things you know what I mean it could do with the strain a weed they like the strain they used to make though or or it could do it there's so many possibilities unlike what could affect the actual color the distillate you know what I mean so don't really like just use that to judge the so yeah if you guys like to know just don't use that that's like your main source of like judging a car just like the color of it you know what I mean because there's so many different like things that could like affect that like so many different variables I could affect the color you know what I mean so so we got the trilogy no I don't know that is a little upsetting that doesn't have the THC percentage on it to be honest so but anybody from kind is watching this I mean I should say a little detail that I'll really cut like a lot more if you guys add it on your packages but like I said it's not too big of a deal but let's just turn this on and get our first couple hits I'm gonna preheat the battery up a little bit get it ready for us to hit it let me just uh voltage so I have it on like a pretty low temperature like just a little like 2 2 point 7 volts so pretty low so you guys are smoked if I didn't mention it I should have added it into the beginning of this video but if I didn't don't watch this video that's for 18 21 or whatever little you were ages Smokey's in the area or you have your medical marijuana card like I do oh yeah I just have to say that [ __ ] to cover my ass but you should hop back into this if you guys are smoking along with me Cheers um and yeah just get into this true OG client library and choose I definitely add that og wish taste oh yeah all right of it even though I'm not I'm not too old I'm not like a og I'm saying not how old I had a nuttin but I've been smoking for a minute um I haven't had a G cush for a minute so I don't know you don't really see too much like real OG Kush now anymore like in the area that I live there's so much like exotic [ __ ] and like I don't know I just feel like that's a new wave it's like exotic strains and that means you know you don't really see too much of the classic like Oh green crack like [ __ ] ogee curve like you know all the og [ __ ] you know what I'm saying you'd only see that too often no more you just see a lot of the exotic stuff so it's pretty like I'm nostalgic to say the least like the hidden some og [ __ ] like that it actually tastes like some fire oh gee it's some real live resin too which is really really like another nice thing about the car and just like the static of it like especially on this pen I mean you can put it even on like the average loss is my evo labs pan this is like a also one of my favorite pens I love this pin so much even on this pin like this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] badass like just black and white you know and this pen actually has on three temperature settings it has a low medium and hot so we're good I have it on the low temperature right now so I guess let's just move this we're gonna heat it up yeah it's preheating for me right now [Music] tastes Oh fire yeah the taste gets a five out of five right off the bat the way it smokes you see I'm barely ripping it I'm blowing clouds it gets a five out of five for the way he smokes it [ __ ] rips my smoked a little bit before I made this video but I'm definitely [ __ ] like I wanna hit this what two or three times so far I mean I'm already higher than I was when I started this video so yeah I mean it's definitely some [ __ ] hope we're not [ __ ] you know what I mean um so these carts should definitely fire but the price of them is they're cheap within the select parts that's a good thing but there's still a little pricey if they were about like 55 bucks I think that'd be a better price point but 62 was a little bit expensive in my opinion for a ground you guys ever tried on time live resin time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think of it and um I don't know if you guys are liking these like um Medical Marijuana reviews or like we train our views or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call these and you have any other recommendations or constructive criticism or anything like that you guys want to tell me time we don't blow in the comments read every single comment I try to reply to every comment I can or at least majority of them or at least like favorite them or you know let me do something I'm always trying to show as much love back to you guys as you guys showed to me because it's like honestly like without you guys that wouldn't really be [ __ ] I mean I'm not really the biggest youtuber right now but still without you guys I wouldn't be nothing you know I mean but so if you guys ever hit me put my Instagram you guys see I always hit you guys back and show as much love as I can so I mean yeah I really do appreciate you guys showing all the love and support you guys do like it honestly doesn't go like for like unseen like I really do appreciate it I'm not making that up but if you guys like really like these videos um the card reviews aren't stuff like that time we don't blow in the comments I've just been like [ __ ] so insanely busy it's been crazy working 40 hours a week trying to do this YouTube stuff keep my Instagram pages active like if you didn't know I have a page where I resell some FTP clothes in the street like that and there's some other stuff so I have so much [ __ ] I'm trying to work on at once while I'm doing [ __ ] 40 hours a week at work and then I figure I said I didn't know I got a [ __ ] DUI for medical marijuana so I got a I'm on probation for that so I'm doing dealing with a bunch of [ __ ] but uh so I'm just [ __ ] insanely busy right now but these videos are just kind of easy for me to record and get out like kind of fast you know what I mean that's what I've been doing them but um we'll have more reaction videos out soon hopefully so if you guys want to see them and you have any requests for us then we don't blow in the comments but definitely this car is definitely fires [ __ ] if you ever um if you ever see a kind live resin in your area I recommend definitely picking them up definitely if they are and if they have a buy one get one free deal like they have when I got these definitely pick them up because it's a [ __ ] steal I don't see why you wouldn't um don't smoke none of those fake hearts going around that's for sure we're all square I'll give this like a four out of five I mean what I said I meant to say a 4.5 out of 5 so like half a point away from a perfect score just for the fact being that they're like a little pricey like I said if they were around like that fifty five dollar mark that'd be a lot more like I don't know I just think that'd be like a better price point for them I mean I don't know I mean the worth is 662 dollars you know what I'm saying but just me personally I don't like spending that much money on just one gram because like I said I can get two grams of should have it for that price but I think 55 bucks should make it a better deal and I think they'd probably sell a lot more cards than they do now if they lowered the price a little bit but yeah that's just my honest review so four point five out of five that's the overall score pace five out of five the way it smokes five out of five I pretty much everything gets a five out of five except for the price point the price point gets a four out of five so that's the only reason it gets like a four point five out of five and I like I said I still have a couple other cards I could review there's a lot of other like dope dispensaries around me there's actually like a kitchen where they make like edible hamburgers and [ __ ] like that pizza so I can make a video there if you guys want um just really anything you guys want me to do is help me down below in the comments but yeah these carts are stupid fired four point five out of five final reading I know I said that a bunch so I'm in the video here let me hit this one more time to see if I have anything I want to tell you guys before in the video and then we'll just ended off

just made me this piece right here gave me a whole gram of this stizzy um watermelon cherry pie wax all right brand spanking new i did not it's not open at all right it's a full gram right here so i was thinking man i haven't i haven't the next hour to to just sesh to myself so i was like i want to get pretty freaking baked so this is what i'm going to do all right so i'm going to use my dip device um e-rig by vape dynamics and what i'm going to do is i'm going to try try all right i'm going to try to smoke this whole gram in one sitting i don't know how long it's gonna take me i don't know if i'm gonna be able to even do it man i like i got lungs i got lungs but a whole gram by yourself is like a lot all right so i'm gonna go ahead and smoke try to smoke this whole gram by myself out of this e-rig right here and just sesh it out with you guys man just have a nice little session with you guys talk with you guys all that good stuff all right but before we get into the actual video if you guys can do me one big favor smash that like button on this video and also if you haven't already man hit that subscribe button alright guys we're so freaking close to 50k and i know we're gonna be able to hit it by the end of this month there's there's still not a doubt in my mind bro so if you haven't already hit that subscribe button just join the fam and hit that button alright guys so let's get this thing started cheers all right ladies and gentlemen so now that i got the camera set up on the tripod man let's just get straight into this man i don't even want to talk so three clicks goes ahead and turns this on one two three all right there you go and then um i am using the stock piece i kind of want to switch it out i'm not even too sure but this is a custom piece that goes on the dip devices um usually i always i like the stock piece on this one honestly it's it does a phenomenal job it has a lot of water in there you get a nice chuggy you know feedback but this piece in particular you get to put even more water in my opinion i think it's actually kind of similar it's actually very very similar this one's a little bit more narrow but i like this piece i like this combination just the purple going on and then um yeah man the overall like look of this the visual appeal is very very nice so let me go ahead and go show you guys the function very very nice feedback right there like i'm telling you guys all right so we're gonna go ahead and set that to the side and then bust into the wax real quick like i said brand new this is a full indica and the funny thing is that this um watermelon cherry pie this is actually one of my favorite curated um one of my favorite curated strains from stizzy so shout out to um the person who made this i think their instagram handle is blaze blades by or i'll go ahead and put that up on the screen so you guys can go ahead and give it a follow if you guys would like all right so brandon you guys heard that seal cracker right go ahead and boom and you got that right there take that off and then give you guys a little bit of a close-up all right so yeah man this is a full untouched gram of wax so shout out to blades by aurora for blessing today's video and i got the nice little um what do you even call this a little picker dab or whatever the case is so we're gonna go ahead and get ourselves a nice chunk i'm gonna be loading it up i'm not gonna lie with a humongous dab every single time now this bowl it's actually pretty big now i do not recommend doing this every single time honestly this is just something that i'm doing for the purpose of this video just so i could get some fat nice um so i could finish the wax kind of quick all right so my plan is to put like three to four fat scoops in there and hopefully it'll be done but let's go ahead and my favorite setting you guys already know it's the purple slash violet color but um we're gonna start off with something a little bit light which is the green setting right so go ahead and hold that and that's already gonna start warming up for you guys and um man i need to prepare my lungs i need to prepare my lungs right so the e-rig if you guys haven't watched my videos on this um you could vape flour out of this and concentrate and it's super budget-friendly all right guys one of my favorite e-rigs out on the market personally for the cost it beats the puffco pro in my opinion if you guys haven't watched that video where i compare the two i'll put that down in the description but this one the function is out of this world like it kills you it kills you so i'm kind of scared because like you get really really fat ribs alright so we're starting off small though on the green setting and i hope you guys are doing good man i'm doing good i'm ready to get baked i'm scared though because i've never really smoked a full gram by myself in one sitting so nonetheless it vibrated so cheers dude this thing gives off super amazing flavor too oh yeah two hits right there now this is the first hit off of this device right now so that's why i'm not really getting too much vapor production you really have to like use it like the first dab in any e-rig that is you're not going to get the fattest clouds you kind of have to warm up the bowl and once it's warm you're gonna start getting fat clouds oh yeah that's super smooth honestly man this might this might be a breeze who knows fat clouds the water filtration on this is actually super super nice now you don't get the biggest chugs out of this but honestly you get a really really decent like you know feedback from the water because there's there's rigs out there let me give you guys a little bit of example right this right here is a really really cheap one and i don't really like the function of this i don't really i think it's like that the feedback of the airflow is just like too too much open airflow let me give you guys a little example like there's so much water in here yet still i'm not getting enough of that that super chugginess that i like right so that all depends on the type of glass that you use honestly and let me give you guys another example so this one right here is a leisure piece that i just copped recently and let me give you guys um example on this chug this is what i love to see that is chug central man this is one of the with um one of my most favorite rigs just because of how much it chugs so let me go ahead and hit this with another reheat real quick because we can't there's there is a little bit of a puddle in there but i don't want to waste anything just for the purpose of this video we're going to try to you know maximize the wax man we're not going to be taking weenie dabs but um yeah man like i said back to the chugs this one has a very very nice chug me personally that's what i call it like you know the little airflow that comes back i call it chugginess because i don't know it feels like a chugging water you feel me so look cheers for an e-rig that's actually really really freaking good right so man this thing is smacking bro so i'm not getting any more flavor off of this it's just straight up smoke so i'm gonna go ahead and clean this up and then we're gonna go ahead and load up another dab so far so good man i haven't i've coughed a little bit but not enough to the point where i'm like all right i'm not gonna be able to do this this is possible but remember guys remember to always keep your water at hand or gatorade or something that's gonna keep you hydrated because when you're coughing when you're smoking it actually really does deplete your body um i'm not really too sure in what way but i there's been every single time that i feel like i smoke i feel like i i lose a little bit of energy you know so keep your water handy man that way you're always hydrated so going in on dab number two all right guys and i'm doing this all on camera so you guys don't think like oh he's not really putting all the full graham so the next one's gonna be kind of a stinky binky big ass one dude look at this one right here right this one's actually pretty freaking huge um it is gonna fit in the bowl i believe yeah it's gonna fit in the bowl perfectly so the only thing though is if you put this much wax inside of the bowl you got to make sure that you keep it leveled because if not it's definitely going to spill and you do not want hot oil spilling over all right so next up i'm going to go ahead and keep it on the purple setting because um i don't know man actually no the green setting was actually perfect the purple one was for the reheat but the green one honestly i was getting a very very nice terpy flavor from that one so we're gonna go ahead and do green alright guys so while that heats up though i just want to know man how is your guys's day going my day is going actually pretty freaking good i hope you guys have been enjoying the content lately man because i i've actually been putting in uh effort like you know i feel like there's there was a slump and you guys and i feel like everybody noticed that i'm not gonna lie i feel like i noticed i feel like my like if people around me notice that i feel like you guys as fans as supporters notice that and it's okay you know it's okay to have slumps but i feel like what is most important is how you pick yourself back up how you come back from that slump and um because that's really what defines who you are man how strong you are right so this is not this vibrated so cheers one like this is my favorite stream because you get a lot of that cherry pie flavor i don't know what it is but that cherry pie flavor that they have in this is just phenomenal man massive clouds bro but nothing but terpenes now if or even the white setting i would have been getting a lot of clouds but i wouldn't be getting that terps now the like in my opinion is the terps are a lot more important than the actual you know vapor production because the terps in my opinion are what gets you faded now don't get me wrong you do need a decent cloud to get you faded but with this device you get the perfect cloud but it gives it really really brings out the terps right and the green setting at least so i'm getting a little reheat on this because it ended a little bit too early i was doing a little bit too much talking so i'm gonna go ahead and hit this man i'm starting to get bait i'm not gonna lie i'm starting to get that head change um but we were already like six dabs in i'm actually pretty faded man but either way cheers oh yeah it's starting to taste a little bit burnt for me now no more you know it's like you know when it doesn't have any more terpenes because it's just straight up smoke it doesn't really taste that good i'm not gonna lie dude it started to get hot boxed in here and i was like dude i started like choking up bro so i went to go turn on the ac made sure there was airflow in this damn freaking house because i was about to [ __ ] pass out bro so cleaned it out dude and i must say i all right so this is this is no no bs all right so i've had this rake for over a month used it multiple times and the bowl is freaking pearly freaking white i don't know if you guys can see that i'm pretty sure i don't know try to take a look in there but it's pearly white man this thing has lasted me so freaking long and i've taken at least 50 dabs out of it so it definitely definitely holds it has durability so i'm freaking faded though that's all i can say right now it's all i can think about is how my throat was just getting graped right now bro so that was technically only the second dab in and um we still have so much freaking more man uh i kind of want i really really want to beat this to challenge so this is what your boy's gonna do you see that i'm gonna just clear this [ __ ] out right now man i should i should honestly just title this video easiest way to waste your wax all right like this isn't even i mean it technically is a challenge though because i am getting super super big like i honestly am on another level right now um i'm baked dude like literally my head is on like in the next realm i i'm just freaking high as heck right now and all i want to do is just like listen to some music and just chill out but i gotta finish this video out i honestly don't even want to take this last dab i'm not even gonna cap but it is what it is um i'm gonna go ahead and take it on the blue setting just so i could get a lot of that freaking terpene profile and i don't really want to cough man my throat is killing me right now like the last two dabs that i put in here i literally reheated them to the point where the the oil was like burnt so that that says it all those first two dabs were killer so it's time to really just minimize it and taste the terps out of this because it's kicking my butt it's kicking my butt alright guys so i'm going to go ahead and actually we're supposed to be hitting it on the freaking blue setting and all you have to do is just hold it like i said and it's going to go ahead and start heating up and i need to go grab some water i'll be right back boy is back in time it still hasn't vibrated but dude this thing all right hold on i need to give you guys a little bit of a close-up i usually don't like pulling out my phone and doing close-ups but the bubbling of the freaking oil is just beautiful bro so i'm going to go ahead and give you guys a little bit of a close-up for that so you guys can really see how it looks it's just so eye appealing it's just so beautiful the oil just burning up in there it's just phenomenal all right it's a it's a beauty it's a beauty to see so this thing is ready and cheers guys oh yeah that's it the blue setting is just super freaking smooth all the way through nothing but terps oh yes oh yeah baby this might be my new favorite setting you're getting a really really nice cloud but nothing but terps bro this is fire alright that i'm not even going to reheat this dude that that was enjoyable as heck i'm not gonna lie now we did it we actually did it it was actually not that hard and all right think about it this way the first two i really really freaking burnt the crap out of the oil like it literally started tasting like it was on fire and then but this one it was just straight up terpene profiles and i must say like judging the the different temperature settings on the dip device i feel like it really does its job bro because when i was using it like i said on the green to purple setting i was getting really really fat clouds and it was like i was getting terps but it was in maximized terps right and as soon as you level it down to green temperature which is supposed to obviously like the lower the temperature the more terps you're gonna taste i started tasting the heck out of those terps like phenomenal so honestly this still to this day is my favorite e-rig i must say so we did it boys we did it we finished a whole stizzy gram go ahead and show you guys that right here in one sitting it was pretty fun i'm not gonna lie i did i did cough a little bit here and there but it is what it is that's the name of the game right so i'm baked really freaking big like honestly like i'm i'm happy like i'm there there's nothing that makes me happier than being baked as heck so with that being said i'm gonna go ahead and shut this video out here i hope you guys enjoyed it as much as i did all right guys if you did do me a favor hit that

come out it was like I said this whole [ __ ] thing put a bitter taste in the [ __ ] mouth I mean I learned a lot I can't be mad at it but you know far as like [ __ ] on my resume or as you say [ __ ] yo grow record this is officially on my grow record so whatever see now this you see a [ __ ] line there that's about how big this [ __ ] things is they crystalline in a [ __ ] but production zero okay okay maybe not zero more like three maybe three maybe four four o'clock fine what I for four percent production as far as like mass and yield I give it 99.9 on the crystal they did a super job on chrysalis tagging but as far as then they could produce us some way I'm pretty shocked we'll pull out about a pound or so some hash out this [ __ ] got a hi laughs French chief from aficionado make

this [ __ ] redo everything up there get all that [ __ ] now I'm not saying that these are bad in there no no I'm just saying that that's what I'm really saying no it's not good for us what we're doing right here just because it does like I said ain't the products fault we got a swamp coolers blunt [ __ ] from outside that's coming directly in and you got an intake here that sucks it in over that so I got so much dirt on this [ __ ] I think I might just have to pull out [ __ ] I'll put a you see you in the didn't know we're talking about it I didn't think of bitter though I don't even lie and you know we gave it a little a little thing laying a solid run you know if you ain't if you can't afford the lights and electricity this will work you just got to clean your [ __ ] like once a

your mistakes and how you prevent that same [ __ ] from reoccurring again down the line cuz [ __ ] - it stings now Feliz Agra Vitas he wouldn't had that problem wonder why let me share with the [ __ ] fetus look like dude chick there a chick down down down think about things that they don't you think don't you think don't let them do that captain saving broke show yeah this is why I look see open no glass yeah big ass fam but when you get to looking at this [ __ ] you just like okay I see why you're doing this for the record on deck Barry jack is an official bin stacker of California and she's hella easy now just imagine right either a those two plans weren't there which are the cookies ripe and everything was the cherry diesel right or the cherry diesel weren't there and Girl Scout cookies are there that'd be a nice little bin stack over there and so what you're gonna have is that you gonna have an outside stack for your bin with some tasty in the middle I think it ain't trippin what you ready to go sees me right there got to tell me twice before I get up in that thing get a lot cutting me somebody [Applause] well girl getting the too intense for you huh well they did cut you down what turn out the lights and grow a bird welcome to that flowering time with your boy daddy Jean so yeah this [ __ ] fairy diesel is losing excuse me this berry Jack is losing its [ __ ] mind and the reason why I keep going back and forth from like berry Jack and berry diesel is I have a nice solid green house run of some very piece that I'm going to show you guys in a minute when I get my ass back down to Santa Rosa smash movies at I keep that [ __ ] all frosting up also I'm thinking about picking up an intern this year you'll have to pay your monthly bill as far as like I'll supply the room but you got to supply the board basically a bedroom your own bathroom but [ __ ] you got to pay your own electricity you gotta feed your own stuff you know I'm saying I keep you on the internet all that type of [ __ ] [ __ ] trash other than that you know be out here with you boy I felt I'll be fine look look you see that Lord Jesus and so yeah if you interested let me know a [ __ ] I'm not paying you no cash I'm not doing none of that [ __ ] I knew I was the percentages on some grows other than anything you need to come over here we know what you're doing so let's look at our cherry diesel remember we got Barry diesel this is cherry diesel and everybody thought that it was a Girl Scout cookie we even thought it was a pie face cut and all of us were wrong and luckily somebody has said hey man why'd I shake our red veins in the stop come here where you at [ __ ] let me see the stop there it is I was like I know that [ __ ] what do I know that strain from my back into some videos have seen this what we was running into town I was like I'll get the [ __ ] out here and that's what she's looking like she getting it she any solid just yet but now we see why we call her cherry diesel because she has that cherry color she didn't and I can't complain she stuck all up in there dog she's still got about three weeks on her because if you grab her right now she look nice and full and this is what you gonna learn matter of fact pull all the way out so even those even though those mugs look very big and they're filled out they're not solid yet this is where when you get to like touching on your bud and be like oh is this [ __ ] ready yeah you guys got whoo yeah she got some squishiness to her now she ain't ready yet if she rock hard and not and not just her you got a way to life that [ __ ] down here get rock hard cuz this top stuff is going what's gonna get hard first and this is when you go home rujuta home ready to go oh mama no no no relax this is where you go look into the camera system yeah this is where you go check all your locks and my other [ __ ] this is where you get all your [ __ ] together cuz this is one think about almost do it it looks nice and neat then when they get this [ __ ] to be like oh man because they're [ __ ] idiots so now let's go over here to the cookies I'm dreaming of some frosty cookies brought to you by 90 chu rocket don't stop it the frost is on the nerve is nug in this well then is white and having fun yeah look at that [ __ ] man [ __ ] going good so there you have it more than likely I'm gonna end up doing a critical jack and cupcake push or critical jack and lady cookies I don't know ain't nobody seen the lady cook you just might want to kind of get on that but then again I know I seen the cupcake then again I could just do this whole [ __ ] thing cupcake over here lady manok we'll just god damn it I don't know you [ __ ] got [ __ ] to do it's the weekend a lot of you [ __ ] get to participate in weekends and things like that I really don't so next show coming up I don't know I just want you guys to have a wonderful day enjoy your [ __ ] life love the one you wit love you [ __ ] himself don't

back again on another episode of The Daily session a YouTube channel for cannabis patients and adults man guys I'm so [ __ ] excited to show you guys this train this [ __ ] is straight fire if you watched my first video I actually dabbed on some of this and this is actually the nug that made that damn that I dabbed out in my first video but yeah VIPRE cookies for you though for those of you don't know what fiber cookies is it is a strain crossed between Viper City og and Girl Scout cookies made by moxie genetics this but specifically was grown by down river meds for patient station exclusively so if you want to get you some of this fire you're gonna have to go down to the patient station shout out to them real quick Viper cookies definitely a powerhouse strain THC levels are up to 28 percent so but alright guys enough of that let's get into a smell test for you real quick [Music] [Music] I smell very pungent very pungent very earthy as that Girl Scout cookies smell that I love very pungent like I said like you open in just everywhere you know you can't hide this smell it cannot know I've got to say so far that this is probably one of my favorite cookie hybrids this stuff is straight fire I loved the wax filing my favorite waxes around and if you ever see it guys I recommend picking it up but real quick guys I'm gonna pack my bowl up with some of this and I've got some close-ups that I hope you enjoy [Music] all right guys nice Bowl tag there [Music] so you can see from those nugs nice very frosty nugs they're very sticky loves the sticky icky yeah guys let's get a good taste test we've got wax her butt and hail it up Cheers [Music] Wow [Music] no you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] damn sit [Music] it'll lemonade Wow it tastes guys definitely has that nice OG taste very earthy sorry as I'm Dino [ __ ] some good stuff [Music] who already I feel that nice body relief I can tell you that this strain would definitely be a couch lock strain so if you're looking to be active stay away from this strain testing out 28% you know so it's very potent this would probably be another one of those that's good for insomnia so it's probably gonna be one of those where I take a nice bowl before I go to sleep and it puts me to sleep it's gonna either take guys it's very good [ __ ] [Music] [Music] also guys let me know what you're smoking on and I like to know so uh throw that down in the comments I was also gonna pick up some dab and I thought you over killed I have the butt and the dab but I'm gonna have it again soon because I love that wax but you know

thing in the morning I didn't prepare but uh yeah boxy stuff is always clean these Congolese dogs are clean it's nice heady sativa and just like a straight classic sativa similar to sour D but a little more energetic and not as mild as sour D Sardis always have a lot of crop Amin in it they're not the biggest handout but I do like sour D a lot but this congolese is closer to Lake Mary

really confusing on how to tell what the temperature was of the Bangor didn't feel like it was that hot to be honest I got my hand pretty close to it too and it seemed like I waited about 45 seconds

comments and [ __ ] and good good things you know it's [ __ ] depressing when I go on there and you know i have like xml any X amount of views I don't know how many it was it wasn't that many one thumbs up and like four thumbs down I can't remember the last time I've had four thumbs down you know and it's not like I was talking trash or doing anything in the video I'm come to find out when I played the video when I listen to it it sounds it's it you can hear a little girl and then the [ __ ] background of the video and it makes it sound like the little kid is like right there with us it's not the case that wasn't the case at all he lives in the two-story house he rents out the downstairs and he just doesn't have anything on his walls and it's a very big open area we were in his kitchen and like they were in the living room and it's just such an open area echoes and they went if they did come confront us or anything they would come to the doorway they wouldn't walk up to us or anything and when you hear that girl of the little girls voice in the video that was her walking up to the doorway and asking her daddy for a drink or something I forget what she wanted I think he was making her a sandwich for lunch while she watched her video but everyone's hating on the video because they're thinking that I'm were like dabbing and smoking and doing all this [ __ ] around the children that's not the case it's not the case at all so I just wanted to focus everyone's hate elsewhere and just make another video and just clarify that and make that make that knowing that we were not smoking around kids weren't dabbing with the [ __ ] sitting on our [ __ ] laps doing dabs it wasn't like that not at all you know if they come into the room if we if we were outside and they even come up to the door while we're outside and we're smoking you know we put the [ __ ] pipes down and [ __ ] we don't start smoking let them watch us do it we're not those type of [ __ ] people so you guys could all get that out of your head real quick everyone so quick to judge you know making these videos that was the last thing that came across my mind that people would be [ __ ] hating on you know it was just cuz there was a child there it's not like she was chilling with us yeah she was in the house [ __ ] in the other room and the place is huge I don't know and we only did like one hit maybe two hits in the kitchen that was right when I first got there and the rest of the time we were either out front Earl back on the porch where the kids were in the host the whole time so voices traveling in houses that have big areas and nothing on the walls so I'm sorry that it made it sound like the little girl was right there with us wasn't the case we wouldn't do that wouldn't do to be honest the kid was in her room taking a nap and she woke up and she saw me and she wasn't going to go back to bed so put on TV for and she was thirsty and wanted everything else because she just woke up from her nap cheers everybody 183 subscribers sorry wow man he's dabs taking my breath away I'm like misjudging them in size fun they're kicking my ass man uh I'm thinking they're small dabs and they're just [ __ ] killing me Wow shit's strong too super shiny it's no longer like super super soupy yeah it was just so hot it's more thickened up right now definitely thickened up so please accept my apology I wanted to clarify that I'm not a scumbag am on that type of person that would smoke or like you know being a car with the windows up with kids in the backseat smoking a fat bowl or anything I'm not we don't do that nothing nothing like that so please if that was what you guys were thinking or anything under the those regards please accept my apology and that is not the case I just wanted to clarify that we're not putting kids at risk and smoking hear them or in front of them we're not even in the same room as them not at all and for ninety-nine percent of the time except for one there one hit each it was all so everything was smoked outside anyway I'm doing these Deb's and I'm thinking they're small and they're killing me so I'm gonna try and do something lots see even just trying to pick up a little bit and it's just there like that will [ __ ] look man I'll kill me right now I wasn't even gonna make another video today but I kept seeing those thumbs now wanted to throw that out there wanted to verify that and it's time for me to medicate again I haven't smoked since earlier when I made those clips and it's now actually it's 20 minutes to eat 20 minutes the eighth right now so it's probably been four hours I Medicaid a little bit make a clip and verify some [ __ ] so hope no one has any hurt feelings or any sticks up their ass about that last video anybody that might have had the wrong idea about [ __ ] trust me people are people are leaving comments a no I don't I don't like people at small brown kids aren't like it's right or that's my pet peeve or whatever I don't like people that smoke around kids either you know I don't know if that kids in the room alone with the person they shouldn't be smoking cigarettes they shouldn't be rolling joints or blunts or doing dabs you know you shouldn't be using any sort of substance around a child in my mind nothing nothing at all so there's kind of bothering me that people were saying that I don't think that's right and we don't do that I'm gonna quit talking about it cuz i'm repeating and I'm dabbing and debs make me talk I don't shut the [ __ ] up ever I just keep going talking she is I was a lot better the very end at one the very very end it gives me a light little tickle little pickle on the throw and the other than adds very smooth hit tasty um prepared to I have exactly a glam left actually I have a little bit in a container put aside to so I got a little bit more than a gram left of the regular tahoe OG but this prepared to this this is tahoe OG in OG kush this is just tahoe OG this is different consistency it's a little bit more stable wax than this I can't tell yet if I think one is more potent than the other I might be able to judge that tomorrow starting off fresh cuz I was taking dabs earlier smoking bowls and I was all over the place so I couldn't tell I was ripped it's definitely not the type that uh I could be doing balls and chains with widow-makers it's just not that type of wax it's just strictly I mean you could probably make like worms with it because it's stretchy it's easy to get like it's easy to get it real stretchy you guys are even seeing us playing around with it a little bit it's just real stretchy real waxy stretchy but the more you keep pulling it up and stretch now the bigger it keeps getting sorry guys this is more of just like a couple Deb's and talking cuz 1 i'm waiting medicated from that shit's getting all over me [ __ ] yeah yeah sorry about talking so much I'm just going to do this tab and upload for you guys i'm already up like 13 minutes appreciate all these subscribers and clear that in their play that from that last video so people don't get the wrong idea I guess when you're making videos you just got to be careful about everything because slightest simplest little things and people quick think something but I understand where they're coming from because that's like an obvious thing to think when you can hear it but it wasn't right there I whatever all right everybody nascent smoothing gives a good after bite like comment subscribe leave me a comment have a good night please", "sINnYmma-9s": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today is a classic ass episode which means edible review but this is not a company that is new to us but it is new to us in the world of edibles uh that is because it's from moxie the folks over at moxie uh we've actually reviewed a few products from them um i know we've done a couple of carts and live resin where they have a different branding mx by moxie there but now they are in the edibles game with the classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all the stuff you want to see on it uh we've got our lab testing results here on the side uh and then we've got uh our dosage instructions which these are uh 10 milligram gummies they're 10 10 milligram gummies in here for 100 milligrams in total uh and these gummies cost me 17 bucks at my dispensary which puts them at the ever so slightly above average price point for a 100 milligram gummy in my neck of the woods uh it does say on here that uh moxie has won 90 plus industry awards neat uh i always find those things to be more annoying than edifying or clarifying uh if you're not gonna tell us what awards you've won uh why should i believe you anyways uh we need some more uh you know packaging regulations here but uh that's neither here nor there let's get to the moxie good stuff i did not actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's what we were talking about but that is what we were here for pretty good from them really good from maria and that guys is gonna do it for everything here on wheats until we see you for our next review or whatever it is stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "lvrvXkDctnM": "what is up Kenna Pham and welcome back so check it out for this video right here I have some different flour for you guys I'm going to show you guys now all this flour right here is different price points this is all different levels of prices some of them actually might be around the same level of pricing but we have you know the more budgeted stuff down here going all the way up to the more expensive stuff and I'm gonna show you guys this as a comparison video so you guys can't compare the really cheap stuff to the really really dank bom top-shelf stuff and then that way you guys kind of got a good overview of what the flour scene is like here in a state of Oregon okay so if you're coming to Oregon if you already live in Oregon this is a great video to kind of give you a good layout of what to expect you know what I mean if you're coming here and you're like hey how much money do I set aside that what do I want to get blah blah blah blah this video can help you so without further ado let's just get into it okay guys so first up let me set some of these ones aside because we're gonna get to those those are not where we're going to start off we're gonna start off with the lowest the cheapest ones and work our way up so the cheapest one I have right now here is this misty mountain days coming in at 16 percent THC this is an indica and this is by green source Gardens okay now this right here runs about four dollars and fifty and over 4.4 dollars and 20 cents sorry so this is a four dollar 20 cents a gram so just imagine what you could get for like a quarter or even an ounce of this stuff because you can't pick up ounces here in Oregon so but anyway that is what it looks like okay [Music] that's what that's what we're dealing with for the $4 20 cent section really cheap really really budgeted I didn't want to go really lower than this even though they do have stuff that is lower than this they do have stuff that's like three dollars a gram two dollars a gram stuff like that but you know this is just I figured you know this is pretty good budget like four dollars come on so anyway I'm gonna open this up so that's what you're dealing with okay [Music] okay not too bad I personally wouldn't smoke this just because that's my personal preference if you are somebody that's on a budget or you don't really give a [ __ ] you just want whatever you know you can get the most of most bang for your buck this is something that you should try out then okay if that's your preference if that's gonna work for you then more power to you however my personal preference I would not waste my money on something like this okay I don't smoke this kind of butter this is really really low grade Bud really really low grade but okay however it's not the worst I have had like nasty green bud that was just awful anyway up next this is at the seven dollar price range so seven dollars a gram so we jumped from four dollars to seven and this is Sookie's by Alta crest and this is a 50-50 hybrid which I kind of doubt that I don't believe that it's a solid 50/50 hybrid it's probably more like 60/40 or something like that anyway 23 percent THC with pretty much no CBD I mean it's going got a point one percent CBD so there you go that is that there's test date let's open it up and take a look at it alright alright so we're just gonna show this big nugget here or vamo it's really dry oh I just lost some of it I just lost a little chunk over here oh shut those right there anyway there's really dry guys this one's really I mean you guys could probably hear it it's just snapping dry and it's not bad I guess it's all I definitely stepped up from the $4 gram you know at least it's more of a dense nug let you know but that is the $7 section so that is what you're going to kind of expect if you're you know looking for that $7 budget-friendly strain you're gonna get stuff like that majority you might you might you might get lucky and find you know something here in Oregon from a certain dispensary that is really bomb at that price point but most of what you're gonna find at the $7 price point is going to be something along those lines okay now we're going to move up one more to the next tier which is I believe here this $10 yeah so we're gonna bring in the $10 ones alright so first up for the $10 actually you know what I'll do this one first actually since this one's opened here at the top we'll do this one first alright so $10 a gram this is probably let me just say this before I get into this $10 and up is probably as far as quality goes as far as good quality this is probably the best bang for your buck $10 now these $10 strains right here I'm about to show you would go like I've seen firsthand in places like California and Nevada I've seen strains just as dank as this if not a little less dank go for like 15 18 dollars a gram in those states so being able to get what I'm least three right here on a buck show you 410 that's phenomenal within itself okay can't beat Oregon prices telling you anyway so look at that this is the hypnotoad 20% THC headrush hills is the farm this is one gram and just look at that purpleness man look at that purple old [ __ ] I dropped it anyway let's do it pull these bad boys out of here oh look at that just beautiful nuts frosty as hell man yeah look at that frost on those nugs beautiful purple in there nice tints of green just what you want when you're looking for nugs and the smell I know you guys can't smell none of this but holy [ __ ] guys this smells great the terpenes are on point with this okay this is some really really good quality for ten dollars a grand okay same with this one this is a 10 gram one two when we open it here so this is the Donnie burger 13 okay you green no-till [Music] and again $10 a gram for this one and I mean just look at that Oh smells phenomenal it's very pungent guys as soon as you take it right out of the bag I mean just phenomenal smell just nice dense nuggets break up nice like if you're rollin blunts or something with this you'd give me you'd be the joint lovers and blunt lovers would love that flower right there it breaks up really nice all right so again Donnie burger 1325 percent THC and then here we go this is the garlic breath now this is probably one of my favorite strains out right now with the GMO if you ask me hey what are your favourite strains right now what what do you recommend uh it would either be the GMO or these garlic breath sorry this garlic breath or the garlic mince uh really I mean I just love stinky strains okay I really do I love that gasps that pungent nest that smell through the bag that's what I like that's what I look for now look at this is a big note look at that Oh beautiful how does one want you to know you're my favorite girl I didn't look at that nice big nug fire ten to ten dollars a gram again I'm telling you that's what to expect here in the state of Oregon okay now so those are the ten dollars set those over here now we're gonna move on to the 12 to $14 arrange now I have a twelve dollar one and then these other two or fourteen so I'm going to show you guys the twelve dollar one so this is the m4 twenty nine percent THC this is super dense that's like a rock I mean that is super dense guys smells great though smells really really good but super dense and just very nice lime bringing some bright orange hairs very nice bug like listen to that listen that listen sit yeah it's dense but so twelve dollars a gram twenty nine percent THC top shelf now we're moving to the last two which are these two $14 a gram and if you ask me my opinion right now they're not that much better than like these are like when I showed you guys these ones that are ten I mean they're almost there they're really not better okay they're kind of the same these just happen to be more expensive I don't know why oh I really don't maybe it's just the flour company or whatever but this is voyager number one from seven points oregon twenty nine percent THC with pretty much no CBD and i'm going to show you guys this 14 dollars a gram for this [Music] or get that nice snug again dents really dental if you you're liking those hard den snugs then you know you want to go for the 12 to $14 sections because that's where you're gonna get a lot of these dents nuggets the smells great phenomenal smell very chirpy very very chirpy I guess maybe that's why it varies in price why this is more expensive than the other stuff is probably because maybe it's more chirpy I don't know but then here we go another $14 gram one strawberry cream 25 percent THC again by seven points Oregon which is a good farm they make good product wash look at that beauty look at that beauty it's the cutie with the bootie I mean seriously though like just nice dense little little tents little very very little tents of purple in there you know just frost it as [ __ ] I mean it looks like somebody took like a salt shaker of tri Chrome's and just shook it all over this bud I mean just drenched it I mean it's super trike City here and I really like that I enjoy that again smells super good it's got like a fruity strawberry smell so that that's really good so there you guys go this has been a comparison video of the cheap budgeted stuff versus the more expensive stuff here in the state of Oregon now let me just end the video by saying this okay guys here in the state of Oregon this is kind of the norm of what you're gonna find at most dispensaries now there are gonna be some premier dispensaries I like to come from your dispensaries because they're more high-end so you will find stuff at those kind of dispensaries that are maybe like you know 16 to 18 dollars a grams stuff like that however this is what you're going to find add just your average basic dispensary that you're going to be visiting in your local town or wherever you're visiting a hatch or anything like that this is majority what you're gonna find and you're gonna find dank bud like this at good prices okay here in Oregon we have the cheapest weed in the United States okay I know there might be some people in the comment section that would like to argue that point maybe they're from Colorado and stuff where they also have cheap weed there as well but Oregon is the cheapest in the United States we have the cheapest and the best bang for your buck okay as you guys can see these $10 grand ones you can't like that's phenomenal that's phenomenal okay so I like I said I just want to do a comparison video show you guys comparing the budgeted stuff the cheaper stuff the the B stirs the whatever you want to call it the low end low grade cannabis versus the high grade you know top-shelf stuff you know that way you guys can get a good idea of kind of what it is you're dealing with here in the Oregon cannabis market okay now I've done a lot of videos on the flower here in Oregon I've done videos if you guys check my channel out I've done videos where you know it's the budgeted but a bunch of different cheap stuff I've done stuff what top shelf looks like here in Oregon I've done this video now that you know kind of compares the two so I'm going to be moving on to dams I got a bunch of dabs here we're going to be moving on to a bunch of different products and stuff like that that we're gonna be moving on to and I'm gonna go show you guys in the next video kind of a comparison of cheap dabs what are expensive dabs and then kind of doing the same thing where I'll show you guys comparison of both cheap and expensive dams alright so I hope this video has been somewhat informational for you guys if you love Bud if you love cannabis

yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the half baked extracts live resin batter so here is a better picture hopefully it is focused on the camera but instead of using my other glass for the video instead of using like the actual rig i'm just going to be using the puffco peek pro just because these different videos even though the rig is fun to use it just takes a lot of time for videos and this is just more convenient for videos if you're just going to be tasting the flavor anyways because it keeps the same temperature so i'm going to be hitting this um off the peak pro at 490 for i believe it is a minute and 10 seconds so i'm gonna go ahead load this up and we're gonna go ahead and take a nice dab so let's go so here's what i'm going to be loading up if i didn't say before i don't think i did this is the recon flavor or strain if you want to call it but let's go ahead load it up and take a hit so it's all loaded up now and we're just going to wait for it to reach temp and once it vibrates we're going to be ready to go i have a turbo in here so hopefully you know i do get a better taste so all of the chirps will be splashing around so just vibrated and here we go uh do so i'm getting a lot of freaking smoke out of this at this low temp it should be over any second now so the batter tastes really good on this low temp and the reason i have it for a minute a minute and 20 seconds and so all of the batter um is used and i don't have any left so i don't need to keep reheating it so that's a good temperature to put it at so i'm only going to hit that one time because i really don't think i really need to go over it that much so it does taste really good i'm gonna have their instagram down below so here's like the little logo that they have and then here's what i just hit so really good flavor puffco peak probably can't go wrong with it really good device just expensive but if you do have the money to spend on it i wouldn't pass out on it's better than some of the other devices that are cheaper but if you want the best device this is it it's just kind of expensive but that's gonna be it for the video thank you guys so much for watching and this ethan signing out peace", "Sdpn-iHpu_c": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 all right like say hi to all the new subscribers old subscribers hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving hope they got most of their Christmas shopping done all right we got a hall from cetera we got another hall I might try to do it tonight or tomorrow I might do a smoke sesh I got a fire burning out back so I might like to roll up a blunt and smoke that let's see what else oh if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we still got the thousand subscriber giveaway coming soon I'm just trying to gather a few more things for it try to make it a little unique as possible you know me so make sure you hit that subscribe button leave me a thumbs up or thumbs down if you don't like to see it don't matter alright let's see what we got to the game alright well you know so Tara got there flower today so you know we had you up there for that well they gave out a free gift floats there I've guessed the flower line they're gonna call it float but this is a real cool jar I haven't seen anything like that for it's a stash jar it's a mason jar so you're going to take this plastic lid off and sure enough regular mason jar lid and then this is just a silicone cozy it's on there real tight by the way I'm gonna come up it'll come down a little bit but you can see it's just one the caning cars so the ones with a little design on it but the silicone thing makes it a little bit more indestructible like so I really kind of like that mm-hmm never seen one like that before hopefully they sell bees and a smaller one would be not you know they make a smaller mason jar I'll never have enough to stash in there so let's see what we got here we did yes flower I believe I forgot to take the tags off all the stuff so you gonna have to give me like a what second to do that yeah we'll leave it on the boxes we'll just want to show the boxes all right one more to go all right so I thought they was gonna do something different what the girl told me on the phone was it was gonna be like flood was gonna be the brand but then they was gonna have like rest and awake you know kind of like their a.m. their p.m. theirs in and all that pens but they actually it was granddaddy purples what I got coming at nineteen percent THC there's a squeezy jars come see a little bit of Leafs in there should a dealer went first so I can roll one but you see a few of the leaves in the bottle but there's some trichomes you can see that yeah let's take it up for the close-up look yeah it wasn't trimmed real good you can see that right there somebody left a couple leaves on there but when we flip it over you wouldn't get the light down here that's feel a little dry though which is kind of to be expected here in Florida to be honest with you guys not all the time don't get me wrong but usually when they come out with it for the first time and they hold it for a holiday like they just did this is Black Friday they just come out with their links flower today you got imagine even sitting on it for a minute like I said the but structures aren't bad they've got some trichomes on them don't know if you can see all that or not see glisten in there a little bit trim job wasn't the best but some of the other ones have been like that they learn as they go down here some learn as they go down here some dispensaries don't learn at all but so we'll probably stick these in a jar with one of them a little believe a pax I did a couple the other ones like that and it worked out pretty good alright and then we got the this is Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer if you look it up on their website it's gonna say Jackie Girl this is the Jackie Girl when you look it up Jackie girls across between Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer so this one was coming in at 18 percent this was only two flowers they had at my location I didn't get there bright and early now this stuff does look good so whoever trimmed the granddaddy purp just probably fire their asses this one's nice because I trimmed up nice nice tight bugs this one's not really that dry we're gonna twist up one of these because you know we gotta smoke something so like I said this is gonna be a Girl Scout cooking a jack for rare it is a hybrid but I'm guessing it's gonna be more a little bit sativa leaning hybrid believed the Girl Scout cookie anyways a little sativa leaning one twist up too big of a ones and like I said with my cloud to the fire here later on I'll go out to the fire you guys can't see crap out there I've tried it one night but I can start the smoke session here and then after I shoot the video while uploading it I can upload outside around the pit and finish my lunch so we might do that we say from here and it's down here my nose is up here I can smell that when I ground it up got a little bit of that fruity smell like the member berries kind of like aluminum rg4 move - it has that kind of fruity smell to it it's also got maybe a little earthy smell to it something hit me a lot harder when I first rounded up but you never know there could have been something left over in the grinder - that it mixed with it that's why I really don't do a review the first time I smoked it because sometimes there's a left over traces of something in the grinder and I'll give you a little false taste on the first one I did that on member berries one time SOT my ground up before that just was a little bit more stronger than it was and carried over alright just twist it up and see what else we got from there now I will say I never really cared for cetera set up usually they're not real busy you know usually I go in there there's two or three people in there and I still wait twenty minutes so they don't have a real good setup you go up to the counter you order your stuff right in front of everybody there's only two people at the counter then you sit down if there's room but there's only about two little small couches in there or one little small couch and a bench or something I don't know then somebody makes up your order in the back room carries it out carries it all the way to the other side the store to the for cash registers they have and then they holler out your name so as you can imagine today they got flour and wax in they look pretty busy more people in there talking unless you can hear some of the some of the guys in there you know they was loud enough you could hear them but a couple of girls they was hollering names two or three times you know all that just slows the process so I'll know we was there for an hour today got no discounts got the float thing but apparently they was one of the few that didn't have any discounts their idea of a Black Friday deal is just letting us have flour I guess so we did get some shattered we got the Tillamook strawberry coming at 68 percent THC they come in these nice little black jars they're real easy to open not like some of them we won't name names and then it's got like a little cupcake thing in there candy wrapper and it's got the shatter which I don't care for this cuz it's as you can see it makes it a big globs so trying to break a piece off of that is a pain in the butt I like it better on a flat piece of parchment paper so it's flattened out hopefully they'll figure that out soon some of them do some of them don't someone just keep packing it in there but at least I didn't just put it in a jar by itself they did put it on some kind of parchment so we'll give that a shot later on it'll give you a review on it too along with the flowers and then we got some of what they're calling soft wax 69% then my native just as wax on the thing it's just soft wax online a little different than what I was expecting online if you look at it look more buttery more like moves rosin this is more like I don't know like if you melted a turkey roll or something or caramel and neither one never had a real strong smell to them so we'll just have to taste them here later on but like I said neither one of them had a strong flavor I don't know if I got a clean dab to learn on but we can clean one real quick you let it cool off I don't wanna melt it any get a little skip out see if we can get a little better look at it and I guess it is a little dance for sorry I was looking at it yeah once you dig into us a little more wet than I thought it was and kind of touched the top and it didn't fall apart I did ask him you always going to ask him Florida because you never freaking know they tried to trick us a few times I was asked if I can get it under inhalation we're not inhalation sorry oral it's got a little bit of flavor once your smell when you broke into it I always ask him if you can get it under oral if you can get under oil it's gonna be distillate the vitae can pulled that crap on us and rise pulled that crap on us with their turkey nectar stuff or whatever they had and by takane had to concentrate jars that they tried saying was you know they kept saying a honey consistency they never come out and said honey but when you do look online it does say on the float products it does say cannabis derived terpenes at it so you're not gonna add you can't I don't think you can I mean you might add terpenes to the flower so you can't really add it to the shatter I mean I guess you could before it was still liquid when you was pouring it out I guess you could add terpenes in but usually when you see they're adding terpenes back to it it's gonna be a more of a flavored distillate so I was a little bit nervous about that and we'll see cuz this one kind of looks like it could be a flavored distillate if it pops up next week that you could buy this crap under oil on no offense time so we'll just see we'll give it a flavor test all this was 180 bucks it's $60 a piece for the wax the soft wax and the shatter their flower is thirty and eight so neither one of these two strains I've had before I don't think I've had the granddaddy purple in a flower I think we've only had it in a vet cart before let's see what else this doesn't have a bad flavor to it I just smoked a bowl before the video because I got some phone calls on no one to smoke on here but I was wanting to smoke too so I didn't wanna wait so he's a little medicated when we started can tastes more like the Girl Scout cookie I think than the Jack Herer in here it does have a little earthy undertone to it but we'll do a full review on it later along with the Laxus so I think that's going to be it guys I'm gonna try to finish the rest of this we'll see how it goes you know it is only 18% but I've had some 18% hit me harder than anything else some of the hardest hitting flowers I think I've had here in Florida it was around the 18 or 21 percent not saying that there ain't some you know 27 that are good and stuff but I think the best strains I've had have been a lower you know run 18 21 % to be honest so like I said I think that'll be it guys will try to either do a smoke sesh or the other review tonight or will see you tomorrow one of the two pins on how the night goes you know I got a bunch of kids so yeah you never know what's gonna pop up around the air you guys haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we're trying to grow the channel as quick as we can as fast as we can get as big as we can so make sure you subscribe for all the latest videos so why is hoping now I just heard horn honk so I'm gonna cut this one off and hopefully go in there and help her with some dinner maybe or just sit on the couch and play with the kids wanted to so if you haven't subscribed subscribe leave me a thumbs up thumbs down comment down below let me know what you guys are talkin on tonight how was your Black Friday shopping did you bother go or did you go out and get anything today for yourself some weed like I did let me know and until next time keep on talking my friend", "PAk3eXM8VhU": "guess for starters let's put some water in the bond hey guys so today we are going to be sitting down and doing our second edition of flower versus concentrate the strain that we are going to be looking at it's going to be Girl Scout cookies or gse depending on where are you buying it from and what the hubbub about Girl Scout cookies versus GSC is I suppose the only reason I say that is because today somebody was just telling me that there has been like all of this hubbub and legal matters was surrounding the name Girl Scout cookies because I don't know trademark reasons Girl Scout cookie reasons I'm going to be sitting down and talking to you guys about the strain as a whole and talking about its effects in flower form and concentrate for him and then we're gonna choose which one I like better as a hybrid Girl Scout cookies is a really great middle-of-the-road strain great for the afternoons if you want to just hang out on the couch or if you're kind of indecisive but you just want to smoke a bong and you might get up and do something later I personally enjoy Girl Scout cookies most when I'm about to sit down and watch a movie and just kind of do mindless stuff for the rest of the day though again I do definitely like it as one of those strains were like I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna smoke it as if I'm going to be lazy and not do anything for the rest of the day but if for some reason I end up having to get up and go run errands or you know do something I'm not totally groggy and like in the couch from the strain I feel like Girl Scout cookies is one of those strains that has a very familiar look and smell to it like like when you see Girl Scout cookies and you smell it and you taste it you know it's Girl Scout cookies umm GSC just has this really vibrant green and orange look to it it's pastilles are very very like fluffy and orange and Girl Scout cookies is such a like sweet almost like fruity scent which is kind of funny because when I think of Girl Scout cookies I think of like thin mints or dozy doats but it totally does have a very like sweet fruity candy almost like aroma it's taste does kind of represent that sort of fruity candy taste but it definitely does have more of a cookie taste I guess you could call it so the parents trains of Girl Scout cookies are Durbin poison and OG Kush which are two strains that I've never had a chance to try before so I always find it interesting to come across what the parent strains of some of my personal favorites are and just to see whether they are strains that I'm a fan of or that I've even tried or heard of GSC has kind of made a name for itself in the medical marijuana community as being a pretty popular strain for just everyday stress and depression as well as it's been known to be a really great just body relaxing strain as well as like total mind relaxing as well so like I said Girl Scout cookies can kind of be in any time strain I personally like it in the afternoon however I can see it being a really good strain to start your day with a fewer person with super high anxiety or maybe really manic depression on days that I don't have a big to-do list Girl Scout cookies is definitely on my breakfast menu so in Flour forum I would have to say that Girl Scout cookies is one of my favorites overall I mean it just has a really great look a really great smell and a really great feel to it it's definitely one of the more popular flower strains on the market I have noticed as well now that we've covered the flour part of this video let's get right on into the concentrate part of the Girl Scout cookies I have transferred my concentrates just into this little oil slick because it's just easier to contain them than the packaging that never had provided so Girl Scout cookies as a wax definitely for me is different than Girl Scout cookies for me as a flower I noticed that I'm definitely a little bit more able to relax with the Girl Scout cookies flower like I could probably fall asleep whereas the concentrate form of it is definitely a little more upbeat I notice I always find it interesting how depending on whether you get a strain in flour or concentrate it will definitely affect you differently or it definitely affects me differently I notice I've definitely heard some people say that they think Girl Scout cookies has a sort of diesel e or fuel scent or taste to it I don't really get that in the flour however I definitely do get it in the wax form I feel like in the wax form it also has more of like a desert flavor versus like a candy or fruity flavor GSC is one of those strains it's almost like a triple threat between the way that it looks the way that it smells and like it's After Effects of smoking and using it um like I don't know I just feel like it's such it's such a common strain and it's just like hit home for so many people and gotten on there like top three favorites I definitely prefer the wax form of GSC for more upbeat things versus the plot the versus the flower form where I definitely would use that for more of like an evening on the couch or you know like I don't know crafts or something I can definitely see myself using the wax form for an afternoon yoga hanging out with friends or you know just kind of getting some light work done around the house nothing too major nothing that I need like a super sativa for but all right I'm gonna have myself one more dab and then we're gonna have to choose which I like better the flower or the concentrate form of GSC and today we are devin on our xlb glass rig that we got in seattle this thing is like I was just shopping cases before I was sitting down to record this video I'm so excited at the beginning of this video I really did think that I had my mind made up already whether I was going to like the flower or the concentrate form of the GSC better I mean I really really thought that it was going to be the flower I'm like I think you know actually I think it still is going to be the flower form of the GSC that I like better but like that dad really threw me for a loop like I'm blown away right now I think that the flower is going to be the winner winner chicken dinner of this flower versus concentrate episode with you guys I guess I'll call it an episode it's our second episode I feel like Girl Scout cookies for me in flower form is just like a really great end of the day kind of like melt away the stress of the day kind of just sit back on the couch and watch an episode of something and just relax the wax form was just like phenomenal I'm still just blown away by how how incredible that dab made me feel so that's always like something that I'm going to be keeping right up here thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you get a chance to try the both flower and concentrate form of GSC or Girl Scout cookies however you may like to call it and I will see you guys again for another episode of this hopefully it'll be a lot sooner than it took me to get in this one after the first episode which was the arcade a train wreck but alright I'll catch up with you guys later feel free to subscribe if you have not ready give me a thumbs up if you have not already put some words in that little comment box if you have not already and I will see you guys later", "dOr-KK3IAJk": "yo guys what is going on ethan here today i'm going to be reviewing this shrieker cart from rise over in florida i don't know what other states i have it in but this is where i'm at and this is where i got it from so this is what the cartridge looks like um let me try to have it focus a little bit better but the oil does look good and i have tasted already and it is a pretty good car as you can see it may be a little bit high already but this cartridge does i can't even talk right now that's how good this cartridge is so it does smack let me hit it again i said let me hit it again and this was my first hit on the video so this already tells you cheese but i do want to thank you guys for all the support you guys have been giving me i know i haven't uploaded in a while it's been like two weeks i've just been really busy i've been trying to use my other social medias more so i haven't been uploading on youtube as much so that's my fault i've just been trying to grow my other ones so i could bring more of a following to my youtube if that makes any more sense so i'm gonna have my other social medias on the screen so you guys can check that out but yeah i want to thank you guys for all the support recently this cartridge is amazing so yeah it's a good car um thank you rise for giving me this cartridge to review and i'm not being like biased because they gave me the cartridge if it was ass i would say it's ass so this this is a good card [Music] this is the battery that comes with it so i don't know what voltage it's at but i'm just using the one that came with it because i didn't want to [ __ ] around the batteries and get one that was too hot for this and mess up the cartridge but yeah this is a really good battery and a nice cartridge as well i like how on this battery you don't need to hit anything so you just charge it and then whenever you want to use it put the cartridge on and you just inhale and it turns on by itself so so i want to let you guys know like i've been seeing a lot of people saying like oh i don't have the right equipment to start the youtube channel i don't have this i don't have that i want to show you guys that i'm recording this one like this video on my phone instead of my other camera just to show you that you guys don't need every little thing to start a channel like i started using my phone and i'm using it again on this video just to show you guys that you guys don't need all the equipment just start a channel so yeah it's it's kind of cool and i like seeing the channel grows and i get to meet more people so i really like engaging with my i guess the people that subscribe to me and that follow me so i want to thank you guys a lot this video wasn't going to be long it was just a little review on the cartridge and like i said already it is a nice cartridge this is just a half gram they do make full grams but obviously it do cost more but i think it's like like 50 bucks around that price i'm not exactly sure but i'm gonna have the information down below in the comments because i think if i put in the description they're gonna remove it but i'll i'll see if i can put it in the description i'm not gonna be 100 sure and i'll try to pop it up on the screen that's going to be it for the video this card is good like i just said a couple times but subscribe comment leave a like and thank you guys for watching and this is ethan signing out peace [Music]", "w0_1bXksiUM": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up guys back here for another video and your boys back here with another freaking cart review slash versus guys i haven't tried these too strange in so long so your boy had to try him um the homie he picked up and he's just been you know collecting a lot of cars so you boy had to you know hop on and he let me try the bezel so shout out to the homie you already know see get yourself a homie who got cards that you can review you feel me and try out you feel me so we got the nug and the nug is a big sur it's a live resin and then the bezel it's actually called bezel i think i said bezel earlier it's actually called bezel it's a sauce cart and this one is actually i think higher in terpenes and stuff than this other cart and it's actually it's also um made using butane actually i read it on the side in their ingredients but it also says it's high in terpenes so we're going to check that out see how good it is it's a a disc chill it with terpenes basically turns it into sauce i guess but the other one is more of a live resin so sauce versus live resin you kill me but um let me give you guys a close-up this is uh what the bezel comes in like a tube comes in a pretty big box but they only sell uh half grams so if you guys are in the full grams you're probably gonna end up having to buy two they haven't made a full gram cartridge of this yet but you know what it's all good let me take a hit before i even open up this other package hope everyone's smoking right now i'm smoking on um the rest of the absolute extracts the orange creamsicle freaking fire we're going to turn this temp up i know y'all like seeing them clouds because y'all like seeing a brother cough i let a lot of that get away but y'all saw me but um as you can see it's hard to get these shits open with one hand but it's all good the bigger one is the nug it has their little symbol on if you can see it you can barely see it but as you can see the sauce cart it's a little lighter and that's just because it has distillates and the terpenes you know it's not enough to make it super dark but it makes it dark the terpenes i'm pretty sure is what makes it darker but it looks good it's a nice little i don't know what kind of i don't know but you know it's pretty much the same as nug it's just another is a little bit darker but they're both kind of an amberish color this one's more yellow though you know what i'm saying but um we're gonna try out the nut first just because i am a nug fan over basil so we're gonna try snug first shout out to nug if y'all haven't seen um i made a video on their dispensary so go check that out um and also i did a review on one of their freaking fire ass products called thc a if you guys haven't seen that i'll try and put it in the top of the screen but don't be mad if it's not the top of the screen just go through my vlogs check me out watch it man you guys will catch a [ __ ] vibe all right cheers guys enough time let's see if i can take a blinker hit we'll see it's on a very high temp right now so i don't know if i can bam what street big sur i don't know what [Music] what freaking strains they use flower wise but it definitely has like a um let me taste it one more time guys hold on i give you exact what i think in my brain what it tastes like i don't know i feel like it has like a little taste but it's not necessarily sweet but it's definitely just like super dank because it's not guys it's live resin you guys already know that but it tastes super smooth like it's not harsh really at all you already know it's freaking it's amazing like nuggets probably one of my top live resins that i would get and one day i'm gonna do like at the end of the year when it's a new year guys i'm thinking about showing you guys all my product so tell me if you guys want that vlog showing you all the products that i did um that i smoked this year and telling you guys which ones i thought were the top best ones because i feel like in some of my vlogs i don't necessarily you know tell you guys oh this is better or this one's better because some people like different things and i want people to try things you know think for yourself you feel me because i'm not an influencer guys i i'm just gonna put that out there right now i don't want to be called an influencer if anything the thing the message that i want you guys to get is to think on your [ __ ] selves you know but um shout out to you guys let me take over here before i try this sauce yeah that shit's a hit man that's just to hit you turn the temp down and try oh yeah let me turn the temp down and like maybe i could taste it better that's facts i forgot see this is the honey stick that i used to have guys you've seen it in um vlogs before but mine broke or got stolen one of those i can't remember but hey it's almost 10. it's a little tip and we're high as [ __ ] but um let's see what it tastes like on low temp because low temp guys this is what people need to understand like yes it's cool to have big clouds get that fat head get loaded as [ __ ] hella quick whatever but it's also cool to just gradually get high and take low temp hits because you actually get the flavor of the strain that you won't you know that you're smoking like that's why it would be dope to you know vaporize but you know it's just a lot of vaporizers that i want like the volcano are super expensive because i would honestly bake the bud get high you know and then use the vape bud to make edibles or something but we're gonna try it on low temp [Music] i don't know it don't almost taste like uh like a cake like plain by itself you know what i mean i don't know if you got like just you know like pound cake or something i don't that's just me you traced in i don't know you i don't know maybe i'm wrong it has something in there like a certain taste to it that i feel like but it is dank as [ __ ] mainly it's just like a super dang dab taste but it has a taste to it i feel like what do you think [Music] dude i could taste this sauce it almost tastes like like lemon cake see i'm saying it's like a i feel you it's like lemony or something bro i'm puffing on this right now and like it tastes sweet as [ __ ] take a puff on that the sauce tastes sweet as hell when you puff on it right now like don't you think holy [ __ ] like i think this might have this might win no no we ain't gonna say that yet we're gonna say that yet hold on let's switch it up [Music] and i'm not the biggest fan of these tops because like you can end up seeing the oil there but these tops because they're circle they're good for taking bong hits you know if you don't have like the tool to smoke your boners so cheers guys we're gonna taste this on low temp because it tasted super fruity like it had like flavor to it guys so we're gonna see what it tastes like [Music] damn bro [Music] this [ __ ] is good guys holy [ __ ] i'm trying to match the flavor on this [ __ ] bro it's like um like a like i see like i don't know [Music] it's like a sherbert you guys can barely see the vapor probably because it's on low temp but it tastes like freaking sherbet or something taste it real quick tell me i'm telling you bro flavorful papaya papaya okay papaya what which one is this dude this is the the miss usa this is miss usa guys sorry i did not say in the vlog you guys probably can't see that but it says miss usa and it's an indica hybrid slash hybrid so it's a hybrid probably dominant indica or indica dominant you turned up 10 a little bit [Music] all right guys this this bezel is is giving nug a run for their money not not trying to dis nug but you have to see it like this guys the bezel is a distillate that's high in terpenes nug is a live resin so it's not a fair comparison because they don't add anything you're not you don't really add anything to librarian some brands do like um i'm trying to think like buddies they add terpenes to their live resins but um i don't think nug adds any terpenes to their live resin i'ma look at the ingredients [Music] they might have terps in it but it's like maybe low in it low in terps but um this freaking diesel actually tastes freaking fire you gotta try this strain exactly guys miss usa try this straight exactly i'm gonna take um a couple more hits for you guys and i'm gonna dip out and just chill you know gotta chill a little bit you know you know spend time with homie talk a little bit and you know maybe have some high moments some high thoughts guys tell me if you guys want to hear our high thoughts video comment below if you guys want to see a video about just my high thoughts or some [ __ ] we've been like me and the homie been thinking about it so maybe we'll just jot some things down that we said because we say some like crazy freaking [ __ ] that's just like what the hell high thoughts guys like i thought but let me take a rip real quick [Music] damn yeah this cart i'm buying this car soon i'm buying this car soon guys but um i hope everyone enjoyed this video new vlog coming soon probably in a

hoes yeah they're from apostle but yeah hell yeah girls like this [ __ ] like and what i noticed brother them [ __ ] since the it caught like you know how we lost a lot of money and [ __ ] like that like the economy it went like broke them [ __ ] took advantage of that [ __ ] and started buying companies bro a lot of china yeah a lot of the companies that when i bailed well you owe them a shitload of money [ __ ] in the u.s is your procedure charging no it's on 12. but yeah like as soon as that [ __ ] happened bro they took advantage and i started buying a lot of different companies bro you know tick tocks from uh i think and the craziest [ __ ] is bro that like there is not a lot of [ __ ] that uh americans did you know as in like products i was in phones bro like i think samsung samsung is like american right you know but i know that iphones ain't because they want to know china on the bank they'll probably [ __ ] uh agree with this bill gates is trying to earn humanity what like he's trying to end humanity yeah well not in humanity but like in the ones that like trying to control public population um that's what china's doing because i swear to god bro but bill gates is trying to do it here they say that the supposedly the snowstorm that texas had was uh created by bill gates or like the government supposedly i don't know and you're saying that like why you saying that like what are the little reasons you know because uh bill gates put it on twitter that like he had put something on twitter about humanity and controlling me or something like that back in like 2012 or 2011 i think it was yeah i'm not sure what it was they had already built a climate control machine learning where they can make clouds that can rain they can snow they can cause tomatoes [ __ ] hurricanes all kinds of [ __ ] have you been like you know how the chemtrails you know like chemtrails and [ __ ] so the things on the sky bro like the white smoke that the airplanes leave so like a lot of people say that but like why is he okay i seen someone some of them are black bro some leave a black mark that's the ones i believe is the castle you know i don't know because i'll be seeing the white one bro like they leave a white mark and then over time they expand explained it you know i think it takes up her it was a video he said that they they release gas so they can land safely because they take off with so much weight and then whenever they're gonna land they can't land with that much weight because the plane will like they'll just go straight down like nose nose first so is that too much light you think i mean i'm not i mean yeah we they can see our place for sure like that oh here's some [ __ ] what do y'all think about bill gates yeah bro could look you know like um davinci bro what's his name the dude that um created the mona lisa you know can you search up his democracy so i can set out correctly well like him bro he made the mona lisa bro and that was one of them right but if you look in the mona lisa it's the mona lisa in the middle and it's the water going like this and then the other side is higher da vinci thank you bro thank you to francisco thank you but yeah bro like leonardo da vinci bro so like not just he didn't just make that one that's a very famous artwork right so like that's famous because of that [ __ ] because of what is on there bro like dude i just seen that badass not bad i'm always interrupting and then like oh so there's that one bro and there's also like hey we just uh shut off the license [ __ ] this is like there's people around here but like what's it called um there's another picture bro and this other picture is um matter of fact it's a book bro is that the davinci code bro yes the da vinci codes because that's gonna be on the book in the book you know who bought the book bro in 1995 bill gates for 30 30 million dollars bro go search that [ __ ] up 30 million dollars or 35 million dollars cuz [ __ ] wait what but like that's what that [ __ ] bought that [ __ ] for bro what's that let's get big hot smoking off spiral chair on flowers cherry cookies oh [ __ ] who's phone who's phone like

say that [ __ ] to give you a dry face yeah yeah just be like give me a good cut yeah i understand do you like the mental bread string mendo breath strain i haven't now now i haven't tried that one we both have tried the peanut butter bread is that what i call i don't know coming from it oh yeah that [ __ ] that [ __ ] was saying i think it was like honestly bro let me be honest about this [ __ ] it was like now that i have seen like different strains bro that strain it was like what how what would you rate that like shelf wise because i don't know i have a high tolerance so i tell you the one i liked was the kim jong kim dog oh i had like three different kim dogs bro they all been gasps bro man the one right here that one and then it was the one um what's it called after that in colorado

cannabis products and uh why not do the timeless battery attached to it is you know say most people know the brand pacific stone but here they are uh pretty sure i'm smoking on pretty sure it's 805 sour it could be forbidden fruit it's funny that something so distinct i guess i'm not a hundred percent sure on because they do taste very differently hey maybe if this battery rips clean and uh allows me to enjoy some terpenes then maybe i can actually know the strain and then i just let y'all know hey this battery is great for like distinguishing like for a person that has multiple cards you know i want to come a little bit to the shade so you can see that it lights up a little bit and so i could maybe stop sweating so much um oh this absolutely rips higher than 3.5 volts if you're looking for like a low uh low temp part this this as well as most automatics in my knowledge aren't actually great for that you'll want like a variable voltage or just maybe like a lower voltage button press battery for that type of experience but yeah i'm pretty sure that's forbidden fruit the my issue now with it is actually the heart not even the battery so i can even maybe try to change the cart so i can review this battery for a little longer have more content and have more feedback for you because i don't really feel like if i don't get enough you know like a satisfactory hit i can't really review it that well and that cart was just uh the oil wasn't lining up with the wick it was tasting burns but i know that has nothing to do with the battery so i'm gonna go back to this shady spot it also helps me to see good this thing i actually can't see the recording at all it's too bright but yeah we're back here okay yeah it's a little puff rock garden usually clog so i guess i kind of have to for a video like this show you what a blinker would be like am i ready though i believe that was a standard 10 seconds oh yeah it's ripping this raw garden beautifully oh oh wow show y'all the view or whatever so you don't need to see my face when i'm suffering i might need some water but i'm i'm crawling it's just it's just a blinker actually i took back-to-back blinkers very very nice i'd raise some pictures right there probably going to use that for the thumbnail if i can wow i'm now i'm just sloppy um i'm i will check just for the [ __ ] sake of this video or should i just think excuse my head right quick yeah yeah all right i got it okay and i hope oh no no it won't work it won't work never mind okay i thought i had a different type of cart so i could show y'all maybe three three different types but that one it actually requires you to be a below like three volts and a taste burn when i use it with this battery well i think none of these damn um battery reviews ends up being one of my longer videos because i'm just out here vibing oh and i guess it's rare that i have this much runtime i'm always low on storage now a little more nature oh i guess my flash is on too i don't think that's really done much but yeah i really like this battery it's held small definitely should have showed y'all what it like came with honestly i think i have in a different video oh my god my hand but yeah my hands have all this like you know just sidewalk concrete take a nice deep breath in okay oh my god well yeah realizing that taylor these blinkers contributing to me sweating too i love this [ __ ] battery um it is a small battery doesn't last the longest but i don't feel like it dies hella quick either so he won like a nice auto draw with some swag it did come with a carrying case that i might actually just add on to the video or not and um you really just like can't go wrong with him like this unless you have specific cartridge that says you cannot exceed like three volts or you know you gotta be on it you gotta rip this live resident cartridge at a lower temperature otherwise this is crazy", "SrOGd0GUJzU": "welcome to the blind taste terp challenge for this episode we have papa's herb three flavors are gonna be miami citrus rainbow sorbet and sour headband you see they're all collab with ill river the way this works is i'm gonna mark them all with some stickers without looking and see if i can match the strain name with the terps that i'm tasting i also then gonna rank them from first to third place on which i prefer all right let's get that all right here we go the first hit papa's herb it's like a sugary but yet it's got a little sauce separation there too a couple little diamonds in it that's pink i don't know if you can tell with the light got a little bit of the sugary stuff and the sauce all on that head first time trying papa serve let's see [Music] oh [Music] got a little spicy to the terps [Music] i'm gonna go sour a headband on that one all right here we go another one it's got a little diamond in there some sugars a little bit of sauce separation this is the blue it's got the same similar smell see if it has the same taste [Music] but the same kind of taste a little spicy not really getting any citrus taste so i'm not gonna guess that so we're gonna go rainbow sorbet i think the one before had a little more sweeter taste than this one though i'm gonna put this at second place right now [Music] all right final head what's more on the sugar side not on the sauce the chunky sugar that's the gold case forgot what i'm dabbing on it's papa herb [Music] oh [Music] that one tastes similar as the other ones as well i have miami citrus left there's a slight citrus taste let me put that one in the middle stay tuned for the results all right time for the results you can see i have miami citrus in the middle up there that was my third hit i said rainbow sorbet was my second hit in the blue and my first hit was the pink sticker that i said first kind of thinking those two might be opposite because i kind of got more of a sweeter taste from the first hit than the second but who's gonna keep them how they are and let it ride i guess you say huh all right let's see this first one yellow over here let's see if it is miami citrus miami citrus all right one right so this one i said rainbow sorbet with the blue let's see what we got here rainbow sorbet at the blue all right that means this third one's correct too sour headband so i got those correct three for three glad i didn't change them all right so here is the ranking coming in first place sour headband see that sauce dripping in there coming in second miami citrus [Music] i want more chunky side last but not least rainbow sorbet [Music] it's got a nice little pool of liquid of terps in there a little diamond up there like i said all three are really similar i just got like a little more like cooler aftertaste

and Managing Partner of advanced grow labs we hope you enjoy your tour today flower room - we just repopulated yesterday so we're starting week one we grow 85 and veg and then we switch over to the HBS so these plants will be here for a couple more days you'll see they're hooked up to basically just drip drip irrigation we have each row feeds differently depending on what strain it is the reservoirs are automated so they feed a couple times a day at the beginning a couple first couple of weeks of flower you know will feed it maybe once a day and then increase they're like you feeding today in this room we have six different strains some of the strains that we have in this room are fluid our super silver sour diesel haze we have some Starkiller behind us some alien rip ask gooey and yeah we grow in cocoa which is soilless media and pretty much has run drip to waste I mean drain to waste these are drying and curing room so what we do here after we harvest a room is we come in here and hang them on these hangers for about ten to fourteen days afterwards as you can see here Craig and Bryce are doing is they're trimming the the nugs what we do is we clean them up a little bit take off all the fan leaves all the sugar leaves all the excess sugar leaves we use for oil and other extracts I think you like to come in this room you know here's all the plants that we harvested and hung as you can see they're all strain specific all by the dates keeping them all together each strain dries differently than others so what we like to do is pay attention every day to him open up the colos a lot of us to breathe and whatnot and basically just check them every day [Music] just 14 ounces the drams and weigh it out each one of these is a different strain so we color coordinate everything and then these are just the drams that depends that Danielle is working on they go in and just how we securely packaged them and give them up to the dispensary and then they dispense them in this cartridge sorry 20 milligram a chocolate chip cookie dough a way out each cookie to about 30 grams with a very precise but we in measuring every single they would sign for them every cookie is 20 milligrams every four 40 milligrams every single time we package everything in chat so it's packaging individual like one cookie will go in the bag we seal it so bake so a kid can see you know which are just ridiculous let's rip into that [Applause] [Music]", "tsvjiDfXdDc": "hi everyone how's it going welcome back to our channel where we talk about various hot products in the market based
