This is our automatic irrigation and\nfertilization system, and building management system, attached here in the hallway to our flowering rooms. Our building, in addition to having solar\npanels on the top has nineteen (19) geothermal wells where we recycle the water from\nour HVAC system and LED lights.

that's it right there just kind of turn to dust I was reading the package it says this was packaged playfulness in January today is for for today is the 4th of April this was packaged on the 9th of January a belief there is no stinky left this is now dust it looks so good so far so chunky I know you got a package it you don't want the mold to come you gotta get rid of the moisture but again one of them humidity packs to keep that our each right and this problem doesn't happen I'm not sitting here looking at this [ __ ] dust for what was this you see that that gorgeous thing turned into this powder because this it's so dense that it won't bust and crumble but it turned to dust as soon as I hit it in the grinder because it's been sitting in the package unprotected for three months now not good get on your game get you the booze get you the Boveda and get that in there get that RH right because it we ain't got the right humidity in there this is always gonna happen and you can end up with beautiful we turn the [ __ ] I'm gonna roll this up and I hope the Turks haven't gone in the air as well that's something that happens when you grind up your weed put it in container joint does that happen to me about one of these from them wonder skunk it was a wonder that I was able to finish it it was zero take some talk about it taste like I ground up so release from outside growl from the ground stuff them into a pre roll smoke it got me high but man when you destroy something it started its life out soap that pre-roll was packaged in December I don't want Christmas sweet I don't want some [ __ ] that's four months old do you want to smoke a four-month-old joint go [ __ ] ahead but don't sell it to me that is just wrong I I smoked it on my way home yesterday because it's a freaking hour ride home and I don't want to get upset about it but it was a terrible experience when I lit that joint in the first pull was a brick weed I don't know if you guys remember the 90s 80s there was the bricks this big for the seeds and stems that's what the one disco tastes like I've had fire stone fire skunk it's floral gassy a fire strain they took something beautiful and ruined it because it wasn't packaged right once again inside with this nice container iron i like the package one little one gram boost or both okay anything that provides humidity anything that suits the the turret profile locked in there because I'm telling you once you grind that wheat up the terms are floating in the air they're going like this wheat right here thank God we're indoors because there's a lot of dust if you're collecting keep that this is keep dumping days a very disappointed so far let's keep going how long there she is this is the Black Mamba all rolled up we're all in black today we're rocking right we got the Black Mamba that black all black here we go with that GSR drip that's like this so it's normal people cultivate you know they got my favorite strain out there they talk to the home team I've already smoked some of that it's so fresh so clean so beautiful so we chocolate me me this right here I tried to bust a little up by hand and like in the snow I can watch them this will be an ask you a question so mark man you know on your videos I love hella entertaining I get good information about the weed but you will never talk about what their Crossway is how they're made just release a buyer back you can go online and you can look up what black mambas and you go online and make sure the people that cultivate be able to bag you up something four months ago three months ago and say here you go smoke this it's okay and pay us $50 for this old [ __ ] weed that turns to dust but you're not gonna find that in the magazine or online unless you highlight your point to create a stranger view your boy mark is here for you don't put some fighter this and listen with this dust does because the only answers I'll have for you does she look good does she taste a little misty burn right listen that's what we're here for weirdo that you know if they keep in the game correct because as you know now what happens you know boom she's going in the trash that's it I gotta get back into this um I'm interested on that but that I'm very interested on that flavor profile it just hit me it was very little puss-puss Quebec it the black mamba it has a very subtle battery must be very kind of taste enjoyed this this is a nice taste that's coming in at nineteen percent nineteen to stop there that's good numbers and you chasing the numbers based on the string takes on the flavor this is flavorful we're going to be saving bacon got a burning yes and as you could show up today to think that this was all blank we got that new black dark light we got that black mamba got that black we got that right I was rocking the black bands you know I want to say that this weed is good does she look beautiful I want to sing that this is something I would buy a gun I would if I got it backed up way sooner I don't want to smoke do you on though weed this right here could have been a great experience the Turks have gone to [ __ ] it got way too dry it sat there unprotected and now something that I believe was fire is now just turn it into something that's neither here nor there getting back it ain't good not like that joint that I sent the wonders cover that right there was such a disappointment 25 percent THC big numbers have the name anything sitting with the name of scope behind it it comes from a strong lineage not that one because it was for long sold and after a while no matter what package you put it in go Terps they're gone a flavour gone so if you just want to smoke something that tastes like dust a strike here copy some of that old weed I don't know why it sits there for so long right now there's people out there struggling struggling to get their hands on this medicine not everybody has a medical card not everybody could find out to cultivate like your boy did and cop this medicine right now take a look at that ash as always you know let straight clean straight White House keeps you baked you do your thing I don't think it's your fault I believe people need to get out there so get out there support your people that cultivate start coughing their blood take that real ride it's a beautiful right you've seen my first time when I went out there and we popped our very first bag of chocolate old G well we went to Leicester Massachusetts not leister definitely don't forget while you did and thank you but cinder because these guys are putting themselves at risk every day this thing that's going on around all of us so while you're out there say thank you I think you definitely stay tuned for the next episode we're in the dynamo Mensa yeah that come doll and you're gonna be visit my personal favorite chocolate you", "ESQcy20OCyY": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds today we're gonna try some black mamba never got from can abysmal oh my [ __ ] aim wow that's really [ __ ] strong let me grab a bun to show you guys let's take it up to the board check it out eh it's really dark looking you see little crystals on they're all over the place everywhere Hey there's little crystals everywhere well what a strong smell I see some hidden red hairs looks almost gray in some areas there's a little bit of purple down there I don't know if you guys could see it or not there's a lot of different colors going on in there but they're all it seems like all the colors are hidden under a gray hue hey a gray hue is that what you call it a great you I don't know whatever anyway pretty nice-looking eh I hope you guys got a good enough look I hope you had a good peep hey I hope you had a good peep I hope you had a good peep anyway I don't know if this is the middle hopefully it is whatever um I'm gonna grind this [ __ ] up and uh like always we'll get the show on the road Hey there it is all grinded up this is an early morning waking Bank featuring Black Mamba from can abismo [Music] [ __ ] line I got some gummy worms and a cold can of coca-cola hey it seems coca-cola pears laced with every strain of weaves if there is at least that's what I think [Music] anyway um anyone let me shut the light off I think there's too much light here that's better I don't think it changed much did it not enough light coming in from the Sun anyway um the smell it smells real nice hey it smells real good it's got a pretty strong smell though if you're trying to hide it from your your parents or somebody you're not gonna be able to it's pretty strong it's not very smoky it is that first when you blow it out but it kind of it kind of banishes hey it just vanishes it just [ __ ] disappears the taste I'm not too sure let's do another bong toke I'm not too sure what it tastes like to me the packaging says pungent sweet and grape I don't think I've tasted any of that stuff but then again my taste buds are a little [ __ ] hey um there might be an after effect of the grape you know what I mean but not grape it's kind of like if you had something that might have been great flavor but you had it a long [ __ ] time ago and the taste might still be a little bit you know a little bit of a lingering taste there there might still be a little bit of a lingering taste but not really grape is more of the after effect of eating it you know that kind of the fruity taste but not I do not explain it [ __ ] I'm not good at explaining those things and sweet well that would go along with the grape their the fruity taste and pungent I mean what the [ __ ] plunge it means so huh [ __ ] pungent hmm and effects yeah let's talk about the effects here it's this happy relaxed and sleepy I feel pretty [ __ ] happy I'm feeling really relaxed but the sleepy part I'm not feeling because I've got a pretty high tolerance a it takes a lot to uh you know to put me to sleep so maybe by the end of the day you know maybe at the end of the day I might be sleepy but right now I just [ __ ] woke up so it's not gonna put me back to sleep for a whole day it's gonna take a long time so yeah if you don't smoke it a lot I could tell that it probably it probably put you for a nap but I smoke the [ __ ] every single day you know what I mean I smoke a lot of weed so it takes a lot to make me sleepy hey just sayin let's see if there's any uh let's see if there's a refri a bonus toke hey there's a little bonus tok hey a little one I'm gonna fill my bowl back up we do another bong toke but before I do I hope I hope you guys can see my rating system here Donna still hasn't made it bigger for me says shitty decent and oh my [ __ ] and right now the black bomba I would give it somewhere in between decent and oh my [ __ ] it's right in between decent and oh my flock I would definitely buy this again I can live with this strain if if this was the last strain left on the planet Earth I don't think I'd complain I don't think you guys complain either or [ __ ] I think I sent that wrong a [ __ ] what I meant to say is I don't think you guys would complain either I hope I said it right that time see you can tell it's good weeds I'm [ __ ] up all my words anyway let me fill my bowl back up um it's got that nice gray look to it ain't it's not exactly green it's more of a I guess you'd say like maybe a military green hey a military green would that be like a darker green like a grayish color almost I think so maybe not [ __ ] anyway that's what it looks like though it's a dark green with with you know let's play it like I was saying earlier if you upgrade over it it's good camouflage weeds you wouldn't want to drop it outside you probably wouldn't find it again I don't know if that in that [ __ ] even made sense let me just fill my [ __ ] Bowl I like the way it grinds up it gives it a nice fluff hey when you grind up a little bud it fluffs up and you can tell that it's gonna go up you know it's gonna go pretty far like the pile I showed you a few minutes ago when it was all grinded up that was that was only three little buds make small little [ __ ] and a fluff trade up so I like that when it grinds up like that you know it's not too dry it's not too moist it's just perfect enough to fluff up for you you know it's fluffy hey [ __ ] I hope that makes sense to you guys I probably [ __ ] this review up eh let me start again I could probably do this better this smells strong but it smells really good and it starts off smoky but the smoke vanishes hey like a ghost on scooby-doo and [ __ ] vanishes it just disappears the taste a little bit like grape maybe sweet a little bit and pungent I don't [ __ ] know off to look that word up I'm not you're a pungent means I don't use the word pungent ever the feel and whatever happy relaxed definitely I'm definitely happy and relaxed huh too sleepy yeah I could feel that that's a thing but just like I said I have a high tolerance so it's not going to put me to sleep but it's going to take probably a day of smoking this before I get tired but if you don't smoke it a lot just probably a nap in your afternoon or even in your morning or probably within 20 minutes after you smoke it hey just saying am i rating I gave it between the decent and and all my [ __ ] you know it's really good and you should go and get yourself some you don't know what you're missing this is my first time ever having black mamba and I think I'm gonna add it to one of my to one of my [ __ ] hot I'm gonna add it to my list of favorites because I think this is one of my favorites now I like this one I drew [ __ ] but the toad twisters are coming out now hey [ __ ] anyway I really like this one this strain I hope I find some seeds in here probably not I haven't seen one yet [ __ ] I like to cross on my own hey I'm having a hard time finding good seeds though maybe it's just me but I could almost smell a hit the chocolate in there damn maybe not maybe I'm just gonna creating for chocolate and that's probably what it is but I think of smelling chocolate probably not but I think I am no well anyway sorry about the [ __ ] sirens under the Timmins Ontario

receipted discount caregivers in Tarzana California and I guess they have a new private label called The Syndicate because now all the most of the flowers I don't say all of them but most of them have this name The Syndicate and RDC has receded discount caregivers and they have been in business since the beginning out here in California I've been going there since like 2000 I think 11 I'm guessing and they had this all the way back in the old days and this flower has always been one of the ones that's consistently good and it's still going for you know eight years it's just unbelievable so this flower has it's a heavy hitter it has 27 point two nine percent THC and that's a really nice feeling it's a heavy hitter it's good for people who like to vapor or use flowers all the time and I would say this one doesn't really disappoint so today we're going to try it out of the vapor cup I've got it set to 3:30 so here we go Black Mamba out of the vapor Cup this flower makes a lot of eight and also if you get a chance to go down to proceed a discount caregivers or already see it's so cool right now they redid the building and you come in through a secret door it looks like a bookcase you push a red book and you go in what a good job these guys have done well and we do entertainment we're looking for the best it is black man but the best it's a really go but it's not the best out of a one to ten scale I give the flower a nine it's hard to find nines in the city it's definitely a go-to flower if you're in the valley and you're looking for some good flower try some black Mambo from

we will talk about one of the most anticipated debuts of this year easter released their first single called black mamba on the november 17th the mv is clearly an introduction to their world and i bet sm entertainment already planned a long story line for this group i will expose my theories about the mv please note that those are my thoughts and since i only have two brain cells i may be far from the truth but anyways let's get started the mv begins with karen looking at her phone in a classic subway she received an airdrop notification because black mamba wants to share something with her as soon as she clicked on the notification she was transported in another dimension since she is the one who clicked on the notification i think that karana is the channel black mamba used and will use to cause troubles between the members and their ai right after that we see ning who seem to be in a monitoring room receiving a lot of alerts on a computer as if a virus was coming i think ningning is in charge of the connection between the members in their ai winter is the most affected by the loss of connection between the members in their espa she seems to be sat in that corridor people are walking by her fast but she is standing still and it seems like she has a lot on her mind i think she misses her ai since she hadn't had enough time to get to know her avatar before black mamba interrupts the connection later in the mv she's still confused about who exactly is her avatar winter has to be the representation of what happened when the real members met their avatar for the first time if you remember the teasers karina talked with her avatar jesel rap with aegis l ningning sang but winter didn't meet a winter yet now let's talk about the chorus it starts with shizel's line neil you hockey sam kenji on black mamba if you have some knowledges of cory and you'll note that the past tenses used in this sentence could be translated to you've been tempted and swallowed black mamba i think that this is a reference to karana clicking on the notification i personally love this idea because this is like a modern version of eating the prohibited fruit the next sentence is you're wandering around quangia has to be about black mamba wandering in quang gaia and looking for another victim then the second verse starts with shizel she is talking about how exhausted the members are because they have to fight against black mamba she is telling that this is hard because the snake has been growing swallowing all of the greed this sentence makes me think about this cartoon because the snake also draws its strength from people's greed apparently ningning has also been tempted by black mamba but managed to not yield to temptation but karina did as you see in this scene only karen looks in the camera confirming that she is corrupted she has been tempted and failed to resist by the way the line she says just before the second chorus is similar to gisele's but a bit different remember gizelle said you've been tempted and swallowed black mamba bakarana says modengil samkiyabiro black manda which means it will swallow everything here the future tense is used because karana has already been bewitched by the snake so she talks like a disciple of her new master this breathtaking scene which probably represents 50 percent of the budget of the mv shows karana in another dimension although she has a crown she seems to be under the control of the woman behind her i think karana will be the undercover agent of black mamba the song continues on the same note the girls are fighting against the snake ningning wants to restore the connection and winter is confused as hell it seems like the snake is more powerful than he was in the beginning because the beautiful train is now dark and damaged at the end of the mv a shape is coming out of black substance judging by her hairstyle she reminds me of novice the avatar of who was introduced in my care in a video basically novice helped the avatars to contact the real members i think novice will come and maybe the girl's first comeback to help them but nothing is sure okay this is all i have for this song congratulations to the members for their debut and congratulations to the intellectuals who are standing espa i already really like this group and i can't wait to see what they'll show us in the future thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe have a nice day stay safe bye bye", "0NBGnjk5x38": "[Music] hi everyone so today I'm going to try the the Black Mamba from cannabis smoke here's a bud here I I have it it's very dark looking smells a bit sweet it smells like that you know down by the sound by the shore there where there's that long grass but it's in the the mud I can smell I could smell that in there so um I'm gonna grind that up I'm gonna grab my bong and give you guys a review on it okay so I have it grind it up my bowl I decided to put some try the ice thing in the bong I don't really don't know how much is gonna be in there cuz it's so flippin hot here today umm the smell of it grinded up it still has like that dirt with the long grass there by the shore I was talking about um and I'm not really getting the sweet anymore just smells like earthy cold bottled water my Tim Hortons coffee okay let's try black mamba from cannabis No a little bit strong there gives you a tickle back there uh I don't it looks more look it looks more smoky in there than it does in the air um I had to keep doing bong talks to tell you guys the full effect I guess and I decided to do the ice thing because some people said to me oh if you put the ice there cool down it's easier for you to inhale it's not working not working at all okay I can already feel it it's coming right into the eyes so that's good that's a it's a plus and you feel good hey if you're having a bad day get yourself some Black Mamba from from Canada smoke because that will cheer you up even though it's like I don't know oh it's 3334 here today that's in Celsius so if you're in the States watching it's probably in the 90s somewhere for you guys it's um I gets a strong I find it a strong like a strong smoke you know like if you're a smoker and you are smoking just like a regular and then there's how this the stronger smokes ball it's like a stronger smoke but it's a good smoke this is uh this is great I'm not sure what it smells like I think it smells bad in here but I'm not not really sure what this smells like I know this it's not smoky cuz it looks the same to me [Music] the taste I've addressed it's no I said the smell the taste is you dirt you can definitely definitely taste the dirt on this so that's the taste for me anyways the feeling I feel freaking great like this was your worries away yeah this this stuff is pretty this is good this is really good oh yes the we have that rating system you know what I am like it's over it's just about at oh my [ __ ] for me anyways I think this is good stuff I would recommend this I would buy it again I would tell others about it it's good it's so good that even though it's really hot here I don't feel hot right now it's that good yeah this is uh this is good good stuff Black Mamba here I'll show you guys again Black Mamba yesterday ed and I were discussing I said it probably makes you feel like you're a snake in the grass and he said it probably it's like probably named after the venom you know if it's a black mamba snake bites you and this is how you feel after [ __ ] you can't go wrong but I don't think so I think it'd kill us you would I go outside right now no if I did go outside and somebody were just start talking to me I would probably panic and if I definitely give it was like an emergency and I had to be out there well I'm getting some sunglasses first cuz yeah it's a really good strain I makes you happy and cheerful and you just feel great on it like there's no worries in the world on your shoulders but for me I feel like the snake in the grass just lay there all quiet bill even knows that you're there just and if you have to move you do it really slow so that's how I feel like it oh I was just thinking maybe it makes you feel like it's called Black Mamba because I like the snake thing I said you know in the grass and how ed said the lake or the venom whatever came I'm not going on the venom though I'm saying maybe it's called Black Mamba because even though you're in the grass just being real quiet and stuff you're like also like king of the like you're the almighty that's how you feel you feel really good like like I said if you're having a bad day smoke this if like I don't know if somebody was like saying bad things to you like kind of being bully bullying you or just me not making you feel good about like even the way you knew it wasn't true smoke this and you know what you you know that like they were just saying that whatever you know that you're better you know that you're you're fine you're good I do need a drink I'm a little bit see now I feel the heat again because I'm starting to get a little paranoid like a I say as I say this stuff I have like the paranoia back there and it's I don't know not really it's probably have some water though because kind of makes you dry maybe it's hitting me hard too because it's so hot here and you know they sometimes people say oh it hit you hard in the heat well maybe that's part of it I'm not sure wearing like a big the heat warning that we're in like it's hot but this is really good I'm enjoying this I just want to Cinda sit underneath the tree and cross my legs and like just look because it's good right I recommend this can abysmal this says you know what this is good [ __ ] oh let's see what okay flavor profile I should read this sweet I smelt the sweet when it was a bud not so much when it was grinded grape I didn't well you know like maybe a grape crush like maybe like that and mint smell like the dirt from the shore at the shoreline where the tall grass is with a grape crush that's how the bud smells effects happy happy is not the word you feel like overjoyed like you're just relaxed yeah yeah cuz remember I said it was gonna sit underneath the tree across the baby's legs and just look sleepy I probably went like the buzz wears off or down or whatever because you're just that like this black mamba not only makes you if you get paranoid you'll feel like the snake in the grass you're so happy and overjoyed and just even does it you know put on your shoes and like skip down the road cuz you're just this is good I like this um so look at that a like the can you see the ice well it looks bigger on there but you know just small little things but it's melting pretty fast okay so that is my review of Black Mamba from Canada so highly recommend it um you know well I was just thinking hang on this um you don't like the happy and I said it like I'm happy like I'm just smiling away this would be a good time if you wanted to get some good pictures done some black mamba and you'd be smiling in every picture there wouldn't be a bad there wouldn't be a bad shot oh yeah okay so enough of that so we covered the smell and the smoke gets not a smokey like it doesn't it's not staying in the air taste yes dirt jerk was the taste that stuff with the long grass growing out of it ah the feel and it's like I said it's just about at the oh my [ __ ] it's that I'm really liking this um the feeling I'm sure you guys know now that I'm just happy I think that's about it I think that's that's my review of it oh yeah before I go for me I wouldn't like have to do a lot of dog after ball after ball I'm good I'm I'm totally fine I can wait a couple hours and yeah okay so go get some that cannabis move Black Mamba Donna says it's really good so I'm going to know but I'm gonna maybe I'll sit outside under the tree and just look so that's it that's all bye", "Q-lwC3cX5mA": "[Music] hi Aaron capper for mary-jane news I'm here in sunny Manchester reported on a synthetic drug called spice has been causing major problems here in the city Piccadilly Gardens is synonymous with shopping and tourism but nowadays you'll often see users of spice among the shoppers in a zombie-like state to find out more we're going to speak to some people at the heart of the problem first of in a chapter Peter Morgan youth worker author of the spice boys marketed many years ago as a cheaper substitute to cannabis and had the same effect at the same same size I was slightly cheaper and was legal spice is probably closer to heroin and its effects in its hit and it's me in May 2016 in England and Wales we introduced the psychoactive substances acts which made new psychoactive substances include in spies a Class B substance what we're seeing since the act is a concentration on the street level market on the homeless community in Manchester and other cities in the UK for mental health issues I've seen young people's mental mental health deteriorate at a rapid rate would you say the high is the same some of the users say it is but when you watch how they switched off and then go down and hit the thing I just did but they said they've just gone that doesn't really happens we're kind of a shortly it's become very visible in Manchester I think we're seeing the same in some of the other cities in England and Wales as well thanks 5% of the young people who I know who I engage with you a street homeless or is foot accommodation and now on spice it's it's it's narcissistic it's the truth the other week I'll walk download a picture of a temple stone smoking is next we you know started feeling weird and it felt like when long as we shut him down I could feel like the longer the air coming out with long time a brain shutting down if you know what I mean it was like everything in a pastor's come back arm and I want some more I hit man I didn't know where or what in the world and literally for a diet it's basically a synthetic man-made evil drug but some estimates have been between 60 and 90 percent of the street at homeless and the prison population are using it and that's no coincidence because those populations define yourself it whether it's in a prison cell are on the streets there needs something which is going to kind of take them away from that reality and to block out that situation it really really bad epidemic at Normandy Manchester that one son he used to be people walking around selling smack brat cannabis now all you really spice by spice or he's not just people out on the street were taking it normal people day-to-day life has taken it I don't read beekeepers in cannabis or whatnot well it's a hell of a lot more dangerous and it needs it don't need stop it so it's quite obvious as a massive problem with this synthetic drug spice in Manchester we've been around Piccadilly Gardens respected professionals will also expect to people on the ground and users it wouldn't be on camera for obvious reasons but this problem is not just in Manchester it's only every city the UK is a huge growing

developing story our first look at the drug that's causing seizures hallucinations and sickness so severe people are on life support doctors say it's a bad batch of black mamba a type of synthetic marijuana 7 News reporter Jacqueline Allen live at denver health where more people are coming in tonight that's right you know I just checked in the last hour and total Denver Health has seen about 10 patients in the last 24 hours University Hospital has seen about 25 total so the numbers are going up and some of those people have been near death all because of a drug commonly called Black Mamba one of the patients that came in what may look like marijuana at this this pocket is the first video of a so-called bad batch of black mamba a university hospital I had never seen anything like that veteran charge nurse amanda poole first noticed patient after patient in the ER after smoking what's also called k2 spice or synthetic marijuana patients come in and have no gag reflex same story of denver health they're extremely combative psychotic episodes they are hallucinating suppressed breathing in the worst cases patients end up on life support the truth is is that these people are sick enough that if they didn't get to health care there's a good chance that some of them when i made it black mamba is actually a chemical combo sprayed on a plant colorado lawmakers made it illegal two years ago but doctors say the latest bad batch has people jumping off buildings walking into traffic and getting violent it's a combination of the hallucinogenic and the stimulant and so they're fighting things that they only see in their mind that nobody else sees and so we deal with the consequences of that and even though it's illegal records obtained by seven news show undercover police

University of Ottawa Heart Institute on behalf of Terry Messina our CEO and my co-chair for Grand Rounds Vince Chan it is my great pleasure to welcome Andrew Piper to talk to us today about the times they are a-changin a good quote from the bob dylan cannabis smoking and vaping what you should know we're very pleased to have Andrew with us as you know andrew is our former head of cardiac rehab and has a long history of drugs in sport and smoking cessation nationally and internationally as well as being a former director of our rehab program professor of medicine at the University our WA an honorary fellow from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and most is currently honored by being a chairman of the Heart and Stroke Foundation and we're looking for an educational and interesting talk today on cannabis smoking and vaping thanks Andrew thanks for coming well good morning and thank you for the compliment of the invitation to make this presentation when I received the invitation I thought possibly it was because I was the only person that was from the 60s still in the Heart Institute and I would remind you that if you're from the 60s you can't really or if you were from the 60s you really can't remember what happened there anyway so perhaps that was not the case so many of you will remember or perhaps many of you will be familiar may not necessarily remember Bob Dylan's and femme ik poem in the mid-1960s the times they are a-changin which was a plea to individuals in society at that time of great social tumult that they had better understand what was happening around them because otherwise they would sink like a stone to repeat Bob Dylan's words and so it's probably appropriate to use that kind of that kind of context to usher in a discussion about marijuana because the times they have a changed and has taken a long time for those times to change I remember as a medical student in 1972 a Royal Commission examining issues of drug use in society was struck by the then Prime Minister a prime minister trudeau which recommended the legalization of marijuana that was 1972 it's 2018 and and and here we are here we are today so it's also important I think for us to recognize that notwithstanding that there has been a very substantial change in the law Canada already had the distinction of having the highest use of marijuana of any of the developed nations and this data from the the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health just points out that a very substantial proportion of the Canadian population have been and presumably are still current marijuana users so as a consequence if I may be permitted a prediction that prediction will be that there won't be the tumultuous change that everyone has anticipated or predicted simply because such a large proportion of the population are already marijuana users in the likelihood of hundreds of thousands and millions of Canadians immediately rushing out to experience the effects of marijuana may have been over-emphasised in the press and elsewhere one can understand when you look at this data why it was that government said we have to do something about this issue and indeed this evidence has been growing since the Commission and mr. Dane Commission in 1972 and you see that the use of marijuana is very high amongst young Canadians but you also see that the consequences to the criminal justice system in Canada have been enormous and the gray bars in the graph on your on your right show those individuals who've fallen afoul afoul of the law as a consequence of cannabis possession and the turquoise bars indicate those who have actually fallen afoul of the law as a consequence of possession production a pardon me production or our trafficking and so one of the great import I if you will of making changes to the law was the fact that so many can were risking criminal records etc etc as a consequence of their use of this drug which in 1972 it was suggested in the royal commission was relatively benign and certainly less harmful than alcohol which causes so much carnage in our particular community so the federal government in introducing their legislation and developing this framework for the legalization and introduction of legalized cannabis pointed out that they will take measures to maintain and improve the health of Canadians by minimizing the harms associated with cannabis use and that philosophy of harm reduction underpins in part the arguments for the legalization of marijuana and as we will see when we discuss some other aspects of public policy that have changed very recently the harm reduction principle can sometimes get you into very deep trouble but more of that later I would recommend this to every health professional here today this is a two hundred and fifty two hundred and sixty page in Konya m-- prepared by Health Canada which is encyclopedic in its description of the nature of marijuana its implications for healthcare professionals and to the extent that it is possible it documents all that is currently known about the implications of marijuana use both for the populations and for healthcare professionals it's not available as a publication but it is a PDF document and those of you that are interested may wish to access this document and unload it for your own purposes perhaps a glossary is necessary because there is a complete language associated with marijuana use which probably will change and transform as social attitudes have changed and transform but these concepts revealed on this slide are perhaps not necessarily familiar to all healthcare professionals pot is marijuana from the leaves or the buds of the plant pash is marijuana derived from the resin scrape from the plant to joint as a marijuana cigarette a bong is some kind of a device that may be used to facilitate smoking marijuana a blunt is an empty cigar which is hollowed out and then stuffed with marijuana hash oil is a very gooey liquid made from the hash dabbing is the term used to describe smoking hash oil wax or butter is a form of marijuana that is very much like lip balm in terms of its consistency and Shatter is a very hard substance hard amber colored solid substance of hash oil and so this helps you navigate the language that you may encounter as you discuss issues relating to marijuana use with patience and there is their end pardon me is a very very important point never ever make assumptions and your assumptions about the likelihood of an individual using or not using marijuana are just that they are assumptions and I think it behooves all of us our spective of our clinical discipline here at the Heart Institute to try to understand whether individuals have been marijuana users a question that's much less laden now that the laws have changed in Canada so what do we know about this plant cannabis sativa and that's the most common form of marijuana but there are other strains cannabis indica a variety of other products that are available and that undoubtedly will become available as a mat a serie as an array of massive commercial enterprises begin to produce marijuana in a variety of forms and of differing compositions to meet the needs of a market or perhaps potentially more in the future to more in a more sophisticated fashion meet the medical needs of a community which begins to identify that there are some potential benefits associated with elements of this particular plant the leaves of marijuana contain eighteen different forms of chemicals and more than a hundred different plant based cannabinoids the principal cannabinoids that we talk about most commonly are of course Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC which is has the psychotropic properties this is the compound that is the high many other elements of cannabis do not have any of those psychotropic properties but in fact form the basis of those are of those substances would probably have distinct medicinal benefits though many of those benefits remain too to be identified and it's important to understand that when you smoke marijuana when you heat marijuana a variety of chemical changes take place not just as a consequence of combustion but as importantly as a consequence of pyrolysis which as those of you that can remember organic chemistry will recall it involves the transformation of the chemical structure as a consequence purely of heating and that transformation produces chemicals which are very different which are then ignited and combusted so that burning marijuana produces a whole array of chemical compounds many of which are are potentially very powerful therapeutically and and a number of which are are psychotropic so this is a very very very crude drug which contains a whole array of chemical and potentially pharmacological constituents the properties of which are only slowly slowly being understood and this is a theme to this conversation this morning which will be repeated on a number of occasions THC is by far the what best known and the best studied and is responsible for most if not all of the psychotropic properties of cannabis cannabidiol a kind of a bike Romijn can abide Jerell are also other constituents of of THC which also potentially have psychotropic properties but it's important to understand that as commercial organizations become involved in the growth the distribution the marketing of cannabis that a whole array of different cannabis strains will likely emerge as a consequence of the degree to which the public and potentially in the future health care professionals seek varying forms of this drug or these drugs in order to address various clinical implications or to the needs of the preferences of a consumer market which is now able to access these drugs as a consequence of the legalization of these products I am NOT gonna say very much this morning about medical marijuana that's terra incognita despite the fact that a whole array the pardon me there's been a substantial public clamor for medical marijuana that there are large numbers of individuals who take marijuana and use it ostensibly for medical purposes in exactly the same way that there are individuals in our community who drink a bottle of scotch every couple of days for medicinal properties and experience effects which they feel are beneficial to their health and now that's probably a bit of a lurid analogy but it's not far off the mark because there are many who probably would not enjoy the fact that they no longer have the the psychotropic effects of a drug which probably are not medicinal in any way if they were to rely solely on the cannabidiol and other agents which have phenomenal pharmacological properties or pharmacological potential and there are hundreds if not potentially thousands of compounds that could be constructed from the chemicals that form the basis of this plant which have a whole variety of therapeutic potentials and possibilities and much is to be learned in the years to come about these particular properties and you'll notice that anti ischemia it is one of those particular properties so if we're to understand more about the nature of some of these drugs it's also important that we begin to understand something about the endocannabinoid system and probably we're all familiar with the concept of endorphins the fact that our in our body we have this in our bodies pardon me we have this in Dodge in a system of opioid like substances which operate and attach themselves to various receptors throughout our body and and perform a number of physiological processes the endocannabinoid system is directly or exactly analogous to that system there is in our body a system it's ancient it's conserved throughout evolution of this process of these processes of ubiquitous liquid signaling I believe is the term that's used to describe them which has important regulatory functions throughout the human body incident in its entirety and and the ECS system has been implicated in a wide array of physiological and pathophysiological processes and the list is before you on this particular slide and you can read faster than that I can speak but you will notice that cardiovascular function figures prominently centrally in that particular list and so it's important for us to understand some of the principles of the endocannabinoid system and very simply put we have endocannabinoid receptors which have been very imaginatively named the cannabinoid 1 receptor in the cannabinoid 2 receptor we also have substances in our body which are the the classical ligands for these receptors and and amide being most prominent and 2 AG being the second and then there are a variety of synthesizing and degrading enzymes which operate to regulate the the performance of this particular system well knowing that one can then begin to appreciate how it is that cannabis exerts its effects how it is that cannabis may have pathophysiological consequences but also as importantly how cannabis may have very distinct therapeutic potentials as a result of the degree to which cannabis attaches itself to either of these two receptors so the cannabinoid 1 receptor is found in the central nervous system the cardiac and vascular systems and it contributes when stimulated to tissue damage it's felt to play a role in the production of atherosclerosis and so one can conceive that if we can block the cannabinoid 1 receptors from a cardiovascular perspective there may be very important therapeutic opportunities the cannabis 2 receptor on the other hand is the good guy cannabis receptor and it's found in the immune tissues principally and it facilitates healing it reduces the impact of tissue injury and so if we can stimulate the cannabis to a cannabinoid to receptor then you will also begin to appreciate that that we have a potential therapeutic agent and an understandable mechanism for its application very simply put you see that marijuana very closely or pardon me THC very closely approximates the chemical structure of that principal ligand for the EC s the endocannabinoid system and and amide and even i who graduated from medical school with arguably the lowest ever recorded mark and biochemistry can recognize that something similar about these which may may have some implication for for the the role that THC plays in a variety of physiological processes and it this graph just shows I think more carefully the nature of these particular receptors with particular relevance to to the heart and so you see that the cannabis to receptors are found throughout the myocardium and they attenuate a whole variety of inflammatory and other processes which we understand to take take place in the development of atheroma and the development of tissue injury that occurs as a consequence of ischemia etc etc and so the cannabis to receptor is the good guy as noted in this particular equation the cannabis one receptor is also present in the heart but this is a receptor which stimulate increases or decreases heart rate it can have an effect on on myocardial cell function it can increase tissue injury increase oxidative stresses etc etc and because of its pro-inflammatory effect we can see that it potentiates the damage that may occur to the myocardium or myocardial tissues as a consequence of of injury or insult what we also know is that cannabis smoke itself plays an important role in terms of the development of cardiovascular problems and here it's I think very fundamentally important to understand that smoking marijuana is virtually exactly the same as smoking tobacco in the sense that become question of an organic compound produces large quantities of carbon monoxide it produces large quantities of various carcinogens the difference being that marijuana burns at a much higher temperature than does tobacco and as a consequence the concentration of carcinogens the production of carboxyhemoglobin development of TARP like products is much greater when one burns marijuana then when one burns a commercial tobacco cigarette now the difference of course from a carcinogenesis point of view is that carcinogenesis occurs as a result of exposure and duration of exposure and frequency of exposure so individuals are not typically smoking forty marijuana cigarettes a day as is the case with many smokers and so there's a very quantitative difference but nonetheless there's a very substantial qualitative difference in the exposure that occurs as a consequence of somebody smoking a marijuana cigarette and merely the production of carbon monoxide etc etc can have an impact on the cardiovascular system irrespective of the constituents that we think of when we think about marijuana and so exposure to the smoke of burning can cannabis produces a variety of changes oxidative stress and inflammation electrophysiologic changes endothelial dysfunction etc etc and that occurs incidentally in association with minimal use of marijuana but individuals who have long term heavy frequent exposure to marijuana can anticipate as a consequence of those mechanisms changes in their vascular health with the development of an array of syndromes or pre syndromes that ultimately lead to cardiovascular consequences and in perhaps in a more elegant way this particular slide just outlines the various processes and the mechanisms which contribute to cardiovascular changes which ultimately find expression in a variety of cardiovascular disease states impaired oxygen supply increased oxygen demand effect on the vascular Vascular apparatus itself in changing vascular tone etc etc mechanisms which are familiar to you all as as you think about the implications of smoking anything on vascular physiology except that now we have this array of mechanisms also in play and having a potential effect well what do we know then about the consequences of marijuana in so far as cardiovascular health is concerned and I thought given that I was a child of the 60s in the 70s and indeed was in medical school I would at that during that time I would I would go back and look at some early early research and let me show you this paper or let me discuss this paper which was published in 1971 and I want to draw your attention to one particularly important point the marijuana which was used in this study contains 0.5 or up to 2.9 percent THC and what they noted was that marijuana smoking caused a significant increase in heart rate in the volunteers and the degree of tachycardia related to the to the dose of of THC and their conclusion was that the clinical significance of their finding was probably no greater than that for individuals whose susceptible to smoking tobacco or drinking caffeine containing beverages so a pretty anodyne consequences of using marijuana in this particular study but I would draw your attention to the fact that they said no different than smoking tobacco which really harkens back to the mechanisms that I just described a moment or so ago but recall that the concentration of marijuana in the study was 0.9 to 2.5 percent - I believe well today's marijuana ate your daddy's marijuana and these images from the sixties you know Allen Ginsberg and the Lovins and the pleas for legalizing marijuana took place at a time when typically individuals were smoking marijuana of up to you know to 2.9 1.9 percent THC and of course a whole lot has changed and because the concentration of THC in the marijuana which is now found in our streets and alleys across this country and elsewhere is much much higher and this estimation of 30% underestimates the concentration of what may be found in many commonly smoked or consumed marijuana products in Canada today which is another reason why the federal government sought to legalize marijuana with the hope that we they would be able to standardize doses and bring the levels of THC down by way of comparison the standard NIDA cigarette the National Institute of drug abuse cigarette which was used in many of the studies which examined the effects of marijuana was 2.5% and hydroponically grown BC bud you know typically can have THC concentrations of thirty five forty forty percent so a very different drug with a very different array of consequences for those who use this drug but let's go back to the literature and the year that I graduated from from medical school this particular study was performed in in Calgary marijuana and the cardiovascular system the conclusion of which was that there's really no data to suggest that the acute administration of marijuana presents a significant hazard to cardiovascular system of those using these products well flash forward to 2018 in this article which appeared in nature review which looked at marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids we'll come back to synthetic cannabinoids they are in an entirely different subspecies and weren't very very careful attention and again probably one of the rationales for the Lee or one of the arguments for the legalization of marijuana is that it would hopefully get rid of the synthetic cannabinoids which can cause such carnage in our community but the authors of this particular study there was slightly different conclusion with the legalization of marijuana physicians should be alert to the possibility that marijuana or its synthetic analogues might contribute to severe cardiovascular issues so we know and to summarize again we know that cannabinoid receptors are present in a variety of states and and that smoking marijuana produces a whole array of consequences that might contribute to cardiovascular health and indeed in this study which pardon me was part of that part me this diagram which was part of that Pasha review lists all of the varying cardiovascular consequences which have been attributed to marijuana and the important point to note in this slide is that the asterisks refer to the use of synthetic cannabinoids which are a hundred times more potent than the typical marijuana consumed by individuals today so produce very substantial a can produce its felt substantial consequences from a cardiovascular standpoint therefore when you go to the literature you are struck you are overwhelmed by an array of case reports letters to the editor etc etc all of which tend to emphasize with some degree of stridency often that there are cataclysmic consequences to using marijuana from a cardiovascular standpoint who wants to have cannabis induced asystole and etc etc so it's very important to try to deconstruct this literature and and my attempts to do so is in no way systematic but nonetheless I think fairly thorough in order to try to understand what is actually happening once again we understand that smoking marijuana produces these effects which we know can contribute to increased cardiovascular stress and and lead to in susceptible individuals cardiovascular problems and so it's very very important to separate the effects of smoking a substance from the actual pharmacological physiological effects of some of the other elements that are part of the substance that is being smoked nonetheless some researchers have looked at the impact of individuals who are frequent users of myocardial infarction followed them and and looked at survivability and have suggested that habitual marijuana users with who have had an acute myocardial infarction have an increased mortality rate over over the following 18 years but findings that did not approve uh pardon me approach statistical significance nonetheless the advice of the authors of this study consistent with the advice of the authors of many of the studies that I will show you are that it's given the prior evidence of acutely increased risk during each episode of smoking marijuana it's very important to caution patients with coronary artery disease and those at high risk of such a disease to abstain from smoking marijuana it's been shown for instance by by middlemen in his group that within an hour of smoking a marijuana cigarette your risk of the odds of your having a myocardial infarction are almost five times what they would be in the non marijuana smoking state and and they still remain elevated at one or two hours after after you have smoked two cigarettes and so there is a lower anginal threshold and those with chronic stable angina which is exactly what you see in individuals who smoked a tobacco cigarette so very important to make that distinction and when we begin to examine the impact of marijuana from a cardiovascular perspective it's very important to understand that most of the studies find it impossible to separate other forms of drug use particularly tobacco use amongst those patients who present having used marijuana with a cardiovascular effect because the likelihood is that many of those individuals are heavy smoke or smokers or heavy smokers and may come from circumstances in which is quite likely that other forms of illicit drug use are common but let's look at some of these the French have a very sophisticated system of pharmacovigilance and so they publish a great deal have published a great deal about the impacts of marijuana from a cardiovascular standpoint and and this is one of them a French soccer player I will make no comment about the abilities of French soccer players given the doctor in Mehsana is sitting in the front row but but this particular study involved an individual who is smoking up to 11 or 12 marijuana cigarettes a day as well as being a smoker of other more conventional products and presented with the findings that you see on your left and so this was reported as an exercise induced acute coronary syndrome but with a history of prolonged and massive cannabis consumption and this is not unlike the cases that are to be found throughout throughout the literature if we want to have a more more nuanced perhaps examination of this phenomenon this worked by to differ Lepus from Boston looked at em eyes occurring in all of those under fifty years of age at two academic hospitals to inner-city academic public hospitals in the United States individuals who presented with em eyes from 2000 to 2016 and their substance use was determined by self-report or toxicology stream screen and what they showed was that over a 14 or 15 year period yeah the association of marijuana in young adults with myocardial infarction began to increase their I think we can all see that there's an increase in that particular particular slope and when you look at individual cases and looked at those who were marijuana who are marijuana or cocaine free or using marijuana or cocaine you see that clearly cocaine figures prominently and all cause death and in cardiovascular death marijuana there are increases it would seem above those who are not using neither drugs but seventy percent of all of these individuals were smokers and it was impossible to distinguish those who might be using other drugs because and with compounding lifestyle factors and so once again we see that fairly common sensical recommendation that we should be much more alert when we see young adults with an acute MI to ask about marijuana and obviously other forms of drug use in order that might be able to be addressed another very substantial study is is the cardia study in in which more than 5,000 individuals were followed for more than 25 years and their lifetime exposure to marijuana was was estimated but the primary outcome of interest was the development of incidental pardon me of cardiovascular disease a very sophisticated study the conclusion of which was that neither cumulative lifetime nor recent use of marijuana is associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease in middle-age so we have isolated case reports which suggest that there are some issues here issues which one would predict and anticipate on the basis of any form of smoking behavior on possibly other drug use and then larger population studies which do not seem to show any significant signal and we can find this evidence in a variety of large studies the summary of such studies shows that evidence examining the effect of marijuana and diabetes hyperlipidemia mi stroke and CV mortality was insufficient because the studies are not adequately powered nor are they necessarily appropriately sophisticated enough to be able to distinguish marijuana from other forms of drug use when we look at issues like heart failure this study is rather intriguing it looked at a large number of individuals over a over a two-year basis followed them to see what the impact of marijuana use was on heart failure CVA etc etc and they found that it seemed that the prevalence of these syndromes was much was significantly higher in patients with cannabis use and cannabis use that is regular cannabis used seemed to independently predict the risks of heart failure and CVV and CVA in such individuals but with legalization and potentially increased use the recommendation once again is that further studies need to be undertaken in order that we might find more definitive evidence Christopher France and Frischmann in this pardon me highly regarded review also pointed out and made the arguments in two ways they said yeah there's some evidence that marijuana triggers a mais and it's been suggested that those that that use marijuana on a daily basis have a one to five to three percent annual increase pardon me incidence of cardiac events and that case reports in a variety of other studies suggest there's an association between marijuana use and CVD mortality they also pointed out however and this is a point that I should have made earlier that there's a there are significant animal studies that show that marijuana may have a protective effect on damage to the myocardium particularly in the situation of experimentally induced myocardial infarctions by ligating coronary arteries in experimental animals and that protective effect presumably occurs as a consequence of the stimulation of the cannabinoid to receptors but France and Frischmann also pointed out in a counter-argument within the same argument that there are several large studies which find no effect on overall mortality prominent a 10-year follow-up of patients in the Kaiser Permanente California Health System that found no difference in cardiovascular mortality between those who are marijuana users and non-users and interestingly they included this particular graph derived from another author that sort of set sought to put this into perspective and looked at the odds ratios on the horizontal axis and the population attributable factors on on the on the vertical axis and showed that marijuana figures hmm somewhere down here just behind having a heavy meal but obviously way behind cocaine use so lots of questions remain to be answered and of course given where we are who we are and the capacities and capabilities of this Institute some very intriguing research questions that we might begin to to address in the future I anticipated that there might be some of our anesthesiology colleagues here in the audience this morning and pleased to note that several of you are with us and and there is an emerging literature about the impact of marijuana use on on pre and perioperative implications and as you can see that they are listed here many of them relate to the irritative effects on in the branchial apartment the rest tree system is a consequence of exposure to just smoke but there are also a number of questions about some of the impacts of marijuana particularly in increasing heart rate altering blood pressure may mean that individuals need to be a consideration may need to be given as to the medications that might be used in such individuals and the fact that such individuals may also have much higher and need for analgesics both intra and post operatively and so obviously familiarity with cannabis use prior to surgery is a cynic when on of good anesthesiology and good good medical practice overall when we seek to examine further the nature of the risk from a cardiovascular standpoint this seminal article on marijuana which appeared in the New England Journal in 2014 is a fundamental reference and what the authors of this article did was to summarize the evidence and then identify their overall level of confidence in the likelihood that the marijuana is producing certain adverse effects and so we see that their confidence in the evidence about addiction is high no pun intended and it's been you know if you are a daily user of marijuana there's a 50% chance you're going to become addicted addicted in the classical appropriately defined form of addiction and up to 10% of marijuana users are predicted to become addicted and this has obvious implications for us in our community as potentially the use of marijuana increases very significantly there is also medium levels of confidence in terms of some of these other consequences and I would suggest to you that the level of confidence is probably rising in these particular areas particularly in the area of abnormal brain development we know that neuroplasticity continues until the age of 25 and and is very dynamic through the years of late adolescence and early adulthood and the evidence is quite substantial that the regular you of marijuana through those years has very ominous implications in terms of brain development in terms of the likelihood of developing other significant psychotic or other substantial mental mental health issues and this is an issue which our colleagues in unit on university campuses and college campuses are now seized with because they are seeing an explosion of mental health challenges in that particular population and fundamental among those challenges and central to those challenges is the use of marijuana marijuana and binge drinking to come back to another popular substance are causing havoc in Canadian University and college campuses I'm familiar with the university to the south of us that has several thousand students and had 41,000 visits to MIT to the student health services last year alone forty percent of which were from mental health issues and marijuana and binge drinking figuring prominently and both of them which explains why the Canadian Medical Association and submissions to the federal government at the time of consideration of the legalization of marijuana was so emphatic that the age for purchasing marijuana should be should be 25 we know that the the whole issue of diminished lifetime achievement is also a very prominent among marijuana users and you know there are various phrases he's a STONER Jesus donor that there seems to be an arrest in terms of ambition and overall achievement amongst those potentially amongst those who are heavy users of marijuana at a low age very low association with lung cancer purely on a dose-response kind of exposure kind of basis but what you do not see anywhere in this list is cardiovascular consequences and I think that underscores the fact that there's a great deal of may Sen big Uwe T in terms of the evidence that has been acquired nonetheless with the legalization of marijuana to repeat again we need to be much more sensitive to the fact that use of marijuana and particularly synthetic forms of marijuana maybe the underlying cause of cardiovascular events and pathologies a quick comment about synthetic cannabinoids these are known in the community by such happy names as k2 spice Black Mamba there seem seemingly innocent herbal products is the way the the usual trafficking sources and systems would describe these particular products but they can be up to 200 times more potent than standard THC and these are the agents that generally are very frequently pardon me result in four or five 14 or 15 year-olds presenting in emergency departments in acutely in acute states of emotional mental health devastation etc etc and one would hope that the legalization of marijuana will mean that these products obtained only on the black market will slowly disappear as a consequence of the ease with which people may find other forms of marijuana but individuals who are using marijuana today are used to marijuana of a certain potency and the products which will be available to them through legalization will not in their individual quanta necessarily have that same degree of potency so it may be a little naive to expect that there will be a substantial transformation of purchasing power purchasing behaviors pardon me so it's complicated it's very complicated lack of data the changing levels of THC inability to distinguish the effects of marijuana from other substances the fact that marijuana contains a whole array of carcinogens etc and intriguingly yeah there are some indirect effects of marijuana changing appetite increased body weight diminished levels of physical activity which themselves might ultimately contribute to cardiovascular consequences well at this point we've talked about nothing but smoking marijuana let's talk about ingesting marijuana which in many respects is a very much safer way to use marijuana as has been observed if yes if you're toke don't smoke and because there are safer ways to use marijuana in ingesting marijuana one of them but the challenge here is that the individual who consumes marijuana does not have the opportunity or the ability to very rapidly assess the effect of marijuana when you deliver any drug via smoking you're delivering a drug directly into the arterial circulation and seconds later it's in the addiction centers and other centers within the brain so you know what's happening in smokers of tobacco certainly in smokers of marijuana can titrate with exquisite precision there the intake of the substances that they seek either nicotine or marijuana etc when you eat something a marijuana cookie a marijuana brownie marijuana whatever gummy bear the effect or the impact may not be appreciated and very typically what has happened in the past is individuals consume marijuana brownies marijuana cookies nothing happens so they have some more and nothing happens and so they have some more and then WHAM and so this has the consumption of edible marijuana products has obvious implications for issues like abilities impairment etc etc because of the difficulty controlling the dose when using these products again a potential advantage of a system of legalization which will make marijuana of only certain concentration available in which will permit the manufacturer in the merchandising of products that have certain concentrations of marijuana and you will be able to recognize these particular products by these identifiers which have now been mandated by healthcare by Health Canada the federal government that must form the basis that must be part of the packaging and the promote and the material in which these particular products are sold marijuana is metabolized basically by by the liver and THC hydroxy THC disappears fairly rapidly but part carboxy THC persists for a long time and it's stored in the fact and so a daily marijuana user will always test positive for marijuana as a consequence of the storage of this metabolic product of THC and that has had implications over the years in many particular settings some of you may remember the name rostra bagley a.d which is a name I recall with some what's the name I recall and and so this obviously has connotations for law enforcement agencies who probably are in the process now applying very arbitrary levels of THC carboxy THC the issue here is that regular users of marijuana who may have levels at this point are generally may not be impaired incidental users of marijuana who may have levels at this point are very likely to be impaired because tolerance develops to the psychotropic properties of this drug in the consequence as a consequence of exposure so some quick messages if you don't use marijuana why start many of us have got to you know however many score years and ten without marijuana and seem to have done very well and no particular desire to rush out and be the first in the line to whatever and I think when you're asked questions by patients who may reflect those circumstances I think that's very good advice if you smoke marijuana don't smoke switch to vaping because the delivery of a drug produced by vaporization as opposed to combustion means that you're not exposing yourself to those inevitable products of combustion which can be so problematic particularly from a cardiovascular standpoint and/or if you smoke marijuana consider switching to ingestible x' it's important that we understand the very profound implications of marijuana use by our teenage children and young adult children we do our pardon me we must appreciate the potential of for cardiovascular issues and certainly the synthetic cannabinoids are our products too to be completely eliminated hopefully there are other issues however with the legalization of marijuana this is going to have an impact on our ability to help people stop smoking because so many people mix marijuana with tobacco and smoke tobacco throughout the day and occasionally one of those cigarettes contains marijuana interestingly enough many such users and we see them in our smoking cessation clinic want to stop smoking tobacco because they understand the consequences of tobacco smoking but the likelihood of our being able to help them successfully stop smoking if they are using marijuana in this way is very low in comparison to our ability to help other smokers the question of addiction cannot be avoided or cannot be escaped no one wants to become addicted to a particular drug and no one wants members of their families their neighbours or their community to have high levels of addiction impairment we'll talk about in just a second and it's always been anticipated that the legalization of marijuana will eliminate the contraband black-market marijuana and put out of business those happy people who traffic in marijuana and so many other unbelievable substances that may be a very optimistic perspective given the fact that it's very very very easy to obtain marijuana in the community today very easy marijuana of a certain degree of potency and many of today's contemporary marijuana uses I would suspect or suggest won't feel it necessary to find the particular store or order the particular product that that they seek and and so therefore those happy suppliers of marijuana of a certain type in certain potency well in all likelihood remain in business the entry interaction and the relationship with smoking is is very complex and of great significance and I know you expected me to say that but I'm saying that we have seen for the first time as a consequence I would argue of governmental indifference you know the government said we're gonna have federal government told us we have a brand new reinvigorated tobacco control policy and we're gonna take advantage of the recommendations that came from the endgame summit which suggested that we want to reduce smoking to less than 5 percent by 2035 we're not going to get anywhere close to that unless we become more resolute in addressing tobacco related issues as the principal preventive public health challenge in our community and you see this data which shows this particular uptick but there's more challenge data emerging and we'll come to that in just a second as we talked about vaping and electronic nicotine delivery systems ends have now become commonplace in the market and they have changed dramatically and they have changed in a very sinister fashion in the case of one or two products which will describe in a second so the whole rationale of these devices of the juhi to solution usually propylene glycol which is the solution that's used to make the fog and discos and onstage shows and at rock concerts you put some nicotine in that you heat it it's vaporized you inhale the nicotine and you're not inhaling any of the products of combustion so from point of view of carcinogenesis there is a reduced risk but the products of these devices also have an impact on a variety of other tissues and in the haste to talk about harm reduction many people have over particularly regulatory authorities have overlooked the fact that yeah cancers a horrible consequence of smoking combustion products and so if you switch to vaporize products you eliminate or you dramatically reduce the risk associated with combustion but sixty percent of more of the health consequences of smoking are not cancer they're chronic respiratory disease and they're cardiovascular and there is increasing evidence that the products of these devices pose particular risk for those with cardiovascular disease and we'll see about that in a second and here is the schema which talks about how products that are involved that are part of this e cigarette aerosol can have an interaction with a whole variety of mechanisms which we know are common in terms of the genesis of myocardial partly cardiovascular disease with a particular emphasis on myocardial blood flow in myocardial ischemia so these devices are not anything like the first sig alikes as they were called which first appeared on the market these are very very sophisticated and can cost hundreds of dollars and involve all kinds of controls to increase the voltage increase the temperature increase your exposure to nicotine you can buy solutions that vary in their nicotine concentration so you can dramatically increase the the the intake of nicotine they are also virtually totally unregulated and and this is a cause for for some concern so what do we know about e-cigarettes in general well yeah there's a harm reduction potential but that harm reduction only occurs if individuals switch exclusively to the use of these device and forego the use of combustion tobacco products and that doesn't seem to be happening the overwhelming majority of II device users become what we call dual users with some interesting implications as we'll see in just a second we also know that the tobacco industry is now moving like gangbusters into this area of the marketplace and they have no interest whatsoever in helping individuals stop smoking and so in some respects I would suggest that there's been a rather neglectful indifference to the emergence of these products on the part of regulatory authorities who have I heard someone who I can identify in a position of authority a week or so ago say well this is these aren't a tobacco problem and all I could think about how naive can one possibly get and what have we forgotten in the 20 or 30 years where we made substantial progress against the use of these devices the likelihood of a non-smoking teenager beginning to use these devices as a consequence of fascination curiosity whatever whatever has grown dramatically as we'll see with very sinister consequences and those numbers have increased very substantially in most developed nations where these kinds of products are available with obvious implications because it takes only a day or two to get addicted to nicotine and many of these young people migrate to combustion tobacco products more data in a second what we see from this data provided by dr. Robert Schwartz at the Ontario tobacco research unit is that probably 65 percent of those who use these devices continue to smoke as much if not more when they are using these II devices and and that continues as long as these individuals use these devices and there is emerging evidence or partners good evidence that the use of these devices actually reduces the likelihood that an individual will make a smoking cessation that attempt and we see that from this data from seat ads the Canadian tobacco alcohol drug survey that 15 percent of those using e-cigarettes in the 30 days prior to this survey had never been smokers 133,000 that's not an insignificant number when you can consider the size of this particular survey and the date at which this survey was administered because while government's sleep these products have emerged in our community and I don't know how many of you are familiar with I costs and with Jul but let me tell you your teenage children are familiar certainly with jewel and jewel is a very sophisticated device which delivers more nicotine than a conventional cigarette we used to talk about the cigarette as being the most sophisticated drug delivery device in our community outside of the implantable insulin pump jewel has supplanted that reputation this is a very elegantly packaged very sophisticated li marketed product which has found particular take-up amongst teenagers across North America and elsewhere in the world i costs uses a heat not burn strategy in which let's call it a tea bag containing tobacco which is heated in the vapor that is produced contains nicotine and it too is now starting to be very aggressively marketed i cost is owned by a tobacco company Jules a company formed by two individuals a Stanford graduate and a Harvard graduate who said we can figure out a way than which we can deliver massive amounts of nicotine and we can market the living daylights out of this in a very fantastic and attractive way and boy have they succeeded so this article in the New England Journal on August the 22nd pointed out that the use of pod mod e cigarettes was becoming pandemic in the United States and the picture on the right doesn't portray but it shows teenagers smoking in the car pardon me Julie as they would term it in the classroom a phenomenon which is occurring in high schools in this city and so Joule is a very sophisticated electronic device which heats a solution apart me a cartridge containing nicotine and is available in Canada in a whole variety of flavors cucumber mango peach I'm probably neglecting a few menthol etc etc etc but back to the story in the United States the FDA on September the 12th just two or three weeks after the data produced in the New England Journal of Medicine said we've got we're given these manufacturers 60 days to explain to us how they're gonna stop marketing these products to kids or we're gonna take them off the market and within a week or so the manufacturers said we will no longer sell flavored products we will no longer market them to to teenagers you know in in the following kind of ways now the validity and and the effectiveness of that approach remains to be seen the manufacturers of jewell in canada did nothing the federal government in canada has done nothing despite the fact that the use of these devices is is growing exponentially amongst the teenage population in our community and while this product was only introduced in Canada in September the sales have just absolutely taken off there are high schools in the United States where now all computer charging devices have been removed from the school simply because you recharge these devices using that standard USB like-like-like device I have been in communities in Canada recently in the last few weeks where people are saying gee the hockey team is jus lling before the game during the game and after the game and kids are using these devices in our high schools what are you guys in the smoking world doing about this and and so there's a recognition that there's a problem in our myths which really needs set really needs attention and not yet in publication but these are excerpts from the manuscript and I promised on a stack of Bibles I would not show any numbers is this work by David Hammond at the University of Waterloo showing that there is preliminary evidence that the use of these devices with higher nicotine concentrations is now increasing the intensity and frequency of vaping we may be spawning a new generation of smokers as a consequence of the advent of these products in Stan Glantz who's a very accomplished tobacco researcher has looked carefully at the issue of e-cigarette use particularly as it relates to myocardial infarction and in a recent publication pointed out that the dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes which is very common as we've already noted is actually more dangerous than using either product alone as a consequence he suggests of some of the products which are released in these differ from these devices which also have potential or have actual cardiovascular impacts and he wrote in another article that these devices deliver a whole array of problems that can increase cardiovascular risk knowledge is the issue with youth notes that the tobacco industry is marching in to occupy a very important part of this place 93% of e-cigarette users in the United States continue to smoke the odds of quitting are 28 percent lower and those who use these devices and twenty five percent of youth UE cigarette or II device users would not be likely to start to use these to ever start smoking so a very substantial problem and I can only pray that Health Canada and those who have a regulatory capacity are aware of what is happening here one go to your next gas station and I will guarantee you in many our gas stations on the pump there will be an ad for Joule in the convenience stores in suburban malls you will find product display paraphernalia which rivals the power walls of the days when tobacco advertising was permitted it's as if we've learned nothing after decades of understanding how the tobacco industry circumvents health related regulations and and rules and the result is it could be catastrophic quite frankly and I I don't I exaggerate when I say that given we know are the inevitable consequences of tobacco addiction Canadian smokers lose 10 years of life expectancy as a consequence of their tobacco addiction so this is a very substantial public health issue so to summarize these do not they eliminate carcinogens but they contain compounds with respiratory and cardiovascular impact you'll users are most common and may have additional cardiovascular risk and there is very substantial evidence of increasing rates of adolescent smoking inextricably tied to the degree to which in a few months products have come on into the marketplace which have captured the attention and the purchasing power of teenagers today so I leave you there with to suggest that the transformation that is occurring as a result of the times having been changed mean that there are particulars for us there are particular opportunities there are research opportunities galore in trying to assess the cardiovascular impact of marijuana use and we are well-equipped in this in this in our setting to be able to address this but there are also very substantial public policy challenges and once again I think the health community and health organizations can play a very powerful role in advocating for the public policy instruments which will be necessary to control an existing epidemic and an epidemic which is now emerging in our midst unfortunately the tobacco industry has been unparalleled in terms of its ability to subvert enlightened or imaginative public policy in terms of the regulation of their products if forty seven thousand people a day were dying a year were dying in aircraft accidents in Canada do you think our federal government would be doing anything about it if 47 thousand people a year were dying as the consequence of the use of other consumer products would we be you know talking about slogans and education programs and so on no it's unbelievable to me that tobacco and tobacco related products have have withstood and escaped any form of the kind of regulations which in an enlightened intelligent community we would apply on products char obviously and incredibly dangerous so public policy changes the times they are a-changin unless we are aware of these kinds of changes and their implications we will in the words of Bob Dylan sink like a stone and I don't want to sink like a stone thank you very much for the invitation and to your attention [Applause]", "ScJIPNCENZo": "[Music] you already know by now that espa made its mark on their very successful debut with black mamba but what you don't know is the meaning and the title hints that the groove left in their music video let's start with number one espa's official symbol in the beginning of the music video we can see the girls with their respective symbols karina has the heart symbol ning ning represents the butterfly giselle has the moon sign and lastly winter has the star symbol [Music] number two esva's universe the meaning behind the group's name espa is derived from the words avatar experience and aspect it means to be able to experience a new world through another avatar of yourself in the music video we can see that the avatars are trying to communicate with them and when their avatars joined a different world was unveiled wherein sm entertainment called it espis universe it showed that espa is truly a group for the members of the real world and the avatar members of the virtual world coexist supporting one another and they are able to promote together a dynamic identity number three the black mamba sm entertainment defines v-block mamba as a threatening existent to the world and a hinge into the connection of espa and a their avatars as it travels to their universe the girls express hate to the black mamba with the lyrics i'm viespa there can be two monochromed colors this is evolution the black mamba's existent took over the neon color universe and transformed it into its very own dark world number 4 takeover when the black mamba finally took over it altered the girls in their surroundings the train was dark and the garden was covered with a black mambas venom number 5 meeting with the avatars with the following lyrics is the me in the mirror you is it just a distorted vision if i could connect with you again i want to meet you now the girls asked avatars for help to regain their power against black mamba but only a karina and a winter was shown in the music video number six another avatar in the ending we can see the train remain dark and an unknown avatar was born in my theory i believe espa lost their battle against the black mamba and the black mamba successfully took over the espa universe and made its own avatar number seven is the avatar the next espa member recently it was rumored that sm entertainment is allegedly planning on adding three more members making espa a 7-member group in my theory maybe the new avatar in the ending is a clue to a possible new member this happened before with red velvet when yary was spotted in their happiness music video it left a clue that yary will eventually be a member and it was confirmed one year later when you're officially joining the group in 2015. number eight kwang yeah they said in the song leaving another clue which many fans speculated that it is an acronym of a seven member group k for karina w for winter and ferning ning g for gisele members with initials a y and a are left number nine espa joined the sm culture universe in super m's one music video a scene where taemin pulled out his phone revealed espa's official logo and the garden train used in especial black mamba music video was first seen in nct u's music video for make-a-wish later on espa joined the trend and featured boa and their black mamba's ending scene [Music] number 10 monster rookies in just nine hours espa broke the all-time record for the fastest debuting music video to reach 10 million views in kpop history and within 24 hours it had 21.4 million views on youtube owning the highest 24 hour view count for a debut mv in kpop espo also landed a number four spot on the list of 2020's most viewed girl cube music videos and also has the most viewed sm entertainment girl group music video in the first 24 hours espa is also the first female rookie group this year to reach 1 million followers on instagram you know a powerful debut indeed and that sums up my own envy facts and theory about espus black mamba if you enjoyed watching this video give this video a thumbs up and if you want more espa content consider subscribing to this channel

different and for someone using the vaporizer oil cartridges stealth is often the most important priority you have zero odor folks who live in apartment buildings can use the oil cartridges because

[Music] so [Music] well hello there here we are again another live stream from the new studio of pro cannabis media this is cannabis chat and i'm jimmy young the founder of pro cannabis media very happy you're joining us here on a wednesday we call this professor weed wednesdays because we focus on education and how important education is to the cannabis universe because and who better who better to have in studio than a director of training and development someone who really knows education about the plant from our friends at revolutionary clinics his name is andrew elk andrew thank you so much for coming in today thank you jimmy for having me i'm really excited to be here and it's interesting that you are here and this is kind of goes to how far we've come as a covid engaged society the last public event that i was at was the open house when central square opened up for rev clinics i believe it was march 6th it was a thursday yeah and we interviewed you there yeah yeah we did i had much shorter hair there yes you had much shorter hair then and good for you for growing it out and letting it go because you said to me on the phone you hadn't got a cut no i have not gotten it cut it started as a joke and now it's a hairstyle and now it's part of your your style and you're looking good for you and i also notice you've got your red bow tie on which is the same bow tie that i saw you when you were demonstrating the bubbler on the video that's on your website there's significance to the bow tie yes so bow ties are my thing i used to wear straight ties every day for about two years so a bow tie is actually less work than a straight tie it doesn't bounce around as much you don't need to have a tie clip but the red and black are the rev clinic's colors so i love this bow tie and it always gets a laugh out of people my late father used to wear bow ties all the time and if i had to tie it i probably could but that was before the arthritis gripped my fingers let's not go there okay um so what we do here just so you know right off the top is i kind of give some of the news of the day there's been some news i'm sure you've heard that last night in cleveland ohio there was a little event between the president and the democratic nominee for president joe biden former vice president joe biden and president potus we don't like to even name who that is because he doesn't have respect for that office why should we give him respect yes that's how i feel and certainly he his bullying tactics were on full display last night in cleveland and speaking of cleveland in about an hour and a half from now we'll be talking with the director of education for the cleveland school of cannabis they're friends of ours they follow us we hope to be working with them throughout this this ongoing venture of pro-cannabis media and that's lisa zwerner and she'll be joining us via zoom and we look forward to that as well she'll talk about their curriculum and why that is one of the fastest growing schools of cannabis in the world which is kind of exciting really exciting so we'll be talking to you now um let's get back to uh android well let me let me rephrase it i'm gonna go back to my news because there is a news item that is that is definitely worth mentioning here in the cannabis universe and it has to do with the government of the united states and the fact that once again another covid bill is being introduced to the congress and sure enough the word cannabis is in it 62 times and only the republicans know how many times that words in it because they counted it okay and they made a big deal over the fact that well cannabis is mentioned more times than jobs uh excuse me guys the idea is to hire people in the cannabis industry as it expands thus creating jobs thus creating taxes to undo all the things that the that we haven't been able to get done in washington dc for a long time because of this complete stalemate that has been going on now for a couple of years certainly since the house has been controlled by the democrats and by the way this is not a political show i am not going to point fingers and i'm not going to name blame this is where we are right now we're in a free country we get to talk about it but andrew i'm going to guess since you are in the business how frustrating is it that it isn't expand is not as it it's not expanding as much as it could oh it's incredibly frustrating i mean we in massachusetts have learned so many lessons from california from colorado every state has different different laws and legalities around what allows a business to open what allows you to conduct a transaction but every state in succession has lessons to be learned for others i know that pennsylvania and michigan are both looking at expanding they're both ones who've mentioned looking at massachusetts as a model for how to work and operate and open successfully i'm really excited that we're continuing to see incremental progress but that's what this is is incremental not expansive no it is not and you know as we know if you watch this show or have heard me talk revolutionary clinics is a medicinal cannabis dispensary that is correct in somerville with two locations in cambridge one in central square and one in fresh pond i have been in each one but my go-to dispensary is fresh pond in cambridge um it's about 15 17 minutes from my house and just for the record i drive by about four other dispensaries thank you get there okay thank you very much i support the cars as it were and sure enough there's something that just came out today about uh the effectiveness of cannabis for migraine pain now do you suffer have you ever had a migraine i've been very fortunate not to have migraines but i've known people my whole life who found it i know someone in the room who suffers from migraines let's just say i will not name who it is but he's in the room and i know for a fact that it does ease some of the debilitating effects that migraines have i've seen what happens to people when they get migraines and they just have to shut down and go into a dark room and i believe anything that can be done to help that and sure enough this journal of this was 2019 the journal of pain conducted a study which found inhalation of cannabis to decrease headache and migraine pain up to 50 percent uh this is a new study that has come out and sure enough that too supports some of the old studies this is uh migraines effect just so you know 39 million okay and it does say this recent study collected data from 10 000 migraine sufferers okay which is pretty extensive right uh they say about 8 and 10 or 82 have said they have found relief from the consumption of cannabis it's a prominent treatment option for chronic pain patients especially for migraineers i didn't even know that was a word my grainers yeah but that's what it is and that um that came out today as well um jimmy i mean i don't think it's terribly surprising right that cannabis is incredibly effective for pain management or for migraines but what i think is so exciting about this is this is scientific double-blind study evidence for what we've known anecdotally for a really long time that cannabis is useful for a myriad of conditions pain management chief amongst them right and that's i qualified for that just because i've had four surgeries in 20 years and it was rather easy when i walked in i showed on my fingers and hands and they went here you go and i it's all about maintenance when you get older when you get more mature okay it's about maintenance of your pain everybody has aches and pains some have chronic pain that is just rears its ugly head at the weirdest time like in the middle of the night i wake up with pain in my fingers and it wakes me up at night so again i take a ton of cbd oil i take my turmeric or is it turmeric or turmeric it's that orange spice thing and i take you know straight cbd dropper two and then i have a two to one or a one to one whenever i consume but but you're not alone i think most people especially in the medical community who are using cannabis and there is an enormous population of people in the medical cannabis community who are finding relief and help from cannabis for most of those people and a whole bunch of other people who don't have their medical card the real benefit of cannabis is quality of life improvement you know maintenance like what you're talking about it's about maintenance and and it is quality of life and also one of the things we do like to do here is we like to balance our feelings about this because it does not cure everything no and it can be abused if you use it too much and this is why i preach responsible use right you know it has a medicinal effect therefore you're really self-medicating right right absolutely and and you have to learn what your own body can handle and what your metabolism will handle and you know what might work 10 milligrams for me might wipe somebody out completely or not even affect them at all right i mean i know grown adults that they can take 50 milligrams a day and function and that is an unbelievable thing when i hear about that oh yeah but it has to do with the fact that their bodies are now used to it so their endocannabinoid system is absorbing the amount and that's what it takes to balance their system right i mean any drug out there you're going to build up a tolerance over time that's perfectly typical um and with cannabis it's really about you know starting low going slow figuring out what works for you the beauty of a medical card or operating in a state that's decriminalized and has legal operators is that you can ask questions you can go into a store you can you can uh have a virtual consultation these days um and you can find out what works for you let me ask you about virtual consultations because i know because of covid now revolutionary clinics and a lot of medicinal dispensaries and adult use recreational dispensaries too have gone to this curbside pickup right okay so if i wanted to have a consult how does one go about doing that at rev clinics is it an email and how do they go about doing it so it's all through our website basically you can go onto our website there are a couple ways you can do it there's immediately a little chat robot that engages you and you can say i'd like a virtual consult and you'll basically get pushed to a scheduling calendar function that will allow you to book an appointment with a real human being who you'll sit across the screen from and they can spend 10 minutes 40 minutes an hour an hour and a half we've had an enormous like positive feedback swell from people as we've offered this option right um and the other thing that as a medical dispensary we were serving a medically um fragile like patient base right our customers are people with pre-existing conditions with comorbidities um so we had to really be purposeful in how we were going to continue to operate continue to run our business and protect both our customers and our staff i'm really proud to say that we've had zero cases of community spread within our organization we've locked down we've taken action and i i really see us as a model i see other shops frankly clothing stores um restaurants that don't have the same that have not taken the same level of care that we have right and massachusetts as we know was really one of the first states to really have it bad along with new york city right and you know like i said i remember that week you know that thursday was the last public event that i was at right the following thursday was the last we talk live that we did and that was in quincy we had a studio we rented in quincy and and then we all went into the you know the covet quarantine and my partner in crime kurt dalton from cannabis.net and i have done all of our new shows via zoom and a little bit later we'll be using zoom to get to the director of education it's a great news gathering and talk show gathering you've seen so many webinars i think you guys have run a few webinars too yeah um i don't i will say this i miss the interaction i think that cannabis as a social entity uh it has definitely taken a hit i was reading an article recently about um uh the socialization aspect of it that you're not sharing joints out in the public you're just not right okay uh and that was always part of the culture right absolutely you know and i use my when i happen to be in a group and i am happy to be recreating um i use those filters so that everybody has their own filter exactly and use the widget too i'll throw that in there as a as a little bit of a plug for them but anyway um the socialization aspect has had and going into the dispensary and having that one-on-one has has taken away a little bit but i like the fact that you guys are making your people available online to those and i wonder if there's an opposite effect too right because there are certain people out there that are still a little uncomfortable walking into a dispenser even if they had their medical card you know and they know that they're on camera right and security and what have you and you know i understand all that so um we miss that right right and and eventually massachusetts will have social clubs eventually eventually i never thought eventually we'd have legal adult use cannabis in my home state the fact that we're talking about social clubs i'm just going down one thing and eventually we will have that it'll probably get there town of uxbridge or something like that but another reason to go out to the tiny town of uxbridge and visit our friends caroline's out there but we're getting closer and closer to the 420 mark and this is the time when i get to enlighten people now i'm going on a limb thinking you know the origin origination of 420. oh god well i've heard so many stories but yeah please tell me tell me as we as we warm up the harmonica okay uh the origination it's from a group of young men from san rafael california they were in high school in 1971 right and at 4 20 in the afternoon they would meet at the louis pasteur statue and they would catch a buzz after school so it was hey 420 hey 420 sure enough the police picked up on this and that became 420 going on outside this you know not necessarily at that place but that was the call if there was public consumption of cannabis there's a 420 going police code yeah yeah police code right uh so those are the waldos and that was in 1971 wow which does coincide with the year that i first tried it wow in eighth grade i was 14 do the math of 63. okay bottom line is that was code now in cannabis time to go out and catch a buzz and chill out and relax well when i was growing up it was a song called shanty by jonathan edwards and it was played on an am daytimer i'm going to guarantee i'm going to call tom schneider out here i guarantee he remembers wcas in cambridge it was a 7 40 a.m daytime radio station and they used to play shanty in the afternoon or not necessarily in the evening but because they were on on in the evening as soon as the sun went down that the radio station shut off but it was an alternative rock station jonathan edwards is from new hampshire he had a hit song called sunshine go away today don't feel much luck anyway this is the cult song of my generation and this is jonathan edwards performing at the portsmouth new hampshire public radio station take check it out and enjoy shanty yeah this is a tune that i wrote back in 1909 i've forgotten [Music] we had a saying in our old old band one of my first bands in 1966 or so what are you gonna do tonight oh just you know like every other night just gonna lay around the shanty and put a good buzz on [Music] gonna sit down in the kitchen fix me something good to eat make my head a little high make the whole day complete gonna lay around the shin and oh mama and put a good buzz [Music] we'll take time out to smile a little bit before you let her go we're gonna lay around the shedding oh [Music] oh yeah oh you you're on something go ahead rick brodsky everybody [Music] [Applause] there's nothing to do and there's always room for more fill it light it shut up and close that door baby we're gonna lay around the shiny mama and put a good buzz on take it okay [Music] so prohibition never works it's time to realize it it grows in my backyard it's time to legalize it we're gonna lay around the shed and mama and put a good buzz on [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm going to sit down in my rented car i'm going to jam it into drive i'm going to head on out and play at wsca with sean i'm glad i'm alive we're going to lay around the shanty mama and put our good buzz on every night and day we gonna lay around the shiny mama and put a good buzz on nice it's freddy thank god wsca studios and thank god it's not friday yet okay it's wednesday it's professor weed wednesdays this is cannabis chat i'm jimmy young and i'm in studio with andrew elk that's the deal now in the break because we take a break first of all andrew admitted he'd never heard the song before never heard it before but you like it i really like it it's a great cannabis song and it is a great to me it's the cannabis song and it certainly fits at 4 20 so we play it on mondays wednesdays and fridays when we go live in studio from 4 p.m to 6 p.m mondays is the day we do cannabinoid medicine shows right wednesday is our professor weed wednesday our educational moment and then on friday david rabinovitz joins us and we talk about financial stuff basically we call it the green rush show because everybody's doing a green rush i love i know what i'm saying absolutely all right so one of the things we talked about just in passing was the infusion the infusion world that's going on right right and certainly in your lifetime you will see this i don't know when i'm going to get a chance to see it but i do know that in california of course right there is a infused drink called chill aptly named i would think right right and the basically there are powdered drink mixers one has 10 milligrams of tnthc infused lemon and another is a watermelon mixer with five milligrams thc to five milligrams cbd the one to one right both labeled as fast acting to street meanwhile this writer and i'm pretty sure it's for the emerald media group emerald magazine out of new york another one of our affiliates sure enough that she does a whole review and says hey it was really relaxing took about 20 minutes to feel the effects uh best for beach day or lounging sitting around the shanty for instance would be a good time to try it yeah and uh so that was that was uh and i think you will see it i will see it at some point maybe no and it's a reason why constellation brands invested millions of dollars into canopy growth because they're molson and you would think they would be putting cbd at least in their beer if not a mixture of little thc right um i know california fought pretty hard against it i know there was sort of a thc beer in the works and pretty famously it's sort of they were put out of business overnight but because the the legislators said you can have cannabis or you can have alcohol but you can't put them together so well i'll admit there are times when i have put them together yeah and i've learned from dr tishler that it is eight times the effect wow okay so i just want to say be careful use it responsibly exactly start low go slow all that stuff exactly yeah right what's the biggest aspect of your job as a trainer when it comes down to explaining the benefits and and some of the cautious tales you might tell to people that come in to see you and talk to you well it starts with something you said earlier which is about focusing on the person you have in front of you understanding that my body chemistry is different from your body chemistry so for me the very first place i start with the most important thing is what is this person's experience level what are they trying to achieve do they have a history of um do they have trouble getting to sleep do they have an addictive disorder exactly that can be difficult too absolutely because you know cannabis like sugar like alcohol likes table salt like all of these things caffeine all of these things can be abused and many of those things i just listed cannabis included amongst them lots of people manage to use effectively without issue and improves their quality of life right and it's always the the go-to argument i have with people and they say you know oh yeah you know you're you're addicted to it i'm like i'm not addicted to it because i can stop at any time and have no effect by the way have you ever skipped a day without caffeine right because you get a raging headache almost automatically right and that means your body is craving something it needs to balance itself and it's giving your head pain because it's not there right same kind of thing with cannabis it balances the neurotransmitters in your body right exactly exactly and even if you or i didn't need thc on a daily basis you know there are a lot of people out there who do they need pain management they need assistance they're they're looking for something because they can't find a solution in their life otherwise and my point would be i don't think it's right to say those people the solution they found i don't think the solution is invalid um they have a right to at least in massachusetts they have a right to um use and pursue that that in this case cannabis avenue absolutely and how many times have you heard cannabis has saved my life cannabis has changed my life so many times every day almost every day it's pretty amazing especially when you're in the business and people know that you are some some kind of expert on this right and speaking of expert on this um as a director of training i checked out your video okay and the video that you have uh where you are demonstrating the bubbler right right okay now is this a dabbing device or is this a smoking device so i would say a a bubbler is any um smoking pipe that has a water component right so it's a bomb it is a ball so exactly a bubbler is a mini bong it is a smaller bong well you actually show one we're going to play this video in a second but i mean you show the different chambers it goes through and then and when i was in college we had we borrowed we borrowed some beakers right from the chemistry lab right and we created this this thing called horus and it was basically a bong with multiple helpers you know right kind of like a hookah right with chemistry parts right right we nicknamed it horace oh that's so funny we were fine but the idea when we used it but the the idea is that you're really just filtering smoke right a bubbler a bong adding water extending the length of time it takes for from ignition source the flame um to your throat right like our throat doesn't like hot smoke so the more we can cool it down condition it exactly nice we used to put ice in the bong exactly come on that's old school yeah anyway let's check out andrew demonstrating the bubbler i have before us a beta glass water pipe a very advanced one it would be more accurate to call it a recycler [Music] the primary function of this water filtration system is actually to recycle water in a continuous flow as you inhale the trick is actually to filter smoke through multiple complex compartments and water chambers first we have an extended down stem leading to a shower head percolator which is going to spin our vapor or smoke into a vortex leaving the shower head perk and filtering up through the water it rises through the fabric egg body as water travels upward it cycles through the climb triangular circular top and filters back down in to be pulled again and again that by the time the smoke actually gets to your lips you have a much softer final product water pipes come in a tremendous variety of shapes and sizes and they serve different functions you have different glass to different activities the reason both of these pipes are primarily suited toward concentrate use comes down how complicated their internal structure is you could absolutely do tremendous filtration of plant material with either one of these water pipes the problem is they're so beautiful and complicated and frankly expensive that plant matter will dirty the inside of your pipe much more quickly than concentrate use will my preference is actually to put it in my refrigerator before i leave for work and when i come home it's actually quite cool and nice water conditioning and cooling are the two best ways to soften smoke or vapor for a much more pleasant experience [Music] all right so we're back and andrew's still wearing the same tie i might add it's my lucky time so you were explaining a little bit more about the difference between vaping and flaming right well they both need a flame i guess even the vapor kind of so the guy took out the butane torch i was a little freaked by that right but i get you have to heat it up in order to get the vapor going exactly so it comes down to are we talking about flower material so you're talking about traditional cannabis the plant exactly the plants we're talking about right so that's a combustion traditional like a flame with a lighter right if you're talking about dabbing you're talking about a specialized bowl piece we're talking about concentrate marijuana sometimes it's called wax batter butter shatter basically we take the plant and we condense that thc down into a much smaller form factor and then that tiny little sliver is the equivalent of smoking like three joints all in one hit all at once yeah it's it's very intense okay that's the extraction process right and the director of education from cleveland school of cannabis is gonna she actually teaches extraction wow so i was you know i said oh we're going to talk about decarboxylation yeah which is like one of my favorite words that and cannabidiol and cannabinoids and endocannabinoid i mean you have to say all these words now there are so many things to learn it's really wild well that it 100 correct and when you talk to a science officer of a testing lab for instance okay whether it's mcr or cdx either one of those two those are the two i know and i'm they are by far the most intelligent people i've ever talked to now granted i was a sportscaster for 25 years so it's very small you know what i'm saying but that and i don't mean to discount the student athlete out there but and there are very some very intelligent athletes in fact one in particular uh jaylen brown for the celtics is a brilliant guy uh just like throw that yeah i just because i always sneak in some sports i love it it's just what i gotta do i just gotta do um all right so we've certainly talked about the bubbler we understand the difference between vaping now there are a lot of doctors uh cannabis certified doctors that don't approve of dabbing right or the combustion in the vaping that goes on with the dabbing and right they just don't like the combustion and i had uh julie uh battle in here she's an rn and uh from canalize and she talked about they she doesn't think putting oil in your lungs is a good thing and i say well it's not really the oil it's the vapor from the oil exactly and i said to her i said look when i was a kid excuse me when i was a young father and my child had a cough we would bring the child into the bathroom filled with steam when i go into a steam room i believe i breathe in steam hi steam right so what's the difference so our understanding is that it comes down to temperature right so the problem with combustion is hot smoke in our throat and lungs nobody likes it that's why we add ice that's how i we add water now vaping the idea of we're actually not combusting when we're vaping so because you get right up to that point exactly we're basically using electronic means basically an oven we have a tiny oven space just like the oven in your kitchen and that's heating up our flour or our concentrate material to the exact temperature where thc starts to float off of the physical material whether that's plant or whether that's shatter wax butter what-have-you so you reach that ideal temperature range and then you're exactly like you're saying so um you're just inhaling the vapor floating off that material and that's usually at between 300 and 400 degrees if you are going for low temperature dabbing it's sometimes called it's like like the lit tip of a joint the lit tip of a cigarette is about a thousand degrees fahrenheit so travels down your throat that's hot right this is why i use the ouija i hate to say but i use that filtration system and it works really well and i also noticed that when i was losing my dabbing virginity at the freedom rally a few years back he was telling me it had to get to 500 degrees in order to create it so again it's people are playing with medicine right and this is again we get it i you know they're up it's it can be dangerous i'm not going to say it can't be it can be dangerous i think any time you're using a butane torch by the way or or even lighter right can be dangerous okay i mean you burn the edges of your fingers sometimes and i mean i'm not a torch user myself i prefer to use what are sometimes called e-rigs or dab rigs basically i have a battery pack that replaces my torch that's basically has a little chamber that heats up because i'm with you the torch is a little scary to me it's like it's like smoke it's like crack i don't need that that's not what i need that's not what i'm looking for it's it's hardcore cannabis culture but it's definitely not for everybody it's it's not really even for me yeah and again it's up to you how you want to titrate how you want to partake absorb subject and unfortunately there's a lot of guinea pig going on you have to be a guinea pig you have to try it to see what is going to work for you because as we've established what's good for me may not be good for andrew andrew what's good for andrew but not good for me whatever um how many stories and how many people have you talked to who perhaps have learned the hard way and usually it's with edibles usually it is with edibles so i have definitely heard a fair number of stories i've seen my i remember back to college i've seen a fair few stories play out in front of me um for me the number one thing is understanding that a lot of people first of all if you have access to medical grade edibles where you know the milligrams like most people who when they try edibles for the first time two and a half milligrams is the entry level dose exactly please do not use more than two and a half milligrams right your first time like i used when i was told by a patient advocate right oh yeah i don't even like to use that word but tender right try this it was 33 milligrams yeah that was way too much way too much to start especially when i had them because i'm guy right like that's where i feel really comfortable and i could i could eat that every single day and i'd feel wonderful but it took me a really long time to get there i know people who take 100 milligrams a day we've seen patients who take a thousand milligrams a day um but those are the ones who need it for medicine as opposed to trying it or using it recreationally and there is a difference oh a huge difference anyone first of all you can't even i can't even sell someone a thousand milligrams unless i'm in a medical dispensary you can't go above 100 milligrams in an adult use facility but but the big thing to understand is like a lot of people will eat uh edibles on an empty stomach they think it's the same rules as alcohol so alcohol empty stomach you feel it more cannabis empty stomach you feel it less right so in order to feel an edible you need to have some fat content in your stomach you know yogurt tuna we have a question ooh i love questions i love questions too that's the interaction we encourage chat right and since you don't have a microphone on you're gonna have to yell or you can repeat it okay go ahead um about what you said earlier yes um you got eight times stronger someone was wondering if that was dabbing but you was talking we were talking about alcohol alcohol and cannabis together correct is eight times the effect so and it's interesting you know if you walk into a bar and you've already partaked so you're a little buzzed when you walk into a bar and then you have one drink you're not gonna need two right okay you're just not so one drink is enough now if you have one or two drinks and then you go outside and you partake in cannabis right you're going to go to a completely different level right and it is eight times the effect it's a little bit different and for those that like you said you know depending on who you are and how much and whatever i have always kind of found it to be balancing right and i know that you know i don't i'm not going to sit here and encourage people to get behind the wheel of a car under any influence at all okay i am not going to encourage that okay but in times when you might i have always found that i am a far better driver when i am under the influence of cannabis than if i am under the influence of alcohol now you can avoid where i am all you want you know knock on wood the only times i've ever had an accident when i'm completely straight and i'm at either a red light a stop sign or i'm yielding so you know just don't hit me when i'm sitting still oh absolutely i mean i would back up what you were saying about you really need to just be careful when you're combining alcohol in cannabis right it's definitely not something to to advocate because you pick one or the other right that's what i'd say yeah i mean exactly or learn go ahead and another another question another conversation that sparked in here off of that they were confused about whether you're talking about alcohol or dabbing i don't know if you can answer um comparatively to actual flour how strong are the dabs comparatively oh absolutely so when we're talking about um standard cannabis versus dabbing right so traditional flour you put it in a spoon pipe you roll it in a joint traditional flower versus concentrate cannabis and dabbing so the joke is the reason we call it dabbing is because a dab will do you a small what we sometimes will refer to as half the size of a fingernail it's like on the edge of a pin exactly paper clip the smallest amount that you could that you could basically break off with a paperclip effectively yeah and the reason you're using such a small amount of concentrate is the way we made that concentrate is we took flour and we basically crunched and distilled it down and so there could be in one half gram of concentrate there could be 500 milligrams of dose versus if i was looking at that in flour because again we use sort of different language to talk about flour we use thc test percentage like how much of the plant is thc that thing that makes us feel stoned um concentrates we measure in milligrams we're still talking about thc in both sides but it's it's so basically i mean you're talking 10 to 50 times stronger is like the short answer and it's interesting that the first questions we're getting are about you know what's the most intense high i can get right and this is where i have an issue with underage drinking because i get scared when i see high school kids binge drinking alcohol and i had a personal experience with this and i've seen and and back in the day when i was in in portland maine i was covering sports in portland maine and there was a a young man who was a division one baseball player was he was already accepted to the universe of miami which you know was a beautiful baseball school he was in the 80s and i think the coach was ron frazier back then anyway um he took this camaro and decided to go crazy and binge drink and had uh up close and personal with the telephone pole and died yeah and the binge drink i still see binge drinking right and i and i remember talking to high school kids recently about this and saying i don't get it what's the point what's the point of using it and i go well it's not to get filthy stupid drunk that you get sick your body's going to tell you how much you can or can't do and i just don't get it i just don't i never liked getting sick okay and i found out later in life that i was allergic to hops so i was never a beer drinker i would have three beers and i would get sick right and people are young you can't hold your liquor i'm like that's okay i'll go over here and roll a joint yeah but it was 18 back then too right and there was more education available amongst us than taught in the schools right so it was that was pretty much how i um and i've come out of the cannabis closet at this point i mean people pretty much know that i'm not you know by the way i don't think i would be with the pro cannabis media group and i wouldn't have been the founder of either my mom or my dad we're alive they are not okay so i just want to say i'm going to get that out there uh that being said uh it's been part of my world since i was 14. i could take 10 years off completely when my son was born i was 32 at the time i got my job in boston at necn during that time when i work with mike adams who is a also someone who has come out of the cannabis closet so to speak over the years uh still one of the funniest guys i've ever met and a guy i worked with for many many years and uh but it was really interesting that he was the one that got um busted one yeah at the at the car wash in connecticut at 2 30 in the morning for you know he was commuting from connecticut to newton mass every day wow an hour and a half an hour 45 minutes each i mean so yeah anyway i digress that's what i do here um we're talking with andrew elk and we're we're talking about how um all sorts of different things going on in the world of cannabis now one thing that we haven't touched on in this show on a somewhat regular basis and i do feel remiss that i have not had a grow show i definitely have reached out to growers i encourage people to send me their grow images because people like to look at the pretty pictures i'm going to pick this up now this is the revolutionary clinics wholesale catalog yes it is that has some absolutely beautiful images of beautiful flower in it i'm holding it up oh my god this is i feel like i should be johnny carson and uh yeah i'm over there okay that's good anyway you can kind of see how beautiful these flowers are there's one in the monitor too yeah oh are you going to try and do something or look what he's doing so he's screen capturing part of this image yeah and he's going to punch it up this is dan french at his best he's having so much fun directing the show i know he is throwing it ah hold it still he's got it he's getting it closer closer it's kind of weird i know those are gorgeous now this comes out you have a plant in fitchburg that's correct that is where our facility is and how big a pla how big a facility is it do you know i think it's one million square feet it is a former ll bean shoe factory so it's a big horseshoe we've got two thirds of the horseshoe and the third part of the horseshoe is a retirement home so that's a riot oh yeah it's a bunch of retirees living living next to a pot factory it's really funny now um one of the things that's come out in the news recently is in washington state some of the outdoor farms have a um a smell issue because after all it's a very pungent odor right so are the senior citizens in the retirement homes so to speak my brethren almost uh are they uh do they complain about it do they like at this point i'm guessing they're comfortable smelling it at this point i think they're very comfortable and i think that you know put this down dan because i'm getting a cramp okay um no you know smell is not really an issue in our factory you know we've got about three layers between the outside and where the actual cannabis is you know you've got the brick exterior you've got several layers of sort of airtight because we're really trying to stop pollen from coming in right you know no you don't want pollen on your flower right like you for example walking in for a tour could be carrying some pollen on your jacket so we've got all this technology these air blowers that basically these sticky mats that you walk over to basically keep everything but yeah when you talk about like the most secure part of our whole business it's it's really a building inside a building inside a building right and i've talked to growers before and they won't let me go in with a camera or whatever because you know it's super secret probation it's wonka's chocolate factory right absolutely willy wonka's chocolate factory and the golden ticket is you got to know someone to get in exactly and i have seen a picture actually of tom and keith in the grove facility in fact if we have that b-roll uh dan has a b-roll um some images that i put together of interiors of the summerville and fresh pond locations and also the uh the famous picture i think it's a globe picture i probably ripped it off and i'll probably get in trouble for it but whatever i beg for forgiveness anyway uh of keith and tom in that grow facility you know yes i know i know the picture you know the picture it's on a plaque oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is uh they both have very large grins on their faces oh yeah and uh this is the interior and um there's now an ex-employee of yours who i adored the canon queen herself yes and there's keith um and deirdre's on the far left and it was uh deidre who's the good friend there's our central square store there's your central square uh location and there it is there's the photos yeah i guess they weren't really grinning they were very serious there but uh but it's a great photo and there's black mamba there's one of your flowers that's what i used to fall asleep just last night i love black mamba so obviously you're a connoisseur you're someone who has a taste and understands it all can you really tell like i know wine drinkers right and they taste the wine right and they say oh i i smell wood or blackberry or something right and i'm like i taste red wine right i don't have that discerning palette does it work right how do you do how do you how do you create a palette for canvas so i don't say lots of practice okay um i would say it's real well quality is a huge part of it you know there there is higher and lower quality flower production and some of that is how what soil you grow in whether you use soil at all the conditions of the growing just like you can have high quality tomatoes grown on the vine or low quality tomatoes the big thing is understanding like test percentage is what a lot of people shoot for as the standard for success right if you have a high thc test percentage used to be the 25 was the be all end all now 35 was the be all end all and now now they're high basically you go back to the 60s we're talking about six percent thc that's what the beatles were smoking yes it was and people say oh this is you know who gave the beatles their first week who you don't know this no i don't i found this out i'm trying to remember who told me this but it was bob dylan who told me um dave and beaten stock from the greatest moments in weed history and i knew the answer but i couldn't play i knew it i said as soon as you say the name i'm going to know it yeah that's bob dylan i said isn't it robert zimmerman isn't that his real name anyway but that's one standard that people shoot for but a lot of it has to do with plant structure is it frosty like there are a lot of criteria that people look for in cannabis is it the right shape does it have sort of this frosty um tri-combed exterior um so there are things like i can taste and i can appreciate really high quality stuff like our black mamba our last couple batches of bootylicious like there are some really special strains in the rev clinics lineup and there's also just cannabis you know there's just weed you know there's stuff that you just smoke which is kind of like how i feel about red wine and it's just you know it is what it is it has a different effect i've always liked hash right which is compressed right a concentrate form one of the first concentrates before anybody was making this fancy wax shatter rosin right batter butter right and i i admitted it was a for choice let's just say back in the day in the 60s and 70s you know 70s definitely not but 71 i'm not i'm not afraid of that that's it happens to coincide when the waldos used to get together right you know i just i just it's just a coincidence as they say um you use the word trichome yes tri-color one of the things i like to do on this show because of the vernacular everybody seems to have you know different buzzwords terpenes right trichomes right can you define what a trichome is certainly so a trichome is that when you look at a cannabis nug or a bud or a bit of flour and you see that characteristic sort of sugar crystal it almost looks like a frosting of sugar across the texture of the plant so those are individual little sacs filled with terpenes and cannabinoids so when we're extracting when we're making a cannabis concentrate we're basically separating plant material from those little sugar crystals it's inside those sugar crystals that we have our thc our cbd our all of our special cannabinoids that make us feel good um and then terpenes which are flavor and have their own sort of medicinal effects man this business has gotten really complicated and you need a chemistry degree just to go out and find some decent flour right right some decent bud right and you don't need a uh clipboard or an album cover back in the day you don't even know what albums are do you i of course i know how things are oh god oh my god yeah but that that was the thing now terpenes terpenes terpenes are the steering mechanisms so terpenes are the aromatic smell chemicals that are common to cannabis and all kinds of botanical plants so common example the most common terpene in cannabis is mercin it's a muscle relaxant mercin is in mangoes mercine is in all kinds of fruits mercin if you basically take mercy in its raw form if you give it to a sumo wrestler if you give it to a boa constrictor if you give it to a 16 year old girl it does the same thing to every one of those people it relaxes their muscles okay so we associate mercene with the indica family of flower strains the relaxers the body focus strains and for a long time people thought oh this is an indica strain it's an indica flower they didn't really know what it meant i mean that's about we're talking about plant genetics right now so yeah it's an indica strain that's why it makes me sleepy well actually what we're starting to understand is we there's inside that indica there's mercine there's um terpinoline there's citronine there are all these different terpenes like but these are there are terpenes like pinene famous terpene makes you it's an upper makes you feel energized and awake is in pine sap limonene is in lemon peel so there are certain like aromatic chemicals that when you put them together with thc they do specific things yeah so when i have mercine in an indica strain i feel relaxed because i'm my body's processing a muscle relaxant right versus when i'm smoking um sativa flour and i'm processing citrine or limonene that's an upper like at the chemical level right so we're just now beginning to understand why do sativas for many people have these common side effects why do indicas for this common group of people have many of the same effects but terpenes are basically aroma and effect gotcha and uh that that's fascinating can i ask you where did you get to be so smart you grew up in lexington yes yes suburb yeah summer boys said this guy knows his [ __ ] yes he does he knows [ __ ] and is yeah it's pretty good [ __ ] too i guess um but yeah i learned i learned really from working in the cannabis industry um so i think decriminalization was past 2017 in massachusetts we had medical cannabis since 2013 2013 would not we didn't have decriminalization until 20 until january 1st 2017 i applied for my first cannabis job i think january 2nd uh 2017. but i mean again i want to i get it you you enjoyed it right you are fascinated by it you've read up about it yeah um there are so many schools out there now there's online courses everybody's teaching an online course and i believe as an educator pretty much everybody has something to teach everyone else whether it is in cannabis or sports or communication or pr or recruitment whatever it is especially as you get older you have a certain expertise in how you got to be older right so sharing that with others is something that i believe in and but you're relatively young and i'm amazed at the depth of your knowledge i really am but you didn't go to school for this no no um really um all of my education came from having a lot of youtube watching a lot of youtube videos okay so which ones did you i'm interested to hear which ones because i too when i got my medical card in 2013 i went online and i found green flower right and max simon and in fact max and i are going to he's going to come on the show which i don't think i even told isabel yet but he is which is great he's the founder of green flower and i loved their videos because they were so educational and they were also they had a lot of phds and doctors from california and they basically just brought them in and let them talk about different things and i learned so much oh yeah until youtube took them down did you know that oh yeah well youtube instagram a lot of these platforms they they they don't like cannabis sometimes they do and sometimes they don't no and we're finding that out ourselves let's just say um but it you know here we are talking about educating people and and using it the right way responsibly it's an adult product okay and i and i really make that very clear a lot of people want me to hire interns and i go well first of all interns um have to be 21 as far as i'm concerned if they want to work with us here um because i don't want to have to deal with under 21 year olds i just don't it just doesn't make any sense right aren't you glad you turned 21 dan he's not an intern anymore it is you know he's he's a professional director right but it's an adult business like you said yes it is absolutely um and we're getting up to the top of the hour so we're going to take a little break speaking of education we have at our disposal if you will from our friends at cannabis.net a series of video tutorials on a variety of subjects and i never know what the subject is dan gets to kind of pick them so we're going to run a couple of these cannabis.net videos and then we'll come back on the other side and we've got a few more few more treats to talk about so don't go away cannabis chat continues after this having a party [Music] me [Music] foreign [Music] me make it here [Music] me [Music] for me [Music] uh our program is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm not happy [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] of course it is hi everybody welcome back to cannabis chat i'm jimmy young the founder of pro cannabis media this is professor weed wednesdays andrew elk is in studio from revolutionary clinics he's the director of training and education uh for the the medical dispensary that my go-to place to go to uh and i appreciate you coming in and as you are hearing we're we actually have a more active chat room today than we've had which is great because if anybody's in marketing they understand it's it's providing content with the audience and then engaging with that audience that's the interactivity that is eventually uh sec we call it second screen content a lot of times because if you're watching tv for the most part especially people your age you get your phone right there guilty right and you're either texting someone who's watching the same game or the same show of you or you're multitasking your generation just absorbs and wants to multitask there's so much to do and so little time right so first of all thank you for engaging with our audience because i really do believe that's what we want this show to become and we want to take people's questions for our guests we also asking all of the people that are chatting to please subscribe to our channel because we're trying to reach the 50 plateau right and we we're with 16 people away again we've only been doing this for a couple of weeks right how many we're eight away eight away we need eight more we need eight more people to just subscribe okay and i don't even care if you unsubscribe later as long as we reach that plateau no right again uh please subscribe and watch us because on fridays if you're interested in getting into the cannabis business uh david rabinovitz who you probably have never met but he's the treasurer of mass can um and is someone who's um a data analyst so he'll look at the public documents that the cannabis commission comes out with and are available and he'll analyze them and look at the different licenses and then look at the cost per uh customer and and and kind of figure out where the industry is going and he has been i know that he's been engaged with a lot of people that are looking for that sort of thing so he's somebody i consider to be an expert on any data right and now he is fascinated by the cannabis space because there's so many elements and so many factors to what's going on here and i think that's one of the reasons why you got so involved with the industry because you found different aspects of it fascinating oh incredibly true and what do you like the most though uh my favorite thing is that in the cannabis industry everything we're doing we're doing for the first time pretty much right we are paving the road we are late sometimes literally laying foundation a talk show about cannabis yeah hello right you know but again like opening a store like a brick-and-mortar store what goes into that that's been done before you know like hosting a show that's been done before but everything we're doing here now tomorrow last week in the cannabis is new pretty much there people from different um like backgrounds like i was in theater management before i was doing this job you know mostly i had 400 500 people a night like come into a theater to see a live show cool very different business it's been around for a long time those job roles are set like how you do it has been written down by someone else whereas with cannabis you're writing the road map every day and and you do feel you're part of a historic movement there's no doubt and the fact that it's part of the in the middle of the political mess that is washington dc the fact that republicans are counting the word cannabis in a covid relief bill okay is first of all it drives me nuts to even think that that's an issue right okay and second all the democrats trying to do is open the banks so that those are in the industry can actually have a bank account is that so bad oh it's ridiculous i mean goodness gracious i mean i mean we pay enough in taxes certainly i well some of us do some of us don't pay taxes no matter how much money we make i just want to say yeah and i'm not going to say who right okay but you know cannabis could those like i think you were pointing to cannabis taxes can pay for a lot of things in a state there's a lot of money being left on the table and for 30 40 years yeah i used to say why don't they just legalize this stuff and tax the [ __ ] out of it right right and they finally did they finally listened to me which is great i mean i'm i'm into that but we're in an enlightened state yeah well massachusetts has always been and after all it began here everybody has to remember that we amazingly we have a lot of listeners and downloaders in colorado and in california because right now i don't think there's too many talk shows out there even in the mature markets all right it is something god gave me a gift of gab and i have managed to make somewhat of a career of it uh over the last 40 years i mean it used to be sports but really and truly even i got tired of talking about sports okay i'll never get tired about talking about this because i learned so much from people like you or from the science directors or or from keith cooper your ceo who you know i would absolutely work for because i really like his management style and who he is and how he is amazing manager an amazing boss yeah yeah i feel the same way every day i learned something new about cannabis or about my industry right or the business or dealing with people there's so many elements to it and of course the science is navigating the laws yeah absolutely oh i know what we have we have another video okay and i'm pretty sure there is sound on this but i think it's just music um it was sent to me by tom schneider and it was sent to me from the fitchburg facility because it's called harvest and i think you'll understand why it's called harvest when you check out this video play it dan [Music] so [Music] hey [Music] okay so that's a sneak inside the grow facility and of course while we're watching that andrew's narrating yeah this is what they're doing now this is what they're doing now so they they harvest and then they dry it by turning it upside down and hanging it correct i did notice a lot of clipping of the leaves right and we were talking about the leaves and i know people who are who i talk to at cannabis shows that juice the leaves mix it with carrot juice and of course it you know whatever it cures it cures i mean so what we're talking about is sugar leaf sugar so sugar leaf is is the common name for sort of those big beautiful like iconic fan leaves that when people think cannabis when you think the pot leaf shape right that's the leaves that we're talking about the seven the big palm fronds yeah yeah but so those are enormously chock-full of what we call minor cannabinoids basically not thc not the stuff that gets a stone not the stuff that most people are paying for or buying so really we don't use sugar leaf in any of the products that we manufacture just because we have such a thc cbd medically psychoactive focus right um but there's like i said so you've got cb you do have cbd in sugar leaf you have cbg which is incredible for stomach issues menstrual cramps if you've got cbc is incredibly anti-fungal so there are a myriad of medical benefits and and if you are a medical patient and you get your your flour and a canister and it and they break down the cannabinoids on every label yes and you know by law by law i understand that but there's a lot of zeros and a lot next to a lot of those cbs g's and exactly c's and i'm happy to talk cbs and all that yeah so like when you've got a really high quality strain you might have 25 thc on that label that might be considered above average or average today um if you're cracking 30 percent you've got something really special when it comes to thc all those other cannabinoids cbd amongst them cbd cbg cbn they do other things besides get us high they help with pain they put us to sleep they're good for controlling seizures but the reason they have zero point zero percent sometimes or zero point zero one or zero right a low percentage yeah well you have to understand that since the 50s since as long as people have been growing cannabis as long as there's been a black market oh yeah i was going to say they've been using it for thousands thousands of years exactly but for as long as anyone has been marketing it growing it purposefully selling it to an end user um the only cannabinoid people cared about on the black market was thc does it get you high or not it's like so you had years decades of purposeful cross breeding to get really high test percentages for thc but it's only within the last five to ten years that anyone even knew what cbd was yeah let me ask you a question about that because you know when politicians get involved they're already talking i think california about limiting the percentage of thc in the plant now i know alcohol when you have something that is a hundred proof right that is pure alcohol right right right are we ever going to see that day that the percentages of thc will be governed again you know alcohol has been around since a long time right and as i've mentioned many times i wrote a blog way back when when i first started this that the wrong drug in 1937 was outlawed because i really do believe that if cannabis was part of our society and accepted since 1937 you took a balancing anti-a an immune system builder out of the medicine world okay and what happened we got riddled by cancer right and a million other things pain management you think about where we would be 100 and a lot of oncologists i've thrown this theory out and they actually think that i'm i'm on to something or whatever that means it's just common sense because i find out that in the 1920s three million prescriptions by mds medical doctors people who went to harvard medical school in the turn of the century the 20th century they wrote three million prescriptions for cannabis yeah in the 1920s okay and now you take that out of the human away from mammals because we didn't get into the whole pet thing right right right of course our immune systems are going to be compromised of course we're going to be susceptible to the chemicals that we've put into our environment because our immune systems are beat to hell right right so to answer your question about will we ever reach that point where yes we'll ever reach that point it's good that you remembered me oh yeah oh yeah i appreciate that so the way to think about it is imagine if you have like one nug one gram of flour imagine you got one big honkin nug that's one gram let's say it's 30 thc what that means is that remember those sugar crystals those trichomes remember that's where the thc lives that means if we just if we ignore all the green on the plant all the leaves we forget about all of that 30 of the weight of that one gram of nug is thc it lives in those sugar crystals that's what a thirty percent 30 thc means that's because and that means that even so correct me if i'm wrong if you get something that is 14 thc it will still get you high oh 100 and in fact test percentage is not the be-all end-all remotely like i have had strains that test at 12 11 14 and hit me they have them hit me way harder because some people go by test percentage but really it's the combination of test percentage terpenes your own body chemistry your experience with that strength um and that's the sciences we understand it today but again it's an evolving science oh it's evolving because they're discovering new cannabinoids in every day right which is just again i never took chemistry my science requirement was ended up being astronomy you know what can i tell you i was a liberal arts student in the 70s anyway um well i'm glad that we were able to show that as well because i i i really am fascinated with the grow part of this and the fact that they can dictate the dna of the different plant strains right is amazing to me we'll get into the whole extraction process when uh lisa joins us in about 10 minutes or so or 13 minutes 13 minutes just to be exact and um all that will be happening coming up as well um oh you know what i got something that we haven't played yet and this is something i don't think you've seen but you know ref clinics has been the sponsor of my podcast in the weeds since the beginning okay and that was in 2018 april or may 2018 something like that oh well that's since before i joined wait this is live tv i love that okay the monitor goes to sleep and i get to wake it up anyway i have we put a promotional video now it's really really important that we say this that i say this as a disclaimer okay when you are putting a message out there it's very important according to all the regulations to not have a call to action because it is not a commercial it is not a pitch right what it is is an infomercial it's an informational piece of video that tells a story so this is the infomercial that i put together for rev clinics over the last year or two and we've played hundreds of times and uh for those of you who are tuning in perhaps for the first time you probably haven't seen it but for those of you who have seen it like two people in this room have seen it probably a hundred times just bear with us but let's take a look at the red clinic's spot if you will [Music] weed talk and in the weeds are two productions of pro cannabis media supported by revolutionary clinics one of the top medical cannabis dispensaries in the massachusetts area now with three locations in greater boston two in cambridge and one on broadway in somerville rev clinics has a patient first mission they will customize your needs as a medical patient with the proper titration and combination of strains flavors and products red clinics where the patient comes first [Music] and i should probably give tony simonetti who's my ace after effects editor credit for that we call it a stinger and you liked it i loved it i loved it i had never seen that before but i really liked it well that was my idea and he implemented it because i said you know it looks like paint swishing just make it move yeah and that was i love it what happens all right so that was the commercial for our friends that uh excuse me the infomercial and you didn't hear me talk he said the patient comes first it's a medical dispenser it's a no-brainer exactly right really straightforward and you guys always always um talk about education first anyway exactly and that's what drew me in anyway and i i'm very very happy with my relationship with you guys over the years um have you seen the show growing belushi growing belushi now you know who jim belushi is i do i do i've heard of jim belushi i know jim belushi you know his brother was john belushi you're right from the blues brothers correct all right good this is good you have some knowledge of the belushi family if you will right um jim very successful actor comedian right been in a bunch of movies uh and he has a farm in oregon and he grows cannabis and he pitched the show to the discovery channel and got it accepted they did three episodes and if you have not seen them they are available on youtube you can also get them on demand through discovery channel or whatever you guys are young you know how to find all that we'll find it you find it um it is a riot it's very cleverly written you know it's kind of a reality wink wink show okay okay it's a scripted reality show is really how i would look at this and he and his cousin clark is absolutely the the the he makes the show and even jim had missed this which is kind of cool and they also introduced you to captain jack strain captain jack strain was what the original cast members at saturday night live in the 70s because captain jack was their dealer wow that's perfect that's beautiful so you have to watch this show now absolutely and you know it's it's three 45-minute episodes and the the trip to medellin columbia is absolutely priceless they're they're they uh dan aykroyd is in this right uh judy belushi uh john's widow wow he's in this show as well wow and you know i'm really hopeful that we get jim uh i doubt i'll get him in studio but getting him on a zoom call is probably uh something i'm pretty comfortable that we're going to get we talked to his publicist and nice you know they're pitching this now uh i hope they do a whole season because it's a riot oh god and what it does more than anything else andrew that i really like is they talk about education he he talks about um normalizing this crop and he's a businessman he's a farmer and what is he doing now you know seven farms in oregon got destroyed by the fires right heartbreaking so now he's got if you go on united way and you go to the oregon division of the united way uh you can donate to help out and he's you know pushing this and we we talked about it on our we talk news show a couple weeks ago and um but i'm gonna we have one more clip to play before we go to the interview and i and it he calls it uh cannabis 101. i love it and it's and it's jim belushi playing the role of professor weed that's perfect okay and that's where i kind of got the idea of professor weed wednesdays because there's no original thought in creative content anymore um but we have this dan ready to go all right let's take a look at uh professor reed belushi so you say you don't like to smoke got so high in high school in 1975 with edibles you can control your experience i want a controlled experience he wants a controlled experience would you edibles are gummies chocolate cookies brownies but don't ever take a cooking a brownie from a friend because the dosage is not controlled go to a legal registered recreational dispensary dosage you get a 100 milligram candy bar this is my favorite chocolate bag chocolate child proof [Music] [Applause] unless your kid can wield the hammer don't worry about it here is a hundred milligrams way too much you break it down it's scored most people like a five milligram dosage because it's like a warm hug start slow and wait don't eat an edible in 10 minutes later i don't feel nothing i'm gonna need some more next thing you know you're gonna be on a couch or we're steering around a parking lot make plans to stay home and watch a movie with your lover your wife or both [Music] that was professor weed and that's the first time you've seen jim belushi first time first time i'd seen him doing that that was hysterical hysterical and yet educational incredible which is the way this product should be shared with others one of my biggest beefs is the cannabis control commission in massachusetts has a 250 000 budget to produce these psas to enlighten people about cannabis and they are so condescending so insulting it's it they're just not good and i keep saying you know if anybody ever wants to share this with the with the group i'd be happy to work because that's how you should be doing it right right normalizing normalizing it 100 you know how much information you got out of there start low and go slow child proof packaging was part of that um don't take too much or you'll get goofy i mean figuring out your dose figure out your dose i mean and then he holds up the bang chocolate now courtesy of my pal isabella in the other room we got to talk with their ceo jamie pearson and i didn't know that belushi was going to have this show so after i interviewed her she says you know i'm friendly with jim belushi and i went oh i love jim belushi you know he's got a show coming on i said no i didn't know that next thing i know it's goron belushi it's you know and that's how it all kind of came about and of course he just plugged you talk about product placement yeah perfect you get a celebrity endorser product placement and bang chocolate is not in massachusetts and it's the number one chocolate edible in canada i believe it i believe it and it's a and now she told me the story it was a gourmet chocolatier that she knew and they just went into business together and 10 years they've been in business in california you know killing it and now they're up in canada it's amazing how many chefs and growers chemists scientists have come to the cannabis industry either for quality of life for new opportunities to sort of make their own path to sort of come up on their own or to bring the expertise that made them um really fantastic in their own industry right absolutely and again this is what being part of this industry really is all about is finding those interesting stories and we want to be able to tell those stories that's why i started this pro cannabis media group and that's why i like doing these interviews and doing the shows and it all started with the podcast in the weeds courtesy of our friends at rev clinic so you can blame me or blame them whoever you want to be i love it but i'm not a big blamer okay because i don't believe in that i do want to set up the lisa zwerner interview a little bit the cleveland school of cannabis is located in cleveland and columbus ohio certain states like ohio oklahoma only medical program right but very much a part of the fabric now of each state's society right they're vibrant in oklahoma i think if you show up and you ask for a license you get a license i think it's that's great it's that easy right it gave out something like 800 licenses in the first year wow that's going to cause a problem too right you know but it also is the polar opposite of how massachusetts started their adult use recreational program which is which has moved at a snail's pace right and it's been controlled right and it's been shut down by the governor during covet as the only state doing that but there oh look at that she's got the right background and everything i'll tell you that's what you want oh she's smiling which means i think she can hear me right is that perfect she can hear me all right that's great let's bring in lisa zwerner the director of education from the cleveland school of cannabis hi lisa how are you i'm great thanks for having me jimmy oh no this and this is the perfect end to an amazing program because andrew elk is with us he's a director of education and training for medical dispensary in the greater boston area and we've been getting an education on trichomes and terpenes and to grow and but we've kind of left the extraction process to you because you and i talked yesterday of the day before about this can you please explain the courses of study at the cleveland school of cannabis and your expertise in extraction and why that's so important sure thank you the courses of study we have six different majors which would be anything from horticulture with cultivation business dispensary the medical side as well as processing post-processing and industrial hemp so that is uh and we also have an executive major which is kind of a combination of all of those uh so that would kind of be your masters in uh education of cannabis uh and the extraction do you want me to just kind of review what i would i review in a class kind of the basics absolutely toxic curriculum we cover everything from the basic method of extractions which be would be your mechanical extractions and those type of extractions would be anything from like dry sift to bubble hash to resin pressing and then we get into more commercialized uh methods which would be more of your ethanol and your butane washes as well as your co2 and that's where you get a lot of your vape pens and other types of concentrates from as well as a little bit of infusions for oils and fats that we use for our edibles so we really give them a an overall view in the first course about all the types of extractions and then we get into uh a much more in-depth course with processing and post-processing on the commercial level there you go i mean to me i'm fascinated by every aspect you know they have the horticulture obviously history legal retail activism patient access the whole nine yards this is not this is not your um your average grow certificate course this is this is legit this is i don't even want to call legit because everybody has something to teach everybody else but you're going to college when you go to the cleveland school of cannabis correct lisa yes we are a state accredited institution um so you will be getting a certificate of completion at the end as well as uh job placement we we take this seriously so we take the student from the beginning in education and then try to get them placed into an ohio facility and now we're branching out into uh the u.s with our online program there you go that's incredible it is i told you and and this guy andrew he has is self-taught through various youtube videos and i'm amazed at the depth of his knowledge uh in this space so i think what we have here is we have a a college accredited program and then we have the the street cred if you will right and there's still so much to be learned um at so many different levels and you know again i i'm fascinated with the science behind it lisa um can you walk us through the word decarboxylation i get to say it you know we kind of goofed about that a little bit but this is the process that you're able to take a flower and then extract the chemicals from the flower correct yeah so decarboxylation actually is where you are uh taking the compounds from the flower which are thca cbda cbn you know those type of those those products from the flower and what you do through heat oxidation light those there's different forms that you can actually decarboxylate the compounds and it takes off that carboxyl group that that acid group which is that a on the end and turns it into a a a a form like thc and cbd so it drops the a off now it is uh the thc is euphoric where thca is not and that so so a just to think from um you know the the layman's terms when you are physically rolling a joint with flour that has thca and cbda in it you have to light it you have to heat it for those compounds to accelerate into a form that gives you the euphoria or medicinal properties that you need and that's what decarboxylation is so when you take decarboxylation in different forms let's say for edibles we're not lighting that up or we're not vaporizing that so you have to actually heat that yourself so you would actually grind up that cannabis and you would put it into an oven for you know approximately an hour at 250 240 and that then you have activated the flour and it is now ready to be put into your oils or fats to be delivered into your recipes so that is what decarboxylation is it's just activating the compounds that are already in the flower but they are in an acidic form wow fantastically explained i i love that lisa how in the world did you end up in the cannabis industry you know i asked this a lot to people i still shake my head and go i have a talk show about cannabis how did this happen so how did you get to be where you are and what's your what's your story lisa sure well i actually started out with uh some family members that uh was trying to get off or not necessarily get off but have back off of some medications that were giving them side effects and so i first started out growing and like your other guests there i watched some youtube videos and that's at the time back then when i started it was the only available source uh you might be able to go buy uh you know a book but you you were definitely worried somebody was following you out and following you home when you bought that book uh so you know we went to the youtube and we started watching some different growers you know show you the beginnings and basics and the first time you buy seeds for a hundred dollars and you try to sprout them you're so afraid that you know all that money is going to go down the drain if you don't do it right so i watched a lot of videos then i moved into once i got that growing down and was able to provide the medicine for my family i learned about extractions and again i started on a social media platform on youtube with hash church which some people may be familiar with it was with marcus richardson and he is also bc bubble man has owns bubble bags and he started an educational show about extraction and so i started watching that every sunday um got to meet him had incredible conversations became the moderator of the show started you know listening four hours a every sunday so i had probably i i can't even imagine how many thousands of hours of cannabis education that i was receiving from that and so that is what put me in a place to actually be able to teach extractions i did it myself i taught myself but i also had a lot of uh mentorship through that and then i started you know with my own product and i then started out breeding and got into the breeding business and i have my own cultivar out there called mama's chili bomb i got that actually on the shelves and right now on lp's in canada are now are dispensing that medication to canadian patients and hopefully someday here in the us um and we you know basically got probably um got out of that and got into ohio because at the time i wasn't living in ohio when all that was going on um and then i started uh into the education business and that to me gave me so much joy to be able to give back what i was able to receive that is that is why teachers do what they do um you know you're you're definitely i think you're doing god's work for sure no doubt about that and uh it sounds fascinating on so many so many levels i do want to go back to some of the courses of study at the cleveland school and one of the things you mentioned and when i talked to kevin green he brought this up as well 70 of your graduates get placed into the industry is that accurate yes uh that is accurate um so we we tried to develop relationships with all of the uh cannabis industry within ohio and of course it's very difficult to find employees that have education and cannabis so that is something that obviously you know they're looking for it's it's a much smaller training program when you can you know you know actually have someone that's gone through our courses so we started uh you know within the last couple years developing those relationships and now we get calls constantly you know we need 10 people so so we're trying to churn them out as fast as we can to be able to provide the industry with the needs that they have so andrew you're at a medical dispensary yes um what's the process what do you look for and i don't know if you're involved in the hiring process do you ever more than you'd think okay good so have you ever seen anyone come across your desk with the cleveland school of cannabis diploma right no no i haven't i have seen i remember when i was starting out pretty much the same situation youtube was about the only thing out there i did a lot of research looking for either certificate programs degree programs at the time there was nothing right um so my cannabis knowledge really came from a combination of youtube videos and three years in the industry right but it's interesting so at revolutionary clinics we're often first looking for customer service skills so because we figure we can teach people cannabis is the idea as it's clear from um like educational content that i do that that the cleveland school is doing right um is you can make cannabis education um so for us it's usually but but you're right we want to hire people who know cannabis like rev clinics we want to have the best customer service so we're usually looking for hires that either have cannabis industry experience or we would prefer them have customer service and then train them on cannabis um because for us they're going to be starting out as a team member working with other team members you know there are all kinds of different jobs in the cannabis industry some that need more cannabis knowledge some that are very customer facing where you need that knowledge others in the kitchen or in extraction where again that knowledge is critical can't do the job if you don't know how to extract for example and lisa you are braver than i am when it comes to the seeds okay because i i really do think i have a black thumb i don't want to be responsible for growing something and then having it die i'm a very sensitive guy i just don't think i could handle that not to mention the pressure to actually see it sprout and then go to flower which is why i'm really encouraging people i want to see the grows i want you to send me grow footage i want to see the the images of these beautiful flowers that people are growing um is there a any kind of a research component in the curriculum as far as you guys doing any studies or anything like that we actually have a course called cannabis research study so we teach them not only about the the research that has taken place but how to go about uh you know researching um so yes we do we do offer that um and it's funny when you said you're you had a black thumb and you would couldn't imagine you know doing that i i laughed because i felt that way but wait until you have to take an entire plant and plunge it into water and wash it that's it for for the first time that's that's now that's scary because you can run an entire plant pretty quickly if you don't know what you're doing so you know the education is absolutely important um and when he was just discussing the dispensary side we we we have a dispensary operations class and we just had today and what we call a mock dispensary presentation where we have you know faculty and or other students come in and pretend to be the the patient and you know we have the the menu up and you know the each one of the students has to actually uh find out about you know actually go through the process get their driver's license you know scan their card and and just go through an entire process of what it would be like to work in the dispensary and then what it's like to find the conditions uh their financial situation and try to match up all of you know their needs with what medicine is available uh and then you know asking the right questions so we it's just so imperative to be able to teach that to someone so that when you do go to a dispensary as a patient who doesn't have that background when you walk in you feel like you're speaking to an expert you feel like you will come back time and time again because what they're recommending is working for you so it's so important to have those kind of uh dispensary associates that would be able to um you know educate not just the patients but the public and let's try to get some of this prohibition mentality uh gone and make it more of a medicinal type of a plant now yeah and absolutely and that's always been the most frustrating thing for me too is uh and i do preach it on this show on a regular basis that you are self-medicating with a plant now god put this plant on the earth for a reason and it's been used for thousands of years by medicine men by harvard-educated doctors and now we're finally doing the type of research that i believe you know should have been done for years and years and years um you still fight the stigma don't you because i can kind of hear it in the background of some of your stories uh now now you're smiling how challenging is it in the state of ohio to be accepted as a as an educator of people who are learning about cannabis do you get the old the eyes roll up when you talk to other people in the university system sometimes um it depends i think the stigma is starting to break a little and i i do think that the majority of ohioans believe in the medication itself i just don't think there's a lot of education out there so you know that that's a lot of it understanding the endocannabinoid system and you know how these uh cannabinoids bind with our receptors you know when you explain it in those terms the the standard patient understands oh this is actually working within my body and regulating and creating homeostasis and when when they start talking like that it's it's it just gives me such a thrill because you know we all need to to to like you said take away the old prohibition mentality and you know i am giving away my age i i grew up in you know the times of uh you know the black market first for for many many years and and fought that stigma because i've always believed in this plan and i always felt as if i was being lied to about what you know schedule one and and all of these other things with drug companies and we won't go into all that but i always felt betrayed by that so you know i i just feel like now ohioans have opened their eyes they do want to see a good program they don't want to see it get out of control they like it being regulated as as a medicinal plant so i do feel like it's going to be a long time before we see recreation in ohio but i do feel like what we have set in place is working very well and i'd like to just continue to see that program grow all right you dated yourself so i'm not going to harp on that because i'm 63 i don't need to know your age but one of the things that i do on this show is i play a song by a an old rocker from the 60s and 70s and the song is shanty by jonathan edwards have you ever heard of that song if you would play it i probably would know what it was well i could sing a few of them sing a little bit you know i'm gonna sit around the shanty and put a good buzz on every night and day if i can help it i'm gonna live right sorry that's my rendition i don't normally sing in public and you can understand why [Laughter] lisa um the medical program you basically said uh you know you're in ohio the medical program is established there you pretty much said you won't see adult use record you don't think there's much backing or advocacy for that what do you think is causing is it is it the federal issue more than anything else or is it still the stigma well i think you know i think if the scheduling would change i think that's going to help people that have always had a a different attitude about uh cannabis that they would actually maybe change their minds because now they see the federal government moving on that and sometimes that's what it takes for specific people um but i do think that we i i'm not going to say it's never going to happen of course you know it's going to get back on about some day we tried to do it but with covid you know we kind of got set back on trying to get a legalized program here in ohio and i just feel like it's it's it's going to be a tough fight here but i'm not saying it won't ever happen i'm not sure they'll ever allow home grow they may possibly allow wreck down the road so it's interesting she said no homegrow and here in massachusetts it's the first thing was the first thing and vermont too vermont allowed you to grow it at home right but not sell it and now vermont is moving towards an adult use retail operation regulation and in massachusetts they allow 12 plants if you have two adults and one dwelling right um variant why do you think it is that they're afraid of the grow are they afraid like they're going to drive by fields of of weed in in on the way to miami you of ohio or something like that um i i believe there's a couple things in play here um remember this is this was set up by the board of pharmacy here in the state of ohio right and these investors that have gotten licenses here have invested millions and millions of dollars to to sell the product here in ohio medicinally if they would allow patients to do that then they're taking away the support of the corporate world right um i mean it's going to back off a little bit if you've got if you're allowing all your patients to grow they're not going to spend as much in a dispensary that's just the bottom line and i think that's what this is really all about not only that but you know we have issues with neighbors we have odor control we have a lot of things like that that uh i believe would would cause some problems here in ohio so um i just think that right now uh we tried to get it passed with a home grow back before our medicinal program and it was voted down so i i just think that's going to be something that they may go recreational but i don't think they're going to want the home grow to be surprising to me really yeah i'm going to take go away because my reaction is that you would think that like we have we have uh recreational and adult we have adult use and we have medical cannabis in massachusetts but to your point we both live in massachusetts we both have the right i mean to be fair to the law it the law only protects you if you own property in massachusetts if you're a renter you have zero protection under massachusetts law um but if you own property in massachusetts like i'm not going out there and growing plants right now it's like i'm still buying my wheat in a shop even if i have the option right to grow it online it's too much pressure i mean how do i know what i'm growing is going to be as you know and granted i also recognize as a home grower you can get your stuff tested by a state-certified lab which is great i think it's a 50 feet to get your stuff tested which is great but i mean i can't imagine spending 14 weeks or four months with a plant seeing it grow seeing it flower and then taking it to the testing lab and realized oh this is this is hemp this isn't even this isn't even you know thc based cannabis right but imagine if the only way you could eat bread was if you had to grow the grain yourself and you had so hungry exactly but to lisa's point i really i think i agree with her very much that we won't see probably if we don't see home grow before it won't in ohio it won't come until you have recreational adult use because it's really hard to swallow a pill like okay it's been decriminalized you can get a medical card you can you can buy it in a decriminalized shop but but you can't grow it in your own backyard i don't see long term i don't see that being enforceable right i'm telling someone they can't grow a plant on their own property right exactly that's and it's a weed for quite a lot um i would be remiss you're you're in the cleveland school of cannabis you're in cleveland ohio there was a brawl in the city last night between two political candidates i'm sure you've heard about this i just want to make sure you're okay and and ohio being a swing state and cannabis now becoming a political pawn in this process it's amazing to me that in washington d.c the republicans have counted how many times the word cannabis the democrats have put in their next covid relief bill and it's never going to pass so we're at a stalemate and yet cannabis is right in the middle of it cleveland was right in the middle of it last night and i'll admit i was one of the lucky ones i chose not to watch i was just dealt with the highlights because i would get too upset but did the word cannabis ever get uttered in that debate does anybody know that anybody oh i i watched it i i actually am not in cleveland we have a branch in columbus as well we don't we have more than one school um so i didn't get to see the brawl one-on-one but um i did not hear and i i often told myself and others at the school you know all a candidate all one of those candidates has to do is say that they're gonna work with removing schedule one uh cannabis from schedule one and they would see a huge shift in votes you know i mean i just think that that that is a a big winner right now on both sides so i just don't understand why they're afraid to take that on yeah because they don't understand it it goes back to education it goes back to the stigma they've been told one thing for 80 years they can't beat it ridiculous partisanship is also a big part of this we look at john boehner he used to be former former chair of the senate right now has his own cannabis company says oh well some some smart people told me some things well i think there were a lot of people telling a lot of folks a lot of things before a certain point but suddenly you walk away from a particular political party party and now it's okay to jump in bed with cannabis i think that's a pretty taste and i'm really afraid because getting rid of schedule one lisa as you might know steve d'angelo told me this and you know steve is pretty connected as you might know the campus community in california it's an administrative thing the president of the united states and i don't like to use his name can pick up the phone call the doj and get it descheduled and i'm not going to put it by him to do that a week before even though he's come out as anti and you know we don't have anything to do with it and it's left wing and all this stuff that he throws out there but i'm still fearful that he'll use this as a way to get reelected now granted i just admitted okay i i do lean on the other side okay don't know what's going to happen but lord knows the cleveland school of cannabis will still be there you'll still be teaching no matter what happens in november correct that's right and the future is bright for the cannabis industry and the fact that you guys place so many candidates uh i give i take my hat off to you i think it's a great thing you're doing there and uh you know that you guys are welcome on this show to talk more anytime thank you thank you so much and i believe that you know uh education builds nations right right so this is uh what we need to do with cannabis we need to build a cannabis nation absolutely and uh lisa's wearing zwerna thank you so much for joining us here on cannabis chat from the cleveland school of cannabis on this day this professor read wednesday that we like to call it here and she makes so many good points and it gives you an idea and especially here you are in the business yeah in massachusetts yeah they play 70 of their and you see that's incredible and you really hadn't heard of them before no and i'll tell you i'm i came into it a little biased because we to me the biggest part my biggest question always about certifications is are you placing the people that's that's really what i care about most because i think i even alluded to it when i was talking about who we hire but we're looking for people with experience or we're looking for people with experience in either customer service or cannabis um if there is a service that can pro because frankly talking about hiring how high like it is hard to hire someone in the cannabis industry it usually takes about two months of background checks and follow-ups with the cannabis control commission in this state um it costs us thousands of dollars just to get a candidate even like to their very first day so there is a lot invested by both um by both people who are trying to join the industry and industry um uh players who want to hire top talent um i would love it if there was a hiring like educational service that could send us like really top talent and was establishing a bar absolutely and they're the people to work with i'd be happy to make that intro yeah and dan saying uh this is i feel like this is a good way to and last question to wrap this up yeah someone asked if you are wearing a fake beard or not oh goodness no no you can pull on this uh real hair real hair real beard so jealous so jealous in so many ways andrew elk it's been a pleasure you were you know what you were you have the personality you have the knowledge you have the passion all these things that i call the it factor thank you jimmy so uh i hope uh you won't be a stranger no and i want to come back you absolutely can come back on this show anytime any wednesday because it's all about education here i love wednesday and the beautiful thing because dan french knows how to work the zoom thing you don't even have to leave your living room anymore you can join us on zoom every wednesday if you'd like you know i'll wear a different bow tie next time even oh no but i like that i like the red planks oh yeah no absolutely i love the fact that it's the same tie you had on in the bubbler video too it was great well that's going to do it for this show friday with david rabinovitz our green rush friday we've got three great guests coming in on zoom and rather than tease you just tune in or check it out on demand after the fact but we'll be here on friday 4 p.m to 6 p.m again with another cannabis chat show this time we focus on the finance the business of the industry so you want to tune into that i believe we're going to run this week's weed talk news following this live stream so by all means if you want to see kurt dalton do his thing he is a master when it comes to commenting on just about everything there is to know about the cannabis industry and the news of the week so that'll be coming up after this remember it's a whole new world of wheat out there use it responsibly thanks for watching thanks for listening we are pro cannabis media [Music] hi everyone welcome to wetalk news i'm jimmy young the founder of pro cannabis media and i'm kirk dalton the founder of cannabis.net every week kurt and i get together and talk about the biggest stories in the cannabis universe locally here in massachusetts coast to coast and around the world and this week's no different jimmy vermont is actually getting a little bit closer to recreational sales we have hemp thief stealing hemp thinking that they're getting marijuana and one of the biggest brands in the world cookies is making its way to florida but let's go right to dev board chart of the green market report for our wall street minute take it away deb thanks guys this week the vermont senate cast a final vote in favor of s-54 legislation that would legalize regulate and tax cannabis sales the bill now proceeds to the desk of governor phil scott and he hasn't said whether or not he's going to sign it this would be the latest new england state to legalize cannabis and that puts more pressure on the bordering state of new york aurora cannabis delivered its official results for the fourth quarter only problem is they said that revenues are going to decline in the coming first quarter now a couple of weeks ago you may recall aurora said its fourth quarter net revenue fell 5 to 72 million dollars now they're saying first quarter revenue is only going to come in between 60 million and 64 million dollars cushco holdings said that it expects its fourth quarter revenue now to come in between 25 and a half million and 26 million this is better than the third quarter revenue that came in at only 22.3 million dollars and it's an improvement over the previous guidance where they said they thought revenue was going to come in at between 24 and 26 million dollars kushko said that the 14 to 17 expected increase in revenue is being driven primarily by an increase in sales to its top 100 customers and that's the big business news for this week i'm deborah borchardt from the green marker report for weed talk news so while we wait for vermont governor phil scott to pen the legalization bill for sales of cannabis in vermont there's another part of that bill that we should mention it has to do with the expungement of records of inmates who've been convicted for small cannabis possession crimes laura subin who is the executive director of the vermont coalition to regulate cannabis released this quote we view this as a critical component of a movement towards racial justice and cannabis policy it recognizes and aims to repair some of the horrific legacy of racism and the enforcement of cannabis prohibition laws unquote kurt i think she nailed it right on the head yeah an expungement is such an important part of this process because the things that were taken away uh from their lives when they were arrested like voting rights access to jobs with a background check a criminal check that has to be reversed as well so they have to have the ability to vote people have to have the ability to get a job or have a record cleaned when there's a background check done it's the right way to do it and another news item out of washington d.c from the marijuana moment is that there is now a coalition of cannabis advocacy businesses who are trying to legalize interstate commerce between legal states the alliance for sensible markets campaign is pushing governors of legal cannabis states to enter into an interstate compact now before the lawyers get involved with this and kind of challenge the constitutionality of this keep in mind that a recognized agreement between two or more states to establish a framework for interstate commerce is actually a precedent that was set back in 1921 when new york and new jersey signed a similar agreement that created the port authority of new york so if new jersey makes it legal and new york has a medicinal program they could work out an exchange as well as western states california and oregon kurt do you think we'll ever see this uh in this form that has zero percent chance of going through what they don't mention and god bless the effort is that you're dealing with a schedule one drug by the federal government and states do not have the authority to supersede federal law or create it or change it that's kind of been the whole problem so while i value the the look at history and the loophole that they're trying through it'll never happen this way and it has zero chance of that going through so obviously after the election if there actually is a change of leadership in the united states it has a better chance of going through agreed i would agree that that is certainly the first choice lawsuits like steve deangelo's challenge the constitutionality at the federal level are second this is another kind of wink-wink hail mary that i i don't see this ever working not to mention even if you got momentum the federal government could challenge us for years in different appeals courts all right so it is harvest season for hemp and marijuana but it's the fields of hemp that are being targeted by thieves since of course it's tough to tell the difference between a hemp plant and the same cannabis plant with thc in it it has always been a target of people who think they're stealing weed and end up with non-intoxicating hemp it happened in georgia when a farmer interrupted an attempted theft from his industrial hemp patch over 10 pounds of hemp was recovered when the thieves were caught and cooperated with police the price of those plants about 1 000 for 10 pounds kurt a big difference between 10 pounds of hemp and 10 pounds of marijuana yeah this is a scene right out of a will ferrell or mark wahlberg movie where they the thieves sneak into the field they cut down you know a truckload and they're all happy they realize they have hemp so unless they're planning on making some cbd take the chairs of some really nice cbds uh drops uh they're gonna be greatly disappointed after they they use the help and pay their fines for doing it all right another story about illegal grows is coming from new mexico where illegal cannabis is growing amongst legal growers of hemp now add in the fact that these farms are just off native american lands and owned by chinese businessmen they have caught the attention of the council of the navajo nation the department of homeland security and many other law enforcement entities it seems that kids are being trafficked into new mexico to tend to these crops some of these kids are as young as 10 years old illegal growers are starting to get more and more attention from law enforcement and this may have uncovered a human trafficking ring certainly probably something they'd like to stop especially the human trafficking and certainly not what you want to see in a hemp or in a cannabis field correct yeah we talked about things that are compressing the margins uh all the way around on the bottom line where you have to find a way to create some margin and unfortunately child labor and forced labor is certainly a way uh to to find some margin on the bottom line and unfortunately this is an ugly side of a lot of um parts of life whether it be a sneaker factory or or out of the united states uh picking tomatoes or whatever it's gonna be hemp and cannabis are being attached to this and uh it's a black eye all the way around not just for the hemp and cannabis industry but just child labor and child trafficking is a pretty sick thing altogether absolutely has to start that has to stop so now in fortuna california a one thousand dollar a day fine will be administered as a deterrent for local illegal growers once local enforcement issues a warning now those who do get fined will not be prosecute prosecuted or arrested for this misdemeanor but is that a thousand dollars a day enough to stop growing illegally kurt depends how big your grow is and if you're you know thinking about this you'd want to have grows in multiple locations and just realize this may be the new cost of doing business on the black market um you know if you have four or five locations you know hey one's gonna get taken down every six months and you work that into your financial equations the fact it's not a criminal charge and there's a warning first i think people are going to continue to push the limits as we like to say everybody's doing a little bit of a cash grab meanwhile up in canada it's time for solomon israel's mj biz daily international report and another record set from our northern borders take it away solomon i'm solomon israel from marijuana business daily international and this is your weed talk news canadian cannabis report canadian sales of recreational marijuana hit yet another new high in july the regulated markets surpassed 231 million canadian dollars up more than 15 percent over june on an annualized basis july's figures imply a market worth 2.8 billion canadian dollars meanwhile aurora cannabis posted a net loss approaching 1.9 billion canadian dollars for the quarter ended june 30th all told the company lost 3.3 billion during its 2020 fiscal year new ceo miguel martin said he plans to refocus aurora's brand portfolio to prioritize premium brands and the government of british columbia is working on a program to allow farm gate sales from small licensed cannabis producers that would let those grocers those drawers sell their own crop directly from stores located at their production sites but there's a catch the program isn't scheduled to launch until 2022 and a provincial election is scheduled before then you can read those stories and more at mjbizdaily.com i'm solomon israel from marijuana business daily according to mjbiz daily cannabis consumers are spending more during covert per visit in california nevada washington state and colorado facts like that are available in the mj biz daily 2020 factbook you can get yours at mjbizdaily.com a california company known for its celebrity ownership called cookies has just bought a license to operate a medical dispensary in florida kurt do you know of a rapper named berner i've heard of him before yes i haven't before i read this story anthony milan is his real name and he will be the first person of color to own a license to operate in florida and it will be located in port richie scheduled to open in 2021 so i guess that's a good thing right yeah cookies is a great brand if you've read the back story it's still uh privately held and they've just done such a good job establishing uh the difference in a commodity right we've always talked about how cannabis is going to be a commodity tomatoes cabbage grapefruit whatever it's going to be and cookies has really defined the market it's what med men should be right that's kind of where it's at where cookies is the success story that went under the radar privately held they're doing it right in every state as soon as you see the store you know it for its quality as well as its design again it's kind of where ben ben should have been the vision uh cookies actually is the reality and cookies is a great name for a weed dispensary let's face it because there's always munchies involved right i mean that's obviously where they came from anyway hard to believe there is an issue with delivery in colorado a state where it's been legal for 10 years sure enough colorado springs is banning the delivery of medical marijuana citing a public safety issue and the cost of regulation kurt i do not get this one no it's funny the price of uh cannabis per pound or marijuana in colorado is i have a three year high which tells me if it's just supply and demand there's a lot of demand whether it's black market or above the board for that colorado bud so it's strange to see a medical uh thing maybe there's an incident there or you know what about recreational so i think there's a little more to that story and there could be some players making that happen for strategic purposes in their business but we'll have to wait and see and now it's time for the dc report with vote pro podcast phil adams phil here with the weed talk news dc report postponing a house vote on the moore act until after election day will not slow the momentum toward cannabis reform say industry lobbyist that is provided the democrats retain control of the house david man joan of the liaison group a dc lobby firm for the national cannabis roundtable expects lawmakers to push for cannabis descheduling with a social justice component man joan believes this will offer a more comprehensive solution toward aligning state and federal marijuana laws saying quote the house has set a new line in the sand this is what impactful cannabis reform will look like cannabis trade federation advisor steve fox agrees saying quote social justice is leading the push for reform and the drive for a regulated market it's really where we've been at the state level the food and drug administration will release draft guidelines designed to streamline approvals of cbd based medications the fda announced it is soliciting public feedback from researchers who are interested in submitting new drug applications for cbd products the guidelines come two years after the agency approved epidialex a brand of cbd-based epilepsy medication the fda is also actively seeking research contractors to help study the non-toxicating cannabinoid in news from outside the beltway ethos cannabis announced the purchase of three medical dispensaries in maryland the philadelphia-based company has acquired the rights to four front dispensaries in three locations along the d.c baltimore corridor the purchase is part of an 18 million dollar deal with multi-state cannabis company forefront ventures currently operating under forefronts mission brand the dispensaries will be rebranded to ethos that's the weed talk news dc report for this week i'm phil adams from votepro podcast a few months ago kurt and i talked with melissa metley who was one of the principals at the group called south dakota for better marijuana laws now legalization for adult use and medical marijuana are both on the ballot in south dakota and a recent poll says that over 60 percent of the voters there are planning on approving those initiatives that group released some disturbing but not so surprising stats about cannabis arrests in that state did you know one of nearly 10 arrests in 2018 was for cannabis possession and many were carried out on a racially disproportionate basis once again kurt weed legalization is now more about racial profiling than making the plant legal yeah especially in a state like that i mean i was going to say good we can get the child labor straightened out off the indian reservations on a state like that but to see 61 we had talked to melissa before it's really gaining traction and her group if you remember was the one that was really behind both of those ballot questions and pushing it so congrats to her for not only getting it there but obviously having a strong majority ready to legalize absolutely and hopefully after election day and if it passes uh we'll reach back out to melissa to congratulate her for sure now one last story about those devastating fires on the west coast in oregon specifically and sure enough the small businesses administration confirmed that none of the farms that were destroyed are eligible for any kind of relief funds now the oregonian is reporting that seven companies lost everything canyon cannabis grateful meds blue river grass station and fireside dispensary were a few and amazingly the fire came within three miles of jim belushi's farm but the wind changed direction and it was spared jim belushi issued an appeal for his fellow growers yesterday he wants you to go to the jackson county united way website they have a campaign to try to raise funds specifically for that area and we are showing the link for you to go to that basically it's united unitedwayofjacksoncounty.org backslash give backslash so kurt hopefully people will feel bad about this and donate some money back to some of the businesses that were just you know isn't it interesting our citizens have to do what our federal government won't do yeah it's kind of this um tight rope to walk due to insurance policies for cannabis in some states and what's covered and crops so it's a real disaster even the california fires so anybody that can uh you know you enjoy the plant you enjoy the product if you can give a little everybody gives a little uh it just goes a long way for those farmers who are growing the product you enjoy just trying to make a living growing belushi the show on discovery is hoping for a second season they're actually in negotiations right now now i understand there's a virtual convention this coming weekend 10x and i believe we know someone involved with that kurt you and bruce linton getting together for that are you i think there may be a little banter back and forth if you want to check it out it's the finals of cannabis 10x coming up this weekend judges are cheech marin and bruce linton uh and we'll be doing a piece uh kind of before the uh final judging so stay tuned for that and there's a youtube video out there that promotes that event and kurt i discovered it and

Truly trained professionals should be the only once that should keep mambas. I like the idea of mambas being displayed in zoos \n but somebody has to take care of them. But there are people trained to care for such dangerous animals. No person is really properly trained to handle mambas. I myself handled several docent mambas throughout my carrier. One of the first time was a confiscation in \n which someone had their entire venomous snake ... collection confiscated and brought to my facility. Among the confiscated snakes were three or four mambas \n that I had to place in cages. I actually pinned a few down and some of them I used the hook. Because the are so fast, agile and quick which makes \n them more dangerous than any other snake to handle. But giving enough room and practice they become handleable. Once I bought a mamba hatchling, raised it and I \n pretty much got to know its movement patterns. It got to know my movements too but I \n got to know how to handle it. Where to grab it and what little tricks there are to handling mambas. That comes in times and with experience. That does not happen over night.

the commando rc uh so here uh we have one of my uh sct 410.3 uh if you've been following my channel you've heard me talk about my techno short course don't tell my wife i'm not wearing my ring uh but these trucks are very good trucks i recommend them now uh previous video i actually put in this castle system and this one this is actually a lender system uh my buddy rod lent it to me so if you would like to follow him on instagram he's got some really cool stuff at rodswheels rc's so he lent me the system it's a castle system but i'm going to be removing it because i just picked up this uh really cool uh tkin system this is an rx8 uh gen 3 system and i'm going to try it out see how it works uh the system i used to have was a uh 2200 kv it was the longer can it was the 1515 castle motor with a mamba monster x esc now my esc fried sent it back to castle uh they are replacing it under warranty it's been over two months but i finally got an email uh today that they're gonna be mailing it to me so finally i'm going to get a replacement i guess some other products were manufacturing but i did pick up this system and the reason why i picked up the system is this one here i'll let you know later it's either 1800 or 1900 kvs it's too slow uh i did have a video where i was just doing runs so there's some past videos of me doing some runs with this truck this system the 2200 kv motor 1515 is faster than this one i mean this is a 1512 but you know the other one's higher kvs and it's the same opinion that's the biggest opinion i can fit but we're going to see how this tecan does because this is a uh 2650 so 2650 kvs uh it's the tt 2330 4030 model so we'll see so first thing and it is time to unbox uh so let's go ahead and unbox this tekken rx8 th e3 gen 3 system uh it's motor and esc again it is tt2 330 four zero three zero uh two thousand six hundred fifty kv twenty six fifty kv all right so for this i'm just going to break the seal and generally when i break the seals uh i follow the box don't get into the box you might run the blade into something you don't want to uh but let's see what is in here motor oh this is this feels good uh this actually feels pretty soft it's interesting it's it uh it's very smooth multiple poles i will be making a comparison with a different motor later on actually the castle motor this is very very smooth there it actually isn't much resistance so i'm curious i'm used to things having a little more resistance when it comes to these motors i mean maybe because i i got used to that castle motor uh but let's see we also have the esc and the esc i already did an unboxing i believe all right i soldered one of these up together to my teakin 4300 kv uh that was on my other techno short course uh well this is the exact same i'm actually curious what the size difference is between this and the castle but you do get the wires and you get three wires the black and the red you're going to be using for the motor that you're also going to be using for your terminals for your uh positive and negative the white one you only use for uh the motors you are going to have quite a bit of white wire left over this is for my other esc so let's see 12 gauge yeah that was 12 gauge it's the same esc so i'm just going to be using this and that for the little programming box and as always well these are just massive i don't know why they don't include a smaller one i mean i guess it depends on the setup that's one thing i do like about hobbywing hobbywink provides a short andalon unfortunately i'm out of the short wires uh you do get a fan uh the fan i recommend you install first uh you get this here this has to do with the software make sure you update and this is your hot wire uh so do read the instructions now you do get some uh tkin stickers i'm not really big into stickers to be honest uh especially those that have cut out i think these you have to cut out yep you have to cut them out so i'm not going to be using them all right so the foam in there and then you get your instructions so do re over your instructions especially once you're setting everything up because you will have to calibrate with your radio and that's going to be important for later on for today we're just going to do the comparison and then i'm going to do the install so we'll get rid of this flip this off the table for now but that is it first impressions this thing looks pretty good uh i like the craftsmanship one of the things that i like again they do use uh six screws uh some systems do not well then again this is a 40 millimeter cam but on the smaller cans of 36 millimeters some others only have three and i've actually broken this off and popped some screws out just bashing so i'm glad they use six uh you know somebody's gonna come out and use eight or maybe they'll use larger diameter i'm not sure one thing that i'm very surprised is how easily this is to turn i'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing maybe it's because it's the higher kv magnets are a little lighter maybe just so it can rev up more but i'm not really concerned about torque because this is a 40 millimeter motor uh so the diameter is 40 millimeters so the greater the diameter the more torque so i'm not concerned uh but other than that uh let's go ahead and remove the other system the one we're replacing and then we can compare the motor and esc i'm not going to use this clip this just to hold the wires all right here we go so this is the castle system that we're removing so we need our two and a half millimeter driver and we're going to be removing this first so we want the motor off and one of the things that is nice about castle is they do use these really large connectors i believe they're 6.5 millimeter uh connectors it just makes it easy to install and remove motors you know swap motors with esc without having to solder but i will be honest solder is best so this taken system will be soldered on there we go there's the other one i'm just gonna get some wires out of the way and this is a tight fit i'm gonna have to do this off the table all right so here let me just get this close so on i've already done this uh short course before i showed you i think when i installed it these motors 40 millimeters are very tight fit on the short course so you can modify this i don't want to so that you can easily add it and remove it but since i'm not going to be installing the motor removing the motor often i did not do that the other thing too is notice a little tie here that screws there i took that off the other other option is to go ahead and just kind of grind off part of these fins to make it fit uh i just didn't want to modify the motor because it's not my motor right it's my friend's motor he lent it to me that's the reason why so opinion we're going to go ahead and remove the pinion we'll need our two millimeter driver for that and i am not going to use this pinion this is a 22 tooth pinion i'm actually going to use a 19 tooth pinion with that motor and now i have to cut actually i should use my snips i'll use these a little zip tie there we go all right and i need to open up the receiver box so you need your two millimeter driver just set this over to the side there goes there and for those of you that can't see i mean you can't see over there the way i'm placing the screws is i place them where i took them off so this one came off of this side there and then i just lay the receiver box like this so that i know where the screws came came from so i guess for a very better view with this over here there we go so i'm placing the screws like this that way i know where they came out of that's my method it works for me if you have another method you can share in the comments please share in the comments all right let's see if we can lift this now i am out of five millimeter bullet so i'm gonna have to solder these off and solder them on the new esc but here uh double stick tape it's pretty good tape it's a 3m stuff there we go all right it was actually just this tape that was holding it the other tape as you can see is pretty used to remove this it's just two screws and again uh thanks so much to my uh friend rod for letting me system in the meanwhile uh it's a good system it just uh kbs are too low for this truck uh that's the only thing so this is an 1800 kv so it's a 1512 uh 1800 kb motor and it's just not enough kb's for this particular truck maybe if it were an mt 410 with uh 3.8 wheels tires and wheels uh that would be a different story this would actually be a pretty good motor but because i'm only running short course uh tires on this you know not enough kb's and that's the reason why uh this system does not work for my application but it may work for your application let's see so now we need a 2.5 millimeter driver and remove the motor mount and motor mount is removed let's see screws look good i am going to have to clean a few of these parts i'm going to have to definitely clean this before i give it back to him uh but as of now i want to do a quick size comparison uh now the specs of the rx8 are very very good specs but let's just compare the motors first so motors appear to be the same diameter all right no difference there now as far as the body's concerned the teakin is slightly longer by slightly longer it looks about three millimeters uh just going to place them here on my ruler so if i start at 70 that looks like it's 70. it's going to end let's see at 76. just about so that's a 66 right from 70 from 70 to 76.6 that's uh 66 millimeters approximately now this one here because it kind of the bell i'm going to use the screw as an orientation let's see let's see that looks like it's right at about 70. this one looks like it's at what is that 78 about 78 so from 70 sorry 78 uh 76.8 so from 70 to 76 points so it's about 68 uh millimeters so this one's about two millimeters longer which may not seem like much but on electric motors it's quite a difference uh now one of the things that i am going to note is uh this end bell uh the material is thicker than this one this one's a lot thinner uh compared to this one this one is a little thicker so i don't know if there's a millimeter there uh front belts seem to be about the same so if you measure from here from the face to there where it ends these are the same but the rear this one's thinner this one this one is thicker so if you were to measure from there and then see the black portion uh i don't know if that's where the difference is in length but anyway look about the same if i were to rotate this one see this one's a lot harder to rotate and let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve okay so twelve uh yeah that's this is pretty tough this one's really easy to rotate so i don't know why uh maybe lower kvs stronger magnets uh this one uh maybe weaker magnets so we can get the rpms up i mean keep in mind it's 850 kv difference i lost count but this one jumped every 12 so that's has to do with the polls this one does over 20. let me try it one more time trying to line it up with this screw i keep losing count anyway uh so this one probably has more pulls i'm curious i have to look that up uh all right so motors you know still very similar in space uh now let's look at the esc's the esc's these are easy so if you look at the tekken the teaching is narrower and it's a significant difference but if you look at the length the i guess let's see i should line them up and then so if you look at the rear that's the difference in the rear uh the difference would be let me use my finger so it's easier to see the difference would be greater here but because of this little hump on the castle the difference isn't that much uh that looks like it's hey it's not even two millimeters to be honest could be two let's just say it's two millimeters two millimeters there uh let's see let's just measure let's see we start at 70 so that's about 5.5 if we start at 70 uh you are looking at yeah 5.7 yeah so two millimeters uh so this way not much this yeah this fits perfectly in there and then because it's narrower you're going to have more space between the esc and the motor so when it comes to cooling that's going to make a difference you get a little more air in between them uh so that's pretty much it and this here everything solder is uh saw it has to go be soldered on that's one of the differences between them uh the biggest difference between these two systems to be honest and you shouldn't be able to see it it's right there right there this is a sensored system and i love sensored systems this is sensorless sensorless works if you're just bashing or doing speed runs uh but if you want more control you definitely want censored so mama monster 2 and as a newcastle um 1800 kv gonna be replaced with this tkin system all right so the first thing i'm going to do because it's easier to solder a motor that doesn't move i'm actually going to put the motor mount and i'm going to mount it on and then i'm going to solder the motor once it's here but the first thing you need as always you're going to need a little bit of loctite so i'm just going to set the screws in there i'm just going to put just a small amount here on the threads you don't need to overdo it you're just going to get thread lock everywhere you can use any thread lock you want loctite is a very good brand of thread lock that you can use uh all right so one of the things to note actually i was about to mount this backwards is this here we go this little portion here this is for your driver so this goes on the outside so you want to make sure that this this goes up wherever so this is going to be on the left side of the motor so if you're looking at the motor this way left right this goes to the left of the motor so it should look like that all right now drive the screws in oh this uses bigger screws fun oh all right well i'm not too worried so originally this is what was happening i didn't realize this until now this is actually pretty cool but the motor mount does not allow for a large diameter screw uh if you look at these two holes these are actually larger diameter the other four are the three millimeter diameter which is what i need for this motor mount uh so that being said uh let's try again but let's get the correct hole so i'm going to mount it over here and the reason why i'm choosing oh let's see so if i choose this mounting position where will this end up all right so once this slides in that's going to be toward the bottom so that's not going to work so i actually want to flip it the other way and that's going to be my only option so the reason why is because of the way the mount is designed if i were to mount it this way this slides in that means this motor would have been in here this way so my wires would have been really close to the center shaft so the drive shaft don't want that so i'm going to turn it the other way and i'm going to do this so now they're going to be facing outwards which will allow for more space all right there we go right so the motor mount is in and this thing's going to go in there let me just clean this up just a little bit all right but before i actually install the motor i have to run the wire over here because once i put the motor it's going to be a challenge sorry i think i said install the motor on my esc so i'm just going to get this wire in there apply the rubber bands all right and this is plenty long all right so remember this goes into number two so hopefully with these videos i can encourage many of you to get into rcs and start buying some of these uh higher end kits they are really not that difficult to work on i'll be honest it may seem intimidating especially when you have to build everything piece by piece and yes you're probably going to spend on a higher end kit five to eight hours building it do not use the allen wrenches use drivers uh it seems like a lot but to be honest it's not that much if you think about it if you just spend about an hour a day a week you'll be fine all actually right to just remove that plate but and it's just three screws let's just remove that plate and all three of these screws happen to be the same size i'm not too worried about mixing them up there we go all right perfect so here is the plate now i'm not going to fix this on here just yet i'm just going to let you place it here one of the things that you're going to want to do is you definitely want to do this especially if you're going to be doing some high jump smashing which i mean this truck's my off-road truck and i do jump it i do bash it you definitely want to use a tie strap so if you look at that there and this here this is where you want this tie strap to go so again it's going to go right through there and you're going to tie strap the esc to this mounting plate even if you're taping it down all right so for now go ahead and just add another piece of tape alright so i'm going to use my helping hands because i have to tin the wires and just for fun i'm going to use a soldering gun just to show you that you can use a soldering gun to do all of this work a lot of people don't like them because of the large uh tip here points but it works you can use it but before i do that i should put the fan on because the air comes out this way i'm going to install it this way so that it blows the air into the heat sink so it's going to be this way it's based on rotation the fan is going to be turning this way so it's going to be pushing the air out through this side here so because the air is coming this way i want that to be blowing into the heat sink now you have to keep in mind the length because this is going to be connected here so if i just held it here what are my options i can install it this way and also install it this way i'm going to install it this way it seems much easier all right there we go two millimeter yep two millimeter and the screws should fit right in do not tighten them fully until you have all four on because this moves side to side so wait until all four screws are partially installed okay all right so the fan is on i'm gonna go ahead and connect this right and then in the fan it says a positive negative so positives on the right negatives on the left that's the way i connected this another way to look at is little tabs go toward the outside all right so this is set so now all we have to do is we have to tin all five of these and then we have to tin all the wires so i'm gonna just place the wires here on the helping hands and we're gonna get to tinning a little bit more perfect and the other thing too is you want that glossy finish i mean it's almost chrome like i can't really tell on this camera uh but anyway that's that's the right way to do it so i'm just going to leave this here the other thing too is notice i can handle the wire this thing heats up pretty fast as soon as i place it there it doesn't take long before i can apply the solder and then the solder just kind of runs through the wire you don't want to run too much solder because the solder will just run through the wire and then you're going to get a really hard spot and you're it's not going to be as malleable it won't bend as easily so you're just applying just enough solder for your tinning needs all right that's it and again see so i can hold the wire i mean it's warm i can feel it uh wire also cools surprisingly fast well when you apply cool air or something to it you know that's 120 degrees out well probably not going to cool as fast as you'd like it all right here we go oh perfect all right i'm just going to let it sit there and cool a bit all right now we're going to tip the esc uh so here i'm going to apply the heat gun and then i'm just going to apply the solder should be pretty quick mainly you don't want to apply too much heat for too long because you'll you don't want to heat your electronics i mean heat is your electronics worst enemy that's why you don't want it cheap soldering iron if you get a cheap soldering iron that's only i don't know 5 watts it's probably not going to reach the temperature that you need i mean this thing reaches actually i don't know i'm sure it reaches over 400 celsius i'm sure which is a thousand degrees probably over i have to do the conversion at some other point all right so i'll just be easier if i just stand up and then apply the heat that's it and you can't really see from there but the heat will make the solder spread so the solder spreads to wherever it gets hot or there's heat so let's go to the next one just a little more on the bottom tip the solder melts at about 185 degrees celsius or uh 365 fahrenheit approximately that was quick that was quick too there we go perfect and the what i was doing you can't really see because of the angle but let's just say this were the cylinder and there's a cut out right here i was holding the soldering iron here and i was holding the solder below it so as soon as it reached the temperature it needed to the solder would just kind of melt and spread yeah you can't put the solder directly on the tip but the solder is going to melt at a lower temperature than you need i mean you need to get the metal whatever the terminals are you need to get them up to temperature so that the solder bonds to it so that's the reason why i do it that way now i'm just going to inspect and they're all pre-tin they'll look good all right good so now i just need to tin this other side of the red and the black wire so the red and the black wires these are the only ones i'm going to tin on both sides four now the reason why is i'm actually going to solder them as a loop and then later i'm going to cut them to length just that way i can go ahead and install the esc and for those kids that are watching do not do this on supervisor alone just have an adult dude for you if you want the adult to teach you that's fine but do not touch any of the metal components they get extremely hot you will burn and blister your skin so i'm setting up my helping hands this way this way here and the reason why i'm setting it up this way is so that once it gets hot it's going to start up here it just kind of drops in so let's go ahead and set up perfect and then i'm just going to push it down and i'm not touching the electronics yet i'm just giving some time to the heat gun to heat up there looks like it's ready and kind of stuck this is the tricky part because you have to get heat to both items the wire and the terminal there we go and it slides in perfect that's it and again you want that uh shiny uh kind of chrome looking finish and i'm just making sure yep the back everything looks better everything looks good perfect and before you start soldering electronics like this if you've never soldered before and you want to learn you can just grab pieces of wire just kind of solder the wires that's really the best way to go i mean unless somebody taught you when you were a child that's my case my father taught me when i was a kid so the question for me now is now this is the way most people mount it and then you have your wires over here the only thing is if you pay attention to your motor now you're going to need longer wires and i don't like long wires so if these were the wires your wires don't have to be longer but at least your a will be with your a your b will be with your b c will be c just like this if you followed my other build uh i had to cross them right a and b because this was this way all right uh at this point also i really want it this way the only thing is that gets messier for the wires uh because i really want this i guess i can loop it this way i want this wire to come out straight through here and not go under the well motor see can i do that yeah i couldn't do that that's out of the way sure why not do that all right i just want to make sure this is flat i'm trying to get it in here and then through there and oh just use the tie strap to hold it as well right let's just put this through all right and i'm going to flip this and it's easier if you try to find the holes in line mud we go okay so all right so i can apply the sensor wire let's see goes this way so be careful with the sensor wire when you're putting the sensor wire if you notice the uh the little pins the pins are closer to the outside or closer to this side so if you look at this here just line up where the little holes are so little tabs are going to go toward the inside this flat section of plastic that goes this way and then you're just going to set it and should go right in if it doesn't go right in and you're having trouble you're probably doing something wrong because it shouldn't be difficult for you to install the sensor wire all right now i have not tint the motor yet i've not forgotten let's see just that good we'll do this here it's easier if i can see there we go all right so if i place this in for now oh this actually goes in easier um i'm actually curious so what i'm curious is if i can actually put that little plastic strap there so with the castle system i was not because the motor would hit but the way this motor mounts it looks like it mounts just far enough i may be able to use this to secure the wires all right let's see no it's sitting all right so it does fit uh so that little piece of plastic there that uh holds the wire down you're just gonna have to grind off some of the plastic and then the motor kind of slides in uh if you need you can just use a little dead blow hammer or a rubber mallet and just kind of tap it in but on that it fits so i can keep that versus the castle i could not keep it i had to take that off which is one thing i did not like again not a big deal i just didn't like not having that so i'm really glad now that i can keep that little extra piece just to secure my wires so now we can go ahead i actually already set the mesh so i'm just applying a little bit of this thread lock compound shoes already set when we hold the motor perfect just enough play not too much and let's go ahead and set the other one and then we'll continue with the soldering no uh yeah yes yes i need to clean my truck uh i'm gonna run it again so i'm not too worried about it uh one of the things i did lend my compressor my air compressor you can clean all of this really easy with just an air compressor so if you don't have one you can use a little brush and cut it you can use a rag take the whole thing apart but to be honest a air compressor works wonders now it doesn't matter what compressor you have my compressor is actually a small one i can't remember it's probably like one of those three gallon compressors uh the only thing with those is it really it really only holds enough air three gallons is really just enough to do like an arm or a shock and part of the other shock uh you really want a larger a compressor with a just a larger larger capacity all right now we're going to tin these so we have to tin all three of them all of these tabs and then we're going to determine what length we need to wire which will be that length as you can see all right so i'm going to start with the top one so as you can see just apply the side of the terminal just go wherever there's heat and notice i can still touch the motor everything so the motor is not too hot you don't want to overheat your electronics again anything to notice the solder i wasn't even touching uh the solder with the tip of the gun uh here let's let's zoom in a little and then hopefully you'll be able to see so i'm going to do this one and i'm going to apply the heat here and the solder over here [Music] beautiful that's it so again you don't have to apply the solder to the tip of the gun uh and again i can touch this now don't go wild and crazy and stick your finger right on top of the solder you will burn yourself i'm just touching everything around making sure it's not hot and at this point the solder is cool so again actually if you stick your finger there hard enough then you will feel heat but i mean don't do that let's see so i should really connect this sensor wire i don't think i've should have connected this from the start let's see all right the tabs are close to the bottom so that means that this should go so this is going to go up this is going to go here and this is where pliers would come in handy i should have done this before putting the motor in all right i'm gonna have to turn this so i can see there i'm just guessing there we go good stuff and this is why you need needle nose pliers they are very very handy tools i'm just checking making sure the connection is good feels good looks good great that's it so always have a pair of needle nose pliers oh wrong way all right let's go there all right so now i'm gonna get this out of the way like this for now so this red one uh really i really don't need that much so i'm going to be cutting this one here and then i'll be stripping this bit of wire and that's just going to be soldered on so this is a b c a b c uh and i'm gonna want all of my wires to be about the same length to be honest i think the black wire is gonna have to be the longest so i'm gonna cut yeah it looks like it's gonna be the longest so i'm gonna cut the black one first and i'm going to cut the rest so that they're all about the same length there we go and that works all right and then see this will be able to connect to my battery good so now this is that length this one has to be about the same length all right it's that piece of wire make sure i don't cut the wrong one right this is the part that goes to my motor so this is the short side this is the long side all right all right perfect all right uh good so this is my power wire this is my negative and these i'm gonna solder five millimeter bullets to them and no matter where i put my battery anywhere here they should work so now i have to strip a bit out of all of the wires and tin there we go everything's tinned so now i can just start uh soldering on everything else i'm gonna start with the black one since black is c and it's all the way to the end just makes more sense to start off with that one there let's see all right here we go and we're starting off with c can't really there we go you can really get the gun at the terminal that's it all right it's fine right there all right so now we need a let's go ahead to be honest just use my needle nose so i'm trying to touch uh both the terminal and the wire with the tip of the soldering gun just so i can apply heat at the same time and once i see that the solder is melting actually that's when i go up on the wire and that's it and let's see soldering is complete good and solid good and solid good and solid uh great and this is here mesh is good i can't wait to run this thing uh so all we have to do now is solder the five millimeter bullets but we're gonna have to solder off uh these five millimeters because i'm out now it's all right uh i actually put these on my friend rod system i was gonna leave them on but i'm out and my friend uses uh uh ec5 anyway uh so he's probably going to have a little connector with the insulator but he's going to solder on just trying to take the insulation off at least his wires will be tint and i did not shorten them there we go all right installations off [Music] all right to start off it's actually very easy uh all you do is you helping hands you need a set of helping hands uh these are helping hands so i'm just gonna place this there and then i'm just gonna apply heat and i'm just gonna lift and that's it so i'm gonna apply heat on the actual five millimeter bullet and the wire right in there and then once it's ready it'll just come off there we go that's it now since i'm here i'm gonna apply a little more solder now let's do the other one okay that's it just gonna apply a little more solder now turn this so you can actually work with the wires and go ahead and tuck that under there sensor wire all right let's do the red one first leave this i can just use my needle nose with field tubing so on the terminal if you apply heat uh more towards the wire you're gonna see that become a really shiny silver first uh and then it will bond enough or if you apply heat to this first this will turn a very shiny silver and then before the wire and it'll still bond but you may get a cold solder so you want to make sure that both turn just a shiny silver color in other words the tinning so the solder that's on the terminal in this case that five millimeter bullet and the solder and the wire both melt that's what you're looking for and that's the reason why you tint both of them so it is sat inside so once the wire is set inside uh you just melt the solder and that's it just make sure that the both the the solder that was on the terminal or in this case the five millimeter bullet that's my terminal and the wire melts so both of them melt and that's it uh because if you melt the bottom first the wire will go in all right so that is sat in there quite well all right now uh i do not have red uh shrink tubing i do have black so i'm actually only going to do the black for now now i'm going to pick up some red maybe tomorrow all right and i always extend it just a little past this point and the reason why is so it pulls a little better is if you don't uh this thing will if you just heat shrink it there it'll kind of slide off if you pull on it when you're pulling on it here might slide off but if you do it over here it won't slide off as easy then after this just apply a little heat you can use a heat gun you can use a lighter you can use your stove gas stove don't use the electric stove and you are just heating it up you're not burning it usually shrink tubing will shrink to about half of its original diameter and this tubing was actually too big that's why it's taking forever but anyway that's good enough and that's it so we have completed the install of our tkin system now we just have to try it out so i'll be uploading a video shortly testing the system here yes i am going to drop in a 4s lipo battery in there but first i'm going to have to calibrate the esc other

button Gorga said guru - guru button all the kind of process for more autonomy it's really different when you just know about what Jesus did on the cross and it's different once you experience it and share it to other people at Allen Berube develop a new slogan do solid to none column is needy then condense normally but quicken better online so with all the people in our church whose job is discipleship really the ransom orinary degrees Akita sub Danny Garcia posse Damini actually the first and foremost we have to acknowledge that God is part of our discipleship he is the one who initiated discipleship danyoung atomically and guitar scott Accardo useless appendage among humble initiative the rock anthem or autonomy yes so his his role is to build the church through Jesus Christ piranha diamond baingan gridania Louisa's crisis in Matthew 16:18 it says and I tell you you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it Monte's nonetheless we gotta handle ahsoka tano Perico Carla Petros and a despotic are ingenious woman abandoned amatsu dumped into a llama be rockin mama Sonya and we are the church then khattala christening God is building a church that is big for us and will be growing as we continue to advance his kingdom doing going crazy I can bear again Burakumin hangin desperate to move through some arrogant one so God will build his church but it won't happen automatically to Anakin Bowen great janitor genius at our automatic as his church we have a role to play as well Subbaiah crazy at the perineum turn brigand ooo khattala koukin so our role is to make disciples - gasps kita but yang kita adela untuk menjadi kamerad it says in Matthew 28:18 to 20 and Jesus came to them and said all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me we must use the openlm and blossom into a blue ticket again you see that song about American Bharata Seagal accosted in Tsuruga rube maternity freaking but aku go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Garage super villa then the gondola bank summary to Baptists American Allahabad and honored Andrew who's teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you and behold I am with you always to the end of the age and our American democracy glasses OPM croco print a gank bada Mugen capella aku akan a commuter thank Austin anthias ambikada I resumed on so this is actually a commandment from Jesus Christ before he went to heaven for us to go and make disciples yanira printed erases bloom is nicer ooga ooga Brigitta print America tanto progam did you can more it so this is not just for disciples during that time it's not just for our pastors it's not just for the full-time staff it's really for the whole church in a book on your printer buggy para Murupara wok-te to booga-booga Paragon ballast or platinum spoon wok to typography of kita and again a lot of people who attend churches they think that accepting Jesus as their Savior is enough and going to church on a Sunday is already enough another banaram for Brubaker's last Rhema to aneesa's the ranked reserves the amigos greater I just wrote a book but if we are to look at that really if we are to understand it we really have to play our role a basilica table arena guitarist ow Upendra plan kita this ayah christianity more than just accepting him as a savior is really growing in our relationship with him yeah Buchanan's the Quran cousin become hungry my dear okay 200 Qatar's bruton boose buggy or unchristian it is a lifetime journey in Europe or to al-anon su marido the only time we we never graduate from it the only time we graduate as if you think you are already perfect then I can promise divorce Afeni Calathes loose but it's important and then if you're already perfect then you might as well go to heaven right now then Carlos you're particularly nice garden it's funny you always ask a question who wants to go to heaven together over time I get over time via banging in my suit sugar you take my circus way who wants to go to heaven right now here bringing Kasuga skerin okay so we have to do our part we have to continue making disciples we totally get into Paquita Haris Magan Pumbaa rhythm so that we could bring more people with us to heaven siga if I can become Ambani orang kasuga so a lot of people say I don't like discipleship whenever my record how it moon written it's because they don't understand what discipleship is America Mercato Mercato Applebaum britain's malaria so before we go to what discipleship is let's discuss what it is not first natural metabolizer apply the balm reason dragon blazer apathy on Bougainville Morrison so first discipleship is not primarily a mentoring program to help Christians become better church members Jeroboam brit\u00e1nico Buchan so Matamata super program in touring on the menorah no rank resentment I'm good at greeting lobby bike a lot of people think I don't want to go through discipleship they're just going to indoctrinate me they're just going to teach me their church culture okay I got mimosa bomber Eaton car American monkey in doctrine I desire I can rubric entire time to degree J Omega it will happen along the way but discipleship is not mainly about that Jochen member jgies abandoned element is a people Marita Buchanan's and tangy too and we are not going for becoming church member better Church members we are going for becoming better Christians becoming more like Jesus yeah the Buchannon video run christening will be by a song with a greeting will be bike Tom dinner on twisting will be isolated so for discipleship Jesus is our goal the youth of American uses it to adolescence our Andalusian Geeta discipleship is not primarily an advanced course to help Christians know the Bible better no more eatin consume a tomatis boowa Bertie Caruso and rootin around Kristen do monitor who is among now al-kitab lui bike so again other people think oh it's just I'm just going to be studying the Bible and not the field Oh Janet they're just going to ask me to memorize a lot of purses I don't know who mobilized rocket upon dt a little loopy them on a falcon either kita probably the most proteases I'm already old my memories not a sharp as it used to be aku the longitude serum or accoutrements amudha I don't think a lot of people here with admit they're all yes ed it's a referral to a Lavinia and even if you are a piccolo so Dharamraj on the mind of Christ so the Rafah soda lime juice so the red become Omega P Kiran creases so again more than just knowing and memorizing stuff discipleship is really understanding what Jesus said in the heart sense the demon will be upon you Takata we de piqi Renato kita Inga Inga Del Amo abandom a neophyte as a volunteer tsumugu fear Magneto ah kita akan Blazer bagaimana uppington Makka pakka Molly fear Monica telematic eater again our goal is still Jesus cumberly to g1 kita Attila Jesus discipleship is not primarily an accountability group to help Christians stay out of sin no more eatin consumed at Amata's boo Columbo Burton Giovanna Lauren christen pickup no can do sir so a lot of people think I'm going to have a leader and he's just going to watch my every move waiting for me to stumble oh I didn't remember picking reducing American karate and upon my opinion I can non-executive on site a new goose uh my second introducer so it's like having your own personal Pharisee don't do this do this don't do this yeah super tip when you're on far easier pre-birth Yong Yong nee need an 11 inning and we don't want to become like that Givaudan wants perdido then again we want to stay out of sin but at the same time our goal really is to just help each other grow more yeah monkey that you go to EE producer Morgan doses apiece - Joanne Kittel and ooga booga sama-sama Lobby loggy discipleship is not primarily about spirit or guidance from returns ego becomes Matamata man I don't - mom bro honey so again they some people think it's just going to be a counseling time and you know you think there's nothing wrong with me why do I need a counselor the idea though Robert because for the necessity consoling the masala can a pop or is he controlling again it may happen along the way during discipleship but that's not the main thing yeah if you Mugen visitor JD's Wakamatsu process poem written concerning the tepee Buchan eat - young true tom morello gnomeregan so what really is discipleship JD apakah former attorney - again a lot of people don't want it because they don't really have a clear picture of what it is yeah when your auntie dying in Missoula Britannica rapid American burning the last on top upon Brittany - people think it's so complicated in truth it's not complicated it may be difficult but it's really simple yeah I can remember wicked - moon control complicated roomies the reduce of Danny among sadhana well openly - there are complicated Pepito sadhana's an onion again it may be easy oh it may not be easy but it is simple yes it is real big buddha the capacitor handle the dilamuca it was so simple that Jesus Christ Himself taught it to uneducated fishermen through one sentence yeah it's boogie to satanic R&D manager from Carmen Brittany to kepada narayan yang tidak prolific on and I believe we would be able to understand it now just if we are just presented with the right picture there is a potential you can purchase rockin mama hominid ecology family opinion gambhira ninguna so Jesus when he called his first disciples Peter and Andrew he simply said to them follow me and I will make you fishers of men dr. Engelman to proton apoyo san andreas de catechin Summa Brockett Akbar America it could be a CUDA equal to ha code and a American cop Angela man who's here so we will see from here that discipleship is simply a threefold call to follow Jesus the did acidic it's a visible head bone Brittany Tula Pangolin Tigger Pangolin to make you Jesus yeah so first and foremost it is a call to follow him yang pertama American rap Angela no Monique oh dear the second sentence I will make you fishers of men is actually a promise the onion column occurred well took a cadet can command element unintelligible Genji and as we do these two things fellowshipping with other believers who will naturally happen then psychedelic and do a howleen in Makkah but so good to under the sama or on portray a cancer alameda saturday d so discipleship is really simple we can round it down to three fd2 Salonika table is a ring comes from the de tiga f so I think we have to use the English version to say three F yeah look at the English near Ithaca F so can you say it when we first we follow Jesus yeah but a model among Nico Jesus follow follow and then we fish for people fish for people and a yellow man is here and as we do that we fellowship with believers John Sakata Melania get rockin rockin fellowship persecuted enhances amor on casaya so again discipleship is a call to follow jesus and when we say follow he means with every part of our being that is our katha depended on Monica Jesus katha Maggie go to art in yamuna good nap cobra dan kita because we can follow but not really obey car- is a ceremony communicated at mana devious for example faster nor could walk from that corner of the dis corner and i could follow him just doing this yes Antonia McEntire beside original and Rosanna other readings Ito Kasana the inside there if you need to one be some Hmong equity like what Kapaa desire that is not the type of following that Jesus is calling us to do to buchan ceremony good young man Seuk analysis he calls us to follow him really moving forward towards him obeying him tsumugu brittle on me Judy didn't I dear forgive or some other Gandia so we do it with all of our hearts with all of our minds and again with our whole being did he get among you didn't ask in the hottest Napa Kirin on the screen up Cabrera Ankita in the NIV version he includes come follow me vigilant of the manometric in a Vedic Otakon Morita tongue then it could aku so again it's really an invitation to move forward towards his direction the idea ii submersible danghang tomar su ottoman do then we included tun tun Anya so before when we when we still didn't know Jesus Christ used to be going the other direction we used to be following the direction of the world that is abloom Katamon analysis kita pervy Kosovo ARA jung yong-hwa Maya to aramony Buddha dunya but when we encountered Jesus when Jesus Christ encountered us now beside Jesus meant to embody Gita he invited us to look the other way to hunt monkey table Republic Guardian lion he invited us to repent to turn away from our sins the Amagi table top attend but public prosecutor so when we face the other direction there is a particular mother Cara him Republican we now have a decision to make it was the Quran Cunha Caputo's onion Geeta Bassam bill will we stay where we are a part of other demon akiha brother will we continue to face this direction but move towards sin Tokita melihat cara Hanukkah beam under Cara dosa or will we move forward going to him at Okita minutos music Azuga so that is the following that he is asking us to do it took mark suit cat among a cootie young Jesus cat again and when it comes to following Jesus a lot of people say how will I follow him I can't even see him the in fact guitar tambourine good but no remember kitab okay - my good dear Sangha be somebody Jesus that's why it's really important for us to read his word every day you talking about something but you get on Balki top audacity of hurry a lot of people want to be Christians but then they don't want to open the Bible menorah Modi Doren Crescenta Pedro moment Bucca I think we have to look at it differently say Rocky Top normally Hazara provider when we talk about the God's Word we always think about it as just the Bible GW conduct anchormen Allah get academic curricular bank Bhagwat Gita that is the written word it was a lot of fear man inter Tullius but we also know that Jesus Christ was called God's Word f\u00e0bregas you go to Isis you got against a bogey-free Rahman Allah in John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he ought to be returned by the blinds of human fear and oboro-sama solid and firmly to Allah Allah and in verse 14 it says the word became flesh the day as much plastic attack on freedom any to mandara tugging so every time we open the Bible let us remember that it's not just a bunch of words and stories it is actually the voice of Jesus Christ talking to us disagreed on Vitalik a table marquita indeed Buchanan's party to listen in kurtulus it appeared as Croesus yes a gang member beecharmer Agata yes and again we Jesus also sent the holy God also sent the Holy Spirit when Jesus Christ already left us Jesus becoming us who do see us at the Emmanuel can get sugar and the Holy Spirit will continue to allow us to understand the Bible and to hear God's voice as we read it then Rock guru second along Keaton Omaha me I'll get up at the Fairmont one cicada Mamba Sonia another way that we can follow Jesus is through Christians who already went ahead of us at our alignment we could use a large egg interrogator blood around on christening line since ruby dalu virgil and bloom kita so we have a lot of our leaders here that we can look up to and we can imitate then khatam america by napalm in the simian kita bisa leha and vita be satellite on america in 1st Corinthians 11:1 Paul encourages the Corinthians to imitate him as he continues to imitate Jesus Christ himself this Otto Casablancas heart Apollo's monitor Nevada to madacorp in Tucson took the telephony cuckoo Tesla or onion monkey could actua terminada yaku's became an Isaiah do community crisis so again we are called to live differently from the world we are called to we are called to imitate Jesus Christ so that we can inspire others to be like him as well yakitori pendulum Perdido negative angles demony codes amita porneia crystal super heat up some conspiracy or online and again as we follow Jesus as we make decisions different from the world they would call us weird or they would call us like different or trying to be holy yes I'm su globo he to Pony cootie issue souvenir mathematical code Ariana cause there is produce Presutti do a lot of people make fun of Christians for making decisions different from the months they may learn honoring among all or unchristian karma but Caputo's and in repeated in America produced on but we should not be ashamed because we are really called to be different correct a picutre be doubly malacara sooo gooood bangle dupe repeated in a new name so that we could proclaim the glory of God through our lives singer kita bersama packin : Allah hallelujah together because discipleship is not just about following Jesus it's actually helping others and inspiring others to follow him as well Jeremy good Jesus Bugan Bugan Bugan hobbies you comin along or online Madrasi or online Oh duper's Amazon Wingo Jesus so again as we follow Jesus we are also called to fish for people design in code uses category Pangolin junka ottoman gentleman who's here the gospel is not just for us to keep to ourselves until Buchanan's Watanuki the simple to be wicked led we are called to share it to other people that if Angela member connieyc whether online perfect story is Matthew young kids are young some porn I am beaucoup circulatory Matthews he was actually a tax

behold many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and His disciples at the blue moon Jesus Muhammad Alabama took Edinburgh Assad and mackan bersama Sam Reagan dear Dan Whitmer

Kentucky a laplacian and bootcamp a sunburn can a good a tango can do monkey around arm leg and around reducer so Jesus was still saying that over rituals I prefer really to reach out to these people the new cinema knock on door Lapidus glory to Allah gamma salabim Emilio dobra Muhammad Ragini and as Jesus representatives now we are called to do that as well and spoke a wakil represent Asturias Kita's you go deep angelo canal in hama a lot of people think I'm not cut out to do that I am not exactly perfect then all wrong hakuna thoughts of the Milani talking to be some Lagunitas again the goal of this is not perfection but going on the right direction or the other unbreakable bloom to bloom sampoorna cumberly to join abou kanga Tom that is important and be some locals a Paquita Mizoram

Sabourin but they're hiding something the americanum when you Kansas I'm kidding so honestly it's not about perfection it's going towards direct direction yeah in evoke endodontist born and toppika

disciples of all nations we can't do it on our own it'll be summer koukin forgive Doritos column when some would experience it's something that the body of Christ is called to do in here the last two girls Pangolin that is ludicrous again we are called to fellowship with each other to build up each other and to use our gifts really to proclaim Jesus as Lord Denton pandoba suku to Cumbrian Salomon bangin on what Gundam manga caronia caronian to memoria Kinesis in the book of Acts they were talking about the new Christians the kisarazu drove it around a more important borough and it says there

nicotine disappearance attitudes to be jerky tehilim Trang samus Padilla added alum Trang makuhita Brule press Coutinho orange vanilla and endurance and Aigner to menu chicken kita daripada segala deucey so again discipleship is very simple it's really just about relationships the infirmary tendu super Hanna Kara Palmer eaten a Latin tongue whoo boom umbrella see it's developing our relationship with God in Eden Bangu du Bangu that egg onto hon with the lost people began or re-entry lung and with other believers and yoga then sama around Garcia and we all love relationships then it does Masuka mumble new woman so it is something that we can naturally do as we follow Jesus then it's also sort things our alumni can get Allah who can start becoming a good uses but before we go on to how to do discipleship that we salute our love be landed lucky boobies are a number game animal organ boomer Eden I think it's important to discuss really the heart of it second thing to get on with a rockin up angry interior really me because the last thing we would want to do is to tell our people to do this topic are millions ranked en la Cucaracha tamata camba real economy without them understanding the heart behind it Tampa America mama ha me a party bollocks morning Allison development Juanita and more than just information what we would want to impart that them really is the heart of Jesus Christ then repeated by the mob Regan for my manager Gaeta in Mumbai beacon happiest economy because at the end of the day that is what is going to change people come upon I hear it too la Monte young can be some lubricant or on so again before going through the process and strategy of how to do discipleship let's go through some basic foundational principles first that is longer Dhamma sukha methods a strategy became Moroccan Britain market a Masada Holloman deciliter BW let us remember that every person is valuable to God mark tying up was step or on YouTube Baraka lucky to

Laura sonnet and apartment attend or online too small or orinda can see Allah and the only way they will find out about that as if we share it to them then became a nikita target Allah to Solomon began in delivered America it's written in John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life you want to get numberless got a boo-boo sarcastic Allah convenience in getting American analyzing Google Singapore and protect Panetta governor shumlin controlling key to panic a call in Matthew 9:36 Jesus also saw the crowds and he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd if you matthew similarity bounnam the news media or on magnitude and tallahassee noblesse casseon caramel gospel a lot and want our support ESO Superdome Battenberg Ramallah so you see the heart of God is really for the loss there is Susumu happy Allah a deliberate American turkey lung and you know he is their father and you know whatever is important to you is also important to him the undeveloped are buying into punting Baxter - panting buggy dear so my prayer is that the same thing what is important to him we will also value then do a guitar applying it - panting buggy dear Kitty girls our guy next principle every Church campus ministry and small group can girl princip's on generosity of grittier Planum compost and rock until it was ammonia visa Britain boo so it's not a question of if it's a question of when it will grow is the question it's not a question of if it will grow it's a question of when it was your time Buchan apakah invisible to boot a big companies of redundant it is God that decides when it will grow Allah Allah I'm going to connect upon it to be sober to move in first Corinthians three six to eight it says I planted Paul planted Apollo's watered but God gave the growth this article instigated igano-kun Onam applause Munira may Allah he Moon River tumbler so neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything but only God who gets the growth greatly important become a manometer ammonium like an Allah hang one Reaper to ruin so again we are called to be faithful we are called to share the gospel but at the end of the day its Eldad that will turn the hearts of his people Gaddafi bungalow disappear because America needed 201 brake important one DiMaggio a - so a lot of us before we shared the gospel and we got rejected times room Tom Bergen Indian Mookie DeVito lock and you feel like you failed Jesus don't support incidence Romano jaywalking users at the end of the day it is not us who will convert people but I am who can keep and be somewhat Roberto but the important thing is that we obeyed his call to share the gospel younger panting Adela feet apart akan bangle indeed Okutama buggies and indeed and at the end of the day once you share the gospel you have already put a smile on the face of God then but I heard a threat all over South America in deal remember - Hansen and one person you and that seed that you plant that will be in the heart of that person then Permian so there a taboo it work at autonomy happy or on you do so some people will accept the gospel right away when you share it with them I do run along some visit Rhema in Dulce domum Bakugan some will accept two weeks after the braava Mugen baruman eliminate Roman gluggy some will accept two years after welcoming to a council Anya but again the important thing is that you planted a seed the funding budget allocator Sulaiman Abu Bini and we know that the Word of God will not return to him for it gentlemen Allah including blue to accompany didn't see us here so our our groups our church it can actually grow three ways then greater guitar Columbo guitar can visible to began to get ara it can grow larger Ito convertible Opie bizarre it can also grow stronger with our tubular Pequot and more influential October to mullah people Naru and all of those things is not for our pride the need to smoke Naboo Conoco sambar Ankita it's not to say that were the biggest Church here in Indonesia or in Manila under katakana agreed abu sa'id initiatory manila god brings all of those people so that we can work together to advance his kingdom to hunt ba Oregon's most biodiverse Mohammed and number two ostrich Anya every Minister should prepare others to minister so TF lion harus membership on or online giganto lyonie so again we are not really introducing something new when we talk about discipleship yeah bang committee remember consortium Barossa came in bergen dango Buridan we are just actually going back to the original structure that Jesus bottles to his disciples 'get an American cavada m\u00e9todo originally imbue Jesus Republican so when we talk about ministers we are talking about our pastors our leaders our full-time staff alligator Peter Minister fly an Akita Bottari so al Gonzales Eden but a pastor but a staff full-time they are not called to do the ministry alone market ID bangle dragon Brian and violence medium what they are actually caused to do is to equip every attendee in the church - Gus maracas bangle American Branka Branka bishop orange a tangled region to do the same things that they are doing to block on Halloween sama in regala koukin because again that is what we are opposed to do it will open up us to an angle kita but it will take our attendees as well to open their hearts and to open their minds and to embrace really the call of Jesus Christ to go and make disciples of all nations upon Luke Andrew Kohut the younger become a painter book on do Steve and Gouda D'Amato do Bassam lakukan for Murugan juga in ephesians 4 11 12 all says and he gave the Apostles the prophets the evangelists the shepherds and teachers to equip the Saints for the work of the men she for building up the body of Christ and for somebody so blessed and hopeless Danielle I'm abrecan by Russell Russell impunity Nabi from Rita from breda Indian Okanagan balligan ballad and Anderson Xavier unto Mandar incopy Oregon kuru swaggy poker champ lion and bogey from bangin on tobu creases so again we are thankful for our pastors because we have events like this where we can really grow more as Christians guitar secured Milligan Bala to balancing our guitar dc- zebra tomb good and Libby medulla Gollum near panicked Asperger and Kristin and would really help us fulfill God's purposes for us then to know Lanka Tonto be someone can appear at a nanometre gita every disciple should make disciples so PF Morris harus Vendetta cameras so all of us are called to raise leaders as well so T does you go deep angles of mumbo get confirmed in Google but before we can raise leaders we have to be disciples ourselves first the double uma baguette convo maybe Nikita sendiri Haris medium or a video loop so again let us not say that I'm not equipped I'm not perfect Kylie Jenner catechin Bisaya did at some porn us I bloomed upon copy let us remember that God does not call the equipped normally would do the bank depending on to number one copy he equips those whom he hath called Dianna problem copy orange and upon Julian so yes you might not see yourself doing it now but as you continue to follow him to surrender to him he will transform you to become that person you're moving to mm lock on it aside so that a monkey could be here so that I can do Bach and D transform a seem to be some law Connie to if we look back in the life of Peter he started out as an edge uneducated fisherman co-locate omelet Cadogan Peru still memorize bogus O'Donnell Islander burgundy vegan but as he spent time with Jesus for three years he turned from a fisherman to a preacher man did you Ruben let me go to systemic atone Ruben whistling there in a lion when darasuram piccata he actually preached the gospel for the first time in 3000 people surrendered their life to Jesus Christ John Deere Bratva hakama kalambaka engine and Cuban comically low condemned figure go Roberto but and that's a wonderful thing because now you preach three thousand sermons and only one person surrenders their life mattalast Koran string Gutenberg Oba Diah bang Digga Rigga rank appearance a torrent of it so just like Peter who has transform that way God can do the same thing in your lives someone's party 201 Pedro's to and you go be someone go back and given so you are called to make disciples no matter what your age is no matter what your work no matter where you are you have to hunt bangers deaf community community rapidly lotta black amorosa Dorado a Papa mr.

how's the night going for you guys so far so good yeah have you have you guys been shoveling uh thankfully no uh everybody here is remote so we haven't been too too worried about it i meant at home oh no i we didn't go anywhere yeah we haven't gone anywhere yeah yeah uh i shoveled a little but we had neighbor uh college students who need money desperately that are strong so let them take care of it i was very happy to i um my wife and i have gotten into um like the rings on the apple watch and the fitness plus program and um i got to do basically an hour and a half of shoveling as functional strength training so i killed all my rings today fantastic moment of pride um are we waiting for any more panelists or is this the bunch of us i just saw that andrew i think is is having trouble finding the link he might need it reset for from the joint no problem um sorry ashlyn that i didn't see your message until right now oh i'm good um i i worked with lily she sent it to dot com and set a dot org so we got it all worked out okay sorry about that um there it is oh dear so all right so we actually have 13 people that have registered um so but sometimes people don't show up you know everything last minute is is tough um yeah we also have you know as i mentioned before we have a big audience on on youtube so you know when we kick off we can um mostly talk to them um i just want to get um that panelist link um i mean that uh i'll resend it to what would andrew he made andrew yeah okay send great considering it's a snow day we can hang out a little bit longer see if other people are going to show up and then we can kick off that sounds good it's all right maybe maybe waiting is a little bit silly because people can always jump in it's not a big deal yeah um all righty um so good evening everyone thanks for joining um i'm dr kaplan and i'm the host for this evening's discussion um welcome to dispensary highlights with revolutionary clinics um it's a mix of an open forum q a session and a chance for this fine selection of red clinic's employees to tell us about themselves and the company um it's also a chance to learn not just about the dispensary but also um about the benefits of cannabis and and and um sharing the kinds of perspectives and work that goes into the behind the scenes of a successful medical dispensary um and of course any other cannabis topics that that people want to raise um we'll kick off um an introduction to rev clinics um but for those who are with us live please feel free to ask questions either in the q a section or the chats um and we have some questions coming in through twitter and facebook and we'll see where that takes us for the brief time we have tonight um it's all being recorded so that people would like to get to know rev clinics can still watch tonight's discussion later on youtube um that link for anybody who doesn't have it already is is just bitly bit dot l y slash seed youtube um and the ced is capitalized that youtube isn't all right um any of you guys in particular want to kick us off i'm happy to do it i was just about to nominate you so hi everybody i'm barbara van hoosen i'm the senior wellness consultant at revolutionary clinics what i basically do is i help patients with consultations when they have any questions about our products about methods of consumption about the program in general uh navigating our menu we you know we do everything so most most of the time patients will send an email to our virtual consultation at revclinics.org and we set up an appointment but i do have amazing support and that joe casper is also on this consultation team and he is amazing so i'm gonna pass it on to joe thank you so much barb uh yeah i'm a new addition to the uh virtual consultation team as well as the overall uh remote team which is i think one of we're one of the only dispensaries that have uh this type of support right now to be able to offer to patients obviously we would all prefer to have these kinds of conversations face to face and be able to have these you know pleasant interactions where we're able to talk about the various things that people are looking for uh to help themselves uh medically but right now obviously that's just not feasible with covid so in terms of adapting to wild circumstances i'm super happy to be a part of this team and be able to offer that experience to patients virtually and give them the assistance they need because right now i think especially with all the new medical patients that have been coming into the program within the last few months you know for various reasons they're all brand new to this and they really need that kind of assistance to help them navigate the menu like barb said and really find the products that are best suited to them since it's just so subjective [Music] but uh speaking of adapting to crazy circumstances our delivery team has expanded exponentially over the last few months and one of the newest additions to the team i'll pass it off to ashland ashland right yes so my name is ashlyn rizl i'm the general manager for delivery services at rev clinics um i've been with the company now for a few months um but really excited to come on explain a little bit about how our delivery services work obviously um it's a great option for anytime you don't want to leave the house to get your medicine but also in this time of covid um and also preparing for snowstorms we are always around um we do offer deliveries seven days a week um and you can actually get delivery same day uh in some cases you can get delivery in 60 minutes um if you live in some of our zones we are starting to do 60 minute on-demand delivery so we're excited to provide one of the most robust um area coverage deliveries uh and same day with the lowest minimums in in massachusetts right now for our patients um so actually you know i'm curious joe you brought up these um these new patients that are coming in and that made me think of the beginning of covid and we all got this massive onslaught of patients who you know who were using medically although they hadn't registered for card they were sort of passing through the recreational line um i'm wondering if if you guys had reactions to that if you saw those patients and what sort of reactions they had these patients who had been consuming on the rec side what the reactions were now that they had medical cards yeah uh so i i've noticed some some pretty pretty stellar uh you know uh responses from uh patients and i mean staff alike i think we're all kind of you know uh excited to see this whole kind of this wave of new patients who are coming into the program whether it's because they you know during the initial part of the pandemic where the recreational dispensaries were shutting down they they needed a newer course to get you know their their medicine or or whether you know whatever it was um i think we're now seeing more and more people even just like learning about the medical program and realizing that it benefits them i think the more people who are you know getting involved even on an adult use level i think what happens is it sparks conversations that happen between friends and family i've i've talked to a number of new patients who you know were saw that you know one of their friends or one of their family members was really benefiting from medical cannabis and they thought well you know i'm dealing with something like chronic pain or or chronic anxiety maybe i should give something like this a try so i think it's really exciting to see more and more people kind of coming onto the medical train because i think we're seeing that people are are really excited for these these kind of different products that they might not have access to at adult use dispensaries um i know barb and i deal with uh uh well we talk to a lot of different patients you know who are dealing with things like like severe pain severe anxiety and sometimes they need products that have high concentrations of cbd or have different you know variations of cannabinoids that you're really you're not going to be able to find on an adult use you know side of things so for us to be able to cater to those types of patients and offer kind of a whole new world of products for them i think it's super exciting awesome awesome um do you have a sense of well what kinds of feedback is typical for you guys to get when people are talking about their experience at rip clinics i think that uh you know so during the shutdown of the recreational dispensaries we really pushed to make sure that patients knew we had the virtual consultation service since our doors were closed and we knew so many people were joining the program as brand new medical patients um what i've heard uh was basically patients were shocked that they could have this one-on-one conversation that you know i would take 45 minutes an hour whatever they needed to really walk them through everything to make them feel comfortable to ask to answer every question they had of course i know my boundaries and limits i always tell them i am not a doctor your cannabis clinician that certified you in the program is a great resource not just for that one day that you get certified so never be afraid to reach out with medical questions but what the patients i was speaking to were so excited about was having that direct line of communication um also having the discounts available having delivery having so many more options for products like joe was describing and i i would say about 80 percent of the people that i spoke to during the really thick of it when all of these new patients were coming in were dealing with anxiety and or insomnia and so you know it was it was a conversation i had over and over again and so many folks were just happy about the perks of you know they were used to standing in line for recreational product and to know that they could place an order for pickup and go during a time they selected um get you know fast-tracked that sort of thing and obviously have their medication during the the shutdown plus no tax you know it really opened their eyes to all of the benefits that they they just didn't consider before so the feedback has been amazing awesome great um you know i i've i've seen sort of red clinics grow up as i've been in the industry and it's it's really been awesome and and and great to see you guys shining as a quick leader um not just in the local area but the whole state um and part of that i i think is because of the way you guys are distributing products that i know that you guys wholesale products other dispensaries um and i've also watched um a lot of dispensaries start to now share products and and that was relatively new in the last couple years um you know although it was allowed you know if dispensaries ran out of product or were short they're they're legally allowed to have a certain limit of products but i've started to see sort of cross-pollination across the industry um so sort of two-part questions um where i guess across the state do you guys um distribute your products so people that might not be able to get to cambridge somerville where else can they find rev products but then also do you guys also carry other dispensaries products um and how does that how does that go how do you pick which products how do you you know how do people know about that stuff well we're actually the number one yeah and we're actually the number one wholesaler in terms of our products are in more dispensaries than any other in the state of massachusetts it's something we're incredibly proud of um in terms of who carries our products everyone from new dispensaries both medical and recreational who don't have their own production facility right it takes about several million dollars and a couple years to bring a facility like that online it certainly took us that long but in terms of uh whose products we're carrying you know we're looking to partner with really established brands both in terms of when we license products you know proven brands like moxie's mints some of the other brands that have really succeeded in other markets have been have been brought and we're really proud to license and then in other cases you know really it's about making sure we're covering the products that customers are asking for right no facility or company can produce everything and understanding where perhaps we had weaknesses once upon a time were backfilling like i know we just are about to roll out i think it's 13 new strain varieties that we're incredibly proud of we've had some staples on our menu star dog i think we're quite well known for uh gg4 uh don't forget bootylicious bootylicious rev clinic's original uh or or that we've had now for quite a while um but now there's like 13 or 12 new uh genetic strains in the pipeline that we're really excited about i was going to follow up with what andrew was saying uh so like i i myself i'm a flower guy so one of my things is you know going to different dispensaries all over the state and being able to try you know different varieties of flour and different strains and different brands and from the friends that i've made in the industry whether it's at different spenceries in on in western mass central mass uh or more closer to boston you know it's really exciting to hear that like and the reason i brought up bootylicious is because you know i have a friend who works at rise and amherst and one of the things that he's told me consistently is any time bootylicious ends up on their shelves it sells out like within a blink of an eye and i think it's just really exciting to know that we have that ability to reach you know patients across the state and adult use you know consumers across the state you know with different strains like bootylicious star dog and hopefully these new strains too and it's also exciting to see us carrying other you know cool brands you know like the heirloom collective and liberty strains you know and really being able to create that variety for patients because i think the patients like me who are primarily flower consumers the thing that we're always craving is variety we're always looking for different strains we're always looking for something that's different or something that's new and i think you know with the new stuff that we just got in all those new strains i'm personally really excited to try most of them i've already purchased quite a few i'm sure the rest of you have as well awesome um how does red clinics navigate um i guess the balance between stability of products that are well liked you know everybody comes they want you know these bootylicious kinds of products um but then an equally strong interest in in new products and sort of seeing what people might like and exploring new opportunities for strains and other kinds of products i think it's nice that you know those of us who talk to patients all day every day really do try to give feedback to you know the higher ups and our production folks and you know just tell them what patients are asking for it's easy to make well i'd say well it's easy but it's also difficult to try to guess what a patient wants or what might be appealing but really listening to what patients are giving us in terms of feedback it has been critical and so we've we've really do strive to listen to that feedback to incorporate it you know we're not perfect but we do our best to really try to meet those demands so i think that it's really great that we have kind of open lines of communication where those of us who are talking to patients all day are able to pass that upward yeah for sure and i know people appreciate that i've heard that feedback about the red clinic's employees that you know people are very friendly and engaging and open to listen and patient right growing a plant at scale and producing it consistently has unique challenges right this is not like a can of beans that we can just keep making again and again uh plants grow like on a i think it's a three to six month cycle right so let's say we have an enormous harvest 500 pounds let's say of one particular strain variety if we're doing it right we have several hundred pounds of multiple strain varieties that are dropping right i mean if we're doing it's it's one thing to be able to produce as you were saying dr kaplan the same thing over and over and over again but that doesn't actually address what joe and barb were talking about which is we need to also simultaneously have variety of products balancing those two ideas while remaining profitable while keeping the certain sort of you could say the hits on the shelf every day while you have sort of a rotating selection of other varieties that's a really big challenge that's a really big like supply chain challenge too um and then there's turning it into other products so so for what we are keeping on the menu consistently there's a couple of things that we're really proud of that we've managed to scale one of those is the cannabinoid cbn which is really known for sleep right i mean at the pro that we can't we still can't keep this product on the shelf consistently it's so popular but you sell someone an amazing fantastic night's sleep and then that product will just continue to sell out right like you give people an alternative from many medications i know my mother for example like was using i think it was either ambient or melatonin um but now she uses cbn to sleep cbn and cbd to sleep consistently through the evening right she she's an anxious sleeper she often wakes up she's got three kids everyone can benefit from a good night's sleep so we've actually converted parts of our production kitchen into just like a cbn production area right we're taking thc oil we're putting it on these lazy susans with this heated stir arm and they'll cook there for two weeks right we could take that thc oil today and sell it today or we could take two weeks and actually turn it into a product that has really high demand but but is also niche in a way so cbn and then cbd right is the other thing we're really proud of scaling up people always want cbd frankly there's never enough cbd products to satisfy i think the medical cannabis market because a lot of us are afraid i know i am of like the cbd you see in gas stations like i don't touch that stuff like i don't know where it came from i don't know how many times it's been white labeled or bought and resold and resold again and marked up so i'm very i prefer i only use um like certified like medical grade cbd and there's a really it's that growing cbd comes with its own set of challenges that are unique from growing thc um so there's a lot of challenges in the in the idea of what you've put out for us no no doubt i think i think really you know if if um the history of this country is any indication um back in i guess it's 1931 to 1934 when alcohol became legal um it was all about the bars and people getting tanked you know just like today in the wreck market is really all about thc sort of density um and over time you know different spirits evolved and i think over time also you know cannabis varietals will evolve and we're not going to see a really thc or cbd kind of you know unique market we're going to see a whole spectrum of major and minor cannabinoids i think flavonoids are going to start hitting the market and people will really be surprised i mean terpenes people know about um and there's some medical value there but really the big leap beyond terpenes is going to be flavonoids and um that market still being born i mean it's really you know it's a challenge for the growers and it's more a challenge for the sciences the scientists to convey the message but the whole industry has to mature um can can people request specific items or or products either from you know rev clinic's kitchen or other dispensaries we can't actually hold product for people but what we can do is if let's say we are out of our sleep tincture uh something that andrew talked about with the cbn in it very popular if we're out of that what we can do is we can add the patient to our we call it a callback list but we usually will call or email them at whatever their preferences and let them know as soon as it's back in stock and so we can do that for folks and if it's something we don't sell but patients have requests we definitely do take suggestions and recommendations and try to you know again pass that on but we don't actually like hold product for folks we just try to keep them aware of when we have something that we may have been out of and you know just really try to educate them on navigating our menu since it is directly tied to our inventory they can look and see if they see it on the menu it's in stock at that location so just trying to educate them on how to check and if it is something that you know they're worried about being able to get their hands on we let them know as soon as we can that it's back in awesome um what do customers do if they have questions you know if they're looking at the menu and they want to figure out i guess more depth about it what are their options right now they call us and joe that's where that's where barb and i really come in honestly uh especially like with the remote team right now if you call one of our stores more likely than not one of the remote team members will be actually answering your call somebody who's you know safe at home you know with the computer in front of them able to look up anything you know really kind of navigate our different systems to really kind of give you the best you know customer service experience you can get from like a medical dispensary which is really exciting because right now like i said before you know it's really sad it's it's kind of you know it's a bummer that we can't be there for the patients physically and be off be able to offer our recommendations and answer their questions but i am really glad that we've at least created this uh this you know virtual consultation team and the remote team to kind of you know address that uh especially now i think one of the major things that we're you know we're getting all the time you know like we said before is new patients who are brand new to medical cannabis and they need a place to start and sometimes you know we real we recognize that the best product for them you know like the sleep tincture it might not be available so right now something that barb and i do consistently that i i really love that we we have this you know kind of this this system set in place we like to give them kind of a utility belt of different information and different you know things to look for because we recognize that every dispensary is a little bit different every everywhere you go there's going to be a different range of products there's going to be different brands and it can be a little overwhelming if you're looking for something specific so we oftentimes try to break things down you know as much as possible for patients to really understand what it is they're looking for so that maybe if the mxr sleep tincture is missing they at least know oh do you have any other products that have cbn or you have other products that are good for sedation and by you know really kind of navigating the conversation in that way i think it's it's one it's educating our patient base so that they're better informed and and also it also i think invigorates the industry because if there are more patients out there asking for these products like high concentrations of cbd high concentrations of cbn i i would hope that it would actually invigorate the industry into providing more of those types of products and really getting them out there to the patients that need them because i think if these companies look around and see that there is a huge untapped market for these types of products they'll really get on board with creating more and more products and i'm all for you know seeing more products out there that are available to help patients agree yeah no i completely agree um what happens i mean does the remote sort of consultation work post purchase too if patients have questions about things they've purchased or concerns about them are you guys open to that too absolutely yeah our phone lines you know we we i think our phone lines turn on kind of early before we open um and then they close shortly after our um online ordering system shuts down so you know as joe mentioned we do sort of miss seeing our any you know our kind of beloved uh you know patients who've come back again and again plus meeting new faces as well but you know just to keep everyone safe having the virtual ability has been great so folks can call that phone line they can actually speak to someone on demand um lots of the phone calls that come in are basic questions like you know are you wreck or you know what are your hours right but every now and then you'll have a patient who just has a couple of questions we can handle that if it's really detailed where they want a consultation they can either have an on-demand consultation with joe or um if he's not available they can and i and i might be available then they can make an on-demand uh consultation with me or i just call them back or set up a time and we have a nice thorough conversation and that is again it could be post purchase it can be before they go in at any point you know i've i've done consultations with patients that i remember you know seeing for the past two years at rev but something new has come up in their lives that they really don't know how to handle or um you know they're just kind of thinking about varying things a little bit with their product consumption and maybe they're you know dipping their toe into something new maybe they've never tried edibles before and so they really don't even know where to start so absolutely at any point in their experience we have folks who are dedicated to the phone lines we have an email box which is just info revclinics.org like i said our joe and i are available through virtual consultation at revclinics.org but certainly on the phone you can get information from amazing uh knowledgeable patient advocates as well yeah you don't wanna if you don't wanna speak to someone on the phone there's also an online chat right you can go to the website and you can get um zoomed right in basically to the same group of people right but we're serving both people who prefer to speak on the phone we're also serving people who prefer to email we're serving people who prefer to have the instant chat um excuse me just to interrupt you andrew if you do decide to speak to the the chat box i will let you know you still are speaking to myself or one of the remote team members we're just you know we're hidden behind the the shroud of technology so that you don't have to worry about that awkward human interaction it's all it's all digitized that's funny so you know speaking of of these interactions i'd love to get a sense of not just the usual like you're certainly not the ones which are um you know are you wreck are you open um but what are some of the more interesting conversations you've had with with patients or maybe some some great distances i guess that you've helped patients climb you know i mean i know we have a lot of cannabis curious and sort of cannabis anxious patients um i wonder if you could share some stories um that have been memorable for you yeah i was gonna say i got one i know you do too because i can tell by your smile um i have i'll give a really quick one but it's it really did kind of touch me and make me happy so when i was um in the dispensary one day answering the phone there i spoke to a woman who she was older she was very anti-medication um you know i don't take any medications i've always been healthy and you know she doesn't put anything in her body but she has really bad arthritis pain and you know different things that were bothering her so she did get her medical card she really wanted topicals because she didn't want anything that really you know made her feel high that she felt like she was consuming medication so we talked for a very long time about topicals and you know one of the things that we do is and i think joe's already kind of touched on this we i don't just educate patients on what we have to sell them i will happily explain products to them knowing we don't have that and say you know you might be able to find this elsewhere or i know you can find this elsewhere that's something we don't carry right now or you know whatever um so i don't want people to think that i'm trying to sell them our product i want them to be educated so that they can be in charge of their well their wellness first and foremost um so anyway long story short she was very much i don't want to put anything in my body i don't want to be high so we talked about her using some topicals i gave her my direct phone line uh my cell phone number and you know she called me back the next day asked a few more questions she called me back a week later asked a few questions and then two months later she called me and said now tell me maybe i will try something that might make me feel a little high and so she was open to trying some things now because she was starting to come around to how much relief she got from this topical that i'm not sure she fully believed in you know it really doing a great job with giving her pain relief and then she just started to open her mind a little so it was really kind of sweet and funny to me that she did such a 180 uh in about two months so that was fun i will say that is my favorite is when you have somebody who's like i don't want a single drop of thc in this i don't want to be high i don't want to feel anything psychoactive if i see any slight variation of the colors in front of me i will be calling your manager like you know there are people like that and that's totally fair but you know it is always great when they end up coming around and say you know what you've broken down my my barriers give me a five milligram gummy i'll give it a try and then you know it really does open up a whole world of uh you know new products to try and new experiences to try but um i actually i have an anecdote a very recent uh conversation with a patient this is actually a two-parter so in response to your previous question about you know kind of like follow-up consultations or post-purchase consultations this one i think is a really fun example i got a call from a patient i think they just they called online i don't even think they reached out to the virtual consultation email so they were really just like looking for anybody to talk to to to get this process started as a matter of fact actually i don't even think they had acquired their medical card at this point so they just called basically looking for somebody to talk to and looking for some answers i think one of their friends had their medical card and they were talking about different variations of of cbd and thc being really good at helping relieve their stress and relieving their pain and helping them get a good night's sleep this of course sounds really appealing to anybody but this particular patient was really fascinated and wanted to know if this was possible and she was really particularly interested to know if if it was possible to have something that would help her you know deal with pain deal with stress during the daytime i think she was also taking some kind of other medication that was that was really causing the anxiety so this was really something [ __ ] that was that was causing her a lot of stress and a lot of a lot of frustration she wanted to know if there was a product out there that had you know little to no thc but that would help her medicate throughout the day which of course we do carry which is you know we have the harmonized tincture which is a four to one cbd to thc ratio we also have like two to one uh gummies the cucumber watermelon so these products exist so all sometimes you really need is to be able to tell the patient like there are these products available for you and she ended up trying these products and emailed me back like she i think she actually i don't know which doctor she went to i apologize if i didn't send her to you dr kaplan uh but she ended up getting her certification got the temporary id so that she could you know use the two-week temporary registration for these purchases she was able to purchase some some gummies and some and some tincture emailed me about a week later saying hey the tincture worked so well i had the first great night of sleep and and probably weeks the only problem is now i have a bit of a stiff neck do you know if you can recommend a cream or a topical for me and that when i saw that in the email it just it made me laugh because i was like astounded that this person who had you know been kind of a skeptic at first you know enjoyed this product so much that now they needed a different product for an entirely different problem that you know was just a a an accidental side effect of of having too good a night of sleep it's funny and your response of course was well why yes i do have a topic of course we have a topical for that it's fun you should ask yeah absolutely so one of the things that that often comes up in in consultations you know in in medical visits is an explanation of what all this stuff is about why are there so many choices what does it mean why does one person pick another and you know the the patients who are watching um know my spiel and sort of know my explanations but i don't often ask the dispensaries sort of what they're describing and sometimes i hear discrepancies um and the interest for this question is actually not to sort of find discrepancies but i'm genuinely curious um you know what's your what's your observation about the people i guess who may purchase some of the different varieties of products on the menu for example like flour is different from wax concentrate or hash concentrate or keef um for your from your perspective what draws people to some of these different um methods of consumption i i think i i pretty much start my conversations with people where i'm asking them a couple of questions what are your goals with using cannabis and what are your boundaries is there anything you want to stay away from you know some people don't want to smoke some people don't want to vape some do not want an edible so i try to find where's their comfort zone and also what are their what's their goal what are they hoping to achieve with cannabis and then i i try to give them just kind of a basic foundation and um you know i tell folks listen stop me if you already know this if it's too much information i can move you know fast forward a little but i try to explain the difference between you know inhalation in terms of onset and duration uh versus the kind of other end of the spectrum for onset and duration and edible that you have to digest and then where tinctures fall so i try to explain to them in terms of how quickly you'll feel the effects potentially how long that effect might last what could affect those things you know how many inhalations you're taking how big of a draw or inhalation you're taking etc if you have food with that edible if you snack after the edible you know just different things that patients have reported over the years that i've been with rev and in my own experience personally so i try to give them a foundation and you know joe mentioned the utility belt i want them to really walk away from the conversation with me with having an idea of a few options i always stress to patients you know everyone's different and how you process thc is going to be different from the next person and it does not matter how big or small you are so you know your experience is going to be very different trial and error take some notes it doesn't have to be a long journal entry but note how much you took what time um you know maybe if you ate if it's an edible that sort of thing so that you can look at patterns and really try to find that sweet spot that works best for your body and staying nice and comfortable and starting very low and slow and you know not jumping ahead big big leaps and bounds so i really try to make sure people are are educated to know how they can be in control of really trying out some things you know folks will say what are these concentrates on your menu and if it's somebody brand new to cannabis who's already you know kind of telling me they really don't want to be high they don't mind feeling a little bit of the effects of thc i'm like well maybe concentrates aren't a conversation for right now they're not really step one or two but we can always you know i explain to them what those are and and most you know what most patients use them for and how they consume them um but yeah that's sort of the way i approach things i'm not sure how you know other folks feel about tackling that question but yeah go ahead andrew go ahead i just remember uh there was a customer uh before i actually when i was working at a different marijuana clinic dr kaplan you actually came in and did a talk for us and you were talking about the different kinds of uh patients like folks who are medical consumers who are basically trying to solve a problem in their life right they want the same experience every single time that's one block of customers the other group of customers we might call these people more traditionally adult use i think was your framing um but they're the folks like like joe was describing who wants something new and different every single time right so different form factors like flour like barb was saying are much more like step one and two right so you have lower dosages of thc that your body is absorbing now because you're absorbing less the same deal with alcohol right like any drug the lower the dose you ex you absorb the less you feel what we call psychoactive effects the fancy word for stony like getting high effects um so concentrate i knew people who came in every day and they needed cbd shatter right like they had such a high tolerance to thc that the whole point of concentrated mary is that you are concentrating a large quantity of flour into a very very very small form factor of uh processed product so by taking a dab which is right just a term for a very very small what we sometimes describe as half a grain of rice's amount like that's what a dab should be when you're first starting out the point is that that dab is probably the equivalent of several grams of flour potentially all in one shot so if you imagine let's say a mouse and an elephant and they both need to take medicine right you might use a different size pill for the mouse than you would for the elephant and that really is like the difference between flower marijuana and concentrate marijuana how big a dose all in one shot all at once do you need to give that customer and to barb's point you want to generally ramp up very slowly because you can start with concentrates but if you do that it's going to skew your tolerance very very quickly and then the other important thing to remember is that tolerance tolerance does not translate across form factors that's what barr was alluding to earlier with just because you've been smoking flour for 30 years suddenly you eat an edible like it is a very different bodily system right we're talking about our lungs with inhalation and flower that are doing the absorbing like thc is moving through our like alveoli like facts in our lungs to hit our bloodstream versus your stomach which is breaking down an edible by using stomach acid to like break down thc so that it can bond to a fat and then your stomach lining can absorb it those are very different bodily systems and so you have a different reaction to absorbing via those different methods there are a couple people actually in tonight's audience that saw our talk i think it was last night even it might have been the night before where we did a talk about actually about tolerance and and i was teaching folks about um there are at least 14 different ways that people can manage tolerance um and and then tea breaks everybody knows about but they're they're 13 others um yeah so it's a topic fun is one of those right like uh ingesting high doses of cbd as a way to lower a thc tolerance that was one of the first things i learned uh in a dispensary yeah varying dosage varying strain just like you mentioned or two of a bunch um you know it seems it seems impressive and wonderful that you guys are also knowledgeable um i haven't seen that at all dispensaries and i know that's um something that's important to rev clinics is to have the staff that's sort of supremely educated um but i'm curious about the process of teaching and support that's available for you guys um you know what does red clinics look for basically in in helping all of its staff seem so so knowledgeable and at the cutting edge sure before andrew jumps into this because he is definitely the one that takes the lead of this process um when you join rev i as i mentioned i joined in september um i have no cannabis background and very little usage of the product myself prior to joining um i will say though i feel fully confident now talking to patients and and helping them um not on the scale that barb and joe would do but comfortable talking about the different products and what they do um but i i will say the training program that andrew can talk about for a second it it's very fast and very um well done to be able to learn about something that you may not know anything about coming on board yeah so my role at uh revolutionary clinics is training and professional development manager i like to the elevator pitches i make people and systems better is my goal and so that starts with orientation and education so we have a really fantastic 30 page like very beautiful pictures like very one concept two concepts maximum per page and i like to describe this funnel right that when people start with this um sort of and whether you're an entry level new hire or you're the chief financial officer of our organization no matter what your cannabis background is or experience level you start with this 30 page beautiful booklet and then the booklet basically starts sort of like a funnel right if you think about the wide part of a funnel where the most infer the most people will probably start with flower where people mostly think that they know something right we start with sativa indica and hybrid and those sort of words that we say over and over and over again in our industry but breaking down what do they actually mean like there's a smaller group of people who actually understand that sativa and indica mean very different things to a marketing person in the cannabis industry than they do to a grower in the cannabis industry right like a grower or a production person will tell you any tall thin cannabis plant that's ativa any short squat plant we can get into geography because there's also historical like geography that goes into these genetical lineages of plants but right mark to market most marketing people like the what has happened over the last couple years the last decade or so is that we've learned that it's sativa anyway so it starts with a lot of education around starting with uh flower what a lot what a lot of people think they know and then digging deeper into edibles concentrates and then specifically what is the cannabis industry standard right like folks in the cannabis industry make edibles in a very particular way because we need to produce tens of thousands of units right like if you're a bespoke um chef who's making one brownie at a time you can use a very different process than we can so so also digging into what are the specifics of industrial cannabis and then what are the further refining that what are the specifics of revolutionary clinics as processes right so we use co2 we don't use butane to produce our concentrates which you could you could dig in a whole hour just on concentrates but that's what that packet does is it starts with a very broad overview and then refines and refines and refines and what we found is that team members figure out what they're interested in and they get a really broad base on everything but that allows team members to specialize and suddenly you have like a person on the floor who's got a really broad base on everything but individual team members are self-educating themselves suddenly we have a master on edibles suddenly we have a master on topicals and rev clinics is really amazing about giving folks the platform to become that subject matter expert and then be elevated for it i've certainly seen that happen for barb and joe but i talked to him i talk too much no it's great i mean it's it's wonderful for me and for everybody else to hear um you know i i i can't help but think about how far rev has come i mean from actually from an early age i sound really old saying this but you know i've gotten to watch rev sort of grow really wonderfully can you give a sneak peek i guess about where things are going from here i mean obviously the industry is changing by leaps and bounds and you know perhaps we have uh national legalization kind of around the corner um but i'm curious if if you guys have um an insight into you know where things might be going with rev in the near future i was going to say ashlynn um you know i think that one of the biggest things that i've seen so i've been with rev just over two years when i started we just had our summerville location and i started with andrew with joe and then you know we opened our uh faucet uh street fresh pond cambridge location and you know just watching us grow into three locations watching our delivery going from one tiny vehicle to uh you know the expansion that's happened the delivery service has been amazing so ashlynn please talk about how we've grown delivery that's been phenomenal yes so um our really goal is to strive to be not only the most robust and convenient and prompt but also the friendliest medical delivery that that we have in in massachusetts it's great it's a very discreet service the vans nothing's marked um we've got great team members that actually do the delivery they're very very friendly and very knowledgeable themselves they are trained um the the people actually doing the delivery to doors are trained as pas um prior to everything um it's great it's the same experience that you get coming to the store and that you can use cash you can use your debit um we have um the loyalty points and recertification and new patient discounts it can be the exact same but what we're finding is not only um especially for certain medical patients who aren't able to get out or have a caregiver that are at their house um during the day obviously that's where we started was was to bring it to people who couldn't come to the dispensaries um as covid has shown us nobody's leaving their house um anyway so we we've definitely been able to ramp up we actually out of somerville and fresh pond now we're running six vans um we can see that quickly growing um we've expanded our delivery areas to add additional times as of tuesday this past week we launched 60 minute delivery which we think will be a game changer um it's out of summerville so it's a lot of uh zip codes right around the summerville store into like uh maine downtown boston um and the neighborhoods of boston in there but we're very excited to be able to you know if you want it you can come onto the website say i want this now and get a delivery within 60 minutes um we're definitely trying to expand but we're proud to offer same-day service you can place an order up until about 5 30 um and get it that day uh barring that we're not already full uh that is starting to happen more and more but we are working to expand our our fleet and everything else so that that's not the case um we want to be able to offer it as long in the day as possible um but it's really exciting to see patients call us so that they're like thank you for making my life easier and bringing this medicine to me we cover as far as salem marblehead north reading up to linfield we are adding zones all the way up to lowell and we are looking at the south shore for potential expansions coming forward but to be able to take ref products to people who either are too far away from dispensaries or can't get there for whatever reason um it's very exciting and we're excited to be able to offer more and more in that field as we grow but i will say just like the stores we are focusing really hard on on covet safety um to keep that going um a lot of patients order delivery because they're high risk and don't feel comfortable coming to the curbside to the stores to pick up um so we make sure that that that's available um and we're expanding um our rev access card is a great product too for patients that it's 99 for the year we're offering the free delivery with that you get a free grammar equivalent for the month um and we've got a number of delivery patients who continue to to use that service to get their deliveries without any kind of fee to it with with the low minimums that we have um so it's very exciting to to continue to come up with ways that we can better serve people outside of just the dispensary walls um and and really looking to to grow that service to to cover as many patients as possible and as quickly as possible and i'll tell you i have a rev access card it it's i'm such a frugal person spending 99 um you know it has to be really worth it for me and that card is so worth it as ashland said 15 you get every month a free gram or 15 the equivalent off of your order and you get free delivery for the entire year so i've had delivery probably three times in the last few months because i work from home now full-time and i have a child who's doing remote learning full-time so it's it is difficult to get out during the day you know i'm busy and to get delivery right to my door every time it happens i just say what a time to be alive it's it's wonderful the staff is amazing um it really it's i'm so proud of the way we've grown delivery and and how well um you know all of our my colleagues you know they're just they're phenomenal people so and delivery is really how we're expanding within the bounds of massachusetts you asked dr kaplan about like what is the future for rev one of the ways that we are looking to the future not just for rev but really for the whole cannabis industry i want to toot joe and barb's horn right is this remote team i'm not sure i i jumped on a little late but this remote team is answering fifteen thousand fielding fifteen thousand calls a month and that number is going up every month so for us creating one eight hundred cannabis creating an information center there are we're thinking about how can we sell a product outside the bounds across state lines right you can't no state in the union nobody can sell cannabis across state lines but you can sell cannabis services across state lines right like imagine if you're opening a dispensary in pennsylvania you're opening a dispensary in michigan new jersey florida anywhere in the union um you need to like what we've seen that's been incredible right is by creating this remote team suddenly hundreds of phone calls that were coming into our retail facility those phone calls are being handled by dedicated phenomenal like extraordinary customer service professionals suddenly you imagine if you did not need to train your team members in a store how to answer uh product questions right you what if you just needed them to be face-to-face customer service right if people are coming into a store you want to give them the best face-to-face customer service imaginable you don't want your customer service providers distracted by a ringing phone constantly right so selling that service building that like multi-state cross-state service of education cannabis as a as a across state line product that's really the future we think for both rev clinics and for the larger cannabis industry just to follow up on that i will also say like especially right now with these extraordinary circumstances i think it's phenomenal considering like how stressed out everybody is right now how frustrated frustrated we all are with the current circumstances you know of 2020 you know i think it's great that you know despite all that if you're if you're having some some struggles whether you're a new patient you don't know where to go to to get these questions answered you're having issues and you need them resolved it is so wonderful that we can provide these you know friendly voices over the phone you know who can really help you i think i i notice you know you know over and over again we'll get you know people calling in and they're stressed they're in a rush they they don't want to take up anybody's time any more than they have to and they start with just one question usually it's like oh how late are you open or oh can i place an online order after you close like it's usually just a very simple question i'll we'll start talking for maybe like a minute or two and i'll just you know simply ask like do you have any other questions is there anything else i can assist you with and that that two minute conversation will turn into you know a 30-minute consultation because now they have somebody that they can actually speak to and they can really ask their questions and this is honestly you know no matter where you go you know whether it's to you know to best buy or to you know a dispensary like i would say you know it's tough to get really good customer service right now because everybody is is pulling their hair out just because of the year we've had and i think now to have this you know service where people can talk to somebody and really get their questions answered and get that really positive customer service that that's unmatched anywhere else you you go so i'm really proud to be able to provide that type of service to patients and really kind of help ease their stresses if they usually start a conversation or call stressed out or frustrated i usually am able to get them laughing by the end of the call so that's usually a good sign to me and how incredible and how incredible to have a business recognize the value in providing that customer service right you know i in addition to i wear several hats at revolutionary clinics i'm also the lead wholesale client trainer and so i get to walk into dispensaries and see how other businesses in massachusetts operate and i will tell you i have heard so many times i have heard these like okay you get to have 15 minutes with the customer if you're a minute over that you lose seven employee points if you hit negative 15 employee points that means you're talking basically it's like we want to provide great customer service because that's what's going to bring people into our store back for our products and sort of differentiate us really because everybody's got great cannabis right massachusetts market is exploding it's really funny i went last year pre-pandemic i went to amsterdam and they had massachusetts and california marijuana like in amsterdam right that this the script has been flipped um from the idea that uh amsterdam has the best stuff um so yeah i'm just really proud of what barbie and joe do every single day it's really incredible to be able to provide that i i think one major thing that's been a big focus for us in the stores um is the lack of being able to be face to face with people and having that family feel you had your store that you would you know you go by the dispensary every week every two weeks every month and you knew your bud tenders you knew your pa as you knew your receptionist it was a family and it was comfortable to go into the dispensaries um we've lost that a little bit now with pre-ordering and curbside pickup however i really do like that when i talk to patients it's amazing on delivery um i i work with the dispatch team regularly so i'm seeing the patient's names come up and you recognize names over and over um people call i i can tell you like who loves you know on everything that you know i'll get a call from somebody and they're like well i was just talking to gabby or i was talking to barbara i was talking to sabrina and it's not well there was this woman that called me it is still that family feel people know that they can call in and place their orders um over the phone not to do it online and and to call um they've got the same drivers and jumpers that are coming out to them so we we've definitely i think done really well to keep that family and that that cultural feel um even though we're all separated right now so that's that's been something that i've really been excited to see um because it helps us too i mean we're stranded during this pandemic too and we're not seeing faces as much as we are so it's been nice to to have that family feel and that comfort level with with so many patients through this awesome um one of the things that's close to to my heart um obviously are sort of medical um perspectives and illnesses and sort of treatment plans um and you know you guys talk about the cbn and i think that's a perfect example of how the industry is very um slowly i think both in the sense that it's approaching slowly but also it's been long enough that this you know my in my perspective should have been part of the industry right from the beginning but um the question i'm getting to is is you know what products do you have i guess besides the cbn which is clearly oriented towards sleep um what products are sold that have a focus on certain medical illnesses as opposed to sort of more general applicability i guess yeah my first thought is the delta eight thc like tincture that i think just rolled out which i think has a variety of uses but i know it's one of the most medically focused products frankly since we broke grant on cbn that we've been really excited to explore right i mean i think what you're getting at dr kaplan is sort of a little bit of what i was talking about earlier right we have a scalability problem right you have a customer base a medically focused customer base who needs the same product he's very intensely interested in the same product every time but they are a much much smaller group than the group of people who wants to buy thc every single day so there's a there's a finance question of where do you put resources so that you can serve the broadest group of people the most consistently um and i'm really frankly proud to sing the praises for our production and logistics teams in our grow like we have seen them 10x production um like mo tenfold grow like month over month like frankly like they break they break records every every every month and we're like incredibly proud of them for that um i remember when we never cracked 17 percent like it was a big deal when we broke 18 19 thc and now really like we're seeing well numbers aren't first of all phd numbers are not the most important thing i'll say but it is indicative of the overall improvement that we've seen in quality of flour and quality of edibles that we're producing like we're now producing fruit shoes that you can um consume without teeth right like you can actually get through them if you have gums like we're starting to put real thought on who are the customers that we're trying to serve how can we include like i think the the most exciting product i know that's in the pipeline because we've had gluten-free we've had vegan products for a very long time but right like the low sugar like mountain the low sugar like challenge with the cannabis industry right is that you've got cookies you've got brownies you've got gummies i mean there are cannabis patients i'm sorry cancer patients out there who need high sugar right like their particular diet needs high fat content high sugar because they're wasting away there's another group of cancer patients who they can't have a drop of sugar right for those people for everyone frankly the whole there's a whole group of people who want edibles and are really relegated to tinctures as their only low sugar option not everybody wants a tincture there's a lot of people who want to like consume like actually consume like i think we're working on this basically fruit leather that has like um that basically is low sugar low fat low everything but is still very flavorful and delicious and that you can get through without needing dentures so again it's like all of these incredible challenges that are about like okay first how do we solve the challenge then how do we scale the challenge and then how do we consistently produce it on a timeline every single time and how do we get all of our supply chain to line up at exactly the same time right there's a lot of problems there um that it requires a mature organization to handle for sure and i'll put it i'll put a special vote because a lot of my patients are taught about dhcv um and there are you know three or four products in massachusetts which have anything close to one percent there's a huge market um you know not just existing market for the appetite suppression but also the whole diabetic market and there's a lot of literature that points to thcv and the trpv4 receptor stimulation that will be i think cultural changing it's really it's it's a breakthrough opportunity um you know it's it's a difficult plant to find um but um you know there are strains around and i would love to see some of that come into massachusetts um you know there's a company out in california that is producing high volumes of thcb and i know that they've licensed in massachusetts but i don't know who or where and it's all kind of under the radar um but perhaps the company name uh the thc producer david olympic um okay uh he owns or runs uh california cannabinoids and the product is doug's baron out of there i think they have vapor pens that are you know upwards of 30 percent thcv wow no kidding um yeah i mean for the whole world uh really like i know contacts in spain and australia that are hungry for that too and you know he's wisely keeping his you know there it's not just his their crops quite well protected um but i but i talked to him actually recently and he's he has licensed it here um but i don't know who we're aware and i'm i'm just waiting i i feel like on that same note like cbg is kind of on that same level of like being a really undervalued cannabinoid i know i i've read some places it can be good for gastrointestinal type issues um that's another you know cannabinoid that i say you know when you're looking on the cannabis market especially massachusetts you might see it in a like a couple percentage points right of of cbg um so i don't know i think it's i think it's cool that it's like you know it's one of those things that are steadily becoming more and more you know recognized and like i said before you know i think as as long as we keep informing our patients that you know these things exist they just need to be produced then i think if there's more of a demand for it then you know somebody will will come along and say there's a market let's let's tap it so i mean i i would hope that there would be you know a future market for those you know really kind of underutilized cannabinoids i i for one am really happy that we are even you know producing like andrew was saying like cbn at scale because i mean i've been working like barb you know with barb and andrew we've been working for the company for over two years and as we've seen you know the company grown internally you know and interacted you know all three of us have you know started front facing you know working with patients either as patient advocates or working reception and so we we have these conversations all the time about you know what patients are looking for what what do they really need and it's it's you know when you look at all the products available in massachusetts and you have these conversations you realize well after having these multitude of conversations where people are looking consistently for products that help with pain products that help with anxiety and products that help with sleep those are the top three i would say you know it really boils down to those high concentrations of cbd and cbn because really like like with our tinctures to harmonize the sleep these are the products that are consistently being asked for you know as somebody who helps patients sign up for our patient call back list you know i see those products listed over and over again because those are really the products that patients are banging the door down for and they they run out within you know weeks of returning to our sales floor so you know it's one of those things where as long as i i think we keep informing patients we keep advocating for patients um and you know get that information out there and they know and they demand for it i would hope that you know like we've scaled up our cbn production in response i would hope that more companies and more more dispensaries even across the country especially as we see federal legalization is is looming on the horizon i prefer one very optimistic you know i would love to see you know more of these types of cannabinoids being appreciated and recognized as mainstream and therefore being you know having more of a market for them yeah i mean i'm i'm personally making that a mission um i have um not to shamelessly self-promote but i will shamelessly self-promote i have a book coming out um that's going to be aimed at the over 60 crowd over 50 60 crowd um and really helping them understand what's what's real what's not real what's available what's not um what the state of the industry is in in jargon free language and and also hippie free language um just sort of to get to their ears um that's the fastest growing it's the fastest growing slice of the cannabis market right is the folks over 60 the folks who are looking for quality of life improvement people who generally can garden more can can be on their knees more can be more flexible like that is what cbd and thc are offering like a whole group of people who who never considered or maybe who were raised with propaganda uh about about uh cannabis um were taught that it had no medicinal value uh when clearly there's mountains uh there's there's been for generations mountains of anecdotal evidence and now um researchers doctors like yourself dr kaplan are like really bringing a lot of us into like the light of the modern age i agree and actually sort of writing on that comment um you know it's important for patients to understand um you know who are subject to that that history of stigma that they understand that this is a very private protected industry in massachusetts i mean as it is everywhere but especially here um what sorts of privacy protections um can customers expect from rip clinics working reception i feel like uh barb and i could absolutely take that um so it starts with um uh right um hipaa training by understanding what information like we are a medical facility we we do have very intense record-keeping policies and procedures um it starts with like i i make this one of the very first things that every team member learns in training orientation is that we never say first and last name right we always say uh hello first name or hello mr or mrs in fact we don't really use last name we use first name and nickname unless a customer is going to say that that's what they prefer but from record-keeping procedures what information now everything is actually digital right we used to have pieces of paper that we had really stringent policies on um if someone had entered their information that paper did not see the light of day right no there was no way for another customer to see that that there's no way for customer a to see customer b's information period stop um but now that everything is digital there's not even paper records to lock up right like we have um actual backup copies but yeah patient information is extremely private and where we do have to still use paper so on the delivery side regulations do require that a manifest go out with each delivery to say what the van is carrying what people are involved in carrying it and who the in just like taking it from our facility our production facility to a dispensary we have to have that record those manifest one we make sure we all that um exactly what the patient um ordered so that it was dispensed correctly through the ccc for their allotment so we're checking that on a regular basis um and then also all of those documents are locked away filed we have to keep them for so long for the ccc but everything is kept away patient names aren't displayed we make sure even in the facilities we're not leaving screens open with patient names on it um it's very important that nothing's left out with patient information on it so it's something that we focus on and have the walk away ability for anything that does need to go that way yeah and the folks who do want to get um a callback or an email or a text when we have product back in stock that they're looking for we always make sure we're using whatever method of communication is something that they have agreed to so can we leave you a message at this phone number yes you know do you want us to email you text you we ask them you know so that we are being very mindful of their privacy um and uh you know not using let's say a phone line that might be open to other people who would be like what you got this call from a a place called revolutionary clinics so we're very mindful of making sure that we are abiding by whatever is their comfort level for contacting them and reaching out to them and not like leaving them a message saying your marijuana is here or you know anything um that might be problematic the van doesn't have puffs of smoke coming out it does not a flashing green light i know your your marijuana is here no the one good thing with delivery um so we are not um legally allowed to nor would we want to um blast the name actually there's no name on the van the only thing that's on the van is the van number that we have internally um so your neighbors it could be an amazon delivery it could be whatever sometimes people are like please don't pull in the driveway or please you know people are worried if their neighbors or their housemates or sometimes parents or whatever are are going to see that the people that still live at home it is very discreet our delivery team are allowed to wear whatever they uh they're allowed to wear their own clothes however they look professional um they're not rolling up to your house like a drug deal is going down um it is very discreet um and and we we make sure that it's a very professional experience and that people um have their privacy even when it's open in the public like that and they also have masks and face shields right ashland i know you talked earlier about safety but that last interaction like when they're at the door with you first of all that we don't go in the building like customers come out to us and um it's really a really really incredible experience so dr kaplan you asked about privacy but i also want to talk about safety right like that's one of my favorite things to talk about in massachusetts is the reliability and safety of cannabis products and there is no state in the union with more stringent testing requirements than massachusetts it's one of the reasons that massachusetts is the model for states burgeoning cannabis markets like pennsylvania and michigan i keep mentioning them but they actually those states have said like you know colorado california those folks are way too liberal for us but you know good old puritanical semi-liberal massachusetts those folks know how to slap a regulation on somebody um and so like i love telling people that listen the only part of this process that we have zero control over is the third party independent testing right we test for heavy metals we test for carcinogens pesticides like that's in contrast to what we i like to jokingly refer to as maine the wild west cannabis state where you have zero testing regulations whatsoever you have no idea if there's like mouthwash or heavy heavy metals in what you're smoking but in massachusetts like there's there are multiple systems set up in place where there is no way for a product to even get to our shelves let alone get to a customer without it first being vetted by a third party independent like state laboratory whose whole job right is to send up a red flag if anything any any um micro trace of something turns up in the the rather large sample that we have to provide so i love talking about the safety and consistency like it's one of the reasons that frankly i don't think i could ever move anymore to a state without some form of legal cannabis program i i'm not going back to a dealer system i'm very happy being able to walk into a brightly well-lit store or order from my phone and get delivery right like i'm not going back from that yeah no agreed awesome this has been a really fantastic discussion tonight i i um i think it might be one of my favorites i mean we've had so much fun and partly it's because you guys are so much fun and there's so many of you um my last question is actually going to be for for each of you and it's and it's it's a challenge um and i really want you guys to come up with three products from that you think stand out and whether it's of your own preference or what you've seen from customers um but to name that product and then why i got it i already i already have it i have mine all right so uh everyone laughs and jokes about how the our infused hazelnut is like my favorite uh edible that we sell it's a hazelnut spread it's infused and when you know it's one of those things where pretty much every patient i would talk to in the dispensary would end up leaving with it not really but um it's so for me it's great because it's very tasty it does not taste like cannabis which i want it to taste yummy and not like a plant it is great because i can low dose or high dose depending on my needs i tend to medicate in the evening for chronic pain issues and for sleep so i can you know kind of take a quarter of a teaspoon a half teaspoon or i can do a tablespoon whatever fits my needs it's easy for me to adjust that dose so i love the infused hazelnut for relaxation for sleep for pain relief and you know a nice little tasty treat so there's my number one my second one would be our quench one to one tincture so that is equal part cbd thc it has these lovely limonene terpenes in it so a nice little daytime uplift and i personally use it to help with migraines so if i feel a migraine coming on i try to take a small amount of the quenched tincture and usually within about 20 minutes i can feel the tension that's building at the base of my skull start to melt away and instead of feeling kind of like i have a migraine hangover where i'm foggy brained i get more clarity because of those sativa terpenes so i don't feel uh the psychoactivity really because the cbd is helping to pull back the psychoactivity from that thc i can stay functional clear-headed focused and without a migraine pain-free which is fantastic for me so my third one i thought i had it now i'm second-guessing myself okay no i do have it so we have a one-to-one vape cartridge that's called clementine one to one i'm a big fan of cbd mixed with thc so i love our clementine one-to-one cartridge it's fantastic for me for anxiety if i do want to have just a small little puff or maybe more it's also very euphoric for me and very happy and blissful the clementine strain itself so i feel very happy i like people um i like i love life and also i'm able to pull back any anxiety that i have with that clementine one-to-one cartridge all right i'm gonna go before since i since i'm the new one and i have my favorite so i i'm actually an edibles person i i cannot smoke i i've tried it multiple ways with my asthma my lungs just do not like it um so all of my experience with it personally and i think it's great because i a lot of older patients that i talk to um are people similar to myself that don't smoke to have good options my number one right now is the four to one harmonize tincture i know we mentioned it earlier i am swearing by this product right now i actually personally have been going through i have an ulcer um so my doctor put me on about nine pills a day to manage this um going through it which i'm still doing that but even the zofran all that nothing helped with the constant nausea feeling and i was not hungry and this has all been in the last few weeks and that harmonize i have been using it's got a um um essential oil blend in it that's called digest then which my great aunt swears by and keeps sending me um to like put on my chest and all of that for heartburn it actually has that mixed in so it's got a peppermint a ginger kind of a tarragon flavor to it um you can put it on your tongue it is oily so i i do put it in tea but it's going to sit on top but that's an easy way to consume it but that has been better than anything that's been prescribed to me for my digestive issues lately and the other good thing is being newer to cannabis i didn't know or i was worried about having a product because this isn't just at night using a product during the day and being able to use that product and still work the four to one cbd um that's been a great thing so i can meditate i'm not going to get high from it i'm not going to have that feeling and i can work and it's just a wonderful product my second favorite um actually is a smokable in a way it's a newer device that rev has licensed and brought to massachusetts and that's the omora device so it is a function we have pre-loaded uh paper flower sticks that actually have the flower already ground and put into these one-time use um flower sticks they just slide straight into the device and it's it's a heat not burn process so you're not really getting smoke plus it is only a three minute time session so it heats up it vibrates it lets you know every minute it counts down it turns off after that it's very low juice but for someone who cannot smoke i wanted to try some nice i needed a quicker quicker than i can do an edible um i needed a quicker response to something so that's been really good and we actually have bootylicious sticks we have meltdown sticks that you can use those flowers because i'm not able to experience those in other ways um the amore has been great and i think it's great that they're expanding the market of ways to consume to allow people who don't normally choose a certain method to experience that method so i've been really impressed with amora for beginners or non-smokers my final product is something that i just think is fun and i haven't seen a lot of other places and that's our stir it up um tincture drinks there there it is a liquid form um we carry a raspberry a watermelon and then a ectoplasma neon green tangerine flavored but you can mix that i've mixed it in soda water ginger ale sprite different things and it's a great alternative to edibles at night and it's something that it it's not too oily so it actually mixes in with your drink and diffuses through it adding raspberry to the sprite is fantastic all the flavors are wonderful but i i really appreciate that if something that i can put a drink and consume an edible a different way um than just chocolate bars and gummies and brownies and cookies so those are my three i gotta say y'all are making this so hard you're taking all my favorites uh that's why i went quick seriously seriously those are some good ones i was also gonna shout out the stir it up i i'm not a drinker at all uh even through college i'm the type of person i would maybe sip on a side or in the corner of a bar i would never really like i never was really much of a fan of alcohol so when we came out with this product a little over a year ago back then it was called slurpee terp uh rest in peace slurpee terp what what a great name uh anyways the stir it up for me was such a great product because it was really it was a cocktail replacement you know something for me i'm you know pre-covet i was a very social person i like to hang out with friends and so for me to be able to have a glass of my hand maybe put a little bit of the watermelon stir it up in there mix it around and get that kind of infused beverage i wasn't i was anybody i wasn't even aware that that was a product available anywhere let alone here in massachusetts and lo and behold we're the ones creating it um so stir it up i'm gonna just second that one because that's a such a great product um my second uh top choice for me so i'm not usually super into cartridges uh and i know there's a lot of you know skeptics out there you know post the the vape band that we experienced in the like the past year um but for me you know i i i am going for a cartridge my favorite cartridges that we produce are the full spectrum cartridges my personal favorite like barb is a one to one it's the orange tied full spectrum cartridge for me like barbs was saying it's a very uplifting strain without you know causing any kind of stress or paranoia and that one-to-one balance is really really fantastic for me in terms of helping me ease my anxiety and help me get my throat get get through my day um and we used to have orange tide as you know a pretty consistent strain of flower i'm hoping and praying that that comes back because for me the orange tide was something i could you know i could take that during the day whether i'm smoking or vaping it and really kind of go through my day clear-headed and still medicated and still being able to focus and get things done um and i just like i'm a huge advocate for the entourage effect so to have that full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes just straight from that flower i will advocate for that that particular type of cartridge for any patient who's looking to get into vaping um but then my final choice and it is a strain of flour and i just want to preface this by saying if anybody out there is looking for something you know festive to do with all this snow if you have a bong at home now is the perfect time to to make a good old-fashioned snow bong literally all you have to do is go outside get a little cup stuff some snow into the neck of that bong get make sure it's clean snow no yellow snow for this but if you smoke through the bong with snow in the neck it will be one of the smoothest smokes you will ever experience just be careful not to take too much but it will be a very very pleasant experience i'm a singer i'm a performer i do improv in the pre-covet days so it's something that i can do on a regular basis whether it's with snow or with ice and i still preserve my lungs for the most part of my vocal cords without feeling vocal fry or or feeling like i'm drying out my my throat too much it's it's an experience i very much recommend but all that aside chocolate oranges is a great strain of flour yes that's right tom watch out for that yellow snow uh really chocolate oranges for me it i i'm i'm pure i'm mostly medicating to help with anxiety and depression those are my two you know main focuses and oftentimes i think with medical cannabis it's kind of like it's a balance you know because some products that are good for depression might exacerbate anxiety and vice versa so chocolate oranges for me is kind of like a nice balance it's it's technically an indica but it's it's a strain that's giggly it's social it's very fun it's not the type of indica that leaves you stuck in the couch or or feeling like you have to take a nap it's very much a type of indica where you can still function maybe enjoy a movie or play some video games depending on what your preferences are but chocolate oranges is for me will always be my my go-to get home from work and de-stress type of strain not to say that working in the cannabis industry is stressful wow i guess i'm up you guys have picked uh almost all the good what now i was gonna say so many more there's so many more i'm ready i'm ready i'm ready for this i know you can think of something so i've got three so the i'm going to also start out with a cartridge i'm a big cartridge user just for the convenience i'm someone who's like we were talking about safety and like testing earlier i'm very comfortable because i know exactly what is in every vaporizer cartridge that comes out of revolutionary clinics we've never used cutters thinners like uh like gel replacements of any kind you know we were actually born right right so the vape gate that joe was alluding to 2019 revolution like massachusetts had its own version of vapegate back in 2017 when i first joined the industry i remember working for patriot care and patriot karen neta had put out the very first cartridges in massachusetts and anyone who was in the market at that time remembers like they were thick as tar and they were black because nobody on massachusetts knew how to make a quality cartridge yet everyone was using thinners they were using peg polyethylene glycol so the the the vape gate crisis of 2019 is just a rehash of like we had to keep anyway so i'm very comfortable and very happy because i know that they're like the very high quality of product that we're producing today at rev clinic so for me the newest cartridge that we're producing is actually called the astaria sleep cartridge so we talked about cbn and how we've been scaling up our production of cbn the astaria line it's a brand new sleep brand that we are launching it's going to be an edible product a tincture product a vaporizer product flower product we're basically trying to create sleep as a brand because we understand that everyone needs sleep and so what's special about astaria is that it's actually a three cannabinoid blend right so it's four parts thc to two parts cbd to one part cdn so the idea is that the cbd is going to reduce inflammation the thc is going to help with relaxation and then the cbn is going to help with uh sleep and so that you are going to fall asleep stay asleep and get really thorough like sleep so i know that our vp of product dan gillan and our vp of marketing tom have been working we're working on that product for months um to sort of perfect this particular ratio this particular blend of cannabinoids um but to me that's sort of taking what we've learned about cbn and taking it to the furthest like elevation and evolution that we have so far so really special medically focused uh concentrate uh cartridge that i think is going to really like awaken a lot of people to the magical powers of cbn so that's product one uh i would say uh product two i gotta say about the tiger gold bar so a lot of folks on this call have been shouting out micro dosing products i wanna talk about macro dosing for just a second for all of those people out there who are not necessarily so new to the cannabis space folks who like me i need 50 to 100 milligrams right we we recommend a starting dose of cannabis as 2.5 to like milligrams really like a baby's teaspoon just to get you started into edibles we'd much rather you feel nothing the first time with an edible than feel too much right it's much easier to convince someone to try just a little bit more let's just dial up let's titrate right that fancy talk for dial up your dosage very slowly to find what's the optimal dose for you for me i know my dose it's 50 milligrams at 50 milligrams i'm i'm spoiled i have access to really high quality consistently dosed edible products it's another reason i would never go back to gray or black market edibles but for me i don't want to eat an entire chocolate bar right every time i want to try an edible and if you're in the adult use market that's what i would basically need to do is i would need to either eat like 50 milligrams would be half a chocolate bar or an entire chocolate bar so our tiger gold bar it's with a peanut butter base with a dark chocolate swirl and a toffee crunch through the bar it is absolutely delicious you cannot taste one trace of cannabis in there but one single piece it's a thousand milligrams and then in one chocolate bar about this big which means one piece is 50 milligrams so for me i can pop one piece you know it's a very specific product for a macro dose customer but that's going to be my number two for products i'm really proud of and it's something that you can only get in a medical dispensary in massachusetts um and then product three i'll do a flower strain i've treated add i've been diagnosed with pension deficit disorder going back to about the age of 10. so i've always been a fast talker a high energy individual and i use medication to manage my symptoms like on a daily basis but i really adore high energy sativas right like indicas like knock me out and i use them for sleep in certain situations but what i'm going to day after day like my daily driver strains are all sativas um and for when i'm trying to relax but also have that sort of like wide-eyed exhilaration that i love um for me that's mr clean that thing is liquid rocket fuel right like i tell people like if you need to sit still for any reason this is not the strain for you if you want your eyeballs to vibrate that's mr clean like you need to clean your apartment you need a workout you need motivation to do something that's mr clean and for a lot of people people think of cannabis as like oh you know stoners like that's what cannabis is they just sit on the couch like a lump they don't do things like i'm a stoner who does things i do things all day long i'm a really active i'm an active cannabis user and i'm very active while i consume cannabis it's a big part of my life and for me having a variety of not just something to put me to sleep i do need that just like the vast majority of customers but i also i love products that get me moving that like energize me to take on the day and for me that's that's mr clean really high energy wow that was just an awesome um review not just of of you guys as sort of individuals and your perspectives but the products and really the company that's sort of behind them making them so i think i'm glad that that worked out to be such a fantastic last um send-off um that should be your closer doctor i guess maybe now it will be um that was i mean that was really remarkable the staff really enjoy the products that the company is producing for sure for sure no agreed um and i just i didn't realize we blew way past the hour mark so that's also a sign of success um well thank you all for for for for speaking and so sort of you know thoroughly and transparently about your your preferences and your thoughts and your your perspectives about the patients um thanks for the folks who joined and send in questions um and i can't wait till the next one i guess we'll we'll hopefully see you all soon very soon i hope this has been incredible have a good good night seasons greetings to everybody have a good night everybody", "qSVJusxL96Y": "ah hard oh oh oh you don't seem like I was making [ __ ] bang oh please [ __ ] I

health world for her research and all of the work she's done to help so many people I'm here with dr. Terry walls who is a clinical professor at the University of Iowa where she conducts clinical trials testing the efficacy of therapeutic lifestyle interventions to treat multiple sclerosis related symptoms in addition she's the author of the walls protocol how I beat progressive MS using paleo principles and functional medicine and the cookbook the walls protocol for life what's even more amazing about her story doctor walls was a patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis which confined her to a tilt recline wheelchair for four years she restored her health using diet and lifestyle that she specifically designed for her own work and she now rides her bike to work each day and has I believe even done travellin she's an incredible shape she is thriving and absolutely beautiful and amazing in person I cannot wait to share her with you today so without further ado let's join dr. Terry walls dr. Terry walls welcome and thanks for being here oh thank you so much for having me well I knew I had to have you back on when I realized you were one of my first guests ever on this podcast episode 25 I think I'll make sure that's linked in the show notes if you guys did not hear it it was an amazing episode and I figured 250 episodes later it was about time to have you back because I know you have been deep in the research learning amazing things for last few years and I just had to bring you back and share you with the audience again so thank you for your time being here today oh thank you so much for having me back and to start even though you covered it in depth in the first episode I would love if you could just walk us through your story because there's a lot of new listeners who aren't familiar with your amazing story so I am a professor of internal medicine and I had a very skeptical view of complementarity of medicine and I taught my young physicians to be skeptical as well you know but God works in mysterious ways I in 2000 began to have problems with stumbling and was evaluated yes part of that I got MRI spinal taps lots of blood tests and they diagnosed multiple sclerosis I wanted to treat my disease very aggressively I sought out the best people in the country took the newest drugs including these new biologic drugs costing tens of thousands of dollars each month but I went relentlessly downhill within three years I'm too weak to set up in a regular chair and I need a tilt recline wheelchair I've had episodes of trigeminal neuralgia which is electrical face pain that had started 20 years earlier and those have been getting steadily worse and by 2007 I was really on the verge of being forced into medical retirement it was clear I was had a trajectory of coming bedridden demented quite possibly horrific levels of pain that were not going to be controlled but fortunately I had been reading the basic science ancestor health principles and functional medicine and would also a create this diet and lifestyle program that to my amazement got me out of that wheelchair and with my neurologist blessing I was able to wean and discontinue these potent disease-modifying drugs that had never done anything for me really and so I'm off the drugs and I'm able to do a twenty mile bike ride with my family so this of course radically changes how I practice medicine would radically change the focus of my research and so at first people here at the University I thought I was pretty eccentric and a bit odd now as my research was being published and recognized by more and more centers and we have greater success with getting grants and larger studies I'm being hailed as this brilliant visionary so many many wonderful things have happened in this journey it's amazing I mean truly you just don't hear that one now you do because you're helping up thousands and people do it but people literally recovering getting out of a wheelchair and going back to an active lifestyle and now I know you personally I know just how busy you are with all your research and all the people you helped and you seem to have kind of endless energy so you're definitely a testament to the fact that it works and I know that in the last few years but I'm so excited to go deep with you on today is you found this for you for MS and you've realized through research that it actually has far-reaching benefits for a variety of conditions is that right besides SMS oh no absolutely so you know if we go back 10 years what I change my practice and so I'm using these concepts in primary care so I'm for the first time reversing type 2 diabetes reversing obesity we've ever seen in rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus fibromyalgia helping people with traumatic brain injury recover remarkable function then the VI here at the Iowa City said you know we got we want to take you out of your primary care clinic and let you run your own specialty clinic so we did that we called the therapeutic lifestyle clinic and I went to primary care and to the pain clinic and said you know give me your most difficult cases but but people need to know they're not getting drugs for me we're just gonna use diet and lifestyle so I saw the most difficult people with refractory disease that we're still having a great deal of pain in time and time again I stabilized them reduce their pain got them off neurotic narcotics and got better control of a wide variety of disease states and many of these were serious autoimmune problems that had they could not control even with multiple very potent biologic disease-modifying drugs I mean costing tens of thousands of dollars each month so the VA nationally was very interested in what I was doing because of this remarkable success and the VA locally you know was very impressed because I was saving all this money in terms of the pharmacy cost because we're having such remarkable effect that's amazing ok so for anyone who's not familiar and of course I highly recommend everything you've written you go into it in detail in your books but what are the basics of this diet and lifestyle approach and and why do you think that makes it so effective so we talked about the role of the environment training your genes on and off I and so I teach people how the mechanisms work then we teach them the basic tenets of the diet that our foods been designed by the food companies because there's a big profit motive to create food that creates us to be addicted to these foodstuffs and over consume and so there's a lot of food like chemicals added that are addicting and fertilized the wrong microbes in our gut so I want people to get rid of these foods that are so inflammatory so it's the big three sugar gluten I which is the protein and wheat rye barley many ancient grains and casein the protein and dairy and then for many people our problems will have them take eggs out as well I tell them really what you want to be eating our vegetables and your source of protein I have a strategy for meat-eaters and a different one for non meat eaters I and so that's the entry-level diet and depending on their health issues we may advance it further more specifically for them then we talked about a meditative mindfulness gratitude type of practice and many they can do that and we talk about the role of physical activity and again this depends on where the person is at in terms of beginning to increase their physical activity at a pace and tempo that is appropriate given their current level of function because some of my folks are so disabled they can just shuffle a few steps on their Walker so and some are folks who just got out of the military so we design activity programs very specific to the individual that makes sense and one thing I love about your approach is that you also instead of just focusing on the bad because a lot of Dietary Approaches do that the things you have to avoid you also really go into detail on how to support the body nutritionally and the things that your body needs so can we talk about that pipe part - oh absolutely so you know I think most people know that I really love the Paleo diet I'm very very fond of that but what people may forget is that in my own healing journey I'd been vegetarian for 20 years my cleveland clinic doctors introduced me to the concept of the Paleo diet I adopted that but I continued to decline so the Paleo diet wasn't enough to recover me and I stayed with it because scientifically I thought it made some sense I didn't know how long it would take to recover but when I when I redesigned my Paleo diet in a very specific way based on what I've learned in functional medicine and the supplements I was using to support my brain that's when I came up with this Statuary protocol that led to this dramatic restoration of strength and so here the key concepts we want lots of vegetables in the following grouping 3 cups of greens 3 cups of cabbage onion mushroom family vegetables in 3 cups of deeply pigmented vegetables like beets carrots or berries I and for people who are not finding the cups if you take your big dinner plate and you cover the whole plate so you can't see the bottom that would be the equivalent of three cups so we're talking three plates of vegetables measured raw and you can eat them raw or you can eat them cooked according to your preferences or needs but that would give you an idea of the volume yeah and it's also I'm not trying to make you over consumed so if you're very petite individual and and in our studies we had some very petite folks and they were eating more like 6 cups of vegetables so we're not trying to over feed you but I don't there's no need for you to be hungry so if you're hungry we want you to eat more of the allowed foods but there's no need this is not a weight-loss program although people who are overweight typically lose weight because they get back to the weight that they had often in high school or the early 20s without being hungry I wanna make that very clear got it so what's the mechanism that's going on or what do you why these specific groupings of vegetables so the greens we're doing that because I want to have a lot more carotenoids these compounds are phenomenally important for the retina of your eye and for your brain cells you'll also get a lot more magnesium in them more folate and some of the compounds that are used in detoxification the sulfur-containing vegetables are really important for how your body processes it eliminates the the chemical trash that we make in the chemistry of life and the pollutants synthetic compounds that are in air water and food that we eat just because there's so many chemicals that we encounter in everyday life they're also important for some neurotransmitters that we make in our brain and then the third area the deep colors colors are really good marker for antioxidants yeah in these antioxidants again are necessary for protecting selves as they do the chemistry of life we have huge studies with more millions plus people in them when you combine them in these meta analyses that show us the more color that you eat the better your brain is the the less cognitive decline you'll have the less cancer you will have the less diabetes you'll have the less heart disease you'll have that's also true not just of the more servings of color but also the more servings of vegetables in general so I think the research is very very good that particularly the non starchy vegetables incredibly good for us and then I want to be sure that people have protein so we talk about protein strategies for the meat eaters and the non meat eaters the meat eaters I tell them to eat a little less meat I want them to still eat meat but that quite as much as they would normally end up Paleo diet because I'm giving them a lot more vegetables and the vegetarians I'm trying to be sure that their have means a sufficient amount of protein and the other thing I do is I talk about fact that our brain is about 70% fat and fat is involved in the wiring between brain cells it's in the fat wrap around every cell in our body I we need fat to make some really important hormones like testosterone and all of our estrogen hormones I in our cortisol adrenal hormones so we if we don't have enough cholesterol to make those things if you're a man you're totally screwed because you need testosterone if you're a lady you're totally screwed because you need estrogen for your bones to work of in both cases and for your brains to work independent of your fertility issues so those sex hormones are vital to us and we want to brain the work so we need fat we need some cholesterol we want to be sure that we're avoiding damaged fats so I talk about if you're going to cook with fat it should be a saturated fat otherwise we're gonna use olive oil please use it cold as it in addressing our sauce after you've made something and to have lots of picados which is obviously good for you and lots of coal dalawa sadly good stuff for you yeah and it seems like that the vegetable key is something that almost every dietary approach agrees with I know there's a couple of mal that don't but in general that's one thing that most people seem to agree with is that we are probably not consuming enough vegetables in the US but you take it to a really targeted level with removing the understanding it removing the inflammatory components and food and then using really targeted nutrients to replenish those levels in the body is that what's causing the shift in autoimmunity correct that's what's causing the shift and you know the other thing that I want observe is say every other author out there writing about their recommended diet I'm the only one that does clinical research testing the diet that they talk about I'm the only one who's who's taken the time to actually do a research level analysis of that diet to say and this diet will provide the this level of nutrients and that's how it compares to the recommended daily allowance or the adequate intake recommendations so I'm really the only one can say this diet would be safe long-term probably would it be safe it would be vastly superior to the average dietary consumption and equivalent or superior to the healthy eating plan that's been recommended there because I'm I'm the only one that's doing clinical research if and also out there trying to teach the public how to do this stuff yeah and I know you you are very deeply involved in that world can you walk us through the mechanism of what's happening on a cellular level or what I know it's the body's capacity to heal itself is incredible and we're supporting that but I don't what's going on in the body when this is when this change is happening so you know life is we exist because of a series of self-correcting chemical reactions and so the biggest thing we need to do is to stop the action that's going on and when we are consuming these inflammatory foods they may leak in into our bloodstream I and so these inflammatory proteins are recognized by our immune cells as a threat I and the immune cells will then rev up release more inflammatory very damaging proteins into our bloodstream that again depending your specific genetics so in my case my brain would be damaged in my spinal cord would be damaged and then over time I developed some psoriasis so then my skin starts getting damaged I also have asthma so my lungs we're getting damaged and you know I'm having to take more and more steroids and nebulizers for the asthma creams for the psoriasis and when I learn how to remove all these inflammatory foods the as most gone the psoriasis is gone and I had this dramatic steady improvement I in strength and balance and of course I'm doing intensive physical therapy so I had this recovery so you have to stop the damage and then in order to have my cells repair the damage to my skin repair the damage to my lung rewire my brain I have to have all the building blocks so in my case I need you need and we all need a lot of the correct fats so your cells can come in and repair and replace the stiff molecules in my cell membranes that have the damaged fats with them with the proper fats in the cell membrane so the cell membrane is fluid again and then in the cellular structures in my lungs again I need the proper fats I need to be able to remove some of the toxins so the sulfur compounds from that sulfur group of families remarkably improved the cells in my lungs also added to the flexibility of the small arterioles and the muscles around the blood vessels so my blood pressure improves that is really fun yes if you look at photographs of me serially you see that I steadily was looking older and older and at age 52 when I was at my worst I looked much much older than my stated age and now I know each year I keep looking younger and younger my hair is getting more gray but I'd say my face looks younger and younger and younger and I've done a biomarker looking at telomeres which is a lovely biologic marker of how old your cells are and when I when I ordered that I was I braced myself for getting results that would say that my telomere age was five years maybe ten years older than my chronological age because after all I do have a progressive neurodegenerative disease with progressive MS but it came back and I'm 12 years younger then stated age and so biologically by giving my cells the building blocks they need to do chemistry of life they keep repairing the damage but you have to you have to flood it with the proper nutrition that's amazing and that speaks to the fact that even for listeners who maybe hopefully don't have an autoimmune disease because I have one and wouldn't wish not anyone that there is a really strong anti-aging and potential longevity component to this type of diet correct absolutely we would see that in clinics that people would come back looking younger and younger and younger that was very consistent to me it looks like visually people would get back go back about 10 years that was a very common it makes sense because you're focusing on a lot of the things that are largely missing from our modern diets and you're putting them back in in huge amounts which makes total sense because I I'm a very big believer in the body's ability to move back toward health when you just give it the right building blocks that's been part of my own he was realizing this is not a fight you're not fighting your body you're strictly you're just supporting your body and it knows what to do if we give it those building blocks does that mean there's also have you studied the preventative aspects of this type of diet as well is there hope for preventing some of these problems you know I don't have research to tell me that clinical trials I do have clinical experience in that you know many of these families you know they come in they make these transformations I and because I tell them it's far more successful as a family and so that they should get their kids when they're home to eat this way and realize that you know you can't control what they do away from home what's served off to school but many of these families are recognizing that getting their children to eat this way begins to change the children's behavior for better begins to change their academic performance for better I and they're seeing new happier children and so we have this conversation like you have prevented big health challenges and probably a big life challenges for those youngsters by having them begin to adopt this healthy lifestyle We certainly have folks who have like the apoe4 gene and who have parents who've had dementia and grandparents who had dementia and so they're like oh my god I don't want to get dementia I and so they've adopted my diet and lifestyle program in they're doing extraordinarily well that was actually gonna be one of my follow-up questions because I know with apoE are there some concerns with saturated fats for anyone who's not familiar with it can you explain what that means yeah so 84 is a gene that regulates in part how we handle fats and there's been a big debate if you have eight before what does that mean we know it increases your risk for Alzheimer's should how should we feed that person should we put them on a low-fat diet you put them on a high-fat diet and if we use a high-fat diet which kind of fat should we use so that there's a lot of research questions about that what is very clear that we all agree on you you want them to not have any sugar you want them to not have white flour that you'd rather that they have a relatively low grain or no grain diet they would probably do well in a ketogenic diet if you do a ketogenic diet the agreement is that avoiding MCT oil coconut oil it would be preferable probably avoiding butter is also preferable so now olive oil would be what's recommended it's also what I'd recommend and I have a plenty of a Polly followers who use my diet lots of olive oil and we'll eat just once a day so that they will have like 16 to 18 hours to 20 hours of not eating that means that and they can eat you know like 80 grams of carbs lots of olive oil they'll go out of ketosis but in 12 hours they'll be back because they'll have used up all of their glycogen stores they will be back in ketosis for about eight hours if they eat once a day and that's worked very well for them and many of these folks i mean i've met some of these a priori folks in their late 80s and 90s who are still traveling still going to meetings so write in to me at a variety of ancestral health meetings and still playing chess you know it's it's very impressive I'm like well these folks are doing well that's amazing and you touched on another question that was on my list which is fasting has obviously become very popular in the last couple of years whether it be intermittent fasting water fasting there's a lot of different forms I'm curious how do you see this fitting in with your approach is there a place for it and if so how can someone who also likes to fast and some form integrate that that is a great great question in fact in my book I talk a lot more about fasting because I think the research is absolutely so very compelling about the benefits of ketosis about the benefits of either calorie restriction so we're eating only about 70% of what we're what we need so you're chronically hungry all the time that one's very difficult for people to do long you know forever for the rest of your life voluntarily but you can do this severe calorie restriction for a week out of out of each month and that's really the fast Seema making diet great benefits for doing that and that's much easier to sustain you could do severe calorie restriction two days a month or two days a week I in that there's also good benefits with that you could do a high fat diet lower and carb good benefits with that it's not quite so clear if we should do that for the rest of your life or not there are circumstances where I think it's definitely helpful optically if you've got cancer or severe seizure disorder and then I talk about the fact if we look at what our ancestral mothers and fathers had to deal with once we migrated out of equatorial regions and moved into areas where there is winter our ancestral mothers and fathers were in ketosis during every winter or during the war or during drought but we we don't really have any societies that are in ketosis nutritionally for the rest of their lives for for that reason my stance is that ketosis the rest of your life is uncertain there's clinical circumstances where I think it's the right thing to do but I'm not comfortable recommending that for everyone I am very comfortable saying seasonal ketosis that would have been the equivalence of the winter for your ancestral group there's plenty of evidence that that would be probably very good for you when you go longer than that now we're back to I'm not really sure what the better what the risks are if you want to do that the rest of your life okay cool and to circle back so you mentioned a couple questions ago about this being a great approach for families and having a lot of benefits for children which makes sense because they have even faster cellular turnover and they're growing and they've got more hormone production I'm guessing there are some parents listening going that's all great and all but how do I actually get my kids to eat 9 cups of vegetables per day do you have any suggestions for families we're actually implementing so yes many talk about food non-stop remember that our kids are being overwhelmed with marketing to get them to eat terrible foods that to which they'll become addicted get all the food that you think is wrong out of the house and have plenty of food that is good for them in the house so that when they're hungry there's food that is tasty and available so fruit nuts guacamole for example would work really well my kids loved kale chips and we take couches to school their friends love that my kids actually loved we made some liver and onion treats bacon-wrapped liver that they loved they would make for their friends and the friends loved it as well so it's possible to make food that it's very very tasty having the kids help with shopping cooking and teach them how to cook beginning at age five is incredibly helpful I and if mom and dad are excited about these males kids will emulate what they see us do the other the other thing that is so important is to get extended family on board with this and to recognize that many kids during elementary school you'll have a much better success at controlling with their decisions of what they're going to eat when they go to junior high they might start cheese and they'll experience their health consequences and hopefully eventually come back and say mom dad I feel bad I'd like to improve my diet and you can help them because you want them to make their poor choices and come back to you before they go off to college before they move away from home where it's harder to get back connected to you to get rece cool on good choices what about with kids especially so I have six kids and they're all extremely active to the tune of like running around the neighborhood multiple miles per day sometimes up to ten miles per day do kids have a higher need for adding in more things like fruit and starchy vegetables and is there a place for that so absolutely if here the question is you're gonna have to have enough protein to be sure that they can meet their protein needs and is the child obese already on the path to type 2 diabetes already on the path to a serious autoimmune disease or are they healthy athlete so we really have to personalize based on am i treating a healthy athlete who's on football doing a lot of weight training or is on distance sports and track so we have to personalize that or do I have a youngster who has already developed multiple sclerosis or inflammatory bowel disease or type 2 diabetes or severe behavioral problems yeah it's sad and scary to see the numbers rising for young people going through all of those problems one in two children know when I talk to my pediatric Front's one and two children are doing are having serious health problems you know I a little side note what I'm incredibly excited a a good friend of mine Alisa song and I are discussing putting together a future pediatric medicine conference for the fall of 2020 because we're also alarmed by what we see going on in the public and that clinicians and families are trying to find pediatricians and family Doc's who will take care of children with complex issues from more of an integrative diet and therapeutic lifestyle perspective I definitely have to keep an eye out for that one I'm also curious because I've heard from a lot of parents who are having especially daughters go through puberty early I'm curious if an approach like this there may not be studies but I know that like for instance green vegetables help bind to excess estrogen in the body and excess estrogen mimicking products in the body do you think an approach like this can help children have a more hormonal and easier hormonal experience through puberty well yes absolutely I think it would help prevent and delay that early onset puberty it will also help prevent that estrogen dominance so if that greatly reduces the severity of pelvic pain and severe cramping severe bleeding you know it's funny my daughter and many many of our patients have all come and said you know really do paying attention to my diet makes all the difference in terms of severity of my pelvic pain the severity of the menstrual bleeding it when I'm not finding the diet the period is heavy hard and miserable when I'm on the diet it is so much more manageable it makes sense this episode is brought to you by fabletics fabletics makes cute and really high-quality

body and brain they're naturally gluten dairy and sway free contain lots of electrolytes vitamins and minerals and even though they're chocolate they won't melt in the heat or freezing the cold and their delicious chocolatey coconut flavor and texture is one that both kids and adults love right now you can get 10% off the key on clean energy bar by going to get key on Comm forward slash Wellness Mama and using the code mama 10 ma ma 10 and check-out so again that's GE t ki o n dot-com slash Wellness Mama and make sure to use the discount code capital ma ma 10 also a question I've had for you is there's kind of that debate in the health world of do we ever need supplements or why can't we get everything we need from food and I would say your approach is probably the best one I could possibly think of getting close to getting everything we could possibly need from food because you're consuming such a wide variety of micronutrients and enough antioxidants what are you what's your take on the role of supplements and if we need them and how to know if we need them well my diet was designed and we measured we verified that yes we're meeting all of the are days so we're doing extraordinarily well there I do recommend everyone get their vitamin D level I and then work with your personal medical team to take supplements either by sunlight exposure or by an oral supplement to get your vitamin D in the top half of the reference range then depending on your health issue there may be a compelling reason to take additional supplements additional Omega threes additional vitamin K and perhaps additional other targeted supplements based on your specific health story and your symptoms so I really like to personalize that I talked about this in my book I give people a very nice discussion of what are the factors that I consider what are the labs I used to evaluate my as so people could work with their primary care doc get the labs I've suggested and then they could sort of work through with their primary care doc what additional supplements might be right for them that makes sense another thing I'm curious about because I'm seeing the aspect of chewing 9 cups of vegetables what do you think about smooth I know that there's some debate there as far as if they're good for the gut or not what do you think so smoothies can be very helpful a lot of people with my community neurologic disorders we can have difficulty chewing all of that food and they begin to have difficulty swallowing so for them fabulously helpful for people who are really busy it felt like and who don't want to do time we started feeding having a smoothie and a protein bar makes it easy for them to get calories in in the morning in their busy hectic day for work so I think that's great and personally I often make a green smoothie in the evening with my fresh garden herbs a little olive oil a few green grapes and I have that as part of my evening beverage I also because I want to have plenty of enzymes I chew a little bitter kale before my meal to get my digestive enzymes activated so it's the chewing and the bitter flavors that will really help with your digestive enzymes and you don't have a lot of chewing so I mean I make sure that I have vigorous piece of meat that's gonna require a lot of chewing for every meal because that chewing is a very important part of the digestive process absolutely and especially I say that to parents a lot for kids because that's actually especially chewing things like tough meat is for the jaw development and the mandible maxilla developing correctly you actually need pressure and like in the u.s. we give maybe he's only like soft baby food and we give kids like these soft foods that require no actual chewing and we're seeing that change in their jaw structure as a result so I think you're right there's so many benefits to chewing as well but smoothies are a good way to get it in more quickly if you're just trying to make sure you behave your levels right if you do smoothies you want to use some bitters before the meal and you want to be sure that you're eating something requires hard work to eat incredibly important for our children there's a great book jaws that talks about that very issue so all this airway obstruction problems sleep apnea has to do with our lack of chewing when children and then lack of chewing as adults I will link that book in the show notes if you guys want to find it dr. Wallace what's exciting for you in the research right now I know that you're constantly still researching oh so we have this great we've had several studies oh using the diet that I study is showing favorable results we do seeing fatigue improving quality of life for people with MS we have a big study funded by the MS Society comparing a low-fat diet to the walls diet will be finishing that study in January and probably publishing those results sometime in 2020 or 20 21 that's very exciting we are in the process of working to get approval to do a quasi-experimental study where we'll be taking people newly diagnosed with MS who want to use diet and lifestyle have been offered drugs and declined drugs we will enroll them and treat them with Wahls protocol compare them to a cohort of groups newly diagnosed with MS getting usual care at the MS clinic and so that's gonna be an incredibly exciting study we're raising money to analyze the freezer full of blood that I have from all of my previous studies that like to see what other changes in the biomarkers and my as people adapt the walls protocol compared to those who don't so that's a very very exciting that we're working on looking at changes in neuro filament changes in the metabolism gene expression we have collected the poop so I'll be looking at changes in the microbiome between adapting the walls diet before and after so it's exciting it's it's hard to sleep at night cuz I'm so excited about all the all the wonderful things that are going on that is really exciting and I know you are like I mention in the beginning one of the busiest people I know so I'm so grateful I want to make sure I respect your time and we have about I think ten minutes left a few questions I love to ask toward the end the first is what are some areas that you feel like are still not known or misunderstood about your area of expertise well when we change the diet what is HAP with the microbiome we are beginning to understand what species change but I don't think it's really the species I think it's the genes within the bacteria so it's really the processes that were dependent on and so the studies that are going to be looking at the what's called the metabolic processes that the microbes can do for us that the studies that we'll be publishing on that metallo I think will be the most exciting so I think that's probably a very important mechanism of how diet is so profound another area that I'm becoming more and more impressed with is the importance the what I call as the resilience factors send more and more time in clinic and I spent more time in my books talking about how we grow the internal resilience to do this work how do we help people have more desire to make these changes to deal with the discomfort and so I see more research on what are the emotional pillars associated with success and how do we nurture that for people you know except I don't think people struggle from lack of knowledge I think they struggle from lack of emotional resilience lack of internal motivation and so deepening understanding of how we help people nurture that in themselves I think will be incredibly important that's fascinating yeah I think you're right especially in today's world like when you and I both probably started this there was not this huge amount of knowledge that there is now and you didn't there wasn't access to all of this but now people largely I think know what they should do or know what helps them feel good and it's continuing to do it day after day that seems to be the struggle it is hard and I think there are not as many people in this space talking about these resilience factors or pain sufficient attention to how we help people grow their internal motivation so I'm working I'm working on that in my faculty role trying to incorporate more of that in my lectures and and in my seminar that's we really focus on is that we spend a lot of time on the resilience of the purpose the meaning to help people really blossom their resolve that's fascinating and I look forward to keeping up with your research on that cuz I think you're right that's a huge key that we're missing couple other questions I love to wrap up with if there is a book or a number of books that have dramatically changed your life if so what are they and why you know I love my book the Wallace protocol in the cookbook there were a huge amount of work writing them yeah in getting them out there another book that I've just read the nature cure the and that was a written by a German physician talking about some of the traditional healing methods including leeches and that was really fascinating looking at some of these traditional practices what are what are their health benefits and what research is out there and so that was quite fun quite fun reading and another book I read many many years ago Victor Frankel's man's search for meaning and his big thesis there was between every event in your life in your response to it there's a space and that space defines your character and so that was very inspirational for me as going through my profound disability that I could keep thinking about I wanted to be a role model for my kids I and so I couldn't give up I had to keep doing the best that I could that's one of my favorite books as well I love that you mentioned that one and lastly any parting advice you want to leave for the listeners today especially maybe listeners who are struggling with autoimmune disease or in that place of a health health crisis like you were you know the first thing to do is to remove the inflammatory foods get rid of sugar gluten dairy and encourage you also get rid of it and there's a and then ramped up the green sulfur color you need to know that this is an experiment that you should run ideally for a hundred days but at least for a month but you want to do it a hundred percent if you're having occasional cheap meals you're keeping the inflammation going and so you you won't know could diet help you so talk to your family pickets start time prude your your house so only the right food is around you and then run the experiments and see what being fall in 110% on the diet could do for you awesome and I know you have a lot of resources for that I'll make sure that your website in your books and all of your resources are linked

He was light as a feather in a crowd. People could touch him when he moved. And when he talked, people who really despised his presence was still motivated and affected by his presence. And they would have hate in their face with tears in their eyes. I was close enough to see that. And it left an impact on so many souls, so many powerful people. \u266a Never seen anyone who could inspire people the way he did and the way he inspired me. \u266a It really was his calling to be that voice and to say to people we can make a difference if we work together. \u266a The time is always right to do what is right. The question is whether or not we have the courage to do it. \u266a We actually stop and listen to people's real concerns. We have to look deeper within ourselves and say, you know what? You're right. We gotta change that. \u266a And sometimes when we see an injustice, and there's plenty of that all around us, we must say that here I am, I can make a difference. We can make a difference. You can make a difference. I can't do it, to integrate degree alone or in my own lifetime, but I sure want to leave this world having been moving in the right direction. \u266a Thank you, Obie, for that beautiful rendition of \"Lift Every Voice.\" What better way to start today's celebration than with that stirring hymn. It was written over 100 years ago by poet James Weldon Johnson and kept alive by countless singing school children until it became known as the Black National Anthem. It has the power to stir us all, to keep pushing until quote, \"Earth and heaven ring with the harmonies of liberty.\" And what wonderful thoughts from our past Lifetime Achievement Award winners, including our beloved neighbor and friend Reverend A. Charles Bowie, who died just this past fall. His spirit will always be a part of this celebration at the Cleveland Clinic. What a fitting way to begin this important day in the life of the Cleveland Clinic community. How we wish we could all be together in person, seeing old friends and meeting new ones, sharing a great meal, catching up on family news, and celebrating that some progress has been made over the decades. But mainly we come together each year to fortify our spirits for the work ahead because we have so far yet to go. Not being together in person, for so many things, is just one of the elements of this incredibly difficult year. On top of the horror and death brought on by the historic pandemic, we also saw indisputable evidence that the malignancy of racism is still with us. We hope and pray to see an end, not only to COVID-19, but to the disease of racism. More importantly, we make a personal resolve to do something about it, to speak up, and stand up for justice. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and many other spiritual teachers have shown us, we can use our trials, both personal and communal, as a refining fire to burn off the dross of unimportant things and to reveal the gold of living a life that serves the greater good. Before our program proceeds, let's take a few moments of silence to honor Reverend Bowie and all those who have died, whether by illness or violence, or other causes. It has been a year of incredible loss and we do well to name it. Let's pause together for less than a minute, but let us honor our losses. This can help us heal. Thank you. And now we turn to the story of a physician at Cleveland Clinic who embodies a life filled with purpose, Dr. Navneet Majhail, I am proud to call him a fellow caregiver. As Dr. Majhail reflects on the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he finds inspiration for his own journey. The life and legacy of Dr. King are justice, love, compassion, and equality. As a Cleveland Clinic health system, I think that is what we practice in our day-to-day lives as we take care of patients. Some of the important things that guided me as a physician today were my own experiences growing up with my father who was a physician, with my mother who is a cancer survivor, the patients we treat, they are probably amongst as diverse as they can be. Understanding that diversity is also important because a big part of what we do in medicine is empathy, with all that has happened in the country, especially over the past year, that behooves us to be more conscious of our own backgrounds, our own upbringing, our own thought processes. Sometimes it might be an unconscious bias that is not very evident. These are uncomfortable conversations to have. I think that is what we need to do as we go forward. I still have faith in the future and I believe we're going to solve this problem in America. We as Negroes, I believe we're going to win our freedom, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned tho' we may be our destiny is tied up in the destiny of America. The United States of America, it's a melting pot of many different cultures and peoples. Obviously I look a bit different, sometimes where they may not have seen someone else who wears a turbine, the majority of interactions I've had are in the context of curiosity. In fact, one of the most common questions I get is for the color of my turbine. And my response to that often is, it's basically a fashion statement, right? So I'm trying to match the color of my turbine with the rest of my outfit. As people ask me about my faith and my religion, what I try to teach them about is the basic principles of Sikhism. There are three things, one is to do good deeds, and with humility, hard work, and honesty. The second is we need to incorporate faith into everything we do. And the third tenet is to be compassionate, looking out for others, for justice as well. If you think about these conceptually, they help you get prepared for a life in medicine as well. My patients are getting bone marrow transplant. These are some of the sickest patients in the whole Cleveland Clinic health system. This element of faith does help me connect with them. A lot of times, they are very deeply spiritual themselves and I think at the end of the day, those conversations are really enriching. It helps me be more grounded as a physician. \u266a That statement from Dr. King very deeply resonates with me because that is what my faith and religion is established upon. It is our duty to fight injustice and bring people together. Dr. King's message of love, of compassion, of justice, I think it is all the more important today than anytime else in our history. Thank you, Dr. Majhail. What a beautiful story of bringing your whole self to the work of healing the world. And now, it's my great pleasure to turn it over to our Cleveland Clinic CEO and president, Dr. Tom Mihaljevic. Thank you, Reverend Greene and Dr. Majhail, and thank you to everyone who's helping us celebrate the life and legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Much has changed since we gathered for last year's program. We miss the long-time spiritual leadership of Reverend Charles Bowie. He was the former pastor of East Mount Zion Baptist Church and a longtime friend to Cleveland Clinic. We also miss the sense of community, friendship, and engagement that is hard to replicate in this virtual setting. 2020 was a year of challenge and change. The challenges began in February with the COVID-19 pandemic. The change began when people all across America demanded accountability, following the senseless deaths of black Americans. Marches and demonstrations brought issue of inequality to the forefront once again. Some have called it a national reckoning. We looked within ourselves to confront uncomfortable truths as individuals, as a community, and in our case, at the Cleveland Clinic, as an organization. Racial injustice exists and Cleveland Clinic has a responsibility to be part of the solution. As Dr. King said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" Structural racism has created deep-seeded inequalities leading to disparities in every aspect of life, including healthcare. These disparities have significant impact on a person's health over their lifetime, from infant mortality, to chronic disease, to life expectancy. COVID-19 has magnified this reality. While hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives due to the pandemic, COVID-19 has disproportionally impacted people of color. Cleveland Clinic provided improved access to testing. With Meijer and local volunteers, we donated supplies and food that are much needed during the economic hardships brought on by the pandemic. We are committed to ending racism and bias. Doing so will help create the healthiest communities for everyone. 2021 marks Cleveland Clinic Centennial. For a century, our mission has been to help others heal no matter their race or background. That mission begins by nurturing a culture that values diversity and inclusion. In June, we launched a new series of forums called Lift Every Voice. Caregivers were offered a safe environment to discuss racism and bias and share ideas for change. Thousands of caregivers participated. We are adopting many of their ideas across the organization. We have offered additional training for caregivers who want to better understand how to be an ally. We have also established an executive council on inclusion and racial equity. We're committed to making Cleveland Clinic more diverse and inclusive. We reaffirmed our intentional hiring practices. The organization has already become more diverse and so have our leaders. By 2024, we will have leadership that reflects the diversity of those they lead. We are a founding member of the One Ten project, a national coalition to train, hire, and advance one million black Americans over the next 10 years. Along with Cleveland State University, we secured a National Institute of Health Award to recruit underrepresented minority PhD students. Our commitment extends beyond our walls and into our communities. Caring for the community is a cornerstone of our 100-year-old foundation. We have taken these actions to serve our community. We partnered with civic leaders when the city of Cleveland declared racism a public health crisis. We're investing more resources into our Langston Hughes Center in the Fairfax neighborhood to expand primary care services. Recently, in partnership with TransDigm and Lubrizol Corporations, we helped bring affordable broadband service to the Fairfax neighborhood. Also, philanthropic efforts expanding access. In Summit County, our Neighbor to Neighbor fundraising campaign helped establish a COVID-19 testing center in downtown Akron. It also will help educate future caregivers about social determinants of health. In the Cleveland region, donations of all sizes supporting an emergency medicine team that is improving the care of homeless patients. 2020 was a challenging year, but there's a reason for optimism and hope. The vaccination against COVID-19 will eventually end the pandemic. Widespread public vaccination is expected to begin in the next several months. We will collaborate with national, state, and local officials in the community to ensure the vaccines are distributed equitably. Ultimately, to truly honor Dr. King, we must actively fight against prejudice in all aspects of our lives. There is no place for racism in our world. This is a time for us to embrace one another with respect and empathy. We have more work to do and we are here to help. Now, I would like to introduce today's keynote speaker, Congresswoman Marcia L. Fudge. Since her election in 2008, Congresswoman Fudge has represented the people of the 11th Congressional District of Ohio. During her time in Washington, she has served on committees addressing social determinants of health. She has tackled issues of employment, education, civil rights, voting rights, healthcare, nutrition and safety net programs. Last month, she was nominated by President Elect Biden to be the next Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. If confirmed, Congresswoman Fudge would be only the second black woman to hold this cabinet level position. It is my pleasure to introduce Congresswoman Marcia L. Fudge. Good morning. To quote Dr. King, \"The true measure of a man is not where he stands at times of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\" The question of the day is where do you stand in these times of challenge and controversy? Good morning, Dr. Mihaljevic, and greetings to you all as we celebrate and commemorate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It is an honor to address you. So much of what Dr. King gave his life for is under attack; voting rights, human rights, domestic terrorism, the fight against police brutality, economic equity, equity in healthcare, and attacks on our very democracy. Like Yogi Berra says, \"It's deja vu all over again.\" Thank you, Dr. Mihaljevic for your vision of the Cleveland Clinic as the best place for care anywhere, and the best place to work in healthcare. I am grateful for your commitment to first class care for all patients regardless of their station in life and I cannot thank you and your staff enough for putting your lives and safety at risk every day to serve patients during this deadly pandemic. We recognize your sacrifice, and again, thank you for all you continue to do. Your theme for today's celebration, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,\" is taken from Dr. King's letter from a Birmingham jail, one of my favorite writings of Dr. King. They had a responsibility to take urgent action rather than wait for delayed judicial resolutions because, and I quote, \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\" He went on to say, \"We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny, whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.\" Dr. King's words were so true in 1963, as they are today. COVID-19, to paraphrase Dr. King, tied us together affecting many of us directly and all of us indirectly. We know the COVID pandemic also shined a glaring spotlight on the inequities in healthcare that led to more serious consequences for African Americans and other people of color who contracted the novel coronavirus. We are the least able to socially distance, more likely to be uninsured, more likely to be frontline workers, employed in such jobs as bus drivers, delivery workers, retail workers, sanitation workers, orderlies, and housekeeping. I know Dr. King would have challenged us all to work even harder to eliminate the inequities in health care for African Americans, people of color generally, and the poor. Dr. King knew then, and we clearly see now, what Dr. King said, and I quote, \"Of all the forms of discrimination and inequalities, injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane because it often results in the physical death.\" More than five decades later, that statement became a rallying cry among many defenders of the Affordable Care Act. It was later discovered the reason Dr. King spoke so forcefully about inequalities in healthcare was due to the passage of the 1965 Amendment to the Social Security Act that created Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid are lifelines for so many, yet we still see discrimination in the delivery of health services to those who are sent home prematurely without pain management. One heartbreaking example of this is the plight of the African-American doctor, Susan Moore, who was treated at Indiana University Hospital for COVID-19. As a medical doctor, she was able to advocate for her own treatment, begging for Remdesivir and a CT scan of her chest to prove her pain was real. She received neither and was sent home. Dr. Moore died a week later. The Institute of Medicine issued a report on unequal treatment in 2003 that not only confirmed the existence of racial health disparities, but also found that these disparities in many cases are associated with the worst outcomes. We need only look at the impact that COVID-19 has had on communities of color that have disproportionately borne the brunt of the pandemic, confirming the devastation that can be caused by health disparities. You know the statistics well, but let me emphasize that African-Americans and Latinos are three times more likely to contract COVID-19 and nearly twice as likely to die from it. In many patients, the severity of the virus' impact is exacerbated by chronic illnesses like diabetes or hypertension diseases that could be prevented by health education and preventive care. Couple that with a lengthy history of systemic inequality and distrust of the medical establishment based on events like sterilization, deliberate infections, high infant mortality rates, larger incidents of death from heart attacks, and the purposeful failure to provide available treatment, getting communities of color to trust the medical establishment will take some time to remedy. Another example is that of maternal mortality. Historically, black women have endured the highest maternal mortality rate among all groups. In March of 2010, Congress and the Obama administration tried to address the issue of disparities with the passage of the Affordable Care Act that had three primary goals:  to expand Medicaid to the working pool, make affordable health insurance available to more people, and reform the private insurance market, especially for individuals and those in small group plans. I thank the Cleveland Clinic for offering the Ohio Hospital Care Assurance Program that provides financial assistance to those who do not have access to affordable health care, or are unable to pay. Your program benefits working Ohioans who have jobs that make them ineligible for Medicaid. It is another step in closing the healthcare disparity gap, making you part of the solution. Certainly, that is no surprise to me. Northeast Ohio not only has the best medical care in the country, maybe even in the world, it also has some of the most compassionate care. I am proud of the Cleveland Clinic standards of excellence and efforts to address economic and racial health disparities. Still, we have a long way to go. President Elect Biden has said he wants to expand the ACA to make the type of care you provide at the Cleveland Clinic available to those currently unable to afford such amazing services. I am sure that his administration will do everything possible to implement that promise. As I close, I must say a few words about the events of January 6th, the insurrection, the attack on the US Capitol, where the Statue of Freedom sits atop the seat of our democracy, the Capitol, the people's house. It is time to reevaluate what we mean when we say freedom. The concept of freedom, as we understand it, has become freedumb, F-R-E-E-D-U-M-B. The removal of all restraint, the right to harm others, the ability to do anything you please, no matter how destructive, toxic, foolish, or inane. Freedumb is the right not to ever have to cooperate or to invest, or to act for the common good of a commonwealth. I want to say that I know we are a better nation than we saw on January 6th, and I pledge to you, I will do everything I can to work for what Dr. King called the beloved community. And I know you will too. I thank you, Cleveland Clinic, for your contribution to the dream that we may one day indeed live in the beloved community he envisioned. Thank you. Thank you, and hearty congratulations to you, Congresswoman Fudge, for your inspiring words. Our prayers go with you to Washington. And until we can all be together again, until we can hug, let us stay resolved, stay safe, and stay hopeful. We turn out to the words of the immortal song \"We Shall Overcome,\" which is also more than 100-years-old, but became a wider cultural phenomenon during the civil rights movement. There are so many things for us to overcome, both physical and spiritual. Perhaps the biggest threat to our wellbeing is the virus called despair. So sing along wherever you are while Obie plays this familiar tune that brings to mind these inspiring words. \"We shall overcome, we shall overcome. We shall overcome some day. Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome some day. Thank you, stay safe, stay connected. Lead us, Obie. \u266a \"We Shall Overcome\" \u266a", "0D1m1AiTnn0": "what is up guys John Anthony from masculine development comm and today I'm going to be talking about mice arms before and after results so I was on two different cycles of sarbs the first one was Austrian car Turin and ligand roll the second one was rat 140 and in this video I'm gonna explain my dosages how much muscle mass againts how much that I lost etc but before I get into that part of the video I need to warn you about something and there's a lot of people out there who will record a before and after transformation results video whatever and they'll actually be on steroids while they're doing it so they'll get crazy results and then they'll tell you hey buy my product and you're gonna buy it thinking that you'll get those results and you won't because they're on steroids so keep that in mind if something seems too good to be true it probably is I was not on anything no roids no nothing just storm's or these two cycles so with that in mind let's get to it [Music] so like I said the first cycle that I went on was Austrian car Turin and ligand drawl and I'll put the results right here so you can see them I ended up gaining 18 pounds of muscle and losing seven pounds of fat over the course of three months every day I took 25 milligrams of Austrian ten milligrams of car Turin and ten milligrams of ligand drawl first thing in the morning people get you know crazy about that dose timing and stuff like that twice a day or once the day whatever you don't have to take them that often okay just once a day is fine I get mine from proven peptides I'll put a link in the description down below and like I said I had great results so when you buy them from proven peptides they don't sell powder they sell liquid and that's something that's really important to keep in mind if you're thinking of getting on sarbs most powdered storm's are fake they're junk because it's easy to fill powder with you know just put in you know 20% cornstarch and 80 percents arms or even more cornstarch right so liquid is the way to go when I got my storms that came in at vial again I'll put a picture right here so you can see and all you do is you just you know take a little dropper out and put it in a you know glass of water or you know orange juice or whatever you want to do mix it around and just chug it it's not that great kind of tastes a little bit like alcohol like rubbing alcohol to preserve it it's not actually rubbing a whole alcohol that's in it but you know something's in there to preserve it it's not that good but whatever just suck it up don't be a just drink it to get jacked I noticed results very quickly so within I think the first day or two I found myself just having more energy I was way more focused you know just feeling feeling better overall right and I started noticing strength gains pretty quickly to UM within about a week or two I think I was breaking pr's you know I was killing it just doing a great job at at getting more muscle mass and you know losing fat and getting stronger and I attribute that mostly to the Ostrom so Austrian was the strongest out of those three and I took each of those three storms for a different reason actually so Austrian every storm is gonna I increase your strength and help you lose weight but each one has a different slightly different effect on the body so Austrian is known for strength right strength and muscle mass ligature all is known more for getting that cut and oh I look so if you want to look really cut and dry you know those those awesome striations if you can see any right now I took a picture I'll put it up here earlier today if you want to get those awesome striations then a ligand drawl is a good way to go Carter --n is known for increasing endurance and car turin isn't actually a SARM technically but it's sold alongside saw arms and kind of put in that group because it acts in a similar way so they did a study and they found that lab rats that took Carter in I think after just one or two days their endurance shot up by fifty percent which is huge and that's incredible right so Cardin was for endurance um in retrospect I think that I should have eaten more so if you are gonna get on a storm cycle definitely do eat a lot more protein than you usually do I recommend if you're not on storms you have one gram of protein per pound of lean body weights so you know add another thirty to fifty grams on top of that if you're gonna get on storms um my biggest mistake like I said was not enough protein and I didn't eat enough I was very focused on work I have a blog a YouTube channel obviously um so you know I was very focused on work and I didn't eat enough protein eat enough calories that was my biggest mistake so overall though it was great I mean like I said I gained muscle lost a lot of fat and you know the results basically speak for themselves so with that in mind let's talk about rad 140 which i think is the best SARM on the market so like I said I think that rad 140 is by far the best storm on the market and before I explain why let me just show you my results so this was a 60 days cycle I ended up gaining 21 pounds of muscle and losing 12 pounds of fat so even though I was on rad 144 less time than the previous cycle and even though I was only on once arm which was rad 140 I had better results and so why was this well personally I think it was for two reasons one is that I just learned from the first one right I ate better I had more protein etc etc you know I was very focused on on you know looking good for this before and after picture so that was a big part the second part though is that rad 140 is the strongest SARM in existence and for you nerds out there I'm a huge nerd let me explain something so there is something called anabolic androgenic ratio and I got my jewel in my hand right here this basically means I used nicotine for focus as a nootropic what this basically means is that it's the ratio of how much muscle you'll gain in layman's terms versus how many side effects you'll have right and it's not that simple but that's generally sort of what it is so pure testosterone right the testosterone in and date that bodybuilders inject into their butt like steroids not judging because I've done it that has an anabolic ratio of 100 to 100 so what that means is that the muscle gain that you'll get from it is roughly the same as the side effects that you'll gain from it of stronger steroid like trend blow and acetate has an anabolic androgenic ratio of five hundred to five hundred so what that means is that it's five times stronger than testosterone at building muscle but you'll also get five times the side effects so that's why a lot of guys on you know trend you know like guys what's his name Jeff side and what's that a dude's name John Skywalker or whatever his name is that's why they start having health problems pretty fast right a lot of them died hate to say it but you know in their in their mid-30s that's probably why this died too so you know lots of side effects the thing is though with rad 140 the anabolic androgenic ratio is ninety to one so what that means is that it's literally a ninety percent as effective as giving yourself pure testosterone but it only has one percent of the side effects and that's why I think it's so cool because you can literally get jacked almost like you're taking steroids and not have any side effects so I didn't experience really any side effects when I was on rad 140 I mean you know the only side effects were getting jacked and looking good um I didn't have any you know back knee any you know any of the stuff that I got when I was actually on roids um it was just great I mean I was building muscle I felt it very quickly I'm pretty sure I felt everything like the first day or two could have been placebo I get that but I started breaking PRS within I think like a week maybe two weeks um so I definitely think that rad 140 is the best SARM if you're looking to just you know overall get jacked build so I know look good etc so again I got the same I got the same storms from proven peptides wrap 40 and funny note 2 I actually bought a 3 month supply of rad 140 I took 30 milligrams a day and I got the flu after two months of being on rad 140 so I was just like you know what I'm just gonna cut it off I don't want to you know lose all my gains and then have a shady three months before and after pictures so I just cut it to two months right but even so I gained a more muscle in two months and lost more fat in two months than I did on three months of austere and car Turin and ligand haul and I like I said I took thirty milligrams of rad 140 every day first thing in the morning dropper in the glass of water chug it down first thing in the morning for 60 days and I had incredible results so I hope this helped you guys I have any questions just leave them down below well you know I'm very active on my channel I'll answer them you know I for my PCT as well I took a read PCT for the Oscar and car Turin and they control cycle and for my rad 140 cycle I I think I took what the hell was called it was from same company that sells green 85 I'll put the links down below in the description but I don't think that storm's require a PCT necessarily but I just like to be safe so a PCT is just meant to get your testosterone levels back to normal a cure cycle personally again I don't think it's necessary but if you want to be safe and good for you do that so hope this helps guys if you're thinking of getting on storm's definitely shoot me an email ask me any questions you have leave any comments questions in the description down below and I will see you guys next time [Music] you", "T4dqC2MMfo0": "cbs47 exclusive just weeks after the city of fresno's last medical marijuana dispensary shut down new pot shops are popping up around Fresno County

Commonwealth of Massachusetts we looked around the space and we chose those two and we hope that they're the first of many that will be giving back to in this community and we're just really happy to have another new business in the community that's supporting the work that we do and supporting low-income people here in Somerville it's I mean I think as part of the city allowing them to open their

residential area you got a Costco here at Home Depot there are some homes down this street but I want you to take a look at this MetroPCS this is a spot where a company true level investments wants to put a medical marijuana dispensary this company was in the number to be approved by the state to be licensed today now we did have some questions for the state about the addresses of these dispensaries and their operating locations we it turns out that a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health told us that facilities are allowed to change their addresses after they've been approved for licenses we drove around to several of the addresses listed for the approved licenses at 6200 Troost Avenue Oh XD Troost LLC has been approved for a license there used to be some sort of restaurant here but now there's a real estate sign in the window at another location about two miles away 70 25 Prospect Avenue v3 mow vending 6 LLC was also approved for a license and that location has a real estate sign posted to at 240 Linwood that's where we are right now we did tell you there has been a license approved this is a metro pcs right now but it could soon change we did talk to businesses in the area about the possibility of a dispensary coming next door and so far we've heard no complaints it'll help all the local area businesses like a local businessman like me I think it's gonna help you know bring more traffic to this area this area is actually an upcoming area and we've been here for a few months and we are successful and we think that this is gonna be a good thing for us it could be months before these dispensaries actually start selling medical marijuana and that's because the state of Missouri requires these dispensaries to actually sell marijuana that

"wH14PK1cI3A": "[Music] hi guys and welcome to 5 minutes with mash where I show you the basics of setting up a quadcopter in 5 minutes or less hopefully so let's begin today's video is going to be covering camera and VTX with and without without OSD so let's first talk about OSD now OSD is the on screen display which shows you battery voltage RSSI and all that kind of crazy good stuff we'll get into that in a more advanced tutorial later on but right now we're just going to talk about the connection process so let's begin now most VT X's this is a very good cheap VTX I love and I still use to this day most VT x's take something from seven volts to 24 volts so that's something very important to take note of cameras most of them I highly recommend you stick to 5 volts they all usually just take 5 volts so just consider it 5 volts I'll leave a link to this camera below and all good ones that I recommend below so let's begin now let's start with a flight controller that has an OSD for example here's one right here now how do you know it has an OSD well one thing is you will see a writing that says cam and you'll see something that says VT X or vo and VI video in and video out so as you could tell the pads are right here we have a v TX and a ground and we have a cam in the ground very simple right perfect alright so let's go ahead and begin now first thing you want to do is you want to grab your camera so we know the camera takes a ground a 5-volt and it has this yellow wire so this yellow wire will go to the cam so as you can tell right there some flight controls don't have that they have VI which has video in so it's either cam or VI so that yellow wire would go to cam and then here we have the ground and we have a 5 volts so the ground would go to the black and the 5 volt would go the red would go to the 5 volt right there thus connecting our camera to this board simple right now let's grab our VTX v takes a little bit tricky because it doesn't take 5 volts so depending on the board this is what you would have to do most of the time on most board now if a board has this is all one flight controller now if a board has a 12 volt regulator or a nine volt regulator you can power it up through that but if not you can have to power off through the battery and how do you do that well first let's start easy the yellow wire where is going to where's the yellow wire going to go that's the video wire it'll go to the VTX right there usually they're all VTX or vio video out because the yellow wire from the cam goes to cam goes through the on-screen display chip and pops out to your V T X yellow wire and then this transmitted down to your goggles very simple now powering this guy can't be a little bit tricky sometimes but it's very simple so let's just see here they gave us a ground so it's okay we'll ground it here so put the black wire here we put the yellow wire here for the VTX now where do we power it from well this board does not have anything more than a 5 volt regulator if you take a look here it says 7 2 well it doesn't say here but it's a 7 to 24 volt VTX most of them are like that if they're not then you know what you got alright so where would we take the red wire where would we give this power from well we can give this power from right there with the battery and that's it you're good to go so now everything is working so you have your camera plugged in here 5 volt gram cam VTX in the ground which is the V T X would be the yellow wire and the black wire would be the ground and the red wire would go here very simple we're done just that easy all right so let's take one that's a little bit more tricky that has no OSD here's an SPF 3 this has no OSD there's no camera there's no VTEC so how the hell would I power this guy up well very simple if you watch the previous one you knew that we powered it up through the plus and minus here now once we do that this whole rail is actually a 5 volt in the ground now so you want to do is we can't install the VT X so we have to get the camera we put the black wire to the ground and we put the red wire to the plus down here on any of these it doesn't matter these are like all connected like this just don't bridge them up and down so you could put them right there now we powered up our Campbell we're still left with a yellow wire so what do we do with this yellow wire well what we have to do is we take that yellow wire and we take this yellow wire and we put them together I'll solder them together put a heat shrink and you're good to go now we need to power this guy how would we do that well I highly recommend what you do is you take the black wire you put it with the ground here and this one you go ahead and put it to your PDB so where is the PDB here all right so you go to your PDB and then you could find something called VCC which means battery voltage or you could put it on the plus right there where your battery is coming in and that would give it power so the ground would be here so the black wire for the v-tex would be on the ground here the red wire would be on VCC or the plus of the battery and the video the two yellow wires of the VTX and the camera would be connected together these two would be together soldered together and a little heat shrink and that's it however now you don't have an on screen display so it's very simple and now let's just just quickly take a look at another flight control so here's a really nice good flight control this is an all-in-one flight controller which means it doesn't need a PDB and it's already built in and it's a very good one I've used it and it's just awesome so let's go ahead and take a look here so this one's a little bit tricky kind of because it's very very very tiny alright so here we have vo which means this would be video out and in VI which means video in it's right there now it did the CVI this is it video in vio video out right here so what happens here so if you wanted to connect our camera to this board for example there's a 5 volt so we would give the camera 5 volt here there's a VI video in we put the yellow wire here and then there's a G we put the black wire here that's the ground now this one is very nice because this is pretty cool here so like I mentioned before the red wire from the other flight controller we had to take it all the way from here however here they have a B+ you know but if you're afraid you don't know what a B+ is did you know you don't have to put the red wire here this means the battery voltage plus and you can check the specifications if you're afraid and you don't know what the hell this is don't worry just go put your positive right there for your VTX and you're good to go now vo is the video this would be the yellow wire to your v TX and then ground always ground it next to your camera this this um reduces the chances of problems in your video feed so you could even wrap them together and then solder them in one place the VTX ground and the camera ground so it's very simple so here's video out and video in so like I said the cameras yellow wire would go to video in go through the OSD chip and pop out to the video out which goes to your VT X which is right here right there and it transmits down to your goggles because this has an OSD so it's very simple and very easy that's it there's there's nothing to it you know cam VT X or VI vo and just put power and you're good to go it should be that simple there's nothing else and if you guys have any questions just feel free to let me know and that's gonna conclude it for this video guys I really hope you guys enjoyed it and if you guys have any questions or any suggestions feel free to let me know and please consider joining my patreon it really supports the channel I'm doing awesome giveaways from patreon I'm designing a new frame also giving that to the to the patreon some of the patrons and yeah it'll do great for the channel you could also use the Fila links down below those would greatly support the channel and if you're curious what to get this is a very good VTX I'll leave them I'll leave the recommended parts down in the link below for a budget and some good parts as well that I've tested throughout the channel and throughout the years and yeah that's it guys I really hope you guys enjoyed it and I will see you next time see you guys take her", "MOaAl2ELRcM": "[Music] hey getting closer [Music]", "XKPkK7cVtrU": "[Music] hey guys liam here from primal nomad hope you're doing well back in the nissan navara today actually just going to be doing a few kind of little upgrades not really upgrades just repairs I guess I've been having a little bit of problems with my boost or my turbo so it's been fluctuating a little bit obviously it's about a ten-year-old car now I've done about 72,000 miles so yeah good age but and it's running well in the main part that just going to replace the boost solenoid now so that is a tiny little valve that allows you to or allows the actuator and the vacuum to be correct so that's this little thing here and this is an S and ends a one it basically controls the vacuum go into the turbo I was thinking about replacing that with a Tillich's or a doors valve to manually be able to control the psi on the boost but just at this point this was managed to get this offer off of someone whose car unfortunately got written off and this was brand news I managed to get this for a really good price and it's brand new so I thought I'll replace it with this electronic one and then probably in a few months replace it with a manual and keep this as a spare hopefully that should solve the issue the other thing that I do have is this which is a brand new cold intake right so that goes straight from yet air box this is where the MAF sensor goes straight onto the air box and this goes straight down into the turbo so this is a nice silicon one or heat resistant and I did buy some new Jubilee clips to fit or put the measurements down in the description below so really just a few little things today minor minor little improvements and yeah hopefully that should sort a few things out so I'll just probably set the tripod on the engine and just let you guys watch what I do that the boost control solenoid is actually located at the bottom of the at the bottom of the air box so it's just important that you remember what hose line goes to where so there'll be a vacuum a vacuum out and then there'll be another hose i've actually replaced all of em lines with silicone hose as well previously unfortunately then getting footage of that silly me but still you'll see that when I'm doing it for sure I'm just going to start by undoing this G bleep repair [Music] I should love that come off nicely it'll be another one down here on the clover side and he could reuse his Jubilee clips if I remember correctly these ones are fed onto this they have little hole on the back of the Jubilee clip there's a little rubber prong sticking through so this is one line vacuum line from the boost control from the boost control solenoid which is down here so this is the furthest right the plug is here so I'll show you this quickly [Music] in fact I'll just take these off of here down to this line you keep it in order so we have three vacuum lines here we've got one which is the vacuum this is the vacuum out that goes to the actuator and this there's another vacuum line that goes straight into this cold air intake as if as I said before I've replaced all these with silicon hosing and that was a 4 mil silicon hose so I'm just gonna take that out of the cold intake and I'm gonna keep them in order here so from right to left knowing that this the one with the little speed is on the furthest to the right so I'm actually gonna be replacing this clip because I hate the design they're the worst thing in the world to take off or put on I'm sure there is it well there definitely is a correct tool to use them no I'm gonna replace it with the Jubilee clip so now I've got this detached need to pull this to the side and touch that down here and you can see how this just feeds in here this is just a seizure it's actually solid in there doesn't have a whole top that out of the way or try to brother and then disconnect this pipes I'm just gonna get a rag and just cover that now quickly [Music] that you can see here I'm just wiping the outside not the inside I'm keeping the bag covering over this entrance I'm just wiping the outside so that the new pipe doesn't sit around and this is where that crankcase breather plugs the turbo system in this covering that swim up and pulls in sit down here and see the beautiful solenoid is just there and there the three lines are sending you about on the plug see but back in back out that's the one that goes straight to it yeah called intake that I'm going to be replacing I'm gonna take whip that off now in this place that use equalities new accessible and it's just rubber mount here just clips onto this little clip down here so just feeds through the little slit it here [Music] [Music] [Music] fighting to get this off it's a little tab here you just take a little screwdriver and it pulls up a little metal like that do that something safe [Music] and sighs you can't rough then you can bring your valve up a bit closer and with you with it in your hand for place it straight away so you can see here I now have my new boost control solenoid and it's orientated this way so holding this in my hand I'm gonna like for like take the pipes off straight up just to ensure that they go on the right way and they are the right in the right place sometimes you might just need to use your nail to start sliding it up that goes on that goes on there we can put this old one out of the way now and that old one still was working it wasn't throwing up the fault code it was just the actuator was dropping slightly so I thought let's process of elimination and as I said it is an old solenoid so this can then go onto here in coupon [Music] you see here actually disconnects being a bit broken in the past just realised but not to worry this metal clip here keeps a lot of tension on it isn't able to come out regardless of that bit broke being broken and then this again just gets fed down onto here they can be a little bit awkward getting it on low ah just gonna eat it through the rubber you know ya know that's mounted in place just make sure them black lines nicely push down mr. lemon right order so this is the whole boost control school night and this is the little slitting robber that was telling you about down here at the bottom that feeds onto the clip this way around there's a little mounting plate and you'll see when you take it off it's on today but here is I have my new pipe to go between here and here and obviously this feeds into here should live at wikiquote type it goes right to their perfect my hose line you can just see here just popped out so it's manhandling like those just straight on to the actuator here just to get make sure it hasn't pulled out okay loose control solenoid so now I know that fits in take that out and again just push that to one side was definitely job in here holy swinging hey there else let's cut away I'll move this badness I'm going to do is gonna make it easy for myself and I've put the Jubilee fit this way around that's nice you on this bend in fact what it might be just loosen this airbox to the side I'm just gonna put the air filter back on top sure that nothing gets in there just allows me to work in here work this all the way down to the bottom where it should sit just make sure that's in the right place [Music] [Applause] you see size difference you did find a bit adjustment there's actually a tiny bit of plastic just here on the side of the ms filter inside the DMF sensor that's just pushing up against this silicon here for what I might do it's quickly just chop that off this air pipe just to allow that to sit right here other than that sitting well in there so down all the way around you see how there's just on the side here the MAF stem stuff and this is Department it's just a tiny bit of plastic pushing and just causing that to bulge up there that's just the tiny little bit of plastic so if I cut that off of this bit of the pipe then that will sit flush up to it may be good at the moment where's house that's on them straight down to the turbo there [Music] see this is the forefront industry my point I've put on some new hose clamps here these are actually exhaust clamps because it was lifting a little bit at this end so I recommended that there's about sixty seven millimeters and I've also put silicone hose and over here we'll be able to get dirty and she's made by MK performance housing which is a local company [Music] [Music] [Music] just give it a good turn since it's in nicely substance flushed down here and there's no gaps that has pushed nicely down the point on the turbo that's meant to meet it I just have to trim a tiny bit off because it was touching the crankcase breather there so the end does look a little bit untidy but I singed off all the fibers and did it with a fine saw so it's not rough it's just on a bit of a slob meets up well all the way around see just how oily it is around the crank crank case breather nice and tight as income enough so now we can reconnect this just make sure there's no blockages and this can go straight into your vent here oh yeah slop there this get pushed straight on to there in fact make you see that this crosses over nicely there nose that to be clipped on to there or you could leave it back the thing that's stopping me is I've got this protective heat shrink on it with this heat wrap so as a matter of fact what I'll do is I'll just take it sir I'll take this heat wrap off and I'll put it on the other way around so that the longer section down at the bottom with a steeper curve [Music] so that can go down to here where it's nearer the turbo and the hot pipes and up at this section on and then that you need Turkey onto this has a little bit better rates the other thing I will do is double check the police were once thought of this week who doesn't want to move anywhere this what it's not lifting the airbox up in any places and then I tighten this one up so now I've got this all in place of course I realize that I can put the clip on there which isn't too much of a problem just take it off really this is under vacuum so the tips are any of them precautionary it's precautionary really [Music] alright so now that's all tightened up again check all my lines to the boost solenoids make sure they're all running okay all rather than not run running okay but make sure that they are all plugged in correctly just decided that I'm actually gonna just use this heat shield probably not use this heat shield I probably weren't happy connected to that bit there I just have that running in fact we use it here where it's gonna be near this hot pipe it's a great well that's that all connected now some only boost control solenoid in everything close clamped up nice and tightly let's now give the engine a bit of a run just to make sure it's all driving properly and our turn on the obd2 and chatters and no fault codes so there we have a guys that's how to fit a new boost control solenoid and cold intake pipe to the nissan navara as far as I can see through the obd2 scanner there's no fault codes being thrown so it looks like everything's fine the turbo actuator is you know being held up by the vacuum and you know moving correctly so thanks for watching and if you want me to cover anything else feel free to drop a comment in the comments below and yeah thanks ever so much for watching take care [Music] you", "1BqU7ZAnLjQ": "hey everybody this is ty here Tekin and today I'm going to show you how to set up the third channel drag brake adjustment that is available with the brand new 272 firmware we just released for Tekin brushless esc s now this feature is very cool and allows you to adjust the drag brake strength on your radio via a spare Channel and a three-position switch so I'm gonna show you how to set that up right now first thing we need is our hot wire adapter cable which is part number th513 brushless esc s for connection to the Hotwire 2.0 through the data port now we're gonna use this adapter cable as our third Channel comm cable between the RS Pro black Edition and our receiver so right now I have a hot wire plugged into the car which is for on-board tuning and can be installed and left in the car but since we want to just adjust the drag break I'm gonna go ahead and unplug this hot wire we're gonna take our cable we're gonna see black red white is labeled so black is to the outside I'm gonna go ahead and plug that in right there and then we're gonna plug in the other side to our receiver and now we have our third channel column cable connected from the RS Pro over here to the auxiliary Channel a spare channel on our receiver that's the easy part done now the next part involves programming your actual transmitter okay so I've got a spectrum DX 5c that I'm gonna go ahead and set up the third channel so we're gonna go into auxilary assignment auxilary 1 which is the channel that our third channel plug is plugged into on the receiver right now it's set to inhibit so we're gonna go ahead and turn it on and this is where you can pick which switch you want this adjustable on now I'm gonna go ahead and assign it to the D switch right here so it's nice and reachable while I'm staring so we've set it to D it is already set to 3 position we don't want cyclic because that will mean that every time you click up it's gonna go around in a circle and end up going back to down back to neutral up/down neutral up so we don't want that momentary is already active so this is already set up and ready to go ok so we've got the RS Pro ez data port plugged into the auxiliary channel on our receiver we've got our radio set up with switch D as a three position momentary right now I have no drag break so you can see it's nice and free rolling now if I start clicking up that's five steps I've got dragged break now go five more full drag brake has engaged and you can go back the other way to none now you can set this up on a dial type switch or a three position non momentary switch now the only thing that you'll have to do with a non momentary switch is the ESC has to C of neutral signal and then a full signal and then back to neutral either direction to change the drag break up and down so if you have a non momentary switch you'd have to click up one time then back to neutral and that would be one adjustment in one direction and then to go the other way you'd have to click the opposite direction and then back to neutral so you kind of have to tik-tok your way up the ladder in order to get it to adjust the drag break if you want to set it up on a dial type switch it's the same thing you set the dial so that it's at Center which is neutral and then you'd have to turn it all the way clockwise and then all the way back to Center in order to adjust one step in the drag break now the drag break is adjustable in ten steps before you even start messing with their channel you should set your drag breaks to where you normally like them in the car and then whatever that setting is is going to be the default every time you turn the ESC on so say you set it at thirty for drag break well if you click up one time on your radio it's gonna go to 40 and then 50 and then 60 70 and so on drag brake adjustments on the fly are awesome for rock crawlers and you for racers as well like this axial bomber I have sitting in front of me right now we've all been cruising down the trail we've got our drag brake cranked because it's rock krawler we want the thing to stop when we're on a steep incline and if you let off throttle full drag brake kicks in and it stands up on the front bumper now you have the luxury of adjusting that whenever you want however you want via your radio you can turn the drag brake down for high-speed sections or if you're rock racing and don't want as much as you're traditionally crawling or you can crank it up for those real technical sections so that's pretty much it for setting up our third Channel all we need is our adapter wire right here to go from the easy data port on the TKTS C to an available channel on your receiver and the right kind of switch in your radio go ahead and like share and subscribe for more Tekin content on ty campbell I'll see you next time [Music]", "9N2kENewrvc": "[Music] a very good morning how are you doing wednesday is here with us again wednesday night clinic financial clinic clinic clinic tonight bishops james akuma is my name so glad you could take the time to hook up with me today question is what's your relationship with money everybody has a relationship with money but what kind of a relationship do you have with money one of the things many of us don't realize is that we have a money personality we have a particular mindset we have towards money and it determines our relationship with money interesting i was asking people earlier on on my radio show what's the first thought that comes to mind when you hear the word money and the sms's are very interesting phyllis nongo all the way from saudi arabia for her she says the first when she has money first thought is my children she thinks about her children it is two people texted it and said the first thought that comes to mind when they hear the word money is it's never enough of somebody else who's texted in today and they say when they hear money the first thought is money is the the love of money is the root of all evil moses in qatar uh says when he hears the word money first thing that comes to mind is budget for me when i hear the word money the first thing that comes to mind is freedom money mindset you know growing up i i i keep sharing this story uh when i talk about money growing up you know uh when i was in high school going into college uh my dad had uh left his job and so he had relocated back to uh geshagi so my mom was raising us up they were coordinating in between and i remember one of the things my mom loved saying whenever you would ask my mom for money and my mom is watching see how you have affected my thought processes where money is concerned my mother my mom would always first thing she would say whenever you would ask her for money she would say she would say should i have it even if she was played that day and you asked her for something her first thought was i don't have it i don't have it hakuna pizza even if she would give you later her first reaction would be akuna pesa you know and i kind of picked that from her and i remember one time we were in the supermarket you know when my first born was still a young boy and he asked for something and i shouted hapuna pesa and i thought oh my goodness that is not me speaking that is my mother speaking through me and that's the time i began to understand processes about money mindsets about money what are your thoughts towards money what have you believed about money because those things affect how you relate to money that's what we're going to be talking about today of an amazing guest i will be introducing her to you in the next short while question still goes out to you those on radio have been answering if you're joining us on tv tell me when you hear the word money what is the first thought that comes to your mind share that with me on 20316 sms whatsapp zero seven eight six three sixteen three sixteen it is mambo na clinic financial clinic today we're talking about money mindsets and how to develop the right money mindset i'm asking you the question what's the first thought that comes to mind when you hear the word money maureen in kisumu you say when you hear money you think of shopping i like that one i like that one i have more messages coming in ruth you say my father inducted in me to think money pango hence budget don't touch it until you have a plan for it i think that's a good thought lynette in nairobi for you you say when you hear money a smile comes on your face you think of happiness and stability okay that's good that's good that's good this morning i have an amazing guest for us today as we discuss many mindsets uh joining us via zoom uh we have nungari mugi irenge nungari is a mentor and uh she is excited to be here today how are you doing i'm doing well thank you karimusana you hear the different things people are thinking about when they hear money some are thinking shopping some are thinking budgeting they just think of their children they hear money and they think children that is very interesting i'm listening to them and i really like that from the shopper yes she seems to be my favorite one [Laughter] oh my goodness so when we talk about money mindsets what what are we talking about really we're talking about how people think about money what you know what the attitude towards finances really is what we're talking about and so most people really they're just two mindsets there's the negative and the positive it just falls into different you know it has different um manifestations but really it's either you have a positive mindset towards money or a negative mindset towards money but how it shows up in your life is different okay so i i would say like the lady who's the shopper yeah her mindset is the yellow mindset you know you only live once today we eat and drink for tomorrow we die you see those people all the time yes yes saving and investing is not in the plan you know once they get money they want to enjoy it they want to go on holiday that's when they call out the girls and the boys and they're having a good old time but at the end of the day they are also very stressed because when they actually need money or if they go through a job loss or something like that yeah they find that they have nothing you know they lived for today and that was the end of that so that yellow mindset it's you know it's good for the moment because you're having fun but beyond that it's not good for you at all it's actually a negative money mindset wow very interesting i'm just wondering where do these mindsets come from are we born with them or do they develop over time no when we're born we're just a blank slate we're just a blank slate and life gets to right on the slate you know and sometimes we learn based on what we saw our parents doing if your parents were extremely frugal yes they said everything you might go their way or you might rebel against their way and become a yellow type of person because you saw how how that affected you in a negative way so mainly it's the experiences of life that teach us how to think through things yes um or how we saw other people doing things and we choose to either go the same way or to go a different way ah so as a parent i need to be aware that my relationship with money and my conversations around money and my spending habits are affecting the kind of relationship my children will have with money you're writing on the blank slate and you're the first person that ever writes on that slate as a parent okay so whatever you're doing with money what you're demonstrating about money what you're saying about money what you're teaching about money in your home and sometimes we teach without really saying anything you're communicating either way and your children are picking up out of that and unfortunately in most of you know the african society uh we're very secretive about our money about our finances oh yeah yeah so the dad doesn't really get to say what's going on he never demonstrates how to budget he never demonstrates how to save he's just doing his own thing in secret and so the children never really learn how to deal with money they kind of just develop their own lifestyle and their own way of doing it yes and that can be dangerous you know you say that and and i'm thinking you know even our parents never really showed us how they made their money let alone telling us how much they make you know they never showed us this is how uh i make money this is how i'm able to pay my bills yes you know your dad woke up in the morning he went to work i remember my father was a government worker yeah he retired at the age of 55 earning 8 000 kenya shillings what but he but yes but he was he had built houses he had built rental units how did he how did 8 000 build rents or units it doesn't make any sense but i have no clue what he did and that is what we do most of us do so your children are seeing a manifestation but they have no idea how it came about yeah yeah and we need to become more deliberate in teaching our children how to handle money wow you know you say that i'm i'm also reminded of something that was quite common with with our parents generation that would communicate to ask their children that this is my money you go and make your own you know and they would not tell us how they made their money how they manage their money they would just say and i'm thinking if i don't get a job does it mean i can't get money you know right yeah in fact we were raised with the idea that the education would lead you to a good job yes that would then lead you to finances but the current reality does not even yambatani there's nothing about that that is making sense we have too many graduates out here they have good degrees good papers yeah and no jobs very true and so what is important now is wisdom what the world would call strict smarts but we call it wisdom because god can give you wisdom for the marketplace and that is what we need to tap into more than really our education education is good it's excellent i'm planning to educate my children to the highest level that they will go yeah but really if they can tap into the wisdom of god for the marketplace they will do better very true how yeah how important is it for me as an individual to know the kind of money mindset i have because i figure a lot of people don't even think about it they don't even know so how important is it to know your money mindset is everything it really is everything you know romans 12 2 tells us that we need to be transformed by the renewing of our minds and unless you renew your mind you will keep doing the same things that you are doing you will keep going the same way that you are going you will keep getting the same results that you are getting so you have to renew your mind and as a believer i think the best way to renew your mind is to read your bible because the bible is rich with wisdom from god on how to survive how to thrive in the marketplace and also so that you can know your relationship with god and how that plugs you into heavenly health for the economic you know for what you do out there so you don't need to do business on your own you have help from heaven god will help you but if you don't think that way if you're always thinking it's got to be me it's me and the grind i wake up running i'm off to hustle i'm off it's a struggle already you're in a negative place mentally you're in a negative place so why not first get into a positive place where you know i am helped god will help me he has promised that he will give me wealth he will prosper me he will make me successful and then go out to that oomph coming from heaven and that gives you a more positive attitude towards money and once you learn how to relate positively with money because money shouldn't control you you should control money yeah yeah people care areas i cannot allow them to sleep in the same house with one thousand children [Laughter] and you are there one of you must take people [Laughter] i know such people i know such people you know you know yesterday i was having a conversation with a friend of mine on just the whole subject of money there's something you've said that has triggered that thought you know god has said he will bless us and all that and he was saying party sometimes me i i wonder you know because god has promised us this but it seems like those who are not born again are the ones who are prospering you know those who don't know god those who are not serving him are the ones who have the money they are the ones who have all these things and as believers we are just here you know life is just hard did god lie to us what's the problem you know it's like he's been waiting for god to i don't know whether he was waiting for god to drop down like a safe full of money from heaven good dish you know there you go my son have merry and enjoy where's the disconnect you know that that is a common a common thing that i hear all the time and i have come to understand that most of the people who are struggling with this issue really they do not have an understanding of what the word of god says oh they do not understand that they have a covenant with god that god will prosper them that not only does he want to prosper he wants to give you a surplus of prosperity yes and then they do not understand that there is a way you do things in the kingdom of god you say we get saved we are in the world not of the world but we want to continue in the world as if we are in the world can you imagine a believer who wants to get a tender through bribing yes and they tell you if it was a black bride so i have to bribe now you are in the kingdom of god the devil is your enemy but you have gone to use the devil system to make money will he prosper you no so you have to use kingdom principles to prosper in the marketplace but most believers do not even know what those principles are unfortunately wow and they are all in the word of god so it is our own ignorance we are ignorant yeah and we are perishing for lack of knowledge and if we only knew once you begin to understand how the kingdom works financially you just most people just begin to thrive and to prosper and they discover it wasn't the way they thought i'm just wondering god doesn't lie yes i'm wondering that that that christian that believer who goes out to bribe to get this tender what kind of mindset would you say they have towards money i think they're in a place where they have no understanding of their relationship with god really that's what it is they may be ambitious they may be diligent in their work they may be go-getters they may be through goal you know they may do they may be doing all the right things but they're getting frustrated because they're trying to use the demonic system to get money and it doesn't work when you're in the kingdom of god you see that will work for those in the kingdom of darkness because it is their it is their system that's how they make money but in the kingdom we don't do it that way so once you try to tap into the devil's thing yes to get success it doesn't work it doesn't work so they need to come into a place where they understand god's way of doing things and once they get that and they line up with god it's easier it becomes easier god opens those for you you see the bible says in isaiah 45 i will go before you i will break down those gates of iron i will cast asunder the bars that keep you bad outside i will open the gates for you that i may give to you the secret treasures in hidden places that is wealth but you have to be helped by god if you are doing it in your own effort i have to bribe i have to know somebody i have to work my networks i have to do this i have to do that you're using the other side it doesn't really work he did it to move his agenda forward okay shortly we'll talk about then what is the right money mindset you know as we look at the according to the word of god and how do we develop into that kind of a mindset i'm giving you an opportunity to ask questions this morning 20316 is the sms line and the whatsapp number zero seven eight six three sixteen three sixteen we're talking about the right money mindset whatever lisa massoi you have the opportunity my pastor pastor daniel how are you doing and kenneth o'ma is your driver kenneth um how are you doing thank you for carrying my pastor this morning you guys are tuned in and listening may the lord bless you i'm still getting sms's different people telling me the first thing that comes to mind when they hear money one here says i think of investment tithing and family three things come to mind when this gentleman hears about money and then betty you see first thought that comes when you hear the word money or mosquito hairy oh my goodness keep sending in those sms's today we are hanging out with nungari who's a mentor and she's helping us to gain a deeper understanding of money mindsets and the right mindsets we should have in regards to money so let's go there let's go there what what is the right mindset towards money does the word of god have anything to say about this issue i think the right the right mindset is what i call i would call it a wealthy mindset and a wealthy mindset comes from the word of god because when you read deuteronomy 8 18 you see that it is god who gives us the power to create wealth yes you know he gives it to us and it's a promise and it is something you receive there somewhere you receive salvation by faith you receive wealth by faith and that ability to create wealth by faith this life is by faith without faith we cannot please god yes it's as simple as understanding and believing that god has he has a desire for me to make money and that is and that money is good because there are some people who think money is evil very true you know they must go to the bible instead of saying the love of money which is greed it's greed and avarice where you make money an idol to you that is what is the root of all you it is not money money takes the character of the person who has it if you are a liberal person yeah money will be evil in your hands yeah but if you are a righteous and good person then money will be beneficial in your hand and that is why god wants us to have money because as long as you are in the kingdom of god and you are truly born again in the interests of the father are your interests then in your hands money becomes a good thing so it is having that wealthy mindset i love what you're sharing because i find that for a good number of believers the issue of money is a struggle it's like we want it it's like we want it but we don't want it you know it's like we want it but uh people will start thinking i've joined the illuminati you know all these kinds of things we say you know some of us have believed it is not possible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom you know it is easier for the camel to go through the eye of the needle yeah so that scripture and the one that the one we misquote man is the root of all evil those two scriptures become the guiding point of our lives and so we have we have a brand of christians who believe that uh poverty equals humility and it equals godliness and i'm thinking like how twisted can you get you know when you say that you render the work of christ what he did on calvary powerless because second corinthians 8 9 says that though he was rich for your sake for your sake you who is listening for your sake he became poor and that means he became beggarly he was wealthy and he became beggar so that you through his beggarliness his poverty you might become rich a love word rich that means wealthy it means wealthy money so calvary part of the package of salvation was wealth for the children of god jesus came here left his will became poor for you so that you may become rich once you understand that you stop getting conflicted and i can understand that conflict and it comes from being you know a misinterpretation yeah of those verses you see if money has you remember the story of the rich young man he came to jesus he said i keep all the commandments everything else i have done right jesus said to him go give away everything you have come back and follow me he went away very sad we are told he we didn't see anywhere he came back because manny had his heart yeah it is hard it is very difficult for the rich the ones who who the ones who have given their hearts to money to enter the kingdom of god how will they enter but if you have a right relationship with money and that is key a right relationship with money money will not affect your salvation he will go to heaven just fine father abraham was very rich isaac his son was richard jacob was ridiculous joseph was insane [Laughter] and we will meet them there from one glory to another from one glory to the next in fact they would you see abraham made all his money gave it all to isaac isaac built on it it became even more handed it over to his son jacob got the bulk of it because he got the double inheritance yes he went and built on it then they went to eat it where things just went nuts because while all the egyptians were selling themselves for food joseph was feeding them for free yes they lost nothing and so they were just prospering and growing by the time the famine ended they were the ones who were the mughals in egypt buying up all the food doing all the trade they were so rich pero panicked he said these people are ridiculously rich they're too powerful for us let us do something about this yes so money in the hands of the people of god is a good thing it is part of our covenant he told abraham i will bless you so you can become a blessing and blessing we quote this all the time proverbs 10 22 that the blessing of the lord makes rich and adds no sorrow and adds no sorrow to it you see rich is wealthy that's what it means it doesn't have a hidden meaning it just means wealthy rich pesticide money you know and it adds no sorrow to it sorrow means painful toil so you're not supposed to be toiling painfully for money it shouldn't cost you sorrow it shouldn't cost you mental stress and it shouldn't cause your family to scatter it should be a blessing to you and your people and then you are meant to be a blessing to others with that money now that is the right mindset that we are supposed to be having about finance wow how do i get there how do i get there i think that's the challenge for a lot of believers the word of the lord will renew the mind the word of the lord everything i'm saying is in the word of god unfortunately james and i don't know if you've noticed this believers have a challenge with reading the bible yes that is true they're not they won't read it and so they are class they're ignorant and they're perishing for lack of knowledge if they will only read the word of god with an open heart and an open mind and ask the holy spirit who's supposed to be the teacher they just tell him teach me show me david said show me wonderful things in your law open my eyes to see and once you begin to see you your life is transformed because you get it you understand you begin to receive it and to claim it as a promise from the father you begin to go out with that you know that excitement knowing that god is backing you up you begin to talk to everything jesus would speak to trees he spoke to the fig tree the thing dried up in 24 hours start to talk to your business in the mighty name of jesus you shall prosper i am prospering today this is the day call your clients you know sometimes you have to be a little bit on the insane side okay stand up and call them i call my customers today from the four winds of the air come you will be surprised who will find you on facebook even from iceland or alaska and watch what you are selling so just get radical about it believe god get radical about it and go for it i'm just wondering did you always have the right money mindset or is this something you had to learn and if it's something you had to learn how did it change your life you know i had to learn it obviously i started like everybody else i was a go-getter i was very ambitious you know i went out and i got a really good job and just by the grace of god i learned how to speak the right things and to have the right attitude and to go for what i needed in life and so at the end of in my 20s i was making a six-figure salary a single girl cruising around in a nice car i was a yellow lifer yes that's why i like the shopper i understand that you know i would go on holiday when i wanted that go for a staycation in nevada when i wanted and then i lost my job oh and i had nothing wow and then i had to grow up yes and i had to look in the word of the lord because i would read the word and i would tell god this promise you have said here that you will give me abundant prosperity is a lie i will tell you this is a lie and god would correct me and show me no you are the one who messed it up like this and so i began to grow and i began to learn and i understood that there's a spiritual aspect of money yeah and then there is the financial management i have to be a good steward of money and that is another thing believers do not really want to hear but you must be a good steward wow from the two sides the spiritual aspect of money and the and the stewardship side of money where do you think as believers we are lacking the most in all honesty i think we lack more in the spiritual side okay we really do not have an understanding of our covenant with god we've heard a lot about saving and budgeting we have an idea yeah of saving you know budgeting and what we should do on that end but this at the end we we are not really even conversant what we like in the financial management for most people is not knowledge yeah it is discipline uh-huh okay you see yeah but in the spiritual side we lack knowledge entirely we're just clueless and that is doing us more harm than good wow you know one time i attended this financial class and one of the things that we were told that i've never forgotten maybe you can share a bit on this we were told never be emotional about money yes because the moment you start being emotional around money that is when you begin to mess up money has no emotions towards you have no emotions towards it is that is that is that a good principle that is a very good principle because you see this is that that becomes a question of emotional intelligence around finances oh you see and that is why you notice that the people who have cared a person they can't sleep with a thou in the house yeah that is a lack of emotional just not intelligence in that department and then there's another group of people when they get money they just want you know and they think they're being smart and i see this all the time but somebody keeps saying i want to invest this money you're asking everybody and they're good yeah what do i do with this money i have this money what do i do why not inquire of the lord you see and it takes an emotional intelligence to sit back with a bank account that has a good amount of money not touch that money and simply inquire of the lord what should i do now you know um this thing of instant gratification is a lack of emotional intelligence yes you know we have we have to learn how to delay gratification sit down and delay you know don't let money move you and swing you if you allow it it will it will you will end up doing things you never thought you could and also another thing it is good to be massive and we are called to be given yeah but don't be the kind of guy who gives everybody everything you know you've given your rent money now you have no rent you've now crossed over from faith to foolishness and you didn't know when you crossed yeah it's a thin line sometimes between faith and foolishness so you know don't give everything away some people are controlled by you know family yes your father is one who knows what you're doing with your money when will you grow up mature and handle your own money you know give where you need to give but at the same time handle your responsibilities so some people just need to deal on that emotional intelligence great questions my friend you have like 20 more minutes to ask questions if you have a question for us today we are talking about the right money mindset even as we look forward to this year 2021 you know 2020 was a harsh year financially people lost their jobs people shut down businesses and we are believing 2021 will be a better year but you know if we have a bad mindset towards money blessings may come in 2021 but we will squander them you know like the son who asked for his inheritance account yeah so that's why it's important to have a right money mindset so uh take this opportunity to ask questions 20316 is the sms line what's up number is zero seven eight six three sixteen three sixteen it is the financial clinic today we are talking about the right money mindset your questions coming in via sms on 203 16 what's up on zero seven eight six three sixteen three sixteen nungari is with us in studio via zoom helping us to gain a deeper understanding of uh the right money mindset i have a question here from janet janet says when when when when we talk about money and mindsets she she's always under fear you know there's never enough there's never enough there's never enough and so you know her relationship with money is always based on fear and she's wondering how do i get out of that because the reality on the ground is that actually there's never enough you know it's a struggle every month to just meet the bills how do i get out of that mindset fear to begin with fear is is not a spirit from god the bible says god has not given us a spirit of fear so the moment you start to operate out of fear you're already working with bondage yes you're already in the wrong side the mindset is already off because you and that is why i'm saying you need to renew your mind and that is what she needs to do you must renew your mind so that you know and fully understand that you are helped by god that god will give you you know in when god created man he blessed them the bible says he blessed man he said be fruitful multiply have dominion replenish the earth and subjugate it you see that word replenishment you cannot replenish anything unless you yourself are replenished and usually most people do not understand that you can ask god to replenish your finances yeah when you see your money going down ask god replenish me lord he will we keep telling each other be replenished spiritually be replenished oh may you gain more strength more grace why not ask god replenish me financially yes that part of our it is part of our covenant that god will replenish us you know and then i hear people saying i'm going through a wilderness i don't have i don't have but i will tell you if i'll challenge that thought because in the wilderness god provided for them manner from heaven very true god gave them you know meat came in the wind yes god made sure their clothes never were off you know they had shoes their clothes grew with them so even if you're in a place that place we like to call wilderness yeah in that place specifically god will provide for you in fact things get thicker when you get to the promised land yes because in the promised land they had to tell the land yeah they had to work the land at that point god was blessing the work of their hands but you have to get rid of fear it is a spirit it is horrible it is bondage the bible says fear has comment and what she is describing is being tormented by fear so rebuke it rebuke fear and then put your confidence in god and declare that confidence i know that my god is well able to meet every need for he has said i will supply all of your needs you know put scripture at the devil you know when he preaches to you and tells him and says what the devil preaches to you even you preach why are you keeping your mouth shut when he came to jesus jesus said it is written he was preaching to the devil very true even you preach back i do not have a spirit of fear i refuse to fear my god shall supply all of my needs rojo jew you know when you keep walking this life and enjoy it god shall replenish you wow i have another one here from lily lily says thank you so much for the great show my question is i'm a very good saver and a poor investor meaning i have money because i don't misuse it but it doesn't help me much since i don't invest it anywhere please advise that is also the bondage of fear ah you see because this one is not afraid of losing the money so they keep it under lock and key it is a whole different thing but it comes off of the same route yes so what i would advise you is first of all educate yourself you know when you're more knowledgeable about investment you are able to take the risk but as long as you do you have no knowledge where can i invest or what can i do what are the returns then at that point you become so fearful you just want to keep your money saved because you know you don't want to lose it and really who wants to work and then lose the principle you don't want to do that you want it to make more money for you so number one i would ask you again come again as the spirit of fear because that is what that is and then begin to educate yourself the learning never stops and these days we have the internet go on google figure it out join different investment groups online see what people are investing in begin to invest in your own knowledge once you have understanding and of course seek god for where to put your money then as you do that you will have the confidence to step out until then the fear will keep controlling you and that is not right wow in fact several people are actually identifying with the whole aspect of fear you know we have uh ruth muander says yes indeed fear is a liar this year i'm changing my money mindset and then i have another one here uh from fanwell farmville says i do appreciate the financial clinic today i've struggled with fee as well when it comes to money matters now i know what to do a lot of people are held back with fear you know you don't want to lose you're thinking i i don't want to lose that you know and you have this group of people who you know you always feel confident and safe if you have got money with you you don't use it you go to confuco i might go to your mattress you are good or those people go to the atm just to check the balance like five times a day thank you very much what would you do you know i used to be that person oh really oh my goodness i love looking at my bank balance oh to look you know yes and then when i saw how the money is piling up my heart would just be okay but you know what now this is somebody who has made money their crotch really their confidence is no longer in god it's not the confidence now has shifted it is in the money okay and that is a dangerous place to be because what god will do because he would rather have you poor than lose you rich yes he will just come and pull the rug out from under you you will lose that money so that you can turn back and see god so what i would advise that person today today defense just repent because you have made malia idol it is your crutch that is where your help comes from and remember that is something that should only be given to god it is only god you know the bible says he's our strong tower we run to him and we are safe but you you have made money you are strong tower you are running to it and you are safe when you see it there you feel confident the future is bright the future is bright because of god not because you have money in the past even if you have no money in the bank if you have god your future remains bright so that person needs to change and stop making money they are good god someone says please talk to us about the scarcity mentality oh my that i think that is the worst because this is a person who it you know a lot scarcity mentality it goes also with these people who think they are cast they always cast oh yes you know where the life is against me the world is against me god must have every children because me i never have that is the worst place you can be you see and that is an identity issue the bible talks to us about the children of the king if you read the bible in the story of the kings and maybe the greatest one king david you will realize that david his children would eat at the table of the king yeah no yeah he would he would that is where his children would eat and if if ever you you would also eat at the table of the king so your provisions were totally provided for all the time and that is what we must understand that we are the sons of god if you are born again you have become a son of god you eat at the table of the king how was it you eat at the table of the king so stop thinking that you know resources are scarce finances are scarce opportunities are scarce yeah everything is cast so you your work is to wake up every day chasing after opportunities you don't even have time to pray you're always running take a breather check your theology your dog dreams yes what do you understand about your relationship with god where money is concerned once you understand that god is the giver that you feast at his table on a daily you know it's a daily thing then like jesus said you will ask give me my daily bread just if today i'm fed i'm good because you know god has your tomorrow and god is interesting because life is in times and seasons yeah there are seasons where you don't have and the seasons you have even paul says he went through seasons of need yes and seasons of plenty his secret was that he learned to be content in whichever season he was in and you have to be content you have to get to the place where you say i'm in a season of luck it will not last this is a temporary place it will be forever yes see the bible families never came to last forever apparently would come because that is that is what a family represents economic scarcity so a famine would come it will come for a few years and go then plenty would return so scarcity is always a temporary thing anytime you go through a difficult financial time yeah remind yourself this is a passing cloud it will pass you know hungary i'm thinking that this scarcity mindset is is something that a lot of us in africa uh have to deal with you know i think i don't know whether it was planted in us we we always feel like we don't have enough and we have to depend on the west to come and save us you know that is why you find our leaders you know stealing money and stashing it away in banks overseas and you're wondering for what you know i mean i i i had the opportunity i've had the opportunity to travel to egypt and to travel to israel when we do our israel via egypt trip and one of the things that amazes me is what the people in israel do with their land their land is desert as in desert as we are blessed with land i don't know that can grow what but we still think we don't have enough we don't have enough sirikali's idea you know what what to say dear china's idea and i think it's something that is so deeply ingrained in us as africans we forget that africa is the richest continent on the globe yeah we have the most resources we have got brilliant minds we have got the best land in the world but mindset has we are slaves you know we we also have the most youthful population across the globe yes and just the fact that we have a youthful population means we have people to do to labor yes you know and to have success and and really what what comes up with that it's like a land helplessness i don't know where this came from it's like a land helplessness and and perhaps because um if you look through history the black man has always been oppressed for the skin color yeah but you see we have to break away from these chakras we have to break away and it's more mental than physical you have to break away from this idea that you're just poor you're just beggarly unless somebody comes to help you you cannot be held very true no god is your health look up i always say look up tell god you know jeremiah 17 says this it says blessed is the man who puts his trust in god yes that one will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water it will always be green vibrant you know bearing fruit cast is the man who leans on man who looks to man for help it says that man and this really scares me because it says that man he will not see good even when it comes wow yeah so good will come but he wouldn't but because he's looking to man he will not see it wow so why not change your mentality and you know what we cannot continue blaming our parents forever yeah we you know i come from the ghetto i've always been poor this is how we've always been or whatever no we have to get to a place as adults when you grow up yeah that you have now to come to a place where you decide i have to take responsibility for my growth in the financial area i have to take responsibility yes so you take yourself to god sit down have a come quincy the two of you you say jehovah god you have to help me you are my help i have no one else yeah if you do not lift me up there's nobody coming to save me you are my savior so save me now give me wisdom and understanding show me what to do i am here i am strong all i have is my ability my health nicotine maybe you don't even have an education or whatever those things do not make a man i'm telling you life has a way of equalizing all of us yes we have educated people who are in poverty and we are people who never went to school doing so well ask god for wisdom ask god for wisdom for the marketplace he will take you through and you will rise because of god wow there's one more type of person i want us to talk talk about uh in about two minutes because we are out of time there's this group of people niwa choyo bakar najinima you know as in you have got you have got a good chunk of change in the bank like in here walking around with a torn shirt you know your shoes your shoes are in another angle the people wonder how are you able to walk in those shoes yeah you you don't even do anything for yourself you're always saving i don't know you're saving for what ever talk to us about this group of people that is a is a terrible mindset and it goes beyond just being frugal you know being frugal is where you are not wasteful yes and actually the word prodigal son means wasteful sun i always thought it meant the bad sun it means the waste fusa so when you're frugal you are not wasteful but when you have extreme frugality now you become a maester where you even in your house you just barely making it you know your children if they have uniform it is good usually when you have money you can afford it that is bondage yes the bible says when you have wealth in ecclesiastes to have wealth and the good health to enjoy it is a gift from god now you instead of enjoying what god has given you you're refusing to enjoy yeah we would rather live like somebody who's utterly poverty that is bad bondage your mind you are bound you need to shake off that it's called what are you break that joke shake it off from your neck and say this one i will not deal with it anymore from today i am being prosperous i'm working prosperous i am being blessed and that is how i'm going to do it and listen some things you have to take the step of faith hand me down second hand you know and you're thinking see you've got money in the bank county what is that money for anyway dungaree i'm out of time but i feel like we should just continue with this discussion maybe we'll pick it up again on another day thank you so much for being a part of the financial clinic today what's your parting shot thank you james thank you so much for having me parting is simply get to know what the bible says about money if you are a believer god has promised you wealth and he has a way for you to get it and learn from the word of god i'm sending everybody back to the word of god with the holy ghost as your teacher learn from the best i love that i love that that's all the time we have today and you know from what nungari has said i remember reading a book this gentleman had written a book i can't remember the name of the book but basically his business failed he was at a place where you know you are down to nothing and he cried out just the way nungar is telling us he went to god and he told god if you don't save me if you don't help me i have no one else to go to and god began to teach him from the book of proverbs god took him to the book of proverbs and boy did that man's life change his business was transformed totally and he goes around teaching people how to do business from the book of proverbs the bible has a lot to say about money let's not be afraid for of money it is a tool we need to be able to fulfill the things god has called us to fulfill for this and more

based on the yield so if the point has a higher yield it costs us less Ingrosso cosmos for you and then there's three major three types of marijuana we got sativas and because in hybrid and almost everything nowadays is the highest so this Colombian gold is actually a land race it's a really nice sativa really great smell good but structure to it and then on the other in here Larry oh you which is really frosty different broad structure to it really nice indica and we like the high on that one and then death start here since he starts our diesel it's a really good high rate I like that one so tell me but some of the edibles and the concentrates too so the enemies the edibles are broken down into milligrams so rather than an overall weight like the marijuana these are based off of the milligrams of the infused process so in some of these products there's 100 milligrams and these products we hear there's 80 milligrams on this one the recommended dose is $10 - this is 100 milligrams both pieces such twice 100 divided by 12 and that's how many is in you square the biggest thing is if you never mind it take ten milligrams and give it at least now I want to have two hours or to make sure you're not gonna have too much have a really bad time you eat too many edibles then do you guys accept credit card no we do not accept all these prizes Oh righto where the grass is greener the

marijuana card and converted it into a clinical professional experience hi I'm Dustin Klein my wife Andrea and I own and operate Sun Valley MMJ certification clinics in Arizona and Nevada and this is our headquarters here in Phoenix Arizona and I'd like to give you a walkthrough so in order to become a patient in the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program your first step is to obtain medical records that are less than twelve months old that document that you have one of the thirteen qualifying conditions that allow you to get a card in Arizona here at Sun Valley if you happen to be a patient that is experiencing chronic or severe pain we can actually help assist you with that process even without records so whether you have your records or whether you need records updated for a pain issue Sun Valley can help you year after year with each station you learn something new at check-in you're gonna learn about the qualifying conditions in the process and what you're about to do with either physician you're going to be able to discuss your conditions and be offered alternative treatments like stretching and working out and maybe seeing other physicians and referrals along with discussion on medical marijuana the process of getting certified in checkout you're going to share a screen with a specialist who is going to access the Arizona Medical Marijuana application process online and you and the specialists are going to go line by line on the application process from top to bottom ensuring that your application is perfect and submitting it immediately in front of you ensuring that you get your card as soon as you possibly can we have a process for every aspect of the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program that Awards patients a thorough examination time with the doctor at Sun Valley we have three convenient locations here at our headquarters on 43rd Avenue and Dunlap we're open 10:00 to 6:00 Monday through Saturday our North Phoenix location conveniently located across the hospital off 40th Street and Bell is open 10:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday and our surprise Sun City location located off RH Johnson and Bell is open 9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday we honor appointments first but we do accept walk-ins as we have space available in three years we're currently certifying almost 18,000 patients here in Arizona that makes up for over 17% of the current medical population here in the state our clinics are not just a little marijuana's people come here to be treated like a patient we do not take insurance at this time we accept cash and credit card add all of our locations what we can ensure patients is that 7 to 10 business days from leaving the office here they are going to receive their card and a plain white with street envelope from the department hi my name is Martha I go by Marty I've lived in Arizona a little over a year now I came from Oklahoma when I got here I had been having a lot of back pain and I had got a referral from actually one of my kids teachers funny thing about medical marijuana shoes is it for pain and it was helping her a lot so they referred me to Sun Valley so I mean at first I didn't know if I wanted to do it I was kind of nervous about it you know I'm a housewife I'm a mom and the PTA you know something like medical marijuana you know it has a bad rap so I came in totally totally different than what I thought I mean they're very nice professional treated me well with real doctors so ariana is six years old today she is one year five months eighteen days seizure free she suffers from a brain disease what's called tuberous sclerosis TSC and she also battles with autism she's on the spectrum just being on regular pharmaceutical antiepileptic medications she was having seizures anywhere from about 15 to 20 to 50 every day and until we were able to get her on cannabis oil and really make a dramatic instantaneous difference in her everyday life it was definitely a nightmare we ended up finding the great people over at Sun Valley evaluation clinic it was night and day compared to any other clinic that I had that I had tried to walk into the easiest way to get in contact with us is to

your medical card 29 glorious states and the District of Columbia now have laws that broadly legalized cannabis in some form but the majority of the states still require would be legal smokers to receive medical marijuana recommendations from a licensed physician before entering those golding dispensary gates if you're having visions of your 80 year old family doctor freaking out when you asked him about toking up don't fret just yet getting your med card doesn't have to be a headache here are the fastest and easiest ways you can get a license to light up first let's check out the old-school way the traditional way that we'd patients can get an MMJ card is by visiting a 420 doctor in person if you choose to go the IRL route there are many downsides if you live in an area where medical MJ doctors are hard to come by you could face long wait times rushed consultations sketchy locales and ridiculous fees also note that in many states getting a local weed card allows anyone including potential employers to search databases of ID's to find out if you use cannabis so not exactly fitting if you enjoy a little thing called privacy so now you may be thinking to yourself there's got to be a better way well there is it's a hundred percent legit and it's right on the internet in the last few years there's been an influx of online services that will screen individuals for cannabis use by connecting doctors with patients using video chat sites and apps like hello MD ease MD and nug MD have physicians available to discuss how marijuana can benefit your health and get you smoking sometimes as soon as that same day typically users are asked to submit basic information such as their address state ID and relevant medical history before being connected to a doctor via chat or video call after completing the online visit patients will receive a digital copy of their letter of recommendation which they can use to order weed as a treatment for their medical condition or ailment a couple days later clients receive hard copies of their letters in the mail which are valid for one year the best part the pricing is completely affordable usually ranging from about forty to sixty dollars depending on shipping and other options you might choose and if you already have your medical card but it's time for a renewal these services have you covered for that as well so if you have 10 minutes to spare and want to drastically improve your health and life with the joys of cannabis join the 1.5 million people currently boasting their weed card you don't even have to leave your house to do it [Music]", "UJoEzTFdJvQ": "IS LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE, WHERE AT LEAST ONE BUSINESS IS HOPING TO GET SOME GREEN BY CATERING TO HOME GROWERS. >> BUSINESS HAS BEEN BOMBING. >> PEOPLE ARE

THEY'LL CERTAINLY LOOK AT THE  CRASH.  THEY'LL LOOK IF THE HELICOPTER  WAS IN GOOD WORKING SHAPE.  CERTAINLY THE WEATHER  CONDITIONS WILL BE SOMETHING  THEY LOOK AT WHEN THEY START TO  LOOK INTO THIS ACCIDENT.  RIGHT NOW, IN THE EARLY STAGES  OF THIS, IT WILL BE MORE ABOUT  A BRUSH FIRE THAT KICKED OFF  AROUND THIS CRASH SCENE.  GETTING THAT TAKEN CARE OF.  SECURING THE SCENE.  THE FAA AND N.T.S.B.  WILL HAVE INVESTIGATORS THAT  MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE SCENE.  THEY'LL TRY TO PIECE TOGETHER  WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FINAL  MOMENTS OF THIS FLIGHT.  THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THE  PILOT'S HISTORY.

GENERALLY SPEAKING, HAS A SOLID  SAFETY RECORD.  WITH THAT SAID, CLEARLY  SOMETHING WENT WRONG THIS  MORNING.  THAT WILL BE WHAT THE  INVESTIGATORS, N.T.S.B.  AND FAA WILL LOOK AT HERE.  I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET A LOT  OF QUICK ANSWERS AS TO WHAT  BROUGHT THE HELICOPTER DOWN AT  THAT PRESS CONFERENCE IN A FEW  HOURS.  THOSE FACTS TEND TO TAKE A  LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO WORK OUT.  YOU HAVE TO PIECE TOGETHER  EVERYTHING YOU CAN FROM AIR  TRAFFIC CONTROL AUDIO, FROM  WHATEVER COMMUNICATIONS THAT  MAY HAVE COME FROM THE  HELICOPTER AND CRASH SCENE AS  WELL AS LOOK INTO THE HISTORY  OF THE PILOT.  SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT  WENT WRONG.  THIS WAS A GOOD HELICOPTER.  >> I'M WONDERING, GIVEN THE  HIGH PROFILE NATURE NOW OF THIS  CRASH, IS THERE ANY KIND  POSSIBILITY THAT WE MIGHT GET  INFORMATION, PERHAPS, A LITTLE  SOONER?

THEY CAN THEN USE IT TO HELP  PAINT A CLEARER PICTURE.  WE KNOW FROM PAST  INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE  N.T.S.B.  PROCESS IS VERY THOROUGH.  IT TAKES TIME.  IT MAY BE A YEAR BEFORE THERE  IS A FINAL REPORT ON THIS  CRASH.  OFTEN DETAILS OR A PICTURE OF  WHAT HAPPENED BECOMES CLEAR IN  THE COMING DAYS.  THIS EARLY AFTER A CRASH FROM  THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION  SAFETY BOARD AND FAA  STANDPOINT, EVERYTHING WILL BE  ON THE TABLE.  YOU START REMOVING POSSIBILITIES AS YOU GO.  THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY THE  HELICOPTER WENT DOWN THE WAY IT  DID.  THEY'LL START WITH EVERY  SCENARIO AND SEND THE LIST  UNTIL THEY GET INTO OR GET A  BETTER SENSE AS TO WHAT  HAPPENED ON THIS HELICOPTER ON  THIS DAY.

HE IS AN NBA LEGEND AT 42 YEARS  OLD.  HE FEELS LIKE HE WAS AN ACTIVE  PART OF THE BASKETBALL  COMMUNITY AND NOW HE IS GONE.  >> Reporter: HE PLAYS ALL 20  SEASONS WITH THE LOS ANGELES  LAKERS.  HE WON FIVE TITLES.  L.A.  LOVES THEIR CHAMPIONS.  THEY LOVE THE LOYALTY FACTOR.  FOR HIM, A LOT OF MODERN  BASKETBALL PLAYERS HOP FROM  TEAM TO TEAM.  WE HAVE SEEN KEVIN DURANT AND  LeBRON JAMES DO THAT.  THAT WASN'T THE CASE WITH KOBE  BRYANT.  HE RAISED HIS FOUR DAUGHTERS IN  THE AREA.  HIS WIFE IS FROM THE AREA, TOO.  THEY ARE HUGE CELEBRITIES.  EVERYWHERE HE GOES HE MIGHT SEE  MURALS ON WALLS.  CERTAINLY THERE IS A BILLBOARD  ADVERTISING HIS SNEAKERS FOR  YEARS AND YEARS.  I THINK HE WAS ON TRACK TO BE  ELECTED INTO THE HALL OF FAME  THIS SUMMER.  THAT SPEAKS TO JUST THE NATURE  OF HIS CAREER ON A MORE  NATIONAL STAGE.  HE IS AN ABSOLUTE ICON.  UP THERE WITH THE MOST POPULAR  ATHLETES IN THE CITY FROM ANY  SPORT.  CERTAINLY, HAVING THE CAREER  WHERE HE DID WHERE HE HAD TONS  OF SUCCESS EARLY, HE WON THREE  TITLES WITH SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.  HE HAD A DIVORCE ON THE COURT  WHERE THEY DIDN'T GET ALONG.  HE WAS ABLE TO PUT THE PIECES  BACK TOGETHER AND WIN TWO MORE  TITLES IN HIS CAREER.  HE UNDERWENT A SERIOUS ACHILLES  INJURY WHERE EVERYONE WOULD  FEEL HIS PAIN.  HE BATTLED BACK AND PLAYED  THREE MORE SEASONS.  A SITUATION WHERE HIS FANS FEEL  LIKE THEY RODE THE HIGHS AND  THE LOWS WITH HIM EVERY STEP OF  THE WAY.

BEN, WE HEARD STEVE MENTION A  MOMENT AGO THE SHOCK AND IT  SOUNDS LIKE DISBELIEF AMONG THE  PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEGUN TO GATHER  IN THAT AREA, WHICH IT SOUNDS  LIKE IS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE  PERIMETER AUTHORITIES SET UP.  WE SHOWED A TWEET FROM SCOTTY  PIPPEN, FORMER CHICAGO BULL,  EXPRESSING HIS SADNESS.  I WONDER IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT  HOW KOBE BRYANT'S DEATH, THERE  IS THE TWEET THAT SCOTTY  PIPPEN.  BEN, IF YOU ARE WITH US, CAN  YOU DESCRIBE HOW MUCH OF AN  IMPACT THE DEATH OF KOBE BRYANT  WILL HAVE IN THE WORLD OF THE  NBA GIVEN HIS CAREER, GIVEN THE  CLOSENESS THAT CLEARLY MANY  OTHER PLAYERS FEEL WITH KOBE  BRYANT?  >> Reporter: I WAS THERE FOR  THE TWO GOLD MEDALS HE WON.  I WAS THERE THE NIGHT HE WON AN  OSCAR.  THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD  UNBELIEVABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  I WAS IN EAGLE, COLORADO,  PROBABLY THE LOW POINT FOR KOBE  BRYANT'S PUBLIC CAREER WHEN HE  HAD THAT CHARGE OF RAPE FOR A  WHILE THAT WAS EVENTUALLY  SETTLED OUT OF COURT.  I HAVE COVERED THIS MAN FROM  WHEN HE WAS DRAFTED AS A HIGH  SCHOOLER TO NOW.  IT WAS JUST A REMARKABLE LIFE.  THIS WAS A MAN WHO ALWAYS GAVE  IT HIS ALL.  SOMETIMES YOU DIDN'T GET ALONG  WITH OTHER PLAYERS.  YOU MENTION SCOTTY PIPPEN.  I REMEMBER ONE GAME SEVEN  LAKERS PLAYED AGAINST THE  PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS AND  PIPPEN WAS WITH THE  TRAILBLAZERS AND KOBE BRYANT  PUT A STAKE IN THE HEART OF  PIPPEN.  I REMEMBER HIM POUNDING HIS  FIRSTS ON THE TOWELS USED FOR  PLAYERS TO CLEAN UP.  HE WAS SO DISTRAUGHT AT THE  PAIN KOBE BRYANT AND LAKERS  INSTILLED IN HIM.  I AM TRYING TO RECALL A PLAYER  OF SUCH STATURE DYING AT SUCH A  YOUNG AGE.  WE HAVE HAD GREAT PLAYERS DIE.  I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE HAD  ANYONE AT THIS HIGH STATURE,  MAYBE THERE IS EUROPEAN SOCCER  PLAYERS WHO DIED AT THIS YOUNG   >> WE KNOW AROUND 10:00 A.M.  PACIFIC TIME, 1:00 P.M.

HE IS THERE OUTSIDE OF THE  PERIMETER THAT HAS BEEN SET UP  AS AUTHORITIES, WE ARE  UNDERSTANDINGS, ARE PREPARING  TO GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE IN  ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO.  THAT IS WHAT YOU HEARD, STEVE,  IS THAT RIGHT?  >> Reporter: WE HAVE HEARD  NOTHING OFFICIAL.  WE HEARD ROUGHLY MAYBE 5:00  EASTERN TIME.  IT COULD COME SOONER.  IT COULD COME LATER.  MY UNDERSTANDING IS AUTHORITIES  HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY IDENTIFIED  KOBE BRYANT AS A VICTIM IN THIS  HELICOPTER CRASH.  WE HAVE GOTTEN THIS FROM MANY  OF OUR SOURCES.  ALL SOURCES ARE CONFIRMING,  YES, KOBE BRYANT WAS ON THE  HELICOPTER.  STILL, UNTIL YOU HEAR IT FROM  OFFICIALS, THERE IS MAYBE  ALWAYS THAT HOPE FOR A MIRACLE  THAT SOMETHING WAS  MISUNDERSTOOD IN THE CRASH.  I DON'T THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN,  UNFORTUNATELY.  >> AS WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING E- MAILS ARE COMING IN FAST AND  FURIOUS.  ONE OF THE E-MAILS FROM OUR  NATIONAL DESK AT CBS NEWS  SAYING ACCORDING TO THE  CALABASAS CITY MANAGER KOBE  BRYANT WAS ON BOARD.  ALL OF THIS, WE DO HAVE TO GIVE  THAT CAVEAT.  WE ARE HEARING A LOT OF THINGS  NOW.  THIS IS OUR CBS NEWS NATIONAL  DESK CONFIRMING WITH THE  CALABASAS CITY MANAGER THAT  KOBE BRYANT WAS AMONG THOSE ON  BOARD THE HELICOPTER.  HE WOULD TAKE THIS ENHANCEMENT  BACK AND FORTH TO STAPLES  CENTER DURING REGULAR SEASON  GAMES.  HE LIKED THE HELICOPTER A GREAT  DEAL.  WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT A  HELICOPTER BEING CONNECTED TO  KOBE BRYANT IMMEDIATELY I SAID  THIS COULD BE TRUE.  WE KNOW, THOSE OF US WHO  COVERED COBY OVER THE YEARS, WE  KNOW HOW MUCH HE LIKED TO  TRAVEL ON THE HELICOPTER.  IT IS A SAD IRONY THAT THIS  AIRCRAFT HE LOVED SO MUCH ENDS  UP BEING THE CAUSE OF HIS  DEATH.  >> DANA, FIRST OF ALL, YOUR  THOUGHTS ON THE NEWS THAT WE  ARE JUST LEARNING DETAILS  ABOUT?  >> Reporter: I'M SURE IT IS THE  SAME AS WHAT STEVE SAID AND  EVERYBODY IS THINKING.  IT IS SHOCKING.  IT CAN'T BE TRUE.  IT IS SAD.  IT IS TRAGIC.  I FEEL I'M IN SHOCK.  HE HAD ANOTHER LIFE TO LEAD.  HIS LAST INTERVIEW TALKED AND  WHAT WAS NEXT FOR HIM.  CAN FOUR YOUNG GIRLS AND HIS  WIFE, THE ONLY WORD THAT COMES  TO MIND IS TRAGIC.  >> WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO FIND  THE TWEET.  >> Reporter: IT IS INTERESTING,  OUT OF COINCIDENCE, BECAUSE  THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.  I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION  WITH NBA PEOPLE YESTERDAY ABOUT  HOW MUCH KOBE WANTED TO CATCH  JORDAN.  I WAS WONDERING, DO YOU THINK  IT BOTHERED HIM LeBRON PASSED  HIM?  HE SEEMED APPRECIATIVE THERE  WAS A NOD TO EVERYBODY ELSE  THAT WHAT LeBRON JAMES WAS  DOING WAS GREAT.  THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO SAID  THEY THOUGHT HE WAS UPSET THAT  HE NEVER REACHED THE JORDAN  LEVEL.  TALKING TO HIM THIS PAST  OCTOBER, HE PUT THE BASKETBALL  SIDE ASIDE.  I REMEMBER ASKING HIM IF HE  MISSED THE GAME?  HE DIDN'T MISS THE GAME AS FAR  AS PLAYING IT.  HE LOVED THAT HIS YOUNGEST  GIRLS DIDN'T REMEMBER HIM  PLAYING.  THEY THOUGHT OF THEIR SISTERS  PLAYING THE GAME AND NOT DAD.  HE WAS EMBRACING A LIFE HE WAS  CREATING AND BUILDING OFF WHAT  HE HAD DONE IN THE NBA.  HE SAID BASKETBALL WAS A LOVE  FOR HIM.  HE KNEW IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON.  HE KNEW HE COULD WRITE MORE TO  HIS LEGACY.  THAT IS WHAT HE WAS LOOKING  FORWARD TO DOING.  >> AS YOU WERE SPEAKING WE  SHOWED THAT TWEET, THE LAST  TWEET YOU REFERENCED A MOMENT  AGO.  KOBE BRYANT'S LAST TWEET THERE.  CONTINUING TO MOVE THE GAME  FORWARD KING JAMES.  MUCH RESPECT MY BROTHER.  TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT  THE NOTION THAT, DESPITE HIS  SUCCESS IN THE ARENA, THERE WAS  SO MUCH MORE THAT HE SEEMED TO  BE LOOKING FORWARD TO CLEARLY  IN THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU  HAD WITH HIM.  HE SAID HE TRIED TO BE PART OF  THE COMMERCIALS DONE FOR HIM BY  WRITING SOME OF THESE CONSIDER  TRYING TO GET A TAG LINE.  THE BOOKS HE HAD WERE ABOUT  BRINGING SPORTS TO YOUNG  ADULTS.  IT IS WAS ABOUT SHARING THE  LOVE OF THE GAME.  THE WHOLE OTHER SIDE OF STORY  TELLING AND THE MAGICAL NATURE  OF YOUNG ADULT NOVELS HE WAS  WRITING.  I REMEMBER ASKING -- DON'T  QUOTE ME EXACTLY, 50 YEARS AGO  FROM NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR  LEGACY TO BE?  HE TALKED ABOUT THE BOOKS.  HE WANTED PEOPLE TO REMEMBER  HIM AS THE STORY TELLER WHO WAS  HELPING BRING SPORTS TO KIDS BY  TELLING STORIES.  I SWORD OF LAUGHED AND SAID,  AND THE BASKETBALL SIDE IS FOR  THE OLD PEOPLE?  HE LAUGHED.  I THINK THAT THAT WAS BEING  FUNNY.  I THINK HE KNEW HE HAD DONE  WHAT HE COULD.  HE LEFT HIS IMPRINT ON THE  GAME.  IN A WAY, I THINK MAYBE IF I  CAN SORT OF USE MY OWN MIND  INTO IT, THAT HE DIDN'T MISS  BASKETBALL AS MUCH.  THAT HE REALLY STILL HAD A  CHANCE TO BE A PART OF THE GAME  BY WATCHING THESE YOUNG GIRLS  GROW AND LEARN AND FIND THEIR  DESIRE TO PLAY AS WELL.  >> DANA, AS YOU'VE BEEN  SPEAKING, I JUST WANT TO NOTE  FOR OUR VIEWERS, PRESIDENT  TRUMP HAS NOW WEIGHED IN ON  THIS NEWS, CALLING IT TERRIBLE  NEWS, HE TWEETED JUST A SHORT  TIME AGO.  HE TWEETED THAT BASKETBALL  GREAT, KOBE BRYANT, AND THREE  OTHERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A  HELICOPTER CRASH IN CALIFORNIA.  THAT IS TERRIBLE NEWS.  DANA, GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU  WERE SAYING A MOMENT AGO, HOW  RARE WAS IT, TO HAVE A SPORTS  FIGURE WHO WAS SO ACCOMPLISHED  AS KOBE BRYANT WAS.  YOU HAVE INTERVIEWED MANY  PROMINENT SPORTS FIGURES DURING  YOUR CAREER, BUT TO HAVE  SOMEONE WHO QUOTE UNQUOTE  RETIRES, BUT THEN HAS SUCH A  CLEAR FOCUS ON WHAT THE NEXT  STEPS ARE, IN ONE'S CAREER.  >> IT'S INTERESTING.  YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE ARE A  LOT OF GUYS THAT REALIZE THAT  ANY INJURY CAN BE THE END OF  THAT CAREER, SO MAYBE YOU  SHOULD BE THINKING OF THE NEXT.  I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO TALK TO ANY  THAT ARE AS DRIVEN.  I LITERALLY JUST SAT DOWN TO DO  AN INTERVIEW WITH A FORMER  PLAYER.  I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE DRIVE  IS SIMILAR TO WHAT HE'S DOING  IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.  BUT FOR KOBE BRYANT, AGAIN, TO  BE ONE OF THE GREATEST TO PLAY  THE GAME, AND THEN FIND THAT  SAME SUCCESS SOMEWHERE ELSE,  MAYBE WE SHOULD SAY, IT'S NOT  SURPRISING, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY  THE WORK ETHIC, THE DESIRE TO  BE THE BEST AT SOMETHING IS IS  WHAT HELPED DRIVE HIM AWAY FROM  THE SPORT LATER.  I JUST THINK HE WAS THAT  PERSON.  HE GOES BACK TO THE KID THAT HE  WAS.  HE WASN'T THE ONE DIMENSIONAL,  I JUST WANT TO PLAY BASKETBALL.  HIS SISTER WAS DOING SOME TYPE  OF DANCE CONTEST, AND NEEDED  SOME HELP.  SHE BASICALLY GOT HIM TO  PARTICIPATE IN THIS DANCE  CONTEST, AND HE HAD TO GIVE UP  BASKETBALL PRACTICE TO GO TO  IT.  HE WAS LIKE, I LOVE DANCING, I  WAS HAPPY TO DO IT.  I THINK THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE  SAW HIM SO FOCUSED ON THE GAME  OF BASKETBALL, FOR ANYBODY TO  HAVE THAT SUCCESS, BUT HE HAD  ALWAYS HAD SO MANY OTHER THINGS  AROUND IT, THAT HE ENJOYED THAT  WHEN HE LEFT THE GAME, IT WAS  SPENDING TIME WITH HIS KIDS,  BEING ABLE TO GO AND PICK THEM  UP, AND SPENDING THE TIME HE  DIDN'T GET WITH THEM.  THERE WAS NO BASKETBALL  SCHEDULE DICTATING THINGS.  I GOT THE FEELING FROM WHEN WE  SPOKE THAT HE ENJOYED A LITTLE  OF THE SURPRISE THAT MAYBE SOME  PEOPLE HAD AT THE BOOK THAT HE  WAS WRITING, THAT HE WAS SO  HANDS ONMENT AS YOU REFERENCED,  I THINK IT'S SOMETHING SO  UNIQUE, YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF  PEOPLE THAT HAVE ONE CAREER,  AND ARE SO FOCUSED AND DRIVEN,  MAYBE NOT BE AS HANDS ONMENT  FOR KOBE, THAT WAS THE  PERFECTIONIST, OF I HAVE TO BE  HANDS ON.  I HAVE TO BE THE ONE.  MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE HAS HAD THE  SUCCESS THAT HE HAS, AND IT WAS  SOMETHING THAT HE LOVED.  YOU THINK ABOUT BACK TO WHEN  YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, IF A  TEACHER IGNITED SOMETHING IN  YOU IT THAT YOU LOVED, IT'S  HARD TO LET THAT GO.  HE WAS WILLING TO SAY, I'M  GOING TO HAVE TO PUT IT ASIDE  FOR A WHILE, BUT MAYBE THAT'S  WHY HE CAME BACK TO SOME OF THE  STORYTELLING.  >> HOW DEEPLY DO YOU THINK HIS  DEATH WILL BE FELT, NOT JUST IN  THE WORLD OF BASKETBALL, BUT IN  THE GREATER SPORTS WORLD AS  WELL.  >> ELAINE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW.  I'VE BEEN TRYING IN THE LAST  HOUR TO FIGURE OUT THE  PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THIS IS,  BECAUSE HE'S SO YOUNG, TO DIE  SO YOUNG.  YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THAT  I'VE KNOWN A PLAYER OF HIS  GREATNESS THAT WE'VE LOST AT  THIS AGE.  HE WAS NOT A PERFECT MAN.  HE'D BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL  YOU THAT, AND OBVIOUSLY HAD HIS  OWN ISSUES.  BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE GAME OF  BASKETBALL, TO BE WITH THE SAME  TEAM FOR 20 YEARS, TO HAVE  ACHIEVED THE LEVEL OF SUCCESS  THAT HE HAS, YOU KNOW, ALL THE  TITLES, THE CHAMPIONSHIPS.  THE TIME IN L.A., ESPECIALLY TO  PLAY FOR A TEAM LIKE THAT, I  DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN  ACTUALLY, I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE  ANSWER.  I CAN'T FIND THE PERSPECTIVE,  IT WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST,  THE WAY THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT  ROBERTO CLEMENTE, AND LOOK  BACK.  IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHEN WE  LOST MUHAMMAD ALI, HE LIVED  THAT FULL ARC.  TO LOSE SOMEONE IN THIS TIME  WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO HAVE A  SECOND CHAPTER, I THINK PEOPLE  WONDER WHAT WOULD BE NEXT?  >> DANA JACOBSON, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS,  AND YOUR REFLECTIONS WITH US.  WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.  >> THANKS ELAINE.  >>> FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST  JOINING US, WE ARE FOLLOWING  BREAKING NEWS.  NBA LEGEND KOBE BRYANT IS DEAD  AFTER A HELICOPTER CRASH IN  CALABASAS, CALIFORNIA.  THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF  SAID FIVE PEOPLE WERE ONBOARD.  IT WAS UNCLEAR WHO BRYANT WAS  TRAVELING WITH.  NBA ANALYST, BILL RIDER JOINS  ME NOW FROM LOS ANGELES.  BILL, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?  >> WELL I CAN TELL YOU, WE HAVE  CONFIRMED THE REPORTS THAT KOBE  BRYANT HAS PASSED AWAY, AND  EVERYTHING ELSE IS SPECULATION.  SITTING HERE IN LOS ANGELES, IN  FACT, JUST OUTSIDE THE STUDIO A  FEW MOMENTS AGO, JUST TOOK A  WALK AROUND THE BLOCK, AND  EVERYONE THAT YOU ENCOUNTER HAS  A DAZED LOOK, OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE  ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.  PEOPLE ARE MOURNING THIS LOSS  IN THE STREETS.  I THINK ELAINE THAT THE SHOCK  OF IT, THE UNREALITY OF IT  CONTINUES TO BE THE OPPRESSIVE  FEELING HERE IN LOS ANGELES.  >> AND WHAT DO WE KNOW, IF  ANYTHING ABOUT, DO WE HAVE ANY  SENSE OF WHAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN  DOING?  WHY HE MAY HAVE BEEN TRAVELING  IN A HELICOPTER AT THAT TIME?  >> DO WE HAVE ANY INSIGHT AT  ALL INTO WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES  WERE SURROUNDING THIS  HELICOPTER TRIP?  >> Reporter: SO EARLIER IN THE  DAY, IN TEXTING WITH SOME  SOURCES, ONE SOURCE HAD  EXPRESSED THE CONCERN, THE  POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WERE  HEARING THAT PERHAPS KOBE  BRYANT WAS WITH ONE OF HIS  DAUGHTERS.  A FINE REPORTER FOR ESPN, JUST  A FEW MOMENTS AGO REPORTED THAT  KOBE BRYANT AND HIS OLDEST  DAUGHTER AND ANOTHER PARENT,  ANOTHER PLAYER WERE ON THE WAY  TO A YOUTH BASKETBALL GAME.  AND SO, IT'S A SINGLE REPORT,  BUT IT'S A REPORT FROM A  REPORTER WHO IS VERY WELL  RESPECTED, AND VERY CONNECTED  TO KOBE BRYANT, HIS FAMILY,  THAT LAKERS COMMUNITY.  THE LATEST REPORT, ELAINE, AND  WHAT WE THINK HAS HAPPENED, AND  OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A QUICKLY  DEVELOPING STORY, IS THAT THIS  HELICOPTER WAS ON ITS WAY TO A  YOUTH BASKETBALL GAME FOR KOBE  BRYANT'S OLDEST DAUGHTER.  HE WAS THE COACH OF THAT TEAM.  AND AS WE KNOW, IT NEVER MADE  IT TO ITS DESTINATION.  >> AND BILL, IS IT YOUR  UNDERSTANDING THAT AUTHORITIES  ARE EXPECTED TO HOLD A NEWS  CONFERENCE IN ABOUT THE NEXT  HOUR OR SO, THE FIRST OFFICIAL  SORT OF NEWS CONFERENCE  REGARDING THIS CRASH.  >> Reporter: YES, THE PLAN  RIGHT NOW IS THAT AUTHORITIES  WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE AT  2:00 HERE IN LOS ANGELES, 5:00  EASTERN TIME.  THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT AT THAT  TIME, US IN THE MEDIA, FANS,  ALL OF US TRYING TO MAKE SENSE  OF THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE  REALITY WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO  GET SOME MORE INFORMATION, AND  OFFICIAL DETAILS ON WHAT'S  HAPPENED TODAY.  >> BILL CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT  HOW MUCH A PART OF THE FABRIC  OF THE GREATER LOS ANGELES  AREA, KOBE BRYANT AND HIS  FAMILY ACTUALLY WERE?  IT'S THE SAME QUESTION I POSED  TO ANOTHER SPORTS ANALYST, JUST  A MOMENT AGO.  BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT BE  FAMILIAR WITH HIS DEEP, DEEP  CONNECTION TO THATTER AREA, CAN  YOU JUST TALK ABOUT THAT?  GIVEN HOW LONG HE WAS A PART OF  THAT ORGANIZATION, AND HOW  SUCCESSFUL HE WAS OVER THE  COURSE OF HIS CAREER.  >> Reporter: ELAINE, I'VE BEEN  A SPORTS REPORTER IN MIAMI, IN  CHICAGO, IN NEW YORK CITY, NOW  IN LOS ANGELES, AND KANSAS  CITY, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND  I'VE SPENT A GOOD CHUNK OF MY  LIFE TRAVELING FOR SPORTS  EVENTS, AND I'VE NEVER SEEN  ANOTHER ATHLETE IN ANY REALM,  IN ANY SPORT, EVEN APPROACH THE  CONNECTION THAT KOBE BRYANT HAD  TO LOS ANGELES.  HERE'S A QUICK, JUST PERSONAL  STORY.  WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO L.A.  SEVEN YEARS AGO, HAD TO GET A  CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE,  WENT INTO THE DMV, AND I WALKED  INTO THIS LARGE BUILDING, AND  IT WAS SO COVERED IN LITERALLY  KOBE BRYANT POSTERS, THE COLORS  OF THE LAKERS, BUT THE IMAGES  OF THE KOBE THAT I THOUGHT I'D  ACCIDENTALLY WALKED INTO A  LAKERS OFFICE, AND I TURNED  AROUND, AND WALKED OUT OF THE  DMV.  I HAVE YET TO LEARN THE  CONNECTION THAT KOBE BRYANT HAS  WITH LOS ANGELES, IT IS DEEP,  IT IS EMOTIONAL, IT IS REAL.  EVEN LAST WEEK, AND REALLY,  ELAINE EVERY DAY THAT I'VE  LIVED HERE, BUT LAST WEEK, MY  NEIGHBORS AND THE MAILMAN WERE  TALKING ABOUT KOBE BRYANT.  I WENT TO GET A COFFEE, AND  THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT KOBE  BRYANT.  HE'S BEEN RETIRED FOR SEVERAL  YEARS NOW, BUT HIS HOLD ON THIS  CITY.  TRULY, THE LOVE THAT THIS CITY  HAD FOR KOBE BRYANT, AND THAT  HE HAD FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,  IT IS A REAL, IT IS A DEEPLY  FELT PART OF LOS ANGELES, AND  GREATER LOS ANGELES.  AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE  LOSS FOR THE NBA.  IT'S A HUGE LOSS TO THE LAKERS.  BUT FOR LOS ANGELES, THIS IS A  REALITY.  A STORY, A TURN THAT IS GOING  TO EFFECT ALL OF US HERE.  NOT JUST TODAY, NOT JUST A WEEK  FROM NOW, OR MONTHS FROM NOW.  IT WILL RESHAPE, IT WILL EFFECT  LOS ANGELES FOR THOSE OF US WHO  ARE HERE FOR THE REST OF OUR  LIVES.  >> ALL RIGHT, BILL RIDER, BILL,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US.  >> Reporter: OF COURSE.  >> WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO CBS  NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT,  JONATHAN  VIGLIOTTI, I KNOW YOU  JUST ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?  >> Reporter: CBS NEWS  CONFRIRMING KOBE BRYANT WAS  TRAVELING IN HIS PRIVATE  HELICOPTER AT THE TIME OF THIS  CRASH.  THE CITY OF CALABASAS WHERE  THIS CRASH TOOK PLACE, GOING ON  TWITTER TO WRITE, IT IS WITH  GREAT SADNESS THAT WE LEARN OF  THE DEATH OF KOBE BRYANT.  TO GIVE YOU A SCENE SETTER,  WE'RE ABOUT A MILE AWAY FROM  THE CRASH SITE AS WE ZOOM IN  YOU CAN STILL SEE THE SMOKE  FROM THIS WRECKAGE, RISING IN  THE AIR.  YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN AREA KNOWN  AS MALIBU CANYON, AND THIS  CANYON, THE ROUGH TERRAIN  MAKING IT VERY COMPLICATED FOR  FIRST RESPONDERS TO GET TO THIS  SITE.  IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT LED UP TO IT.  THOUGH WE CAN TELL YOU, THERE  WAS THICK FOG HERE, THAT COULD  HAVE COMPLICATED EFFORTS.  FOUR OTHER PEOPLE WERE ON THIS  HELICOPTER.  ALL OF THEM DIED.  AT THIS POINT, THEIR IDENTITIES  STILL UNCLEAR.  ALONG WITH THE COMPLICATIONS.  TERRAIN, YOU CAN ALSO IMAGINE  SOME OF THE GRIDLOCK THAT'S  UNFOLDING HERE.  YOU CAN SEE IN THIS PARKING  LOT, THERE'S PROBABLY A CROWD  OF 100 PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM  FANS OF KOBE BRYANT COMING TO  SEE THIS CRASH FIRSTHAND.  KOBE BRYANT WAS KNOWN TO TAKE  HIS PRIVATE HELICOPTER BACK AND  FORTH TO THE STAPLES CENTER.  THIS EVENING, THE STAPLES  CENTER GETTING READY TO HOST  THE GRAMMYS.  WE'RE TOLD HIS JERSEY IS NOW ON  DISPLAY, AND LIT UP IN HONOR OF  HIM.  AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, A VERY  FLUID SCENE RIGHT NOW, AS THIS  INVESTIGATION IS JUST IN THE  EARLY STAGES.  THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT  EXPECTED TO GIVE AN UPDATE TO  US IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO,  WHERE WE HOPE TO LEARN MORE,  BUT AGAIN, WE CAN CONFIRM THIS  MORNING, KOBE BRYANT AMONG FIVE  CONFIRMED TO DIE IN A FATAL  HELICOPTER CRASH.  ALL OF THIS AS QUESTIONS REMAIN  AS TO WHAT LED TO THIS CRASH  HERE IN CALIFORNIA.  >> JONATHAN, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH.  AS YOU HEARD JONATHAN SAY A  MOMENT AGO, WE ARE GOING TO  BRING YOU THAT NEWS CONFERENCE,  THAT IS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE  ABOUT 45 MINUTES OR SO FROM  NOW.  BUT RIGHT NOW, WE WANT TO TAKE  YOU BACK TO CBSN, LOS ANGELES,  FOR MORE COVERAGE.  >> 9:46 TO THE SHERIFF'S  DEPARTMENT, DIRECTLY.  UP AT THE LOST HILLS LOCATION.  AND THEY TRANSFERRED ME OVER TO  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND THEN  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED ME  BACK FOR ADDITIONAL  IDENTIFICATION OF WHERE IT WAS  LOCATED.  AND THAT'S WHEN THE DISPATCHER  SAID WE THINK IT'S A PLANE  CRASH.  >> YOU KNOW CLARK, THERE IS SO  MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT  HAPPENED HERE, OBVIOUSLY, THE  NTSB IS INVESTIGATING THIS.  OUR LOCAL AGENCIES ARE  INVESTIGATING WHAT EXACTLY WENT  WRONG HERE.  I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, WE  DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WENT  WRONG AS OF YET.  BUT YOU MENTIONED THE FOG, AND  YOU KNOW CALABASAS VERY WELL,  I'M SURE.  WE SEE FOG, AND I KNOW THERE  ARE A LOT OF HILLS HERE.  IS IT TYPICAL IN YOUR MIND TO  SEE?  HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A HELICOPTER  FLYING THIS LOW IN THIS HILLY  PART OF CALABASAS THERE?  >> WE SEE THE HELICOPTERS FROM  THE SHERIFF'S STATION COME  WITHIN VERY, VERY LOW.  WE'RE WITHIN ABOUT A BLOCK OF  THE SHERIFF'S STATION OR TWO.  AND THEY COME IN EXTREMELY LOW  SOMETIMES.  OF COURSE, THIS IS WHERE THE  BIG FIRE HAPPENED ABOUT A YEAR  AND A HALF AGO.  AND HELICOPTERS WERE YOU KNOW  PRESENT THEN AS WELL.  VERY, VERY LOW.  THEY ACTUALLY DIPPED INTO THE  MUNICIPAL WATER OFFICE.  THEY HAVE A RESERVOIR BACK  THERE, AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY  FIGHTING THE FIRE WITH THAT  WATER.  >> YOU KNOW, CLARK, IT'S  INTERESTING, A LOT OF AIRCRAFT  GO IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA IN  THE CALABASAS AREA.  . IT'S NOT UNUSUAL AS WE TAKE A  LOOK AT THE PICTURE HERE.  THIS IS THE CRASH THAT KILLED  KOBE BRYANT EARLIER TODAY.  YOU SEE THE FLAMES THERE, THE  SMOULDERRING PATCH.  AS WE UNDERSTAND, IT STARTED A  SMALL BRUSH FIRE AS A RESULT OF  THIS PLANE CRASH.  FIVE PEOPLE ONBOARD.  NONE SURVIVED.  CLARK, WE CERTAINLY THANK YOU  FOR YOUR TIME, AND WE WISH YOU  THE BEST, AND THANK YOU FOR  CALLING US HERE ON KCAL 9.  HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS  POINT IN TIME, KOBE BRYANT,  FORMER L.A.  LAKERS PLAYER, DEAD AT THE AGE  OF 41.  HE WAS ONE OF FIVE PEOPLE  KILLED IN THAT HELICOPTER CRASH  IN CALABASAS AROUND 9:45 THIS  MORNING.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE  HELICOPTER WAS COMING FROM, OR  GOING TO AT THIS POINT IN TIME.  THAT CRASH WAS FIRST REPORTED,  LIKE I SAID, 9:45 THIS MORNING.  AT WILLOW GLENN, AND LAS  VIRGINOUS, RIGHT BEHIND THE  WATER DEPARTMENT.  THIS IS  BASICALLY ON THE SOUTH  SIDE OF THE 101.  NOT TOO FAR FROM THE CALABASAS  OAKS AREA.  IF YOU'RE HEADING DOWN TO  MALIBU, THAT'S A VERY POPULAR  ROUTE TO TAKE LAS VIRGINOUS OFF  THE 101, WEST INTO MALIBU.  IT'S A PRETTY BUSY AREA.  A LOT OF PRIVATE AIRCRAFT,  BECAUSE VAN NUYS AIRPORT IS NOT  THAT FAR AWAY.  >> RIGHT, AND LIKE YOU  MENTIONED, A LOT OF SMALL CRAFT  FLYING IN AND OUT OF VAN NUYS.  INCLUDING SOME OF OUR  HELICOPTERS HERE.  CERTAINLY, A LOT OF QUESTIONS  ABOUT WHY THE HELICOPTER WAS  FLYING THERE.  OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF SPECULATION  ABOUT WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM,  AND MUCH HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT  THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WE'VE  SEEN OUT THERE.  OBVIOUSLY, WE'VE SEEN DENSE  FOG.  WE HAD SOME DENSE FOG  ADVISORIES OVER THE COURSE OF  THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.  WE'VE SEEN NOT ONLY IN THE L.A.  AREA, OBVIOUSLY, THAT MAKES  FLYING CONDITIONS VERY  DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE  POTENTIAL VISIBILITY PROBLEMS.  THIS IS GOING TO BE AN  INVESTIGATION THAT COULD TAKE  AS MUCH AS A YEAR.  SOMETIMES WE SEE THESE NTSB  INVESTIGATIONS INTO PLANE  RASHES, AND THEY TAKE VERY,  VERY LONG TIME TO CONCLUDE, AND  IT MAY TAKE THAT LONG TO FIGURE  OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE  IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY.  >> THIS SITE WHERE THIS PLANE  CRASH IS GOING TO BE A MEMORIAL  TO KOBE BRYANT, I'M SURE.  LET'S GO TO GREG MILLS.  HE'S STANDING BY, WHERE A  NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY  BEEN GATHERING AT THIS CRASH  SITE.  >> Reporter: THERE'S A WHOLE  BUNCH OF PEOPLE HERE.  HUNDREDS OF LAKERS FANS, AND  KOBE FANS, LIKE MICHAEL COX.  >> I'M REALLY IN DISBELIEF.  WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT I'M LIKE  NO.  I'M ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND I WAS  JUST TRYING TO VERIFY IF IT WAS  TRUE.  KOBE WAS A STAPLE FOR LOS  ANGELES.  HE BUILT LIKE STAPLE CENTER.  WHAT I LOVED ABOUT KOBE WAS HIS  WORK ETHIC, AND HIS DEDICATION  TO THE GAME LIKE NO OTHER.  >> HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THE  FACT, THIS IS A GUY YOU HAD A  GREAT DEAL OF AFFECTION FOR,  AND NOW HE'S GONE AT THE AGE OF  41.  >> IT'S HUGE.  IT MAKES YOU JUST WANT TO HUG  YOUR DAUGHTERS, BECAUSE LIFE IS  SO SHORT, AND I LOVED HIM AS A  PLAYER, HIS WORK ETHIC, BUT HE  HAS A FAMILY, AND THEIR GRIEF  IS GOING TO BE WAY WORSE THAN  OURS.  >> Reporter: AND MICHAEL COX,  HE HAD A WIFE AND FOUR  DAUGHTERS.  WE KNOW HOW MUCH HE LOVED HIS  DAUGHTERS.  HE COACHED ONE OF THEIR TEAMS.  >> THAT'S THE SAME THING I'D DO  IF MY WIFE WAS HERE.  YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BE WITH THEM  EVERY DAY.  >> Reporter: YOU'RE A BIG KOBE  FAN.  HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THIS?  >> I FEEL LIKE REALLY SAD THAT  HE DIED, AND I WISH THAT HE  WOULD STILL BE ALIVE RIGHT NOW.  >> Reporter: HE HAD DAUGHTERS,  HE WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE WNBA  GAMES.  I THINK HE WENT TO MORE OF  THOSE SINCE HE RETIRED THAN THE  LAKER GAMES.  HE WANTED THEM TO SEE SOME  GREAT ROLE MODELS.  AS A GIRL, DID YOU KNOW HE HAD  FOUR DAUGHTERS AND THAT HE  REALLY CARED ABOUT THEM?  >> YES.  >> Reporter: DID THAT IMPACT  YOU TOO?  >> YES?  >> Reporter: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT  KOBE THAT YOU ADMIRED SO MUCH?  >> THAT HE ALWAYS WANTED TO  HELP SO MANY PEOPLE IN HIS  LIFE, AND HE NEVER WANTED TO  STOP HELPING EVERYONE.  >> Reporter: FANTASTIC, AND  YOUR THOUGHTS, YOU SEE THE  SMOKE FROM THE WRECKAGE.  >> YES, IT IS REALLY SAD.  >> Reporter: COX FAMILY FROM  CARSON.  I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  UP HERE AND CHATTING WITH US  TODAY.  HOW ABOUT YOU, YOUNG MAN?  WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON KOBE  BRYANT.  >> IT SUCKS.  IT SUCKS.  >> Reporter: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT  KOBE THAT YOU LIKE SO MUCH?  >> HE WAS A GOOD BASKETBALL  PLAYER.  >> HE WAS GOOD ON THE COURT.  ALWAYS BROUGHT HIS A GAME.  I DIDN'T WANT TOO MUCH.  MY DAD WAS A BIG FAN.  MY DAD WAS IN SHOCK THIS  MORNING.  PRETTY CRAZY.  HE WAS SKATEBOARDING DOWN THE  STREET.  WE HEARD IT AT THE SKATEBOARD  PARK.  I LITERALLY GOT CHILLS,  EVERYONE AT THE SKATEBOARD PARK  WAS TRIPPING OUT.  >> Reporter: YOU SEE THE  WRECKAGE, STILL SMOKING UP  THERE IN THE HILLS, WHERE KOBE  BRYANT, AND FOUR OTHERS DIED  THIS MORNING.  >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, GREG.  WE APPRECIATE IT.  WE'RE JOINED NOW BY OUR SPORTS  DIRECTOR JIM HILL, WHO HAS SO  MUCH IN THE WAY OF STORIES  ABOUT KOBE BRYANT, AND YOU KNEW  HIM PERSONALLY.  WE JUST WANT TO EXTEND OUR  CONDOLENCES TO YOU AND THE  ENTIRE LAKERS FAMILY.  >> THIS IS MORE THAN SAD, IF  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.  IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS, I  SAY IS, BECAUSE HE STILL LIVES  IN ALL OF US, WHO WAS SO YOUNG,  SO GIFTED, SO WONDERFUL.  SUCH A, WE ALL KNOW HE'S A  GREAT BASKETBALL PLAYER, BUT HE  WAS A BETTER FATHER, HUSBAND,  AND FAMILY MAN.  HE DID SO MUCH IN OUR COMMUNITY  THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY  DON'T KNOW ABOUT.  WE KNOW ABOUT SOME OF THE  THINGS THAT HE DID.  BUT THERE ARE STORIES THAT I  KNOW OF, OF WHERE HE HAS HELPED  PERSONALLY, TO HELP YOUNG KIDS  GO TO SCHOOL.  GAVE THEM MONEY TO GO TO  SCHOOL.  I'M JUST JUST TALKING ABOUT  JUNIOR HIGH, OR HIGH SCHOOL,  I'M TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE, AND  THINGS LIKE THAT.  HE MADE THE ADJUSTMENT TO  RETIREMENT BETTER THAN ANYONE  I'VE EVER MET.  HE WAS, YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS  HEAR ABOUT ATHLETES WHO WHEN  THEY RETIRE, THEY DON'T KNOW  WHAT TO DO.  THEY GET LOST, THEIR SICK, THE  MONEY IS STOLEN.  THEY GET INTO ALL KINDS OF  TROUBLE, AND ALL THAT.  NOT HIM.  HE WAS PREPARING HIS ENTIRE  ATHLETIC LIFE FOR WHEN HE WAS  GOING TO RETIRE.  AND WHEN HE RETIRED, YOU KNEW  EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS GOING TO  DO.  THERE WAS NO GUESSING OR  ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  ONE OTHER THING, HE BECAME AN  AUTHOR, AND ONE OF THE BOOKS IS  LEGACY AND THE QUEEN.  I WENT DOWN AND DID AN  INTERVIEW WITH HIM.  I OPENED IT UP, AND IT SAYS  HERE TO NANI, GIGI, BEBE, AND  COCOA.  MY FOUR BEAUTIFUL AND SPIRITED  DAUGHTERS.  WHEN YOU FIERCELY PROTECT YOUR  PASSION, NO ONE CAN STEAL YOUR  DREAMS.  KOBE BRYANT.  >> HE HAD SO MUCH THAT HE  PLANNED AHEAD.  YOU MENTIONED SO MANY PLAYERS  GO AND HIT THE GOLF COURSE, AND  THEY RETIRE.  BUT HE HAD A PLAN NOT ONLY FOR  WHEN HE WAS 18 YEARS OLD TO  PLAY IN THE NBA, BUT A PLAN FOR  AFTER THE NBA, AND HE SUCCEEDED  AT BOTH.  >> THE OTHER THING IS, WE ALL  HAD OUR UP AND DOWNS.  YOU'RE SHOWING A TAPE RIGHT  HERE.  WHEN I SAW HIM AT LAFC, IF I'M  NOT MISTAKEN, THAT IS THE LAST  TIME I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH  HIM.  I ASKED HIM ABOUT GOING INTO  THE HALL OF FAME.  IN TYPICAL KOBE BRYANT FASHION.  THAT'S OKAY.  I'M NOT REALLY, I'LL WORRY  ABOUT THAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO.  HE ALWAYS DEFLECTED PERSONAL,  INDIVIDUAL GAIN AND NOTORIETY.  HE ALWAYS TRIED TO PUT IT OFF  TO THE SIDE BECAUSE HE KNEW  THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS ALL  ABOUT.  WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS ABOUT  GIVING BACK AND HELPING OUR  YOUNG PEOPLE.  WE TALK ABOUT GIVING BACK.  WE JUST CELEBRATED DR. KING'S  BIRTHDAY.  I WAS DRIVING, AND I WAS  THINKING, THAT WAS A STATEMENT  THAT DR. KING SAID THAT MAYBE  IT APPLIES TO KOBE TODAY, AND  WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO.  THAT IS GIVING BACK TO YOUR  FELLOW MANKIND IS ONE OF THE  MOST NOBLE THINGS THAT ANYONE  CAN DO.  WHAT CAN BE MORE NOBLE THAN TO  HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, AND MAKE  SURE THEY DON'T MAKE THE  MISTAKES THAT WE MADE.  THAT'S WHAT KOBE DOES.  THAT'S WHAT HE DID.  THAT'S WHAT LeBRON DOES.  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BEING AT  THE FOREFRONT OF ALL OF THOSE  THINGS, KOBE GREEN BRYANT.  AND I REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF HIS  RETIREMENT AT STAPLELES CENTER.  >> WHAT A GAME.  >> HE JUST GOT OFF ON THAT GAME  STUFF LIKE THAT.  WHEN HE CAME BACK WITH THE  TOWEL WRAPPED AROUND HIS  SHOULDERS, AND THE LAST THING  HE SAID WAS, YOU KNOW, I'M OUT.  >> MAMBA OUT.  >> HE WAS READY FOR HIS NEXT  CHAPTER.  >> THAT WAS IT.  >> YOU HAVE AN  INTERESTING  PERSPECTIVE.  WE TALK ABOUT THIS ON THE SET.  PEOPLE YOU MET, AND WHO YOU  REALLY ADMIRE.  JUST DEALING WITH THEM IN THEIR  PROFESSIONAL CAREER, FOR ME,  KOBE, AND JUST THE LAKERS GLORY  DAYS, THAT WAS SO PERSONAL.  THOSE WERE MEMORIES, YOU KNOW,  WITH FAMILY THAT YOU KNOW,  PEOPLE IN L.A.  WILL ALWAYS HAVE.  HE'S SO CLOSELY ATTACHED TO  THOSE TIMES.  I WONDER, PERHAPS MAYBE YOU  THINK, IS THAT WHY THIS JUST  FEELS SO PERSONAL?  >> IT IS.  BECAUSE HE GAVE IT HIS ALL.  WHENEVER HE WAS ON THE FLOOR HE  WAS A LAKER.  HE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT TO BE A  LAKER.  WE ALL HAVE THIS OUR UPS AND  DOWNS, AND HE'S GOTTEN THROUGH  ALL OF THOSE, AND HAS COME OUT  ON THE OTHER END, A BETTER MAN  FOR THAT.  WE TEACH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE  ABOUT, WELL, WE TRY TO TEACH  THEM ABOUT BEING STRONG, ABOUT  ADVERSITY, ABOUT OVERCOMING  OBSTACLES, ABOUT HOW TO BECOME  A BETTER YOUNG MAN.  AND IN THIS PARTICULAR  INSTANCE, HOW TO BECOME A  BETTER YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN  MALE.  AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE, WE HAVE  OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR YOUNG  PEOPLE, AND TO ALL YOUNG  PEOPLE, TO SHOW THEM THAT HOW  TO DO THINGS RIGHT.  I REMEMBER IN THIS INTERVIEW  RIGHT HERE, WE WERE, I TOOK MY  LITTLE NEPHEW DOWN TO SEE HIM.  >> WHO YOU LOVE, THAT'S YOUR  LITTLE BUDDY.  >> THAT'S MY LITTLE BUDDY,  YEAH.  THAT'S MY BUDDY.  AND HE'S GOT SUCH A GREAT  NICKNAME.  SO WE WERE, I TOOK HIM DOWN AND  WE WERE GOING OVER TO SEE HIM,  AND KOBE LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID  HEY BUDDY.  MY NEPHEW THOUGHT HE REALLY  KNEW HIM.  BECAUSE HE SAID HEY BUDDY.  IS HE MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU  WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON  IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE WHEN HE  TALKED TO YOU, HE WAS LOOKING  RIGHT AT YOU.  I THINK ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE  AROUND, BUT HE WAS LOOKING  RIGHT AT YOU.  WHEN HE WAS TOOKING TO MY  NEPHEW, LEGEND LEE, HE LOOKED  RIGHT AT HIM, AND LEGEND LOOKED  RIGHT AT HIM.  THAT WAS REALLY COOL.  I SAID I'M NOT INVOLVED?  NO, NOT THIS TIME.  HE HAD THIS UNIQUE ABILITY TO  BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE MASSES,  BUT MAKE THEM THINK HE WAS  TALKING TO EACH ONE  INDIVIDUALLY.  IT'S A BAD DAY.  >> YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE  ADVERSITY, AND HE HAD QUITE A  BIT.  OBVIOUSLY, WE KNOW SOME OF THE  CHALLENGES THAT HE FACED WITHIN  HIS MARRIAGE, AND ALL OF THAT  HAPPENING IN THE PUBLIC EYE.  BUT ALSO, HE HAD A LOT OF  INJURIES THAT MADE THINGS VERY  DIFFICULT FOR HIM, THAT HE HAD  TO TRAIN THROUGH, AND OVERCOME.  CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT HE DID,  AND HOW DETERMINED HE WAS TO  BE, TO CONTINUE TO BE KOBE  BRYANT?  >> HE MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST  SINGULARLY FOCUSED INDIVIDUALS  I HAVE EVER MET.  AND THERE ARE OTHERS.  MAGIC IS ANOTHER.  LeBRON IS ANOTHER.  MOHAMMED WAS ANOTHER.  BUT HE'S UP AT THE TOP OF THAT  LIST.  WHEN HE WANTED TO GET  SINGULARLY FOCUSED, I REMEMBER  ONE TIME, THERE WAS A PLAYOFF  GAME IN UTAH.  THAT TEAM WAS PLAYING REALLY  BAD.  HE WENT IN AT HALFTIME, AND  SAID LOOK, IF YOU GUYS DON'T  WANT TO WIN THIS GAME, GET OUT  OF MY WAY, I'LL WIN IT MYSELF.  AND HE DID.  HIS RECOGNITION, AND THINGS  LIKE THAT.  THERE'S ONLY A FEW PEOPLE THAT  WE KNOW, AND ADMIRE, AND LOVE  THAT HAVE ONE NAME.  THEY GO BY ONE NAME, LIKE  MOHAMMED, MAGIC, MICHAEL,  LeBRON, KOBE, TIGER.  HE'S ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT  I KNOW OF, THAT COULD WALK  ACROSS THE STREET AND STOP  TRAFFIC.  THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.  >> WE'RE HERE IN LOS ANGELES.  WE KNOW THE IMPACT OF KOBE  BRYANT IN LOS ANGELES.  HE HAD GLOBAL APPEAL.  GROWING UP IN EUROPE, AND YOU  KNOW SPEAKING ITALIAN, SPEAKING  DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.  TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT.  ABOUT HIS IMPACT ACROSS THE  GLOBE.  NOT JUST HERE IN LOS ANGELES.  >> WELL BECAUSE HE, SUCH AN  INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUAL.  WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM ITALY,  HIS PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE ON  SPORTS AND EVERYTHING WAS LIKE  THIS.  INSTEAD OF, THE NARROW WAY THAT  SOME OF US LOOK AT IT THE WAY  THAT WE DO.  HIS FAMILY WAS THERE FOR HIM.  GOOD, THROUGH GOOD, BAD, AND  INDIFFERENT.  HE WAS A BETTER EDUCATED YOUNG  MAN.  BECAUSE WHEN HE CAME BACK, AND  STARTED GOING TO SCHOOL HERE,  HE COULD SPEAK ITALIAN.  A LOT OF YOUNG KIDS COULDN'T  SPEAK ITALIAN.  MOST OF US HAD TROUBLE JUST  WITH ENGLISH ITSELF.  BUT HE COULD SPEAK ITALIAN.  HE'S AHEAD OF THE CURVE  ALREADY.  THEN HE HAD THIS WONDERFUL GIFT  OF BEING ABLE TO PLAY  BASKETBALL.  AND I REMEMBER THE PERSON THAT  RECOGNIZED HIM AND FOUND HIM  AND REALIZED THAT WAS JERRY  WEST.  WHEN JERRY WEST SAW HIM WORK  OUT, JERRY WEST CAME BACK AND  TOLD EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW WHAT?  I'VE JUST SEEN THE BEST WORKOUT  BY A TEENAGER THAT I'VE EVER  SEEN, AND IT'S KOBE BRYANT.  >> IS THERE A STORY THAT YOU  HAVE A KOBE THAT ISN'T OUT  THERE, JUST A PERSONAL  OBSERVATION THAT YOU HAVE IN  THE YEARS THAT YOU DEALT WITH  HIM THAT YOU'D LIKE TO TELL US,  THAT GIVES A LITTLE INDICATION?  WE ALL KNOW HOW GREAT HE IS,  BUT MAYBE SOMETHING THAT YOU  SAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES.  >> HIS FAMILY.  HIS BRIDE.  HIS DAUGHTERS.  HE WAS, AS FAR AS HAPPY AS WE  WERE FOR HIM THAT HE WAS  RETIRING AND EVERYTHING, HE WAS  HAPPIER FOR HIMSELF, BECAUSE HE  KNEW HE WANTED TO SPEND TIME  WITH HIS DAUGHTERS.  HE STARTED TAKING HIS DAUGHTERS  TO BASKETBALL GAMES, TO SOCCER  GAMES, AND THINGS LIKE THAT.  WE KNOW ABOUT THE STORIES THAT  ARE OUT THERE, BUT WHO IS ON  THE CHOPPER RIGHT NOW, AND SOME  OF THEM ARE GOING TO COME UP.  BUT THE THING THAT I ADMIRED  ABOUT HIM THE MOST, INSPITE OF  ALL THE BASKETBALL THINGS THAT  HE ACCOMPLISHED WAS HIM BEING A  TERRIFIC FAMILY MAN, HUSBAND,  AND FATHER.  WE USED TO TEASE HIM.  HEY MAN, YOU'VE GOT A HOUSE  FULL OF LADIES.  I LOVE IT.  THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP ME ON THE  STRAIGHT AND NARROW.  THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.  >> AND WE WATCHED HIS  DAUGHTER'S GROW UP.  ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS JUST  TURNED 17.  >> YES, YES.  THEY KNEW THEIR PLACE IN  HISTORY, AND THEY KNEW HIS  PLACE IN HISTORY AS WELL.  >> ABSOLUTELY.  AS WE'RE COMING UP ON 1:30 NOW.  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON  THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF KCAL 9,  AND CBS 2. WE'RE COVERING  DEVASTATING NEWS FOR LOS  ANGELES, AND THE AREA, AND THE  ENTIRE WORLD.  HE WAS FIVE PEOPLE KILLED IN A  HELICOPTER CRASH IN CALABASAS.  THAT CRASH WAS FIRST REPORTED  AROUND 10:00 THIS MORNING IN  WILLOW GLEN, AND LAS VIRGINOUS  ROAD.  >> FOUR TIME NBA CHAMPION, 18  TIME ALL-STAR, 20 YEARS WITH  THE LAKERS, HE WON THE SLAM  DUNK CONTEST AS A ROOKIE, HE  WENT STRAIGHT TO THE NBA FROM  HIGH SCHOOL.  TWO OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST.  IT'S JUST AMAZING, HIS CAREER  AND WHAT HE'S DONE, AMEND THAT  HE CONTINUED TO DO AFTER THE  LAKERS.  >> HE CARES.  HE CARED.  WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT  CARES, AND YOU HAVE THAT  QUALITY INSIDE YOU, IT DOESN'T  GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT.  BECAUSE IF YOU CARE ABOUT  YOURSELF, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR  COMMUNITY, YOUR YOUNG PEOPLE.  >> HE WAS A DIFFERENCE MAKER.  I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.  YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR A VERY  LONG TIME.  CERTAINLY WE'VE COVERED TRAGIC  LOSSES BEFORE IN THE SPORTS  WORLD, AND YOU HAVE AS WELL.  WHO WILL WE HEAR FROM NEXT?  WILL WE HEAR FROM THE LAKERS  ORGANIZATION?  DO YOU EXPECT THEY'LL PUT OUT A  STATEMENT?  WILL WE HEAR FROM JEANNIE BUSS?  >> OH, YES.  JEANNIE WAS CRAZY ABOUT KOBE  BRYANT.  SHE WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY  HE STAYED HERE, BECAUSE JEANNIE  CONTINUED THE THING THAT DR.  BUSS TAUGHT HER, HOW TO RUN  THIS PARTICULAR FRANCHISE.  WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM HER.  IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THE  PLAYERS WHEN THEY GET BACK.  THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY BACK, ON  THIS LONG GRAMMY ROAD TRIP.  IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.  YOU TAKE SOMEONE LIKE LeBRON.  WHEN KOBE SHOWED UP AT A  BASKETBALL GAME, LeBRON GOT A  LITTLE MORE PEP IN HIS STEP,  BECAUSE HE KNEW KOBE WAS THERE.  AND WHEN LeBRON WAS GROWING UP,  WHO WAS HIS ROLE MODEL?  KOBE BRYANT.  >> LeBRON SURPASSED HIM IN  KOBE'S HOMETOWN OF  PHILADELPHIA.  >> I REMEMBER DOING AN  INTERVIEW WITH KOBE ON THAT.  WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO  LeBRON, WHEN HE PASSES YOU.  NOT IF, BUT WHEN.  HE SAID OH, HE'S GOING TO DO  THAT.  THE PROFESSIONAL HE IS, HE  TURNED TO THE CAMERA AND  STARTED TALKING, AND STARTED  TALKING, AND STARTED TALKING.  WHEN HE ENDED UP, HE SAID LOVE  YOU BRAH, LIKE LOVE YOU  BROTHER.  THAT'S WHAT THE LAKERS ARE,  THEY ARE A BAND OF BROTHERS.  LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR TEAM.  THIS IS A BAND OF BROTHERS THAT  ARE INTO IT.  WE CAN SAY ALL THE THINGS WE  WANT, ONE OF THE BIGGEST  BROTHERS ON THE LAKERS, TO HAVE  PLAYED FOR THE LAKERS, MAGIC  JOHNSON.  AND MAGIC TALKS ABOUT THIS ALL  THE TIME.  WE ARE A BAND OF BROTHERS, AND  KOBE BRYANT IS ONE OF THOSE  BROTHERS.  >> WE'VE HAD REPORTERS STANDING  BY, OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS HUGE  NEWS FOR THE LOS ANGELES AREA,  TRULY FOR THE COUNTRY.  ONE OF THOSE REPORTERS HAS BEEN  GREG MILLS.  HE'S VERY NEAR WHERE THE CRASH  SITE HAPPENED IN CALABASAS, IT  SEEMS A LARGE CROWD HAS  GATHERED, A LOT OF PEOPLE   SHARING THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT  KOBE.  GREG, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING  OUT THERE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF  MINUTES?  >> Reporter: THIS CROWD HAS  GROWN QUITE A BIT IN THE LAST  FEW MINUTES, SARAH.  I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE  ASKING ME.  THIS IS ALLEN AND DONYE.  YOU GUYS WERE HERE THIS  MORNING, YOU HEARD THE  HELICOPTER, RIGHT?  >> ABSOLUTELY.  I WAS UP THIS MORNING EARLY.  MY SON AND I WERE KIND OF  HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE.  WE KIND OF HEARD A SPUTTER.  IT WAS REALLY LOUD.  I WASN'T SURE WHAT IT WAS, AND  WE KIND OF BLEW IT OFF, BUT  SHORTLY AFTER THAT, MY SON CAME  BACK AND SAID HE STARTED  GETTING TEXT MESSAGES FROM  FRIENDS OF HIS, THAT IT WAS  SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT OR  SOMETHING THAT WENT DOWN.  >> Reporter: WHAT WERE THE  WEATHER CONDITIONS?  >> EARLY IN THE MORNING, IT WAS  FOGGY.  A DENSE FOG.  CLOUDY.  COULDN'T REALLY SEE UP THERE.  >> Reporter: WE GOT UP HERE AT  11:30, AND IT WAS PRETTY FOGGY  THEN.  YOUR THOUGHTS.  YOU GUYS CAME OUT HERE BECAUSE  OF WHO IT WAS, IT WAS KOBE, AND  FOUR OTHERS WHO LOST THEIR  LIVES.  YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS.  >> IT'S TRAGIC, YOU KNOW.  ANOTHER DEATH.  HE WAS CLOSE.  HAD A CLOSE PLACE IN MY HEART.  I WENT TO THE GYM, MAMBA  ACADEMY.  >> Reporter: YOU MET HIM.  >> YEAH.  >> Reporter: IT WASN'T JUST  GUYS.  >> TODDLERS, CHILDREN, A LOT OF  DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES.  >> Reporter: ONE THING THAT  IMPRESSED ME ABOUT THIS GUY HE  HAD FOUR DAUGHTERS, AND HE WAS  REALLY INVESTED IN THEIR  LIVESMENT WE CAN SEE FROM THE  OUTSIDE, TOOK THEM TO WNBA  GAMES.  I THINK HE WENT TO MORE OF  THOSE GAMES THAN HE EVERY WENT  TO STAPLES CENTER.  WANTED TO SHOW THEM, THESE ARE  GREAT ROLE MODELS.  >> HIS DAUGHTERS WERE AT THE  ACADEMY, AND THEY WERE  PARTICIPANTS.  LIKE I SAID, IT'S AN  UNFORTUNATE TRAGEDY.  WHEN I LEFT THIS MORNING, IT  WAS JUST A LITTLE MEDIA BUILD  UP, BUT NOW YOU CAN SEE, PEOPLE  ARE COMING FROM ALL ANGLES.  >> Reporter: ARE YOU STILL IN  DISBELIEF?  I THINK A  LOT OF US ARE.  >> YEAH, STILL IN SHOCK.  WE JUST PRAY FOR HIM AND HIS  FAMILY.  >> Reporter: ALLEN, YOUR LAST  NAME IS.  >> DELANEY.  >> Reporter: WHAT SEPARATED  THIS GUY?  I NOW HE'S NOW FOURTH ON THE  NBA ALL-TIME SCORING LIST, BUT  THERE WAS SOMETHING MAGICAL ABOUT THIS GUY.  >> I RECALL WHEN HE CAME IN THE  LEAGUE.  ABSOLUTELY CHARLOTTE HORNETS  HAD DRAFTED HIM.  THE LAKERS PICKED HIM UP FROM  THAT POINT.  IT WAS A LOT OF SIMILARITIES,  OBVIOUSLY, WITH MICHAEL  JORDAN'S GAME.  I GO BACK A LITTLE BIT WITH DR.  J, SO I KIND OF FOLLOWED A  TREND.  KOBE HAD HIS OWN STYLE, HIS OWN  WAY ABOUT HIM.  JUST TO SEE HIM GO AT 41, IS A  VERY UNFORTUNATE THING.  >> Reporter: WHAT MADE HIM A  STAR THAT STOOD OUT AMONG STARS  FOR YOU?  >> HIS WORK ETHIC.  HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE GYM.  NEVER STOPPED.  TRYING TO GET BETTER, TRYING TO  DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN  OTHER STARS WERE DOING.  AND YEAH, HE WAS SOMETHING  SPECIAL.  >> Reporter: HE WAS DRIVEN.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING  YOUR THOUGHTS.  I'M GOING TO CHECK IN OVER  HERE.  SARAH, AND JEFF, THIS IS A  YOUNG LADY I SAW OVER HERE.  YOU WERE REALLY HAVING A TOUGH  TIME DEALING WITH THIS.  >> YEAH, I'M CHANICE.  >> Reporter: AND YOUR LAST  NAME?  >> CLARK.  >> Reporter: YOU ARE STANDING  OVER HERE, I'M GUESSING  BOYFRIEND, COMFORTING YOU.  YOU WERE DISTRAUGHT.  >> IT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING,  THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO MEANT A  LOT TO L.A., NOT JUST BECAUSE  HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST  TALENTS WHO WILL EVER COME FROM  THIS CITY, BUT HE'S A BIG PART  OF A LOT OF PEOPLE'S PAST  TIMES.  I REMEMBER GOING TO THE GAMES  AS A KID WITH MY DAD, AND WE  WOULD GET THE NOSE BLEEDS AND  BOND.  WHEN HE'S GONE, A LOT OF OUR  MEMORIES FEEL A LITTLE TORN.  >> Reporter: FOR MOST OF US, WE  GET TO DIE WHEN WE'RE GOING TO  BE 95, OR 102, 41 YEARS OLD, A  VIBRANT PERSONALITY.  >> EXACTLY.  I DON'T KNOW HOW HIS WIFE'S  GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS, BUT  I KNOW THE WHOLE CITY OF L.A.  AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IS GOING  TO BE BEHIND HER.  WE'RE JUST GOING TO TRY TO BE  THERE, HOPEFULLY THEY DO  SOMETHING BIG TO REMEMBER HIM,  AND WE FEEL HIM EVERY DAY, BUT  THIS HURTS.  >> Reporter: I SAW YOU JUST  STARING AT THE SMOKE COMING UP  FROM THE WRECKAGE.  THOUGHTS GOING FROM YOUR MIND?  >> IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IF  YOU DON'T SEE IT, YOU DON'T  BELIEVE IT.  I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE CALLING  AND MESSAGING ME, IS THIS REAL?  THERE'S JUST NO WAY.  THERE'S NO WAY.  IT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING.  I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW,  AND I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT,  AND I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT.  >> Reporter: I UNDERSTAND THAT.  ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT YOU'RE  JOINED BY SO MANY KOBE FANS?  >> NOT AT ALL.  I THINK THIS IS JUST THE START.  I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE  REALLY, REALLY CROWDED FOR  QUITE A WHILE.  IT'S JUST GOING TO BE CRAZY FOR  A LONG TIME.  >> Reporter: MY BEST TO YOU.  >> THANKS.  >> Reporter: SARAH, AND JEFF.  >> HEY GREG, WE UNDERSTAND KOBE  WAS TRAVELING WITH THREE  OTHERS, AND KOBE MAKES FOUR.  THE PILOT IS ONE.  THAT'S FIVE ONBOARD THAT  AIRCRAFT.  NONE SURVIVED.  ARE YOU HEARING ANY WORD AT THE  SCENE AS TO WHO MAY HAVE PASSED  AWAY BEYOND KOBE BRYANT?  >> Reporter: I AM.  WHAT I'M HEARING, I'VE HEARD  THAT ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS WAS  ON BOARD WITH HIM, AND A PARENT  OF ANOTHER CHILD THAT WAS A  BASKETBALL PLAYERER AND THAT  CHILD.  AND I ALSO HAVE HEARD THEY WERE  HEADING TO A TOURNAMENT, OR  HEADING NOW BACK FROM A  TOURNAMENT.  THAT IS WHAT I'VE HEARD.  I'VE NOT CONFIRMED THAT, BUT  THAT IS WHAT I'M HEARING.  >> CERTAINLY, WE'RE GOING TO  WORK TO CONFIRM THAT, AND WE  WANT TO WAIT UNTIL WE CONFIRM  THAT INFORMATION BEFORE WE  SHARE IT IN AN OFFICIAL  CAPACITY WITH OUR VIEWERS.  GREG, CERTAINLY IF THAT IS  TRUE, THIS LOSS IS JUST  COMPOUNDED, AND KOBE BRYANT'S  FAMILY, WHO WAS VERY TIGHT  KNIT, AS JIM HALE HAS BEEN  REPORTING, THIS IS A REALLY,  REALLY TOUGH TIME FOR THEM.  I'VE BEEN GETTING TEXTS FROM  FRIENDS ALL AFTERNOON SINCE  THIS HAPPENED.  FAMILY MEMBERS, FRIENDS,  HEARTBROKEN, THEY'RE CRYING.  I GOT ANOTHER TEXT FROM A  FRIEND WHO WAS A BASKETBALL  PLAYER, SHE SAID SHE JUST FEELS  A PIECE OF HER HEART IS GONE.  >> IT'S NOT JUST L.A.  FRIENDS.  I HAVE FRIENDS IN DETROIT, AND  SAN ANTONIO.  I'VE HAD TEXT MESSAGES FROM  THEM ALL EXPRESSING THEIR  CONCERN, AND THEIR DISMAY AS TO  WHAT HAPPENED HER WITH KOBE  BRYANT.  LET'S GO LIVE TO JOY BENEDICT.  WHAT'S THE LATEST THERE, JOY?  DO WE HAVE JOY?  I GUESS NOT.  LET'S CONTINUE TO GIVE YOU THE  LATEST INFORMATION.  IS SHE THERE?  >> SHE'S GOING TO BE JOINING US  IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.  JOY IS IN NEWPORT COAST.  KOBE IS A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF  THAT AREA.  I'VE TALKED TO JIM PERSONALLY  OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS  AND MONTHS ABOUT PEOPLE SEEING  KOBE IN ORANGE COUNTY, AND  STOPPING TRAFFIC AND JUST WHAT  AN AMAZING THING THAT WAS TO  SEE.  >> Reporter: LIKE I MENTIONED A  LITTLE WHILE AGO, HE'S ONE OF  THE FEW PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER  KNOWN THAT CAN WALK ACROSS THE  STREET AND STOP TRAFFIC.  PEOPLE WOULD JUST HOLLER AND  SCREAM, KOBE, KOBE, KOBE.  I WOULD SEE YOUNG KIDS BREAK  AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS AND  START RUNNING TOWARDS HIM.  TO HECK WITH TRAFFIC AND STUFF  LIKE THAT.  AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT,  THAT I RESPECT THE MOST, I CALL  HIM, IF YOU'RE FAMILY WITH  ASTROLOGY.  HE'S LIKE THAT SHINING STAR,  DISCOVERED KOBE.  JERRY WEST.  JERRY IS WITH US NOW.  I APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US  TODAY, MY FRIEND, BECAUSE THIS  IS, I KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH DAY  FOR ALL OF US, BUT ESPECIALLY  FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU WERE THE  ONE THAT DISCOVERED KOBE.  >> JIM, I REALLY DIDN'T  DISCOVER KOBE, OKAY?  HE WAS A GREAT YOUNG HIGH  SCHOOL PLAYER IN THAT TIME, IT  WASN'T IN VOGUE TO DRAFT  PLAYERS LIKE THAT.  I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING  HIS AGENT HERE, AND MYSELF WERE  WORKING THROUGH THE DRAFT UNTIL  HE BECAME A LAKER.  AND THOSE WERE VERY EXCITING  MOMENTS FOR US TO GET A YOUNG  CHARISMATIC KID LIKE HIM, BUT  MORE IMPORTANTLY, A UNIQUE  TALENT.  IT WAS A START OF A LONG, I  DON'T SAY PROCESS, BUT THE  START OF A LONG FRIENDSHIP, AND  WORKING RELATIONSHIP.  AND TO HEAR THIS NEWS THIS  MORNING, FRANKLY AT FIRST I WAS  SHOCKED.  AND THEN AFTER A WHILE, IT  REALLY SUNK IN, AND YOU KNOW,  TO SEE THE TRANSFORMATION OF  HIM FROM A 17-YEAR-OLD KID WHO  USED TO SPEND TIME AT MY HOUSE  WITH ME, TO MY SON RYAN DRIVING  HIM AROUND, BECAUSE HE COULDN'T  DRIVE.  HE COULDN'T EVEN SIGN A  CONTRACT BECAUSE HE WAS TOO  YOUNG.  TO HIM, THE CONSTANT QUESTIONS  ABOUT THE NBA.  WANTING ME TO GO TO A GYM WITH  HIM TO WATCH HIM WORK OUT, AND  MAYBE MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO HIM.  IT WAS MORE THAN, I REALLY FELT  LIKE A SURROGATE FATHER TO HIM.  THEN AS HIS CAREER BLOSSOMED,  AND HE STARTED TO ESTABLISH  THIS ENORMOUS REPUTATION AS A  PLAYER, AND ALSO FILLED WITH  ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  BUT HIS CHARISMA ON TOP OF IT  WAS SOMETHING THAT MOST GREAT  PLAYERS DON'T HAVE.  AND HE HAD IT.  BUT TO WAKE UP TO THIS NEWS,  THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST  HORRIBLE DAYS OF OUR LIFE.  I FELT LIKE I'VE LOST A SON.  AND FRANKLY NOT DOING VERY  WELL.  >> YEAH, JERRY, I KNOW.  THERE'S ONLY A FEW PEOPLE THAT  HAVE HAD A REALLY INTIMATE  RELATIONSHIP WITH KOBE, AND YOU  ARE ONE OF THEM, BECAUSE YOU  WERE WITH HIM THERE THROUGH THE  GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE  INDIFFERENT.  >> WELL JIM, YOU KNOW IT WASN'T  ALL ROSY.  IT NEVER IS.  AND PARTICULARLY FOR SOMEONE  LIKE HIM WHO WAS SO ANXIOUS FOR  SUCCESS.  AND I REMEMBER ONE PERSONAL  THING I REMEMBER, I SAID TO HIM  AFTER A GAME, WHEN HE PLAYED I  SAID MAN, YOU LOOK A LITTLE  TIRED TONIGHT, AND HE SAID TO  ME, I JUST PROPOSED TO  HOPEFULLY MY NEW WIFE.  AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT  MOMENT.  IT WAS IN THE LOCKER ROOM,  RIGHT AFTER A GAME.  AND TO SEE HIM GET MARRIED,  HAVE CHILDREN, AND CHANGE A  CAREER SO DRASTICALLY TO WHERE  HE WAS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN  THIS WORLD, NOT AS AN ATHLETE,  BUT AS A VERY BRIGHT PERSON.  HIS INTEREST IN WOMEN IN TERMS  OF HIS BASKETBALL ACADEMY.  THE PRIDE HE TOOK INTO THOSE  THINGS.  AND TO SEE THAT ALL TAKEN.  AND HIS FAMILY, MY GOD, I JUST,  THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE  SOME REALLY STRONG PEOPLE OUT  THERE SUPPORTING THEM, BECAUSE  THIS IS THE WORST NEWS YOU  COULD EVER GET.  >> I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT,  JERRY.  AND YOU KNEW HIM BETTER THAN  ANYONE.  THE OTHER THING IS HE CAME TO  YOU FOR ADVICE NOT ONLY FOR  BASKETBALL, BUT JUST ABOUT  GROWING AND MATURING INTO A  YOUNG MAN RESPONSIBLE TO HIS  FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY AS  WELL, DIDN'T HE?  >> WELL JIM, YOU KNOW, I DON'T  WANT TO GO AROUND SAYING I WAS  RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS LIFE,  PERIOD, I DON'T, BECAUSE THAT  WOULD BE MOSTLY UNFAIR.  BUT THE THING I WILL SHARE WITH  YOU IS HOW TO ME, THE THINGS I  SAW HIM, THAT MATURITY THAT I  SAW HIM GROW INTO, I SAW HIM  GROW UP.  I SAW HIM DEAL WITH PRESS THAT  WAS NEGATIVE AT TIMES, BECAUSE  HE PLAYED THE GAME WITH A  FLAIR, AND ANYTIME YOU PLAY THE  GAME WITH A FLAIR, YOU'RE  SUSCEPTIBLE TO MAKING MISTAKES.  BUT I WAS HIS BIGGEST  SUPPORTER, BUT ALSO I HAD SOME  VERY SERIOUS TALKS WITH HIM  ABOUT HOW HE NEEDS TO CHANGE  HIS GAME A LITTLE BIT TO BE  ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE HIMSELF  WITH HIS OTHER TEAMMATES.  BUT I THINK THE THING THAT  BROUGHT ME GREAT JOY WAS TO  WATCH HIM WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS  KIDS.  IT WAS TRULY INSPIRING TO SEE.  HE LIVED IN A WORLD OF  TESTOSTERONE, OKAY? AS ALL ATHLETES DO.  FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE  THE ATHLETIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS  WITH HIS PERSONAL  ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  THIS WAS A BRILLIANT KID.  THIS WASN'T SOME ATHLETE WHO  JUST HAPPENED TO BE A GREAT  BASKETBALL PLAYER.  HE WAS MORE THAN THAT.  IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME  FOR ME TO GET OVER THIS ONE.  >> WHY DO YOU THINK HE WAS  STILL SO BELOVED TODAY, EVEN  THOUGH HE'S BEEN OUT OF THE  GAME FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS?  >> JIM, I THINK PLAYERS THAT  PLAY THE GAME WITH A FLAIR, YOU  SEE A LOT OF GREAT PLAYERS THAT  PLAY THE GAME, LOOK AT ABDUL- JABBAR'S CAREER.  HE JUST HAD A DIFFERENT  PERSONALITY.  AND YOU CAN ARGUABLY SAY HE HAD  THE GREATEST CAREER OF ANYONE.  BUT YET PEOPLE I DON'T THINK  WILL EQUATE AND LOOK AT THEM  THE SAME WAY THEY DO AS ERVIN  JOHNSON.  HE PLAYED THE GAME WITH A  FLAIR.  HE HAD A BIG RELATIONSHIP WITH  THE FANS, STILL DO.  HE'S BIGGER THAN LIFE.  AND KOBE'S LEGACY, IT WILL  REMAIN FOREVER.  HIS IMPACT WILL REMAIN FOREVER.  BUT MY GOD, I JUST FEEL SO  HORRIBLE FOR HIS FAMILY.  >> AND FOR AS GREAT A  BASKETBALL PLAYER AS HE WAS,  JERRY, AND I'VE SAID MANY  TIMES, AND I'VE HEARD YOU SAY  IT TOO, HE WAS A BETTER FAMILY  MAN, A HUSBAND AND FATHER.  MAN, HE LOVED THOSE LADIES IN  HIS HOME.  >> WELL, ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS  SEE THEM WITH HIM.  THAT'S ALL YOU HAD TO DO.  I ONCE KIDDED HIM ONE TIME  AFTER HE HAD A COUPLE GIRLS,  AND AGAIN, I WAS NOT, I'M NOT  SOMEONE WHO GOES AROUND, AND  COMMUNICATES WITH PLAYERS, EX- PLAYERS, OKAY?  I DON'T THINK THAT'S MY  POSITION IN THIS WORLD.  I JUST KNOW THE ADMIRATION I  HAVE FOR THE PLAYERS HAVE  REALLY ACHIEVED SOMETHING  SPECIAL, BUT SOMETIMES THE ONES  WHO HAVEN'T.  BUT WITH HIM, AS I SAY, HE HAD  A LITTLE EXTRA GOLD DUST  SPRINKLED ON HIM.  I WAS KIDDING HIM.  I SAID YOU'RE NOT A MAN, YOU  HAVE ALL THESE WOMEN IN YOUR  LIFE.  OF COURSE HE LAUGHED AT IT.  BUT TO THINK THAT I WON'T SEE  HIM, TO THINK HIS FAMILY WON'T  SEE HIM, PEOPLE WHO LOVED HIM.  PEOPLE ADMIRED HIM.  JUST GOD AWFUL.  >> HE WAS A GIFT, WASN'T HE,  JERRY?  >> JIM, HE WAS DEFINITELY A  GIFT.  YES, HE WAS.  AS YOU SAY, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN  A KID IS BORN, WHAT IT'S GOING  TO BE.  EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A SON OF A  BASKETBALL PLAYER, YOU JUST,  IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HIS  EXCELLENCE, HIS YOU KNOW PEOPLE  CALL HIM MAMBA MENTALITY.  I DON'T.  I DON'T.  HE WAS JUST BORN WITH AN  INCREDIBLE DESIRE TO WIN, IT  HAD NOTHING WITH HIS MENTALITY.  I JUST WANTED TO WIN AT ALL  COST.  AND HE WOULD WIN AT ALL COST.  HE LAYED HIS LIFE ON THE LINE  EVERY NIGHT WHEN IT CAME TO  WINNING.  LOSING WAS NOT IN HIS  VOCABULARY.  AND WITH A LOT OF GREAT  PLAYERS.  BUT HE JUST HAD THIS PERSONA  THAT VERY FEW HAVE.  A LOT OF DESIRE.  AND A LOT WILL NEVER HAVE, EVEN  THOUGH THEY'VE HAD GREAT  CAREERS.  >> JERRY, WOULD YOU SAY HE WAS  ONE OF THE MOST SINGULARLY  FOCUSED ATHLETES YOU'VE EVER  BEEN AROUND.  >> YES, JIM, AND I THINK IN  TODAY'S DAY AND AGE, AND  PARTICULARLY THE MORE SOCIAL  MEDIA THAT WE HAVE TODAY, IT  GETS TALKED ABOUT SO MUCH,  OKAY?  BUT THERE'S OTHER PLAYERS THAT  HAVE HAD THAT SAME FOCUS.  I THINK BECAUSE HE TALKED ABOUT  PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT  DROVE HIM, AND HE TALKED ABOUT  IT A LOT MORE.  BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PLAYERS  THAT HAVE IT, BUT THEY DON'T  HAVE THAT PERSONA.  THEY JUST DON'T HAVE IT.  AND GOD THAT WILL BE MISSED IN  THIS CITY, OH, MY GOODNESS.  FOR ME, I STARTED OFF IN  DISBELIEF, AND NOW I'M IN  ANOTHER PLACE.  AND IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE.  >> HE WAS ALSO, JERRY, ONE OF  THE FEW INDIVIDUALS THAT WE  KNOW THAT WHEN HE WALKED ACROSS  THE STREET, HE REALLY DIDN'T  STOP TRAFFIC, DIDN'T HE?  >> AGAIN, AS I SAID BEFORE,  THERE'S CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT  HAVE THAT.  AND MAGIC JOHNSON, SAME WAY.  THE SAME WAY.  AND THE PEOPLE OF LOS ANGELES  HAVE BEEN BLESSED TO SEE SOME  INCREDIBLY GIFTED PLAYERS, AND  HE WAS HOME-GROWN.  ERVIN JOHNSON WAS HOME-GROWN.  THEY MEAN SO MUCH TO THEIR  COMMUNITIES.  SO MUCH TO THE YOUNG CHILDREN  LOOKING FOR SOMETHING POSITIVE  IN THEIR LIVES.  AS I SAY, THIS IS JUST REALLY  HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE.  I JUST WANT TO GO TO BED, AND  THINK THAT THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.  >> JERRY, AND WHEN HE RETIRED,  HE WAS READY.  THERE ARE A LOT OF GUYS WHO ARE  FORCED INTO RETIREMENT.  THERE ARE SOME GUYS WHO KIND OF  ADJUST TO RETIREMENT, BUT HE  WAS READY FOR RETIREMENT.  IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH,  EVERYTHING YOU TOLD HIM, AND  TAUGHT HIM CAME TO FRUITION,  WHEN HE SAID MAMBA OUT, HE WAS  READY TO GO.  >> JIMMY, IT'S NOT WHAT I  TAUGHT HIM.  YOUR BODY TEACHES YOU WHAT IT  IS.  YOUR BODY TALKS TO YOU ALL THE  TIME WHEN YOU'RE AN ATHLETE.  PEOPLE SEE ATHLETES PERFORM AT  THIS ENORMOUSLY HIGH LEVEL, AND  THEY CAN'T JACK IT UP EVERY  NIGHT, REGARDLESS OF HOW GIFTED  THEY ARE.  THEY CAN GO OUT THERE AND GET  NUMBERS THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN  DO, AND INFLUENCE THE GAME, BUT  SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, YOUR  WILL GETS TESTED BECAUSE YOU  JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE, THAT YOU  CAN COMPETE AT THAT LEVEL EVERY  NIGHT, AS YOU GET OLDER.  BUT AS I SAY, THIS IS, I'VE HAD  A LOST A BROTHER IN A WAR AT 19  YEARS OF AGE, AND TO LOSE  SOMEONE THAT I LOVED AND  ADMIRED.  NOT EASY.  >> YEAH, JERRY WE'VE JUST BEEN  TOLD THAT HIS DAUGHTER, GIANA  WAS ON THAT PLANE WITH HIM.  >> I HAD HEARD THAT  UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S ONE WHO  YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE WITH HIM IN  PICTURES.  MY WIFE WAS JUST GOING THROUGH  SOME PICTURES OF ME AND MY KIDS  WITH HIM, WHEN HE WAS A PUPPY.  AND YOU KNOW, JUST THINK BACK  THOSE DAYS, CAREFREE, HAPPY.  BRIGHT EYED YOUNG MAN.  BUT A TEENAGER.  FRANKLY, I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW  THAT.  >> JERRY, WHAT'S THE LIFE  LESSON?  YOU'VE BEEN TEACHING YOUR  PLAYERS WHEN THEY'RE IN THE  LEAGUE, WHAT'S THE LIFE LESSON  TO LEARN FROM THE LIFE OF KOBE  BRYANT?  >> HARD WORK.  DEDICATION BEYOND MANY.  AND THIS ENORMOUS DESIRE TO  SUCCEED.  AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE  SUCCESSFUL, A LOT OF PEOPLE  TALK A GOOD GAME, AND THEY MAKE  THEMSELF BIGGER IN A NEWSPAPER  THAN THEY REALLY ARE.  HE LIVED IT.  HE DID IT.  AND AS I SAY, HE SHOULD BE AN  INSPIRATION FOR ALL.  YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE'S  DETERMINATION IN A GAME.  YOU COULD SEE HIS.  AND YOU WATCH THAT AND THOSE  ARE THE PLAYERS THAT I ADMIRE  MOST.  SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE HIS  SKILL.  BUT THOSE ARE THE PLAYERS I  ADMIRE MOST.  I'M NOT INTO FLASHY PLAYERS,  I'M NOT INTO PEOPLE WHO LOOK  PRETTY.  I'M INTO RESULTS.  BUT HE HAPPENED TO BE PRETTY TO  WATCH.  MY GOD, THE RESULTS HE GOT WERE  ENORMOUS.  AND FOR THE PEOPLE IN LOS  ANGELES TO WATCH THIS FOR 20  YEARS, A LOT OF FAMILIES GREW  UP WITH HIM, OKAY.  A LOT.  AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE  INSPIRED BY HIM AND HE IS, I  THINK HE WILL INSPIRE MORE  PEOPLE NOW, JIMMY.  I THINK HE'LL BE, HE'LL BE  REVERED FOREVER.  >> AND IT'S AMAZING, THE EFFECT  THAT HE HAS AND HE NOT ONLY  HAD, BUT HE STILL HAS ON  PLAYERS OF TODAY.  I KNOW THAT WHEN HE GOES TO A  LAKER GAME, AND HE'S SITTING AT  COURT SIDE, OR WHEN HE COMES TO  ONE OF YOUR GAMES WITH THE  CLIPPERS, THE PLAYERS REALLY,  THEY DON'T WANT TO LET KOBE  DOWN.  THEY PLAY EVEN HARDER, TRYING  TO, IF NOTHING ELSE, JUST TO  IMPRESS HIM.  LIKE WE JUST HAD ON THE AIR, A  PICTURE OF LeBRON GOING OVER  AND TALKING TO HIM COURTSIDE  BEFORE THE GAME.  >> AS I SAY, JIMMY, PLAYERS  LIKE THIS TRANSCEND TIME.  THEY REALLY DO.  IT'S WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED  BEFORE THEM.  PEOPLE WHO GROW UP, AND WANT TO  WALK AWAY FROM THE GAME HAVE  THAT KIND OF ACCEPTANCE FROM  THE FANS.  BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN YOU  HAVE ACCEPTANCE FROM THE  PLAYERS, THAT'S WHAT'S MOST  IMPORTANT.  THE ONES WHO DON'T HAVE THAT  PERCEPTION WITH THE PLAYERS ARE  THE ONES WHO ARE NOT THE REAL  PEOPLE.  WHEN I SAY REAL PEOPLE, I'M  TALKING ABOUT THE REAL PLAYERS.  HE WAS TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN,  PERIOD.  THAT'S WHO HE WAS.  >> I REMEMBER, I THINK IT WAS  AGAINST UTAH.  MAN, THE LAKERS WERE REALLY  STRUGGLING AND HAVING DIFFICULT  PROBLEMS ON THE FLOOR.  KOBE WENT IN AT HALFTIME AND  SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS?  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WIN THIS  GAME, GET OUT OF MY WAY, AND  I'LL WIN IT MYSELF.  >> WELL I'LL NEVER FORGET  PLAYING AGAINST UTAH, AND THAT  GAME IN PARTICULAR, I THINK  THAT CHANGED THE   >>> YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING  COVERAGE FROM CBSN LOS ANGELES.  NBA LEGEND KOBE BRYANT DIED IN  A HELICOPTER CRASH IN CALABASAS, CALIFORNIA.  TRIBUTES ARE POURING IN FOR THE  FORMER LAKERS SUPERSTAR. HE  RETIRED IN 2016 AFTER SPENDING  20 YEARS WITH THE LOS ANGELES  LAKERS.  HE WAS ONE OF FIVE PEOPLE  KILLED IN A CRASH. IT REMAINS  UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME, WHO ELSE  WAS ON BOARD.  HE WAS THE FOURTH LEADING  SCORER IN NBA HISTORY. IN  ADDITION TO HIS FIVE TITLES  WITH THE FRANCHISE, HE WAS ALSO  SELECTED TO THE ALL-STAR TEAM  ATE TIMES AND WON THE MVP IN  2000 A. WE ARE AWAITING A PRESS  CONFERENCE FROM LOS ANGELES  COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.  WE WILL BRING INTO YOU LIVE, AS  SOON AS IT HAPPENS.  FIRST, NBA ANALYST WRITER JOINS  ME BY PHONE FROM LOS ANGELES.  WHAT MORE HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT  THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING  THE CRASH?>> WE WILL GET THE  OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION IN A FEW  MOMENTS, WHEN THE PRESS  CONFERENCE BEGINS.  AT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED  UNFORTUNATELY, IN MULTIPLE  REPORTS, THAT AMONG THOSE, WHO  DIED IN THE CRASH, INCLUDE KOBE  BRYANT 13-YEAR-OLD, AND OLDEST  DAUGHTER, ONE OF HER TEAMMATES,  AND A PARENT, IT WAS KOBE  BRYANT AND HIS DAUGHTER AND ONE  OF HER TEAMMATES, WHO WERE  HEADED IN HIS HELICOPTER ONE OF  HER YOUTH BASKETBALL GAMES.  >> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US, AS  NEWS HAS SPREAD ABOUT THIS  TRAGIC CRASH.  WHAT IMPACT HAS HIS DEATH HAD  AMONG NOT JUST FANS, BUT IN THE  BROADER SPORTS WORLD.  THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH.  >> A PUBLIC MORNING ACROSS THE  SPORTS WORLD.  ONE OF THE GREATEST SOCCER  PLAYERS TO SCORE A GOAL.  THE ONLY NBA GAME UNDER THE  WEIGHT IS IN TRANTER.  THEY TO:24 SHOT CLOCK VIOLATION  FOR KOBE BRYANT.  WITH THE FAMOUS ATHLETES IN  MORNING.  MY KIDS WERE DOWN AT THE BEACH.  AS THE NEWS BROKE, THERE WAS  SILENCE WITH TEENAGERS AND  ADULTS TALKING IN SHOCKED TONES  ABOUT HOW IT CANNOT BE REAL.  HERE IN LOS ANGELES, AND BEYOND, THERE IS A QUIET LEVEL OF  SHOCK, AS THE REALITY -- WILL  DO OUR BEST TO PROCESS IT.  AND MAKE SENSE OF IT.  >> WHY DO YOU THINK KOBE BRYANT  WAS SUCH A BELOVED FIGURE? IN  LOS ANGELES, YES, BUT NOT JUST  L.A.  I WAS LOOKING ON TWITTER AT  LeBRON JAMES AND HIS COMMENTS  FROM JUST LAST NIGHT.  HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS  REFLECTIONS, SEEING KOBE  BRYANT.  THIS WAS BEFORE THE HELICOPTER  CRASHED.  THE INSPIRATION, THAT HE DREW  FROM WATCHING KOBE BRYANT ON  THE POSSIBLE COURT.  >> IT IS A GREAT QUESTION.  HE RESONATED THE LANGUAGE OF SO  MANY PEOPLE.  IT IS RARE, RIGHT?  THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF ALL- TIME GREATNESS AND AS A PASQUO  PLAYER, HE WAS.  AND BEING A VERY, VERY  COMPLICATED HUMAN BEING.  IF YOU COMPETED AGAINST KOBE  BRYANT, HE WANTED TO DESTROY  \u00faYOUR SELF-CONFIDENCE, YOUR WEL- BEING AND ANY BELIEF YOU HAD  THAT YOU COULD BEAT HIM ON THE  FLOOR.  YET, THERE WAS A REMARKABLE  CHARM AWAY FROM IT.  HE WAS THE MOST BELOVED SPORTS  FIGURE BY A WIDE MARGIN IN LOS  ANGELES.  THE CONNECTION THAT HE HAD WAS  SO POWERFUL. ALMOST CULT LIKE  AN EMOTIONAL.  IN HIS LIFE, HE HAD DARK  MOMENTS.  INCLUDING ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL  ASSAULT.  HE WAS A BASKETBALL PLAYER, AND  ALSO, A RENAISSANCE MAN IN  BUSINESS.  IN ART.  HE SPOKE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.  HE WENT ABROAD IN ITALY WITH  HIS FAMILY.  HE WAS A COMPLICATED GUY. IF  YOU TRY TO SAY KOBE BRYANT WAS  ONE THING, YOU ARE MISSING THE  50 OTHER THINGS THAT DEFINED  HIM.  AS A FATHER AND A PARENT, WHICH  MAKES US EVEN MORE TRAGIC THAN  IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN,  KOBE BRYANT, WAS A DAD.  IT TOOK SOME OF THE ROUGH SPOTS  OFF.  IT GAVE HIM SOME PERSPECTIVE.  WHAT IT DID FOR HIM AS AN  INDIVIDUAL, YOU CAN SEE THE  LOVE HE HAD FOR HIS CHILDREN.  THE LAST TIME I SAW KOBE BRYANT  IN PERSON, HE WAS WITH HIS  OLDEST DAUGHTER, WHO HAS PASSED  AWAY IN THE FLIGHT TODAY.  ALL OF THESE THINGS, IT IS THE  INGREDIENTS THAT WENT INTO KOBE  BRYANT.  AND MADE HIM LIKABLE AND IN THE  END, IT ADDED UP TO A LEVEL OF  RESPECT FOR HIS TALENT, HIS  MIND AND FORM ABILITY.  AND WHO HE BECAME AS A FATHER.  IT IS ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT  PEOPLE ARE MORNING TODAY.  >> WHAT KIND OF A PRESENCE DID  HE RETAIN IN THE LOS ANGELES  AREA?  EVEN THE FACT THAT IN THE END,  HE DID NOT PLAY SINCE 2016?  >> YOU WOULD THINK HE WAS THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  WHEN YOU SAW HIM WALK THROUGH  STAPLES CENTER OR BE SOMEWHERE.  THE LAST GAME I WENT TO, A FEW  WEEKS AGO, WHEN KOBE BRYANT WAS  THERE, LeBRON JAMES IS IN THE  BUILDING.  HE IS A BIG STAR.  IF MEMORY SERVES, IT MAY HAVE  BEEN RIHANNA.  SOME SUPERSTARS WERE THERE.  ANTHONY DAVIS IS A BIG DEAL.  IT IS A WHO IS WHO.  WHEN KOBE BRYANT WALKED IN, NOT  EVEN WHEN HE WALKED IN.  YOU COULD FEEL THE RIPPLE IN  THE BUILDING.  PEOPLE STARTED TO WHISPER, KOBE  IS COMING.  WHEN HE WALKED OUT OF THE TUNNEL , NEAR THE FLOOR, THERE WAS NOT  A GASP.  JUSTIN EXCLAMATION. YOU WOULD  THINK A GROUP OF PEOPLE WERE  WATCHING SOMEONE WALK ON WATER  TO WATCH KOBE BRYANT WALK ONTO  THE FLOOR.  HIS IMPACT, HIS CONNECTION. HIS  HOLD ON THE CITY.  IT WAS ABSOLUTE AND SO  AUTHENTIC.  IT LASTED WELL BEYOND. LOS  ANGELES IS A TOWN WHERE YOU  CANNOT OFFER SOMETHING ANYMORE.  IT WAS NOT TRUE FOR KOBE.  THERE WAS AN EMOTIONAL  CONNECTION BEYOND WHAT HE COULD  DO AS A BASKETBALL PLAYER.  THAT IS PART OF WHAT IS BEING  PROCESSED AND DEALT WITH IN  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  >> I WONDER IF YOU CAN TALK  ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT WAS AN  ACTIVE RETIREMENT FOR HIM AS  WELL.  IN FACT, IN THOSE YEARS AFTER  LEAVING BASKETBALL AS A PLAYER,  HE WAS VERY MUCH KEEPING A BUSY  SCHEDULE.  INCLUDING COACHING HIS  DAUGHTER'S TEAM.  >> THERE ARE A LOT OF NBA  PLAYERS AND FORMER ATHLETES,  WHO RETIRE YOUNG.  YOU GET TO FILL YOUR TIME.  MANY OF THEM TAKE UP GOLF.  THAT WOULD NOT BE KOBE BRYANT.  HE HAD AND NEED TO WIN AND FEEL  ALIVE.  IT DEFINED HIS POST-PLAYING  CAREER.  HE WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL  ENTREPRENEUR.  MOVING INTO MOVIES AND  PRODUCTION.  AS THE COACH OF HIS DAUGHTER'S  TEAM. SHE HAD AN AMAZING TALENT . SHE WAS THE PRIDE FOR HER DAD  OF WHAT SHE WAS BECOMING.  HE CONTINUED TO BE AGGRESSIVELY  INVOLVED IN THE THINGS THAT  MATTER TO HIM.  HIS DAUGHTER'S BASKET TEAM.  BEING A FATHER.  SOME OF THE ENTREPRENEURIAL  VENTURES HE WAS A PART OF.  I HAVE COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS  WHO TRY TO PITCH IDEAS TO HIS  PRODUCTION COMPANY.  A COUPLE SETS OF FRIENDS  MARVELED.  THE APTITUDE AND SHREWDNESS AND  COMPETITIVENESS WITH WHICH HE  CAME TO THE MEETINGS.  HE WANTED TO WIN I WANTED TO BE  SUCCESSFUL.  YOU ARE CORRECT.  HE WAS NOT A LAKER AS A PLAYER  ANYMORE.  EVERYTHING WAS IN HIS PLAYING  DAYS, HE POURED INTO HIS FAMILY  AS A FATHER.  INTO YOUTH BASKET WILL GAMES.  INTO HIS PRODUCTION COMPANY AND  MYRIAD PROJECTS.  WE ALL TRY TO LIVE LIFE AND  SEES THE DATE WHAT WE CAN.  HE DID IT EVERY SINGLE MOMENT  AND EVERY ENDEAVOR HE WAS  ENGAGED IN.  SACRAMENTO LET VIEWERS KNOW WE  ARE KEEPING OUR EYE ON THE  PICTURE THERE ON THE RIGHT-HAND  PART OF YOUR SCREEN.  CALABASAS, CALIFORNIA, WHERE WE  EXPECT LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO  HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE WITHIN  THE HOUR.  THAT IS WHAT WE UNDERSTAND.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT AND BRING YOU THAT NEWS  CONFERENCE AS SOON AS IT  HAPPENS.  YOU MENTIONED EARLIER BEING  THERE ON THE BEACH AND HAVING  STUNNED SILENCE DISSENT AROUND  YOU, WHERE PEOPLE WERE JUST  LEARNING OF THE DEATH OF KOBE  BRYANT.  WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NEXT TWO  DAYS IN LOS ANGELES WILL BE  LIKE.  >> NOT TO SOUND TRITE, BUT IT  WILL BE THE STAGES OF GRIEF.  I AM A SPORTS CASTER. MY  FRIENDS ARE ALWAYS TEXTING ME  ABOUT SPORTS.  PEOPLE SAID WE DO NOT BELIEVE  THIS, IT CANNOT BE TRUE.  AS MORE CAME IN, THIS CANNOT BE  TRUE.  AND NOW, AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE,  THE SHOCK OF IT.  I REALLY BELIEVE IT WILL BE A  TOUGH MORNING.  THERE WILL BE PEOPLE CRYING IN  THE STREETS.  LOSS OF LIFE AND DEATH AS PART  OF THE DEAL IS YOU AND BE AS.  FOR DAPA TO KOBE BRYANT IN THE  CITY AT THE AGE HE WAS AT, 41,  WHICH IS MY AGE.  WITH HIS DAUGHTER ON BOARD, IT  WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST  DIFFICULT, EMOTIONAL COLLECTIVE  MOMENTS LOS ANGELES IS EVER  HAD.  >> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TREATED  REGARDING THE NEWS AS WELL.  WE WILL SHOW OUR VIEWERS THAT  WE.  WE SHOULD YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  TWEET EARLIER.  YOU SEE THE TWEET FROM  PRESIDENT OBAMA.  KOBE BRYANT WAS A LEGEND ON THE  COURT AND JUST GETTING STARTED.  WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS  MEANINGFUL WAS A SECOND ACT.  TO LOSE GIANNA BRYANT IS JUST  AS NAVAL.  WE SEND OUR LOVE AND PRAYERS TO  VANESSA BRIAN AND THE ENTIRE  FAMILY ON AN UNTHINKABLE DAY.  YOU TOUCHED ON THIS A MOMENT  AGO.  THE EFFECT THAT HAVING FAMILY,  PARTICULARLY BEING A FATHER TO  DOCTORS THAT YOU SAW PERHAPS IT  WAS A FACTOR IN THE EVOLUTION  OF KOBE BRYANT.  I WONDER IF YOU TALK MORE ABOUT  THAT?  EARLIER, WHEN WE WERE LISTENING  TO OUR CBSN LOS ANGELES  STATION, THEY HAD JERRY WEST,  WHO TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE SAW AS  A PROFOUND INFLUENCE IN KOBE  BRYANT BECOMING A FATHER.  >> IT IS RIGHT.  AS A FATHER OF A DAUGHTER, WHO  IS 10 YEARS OLD, I CAN RELATE.  WHEN YOU ARE A MAN AND YOU TRY  TO MAKE A PERSON AND A GOOD  HUMAN BEING AND A HUSBAND YOU  THINK YOU UNDERSTAND, YOU GET A  RUDE AWAKENING WHEN YOU HAVE A  LITTLE GIRL.  >> HE WAS SURROUNDED.  >> YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY WORRIES AND ALL OF YOU NEVER IMAGINED.  AND FRANKLY, BY A PERSPECTIVE  ON WHAT IT IS, INC.  IS THE FATHER, A YOUNG WOMAN  YOU NEVER UNDERSTOOD.  KOBE BRYANT HAVE TALKED ABOUT  THIS.  HE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE COMING  UP TO HIM WHEN HIS DAUGHTER WAS  STANDING NEXT TO HIM.  AND SAYING TO KOBE BRYANT,  WOULD YOU GET A SON TO CONTINUE  THE LEGACY.  SHE SNAPPED BACK, I GOT THAT  COVERED.  YOU COULD JUST SEE KOBE TELLING  THAT STORY AS YOU WATCH THE  CLIP ON LATE-NIGHT.  NOT JUST BE QUIET MY MAN.  MY DAUGHTER GETS ITS AND I GET  HE  FOR ANY COMPLICATED MAN, WHEN  YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER, AND IN THE  BRIDE'S CASE, MANY DOCTORS.  YOU HAVE A LEVEL OF OF THE CAN  ONLY AFFECT YOU.  I LIKED KOBE BRYANT.  HE WAS CHARMING.  HE HAD AN EDGE TO HIM.  HE HAD A COMPETITIVE FIRE.  IT WAS DIFFERENT.  IT WAS CONTAINED AND CHANNELED.  THERE WAS AN OVERWHELMING  AMOUNT OF LOVE THAT CAME WITH  IT.  THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM, IT WAS  HIS DAUGHTER WHO HE BROUGHT  WITH HIM.  IT WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT WHERE  HE GOT A STANDING OVATION.  THEY SHARED IT TOGETHER.  MAYBE HE WAS ALWAYS A COMPLETE  MAN AND WE DO NOT SEE IT.  IN THE PUBLIC EYE, THERE WAS A  COMPLETENESS.  THERE WAS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL  REALITY AND SEEING HIM AS A  LOVING, DOTING FATHER, CREATED,  FOR THOSE OF US WHO SOME IS A  COMPETITIVE AS WELL, SOMETHING  ELSE.  >> EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON, WE  TO \"CBS THIS MORNING\" SATURDAY,  THE CO-HOST HAD JUST SAT DOWN  WITH KOBE BRYANT TO TALK ABOUT  THE CHAPTER HE WAS IN NOW.  WHICH IS FOCUSING ON BEING A  STORYTELLER.  WHICH WOULD BE SURPRISING FOR  SOME FOLKS WHO MAY NOT HAVE  REALIZED THE DEPTH OF FEELING  THAT KOBE BRYANT HAD FOR THE  PARTICULAR ISSUE.  TRY TO TELL STORIES.  CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT AT  ALL ABOUT THAT?  IT SEEMED TO BE AN AREA OF  FOCUS THAT WAS JUST AS A  INTENSE IS WHAT HE HAD DONE ON  THE BASKETBALL COURT ITSELF.  >> AS A PERSON WHO IS COVERED  HIGH-LEVEL POLITICS, KOBE  BRYANT, WHEN I COVERED HIM, NO  ONE IN SPORTS, WITH ALL RESPECT  FOR LeBRON JAMES, WAS A MASTER  OF THE NARRATIVE OF HIS OWN  STORY.  THE ABILITY TO PULL REPORTERS  ASIDE AND GIVE ACCESS.  HE OPERATED LIKE SOME SORT OF  WHITE HOUSE SPIN GURU ON HIS  OWN BEHALF.  YOU COULD TELL THAT HE ENJOYED  THE COMPETITION OF CREATING HIS  OWN STORY AND CREATING HIS OWN  NARRATIVE, TO DEFINE HOW THE  PUBLIC SAW HIM.  DOING WHAT YOU DO WHEN IN THE  PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT.  TALKING TO THOSE WHO SHAPED THE  NEWS.  TO HAVE REPORTERS WHO WOULD SEE  HIS PERSPECTIVE.  TO DO AS BEST HE COULD.  WHICH IS NO EASY TASK.  WHEN I HEARD THAT, THAT HE HAD  AN INTEREST IN NARRATIVE AND  STORYTELLING, IT MADE SENSE.  LOOKING BACK, I THINK HE ALWAYS  UNDERSTOOD HIS OWN CAREER. WHEN  HE STEPPED OFF THE FLOOR IN  THAT CONTEXT.  THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND END  OF HEROES AND VILLAINS.  HE WAS A GUY WHO OPERATED WITH  SO MUCH DEPTH AS MUCH SMARTS.  IN EVERYTHING THAT HE DID.  IT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME.  I CAN REMEMBER IN DEALING WITH  HIM, HE WAS THINKING I HAVE TO  BE CAREFUL HOW CHARMING AND  AWARE HE IS AND WHAT HE WANTS.  HE FEELS LIKE WE ARE PLAYING  CHESS RIGHT NOW.  EVEN THOUGH IT IS JUST A POLITE  CONVERSATION.  HE UNDERSTOOD IN A WAY THAT I  RESPECT.  HE UNDERSTOOD THE IDEA OF  BUILDING A STORY.  IT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME. HE DID  IT HIMSELF PROFESSIONALLY.  >> I'M TOLD WE HAVE ANOTHER  TWEET WE WANT TO SHOW.  AS TRIBUTE UP AND POURING IN.  WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING SOCIAL  MEDIA.  LET'S GO AHEAD AND LISTEN TO  THE REACTION NOW.  FROM KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR.  >> IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME  TO PUT INTO WORDS, HOW I FEEL  ABOUT THE LOSS OF KOBE BRYANT.  AS A YOUNG BOY, I MET HIM WHEN  HE WAS 11 OR 12 YEARS OLD.  I WAS FRIENDS WITH HIS DAD,  JOE.  WE WERE FORMER ADVERSARIES.  JOE PLAYED FOR THE 76ers.  HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND.  AND SOMEONE I SHARED A  FRIENDSHIP WITH.  IT IS HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND  NOW, HOW THIS IS AFFECTING JOE  AND HIS WIFE.  TO KOBE'S FAMILY, I SEND MY  MOST SINCERE AND HEARTFELT  REGRETS AND PRAYERS. AND MY  THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU GUYS.  KOBE WAS AN INCREDIBLE FAMILY  MAN.  HE LOVED HIS WIFE AND  DAUGHTERS.  HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE ATHLETE.  AND A LEADER IN A LOT OF WAYS.  HE ASPIRED A GENERATION OF  YOUNG ATHLETES.  HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO  LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL AND COME TO  THE NBA AND DO SO WELL.  DOMINATING THE GAME.  AND BECOMING ONE OF THE BEST  SCORES AT THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS , THAT THEY HAVE EVER SEEN.  I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING  THERE WHEN HE SCORED HIS 81  POINT GAME.  IT IS SOMETHING I WILL ALWAYS  REMEMBER AS ONE OF THE  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE THINGS I HAVE  LEARNED AND OBSERVED IN SPORTS.  MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU.  ABSOLUTELY.  REST IN PEACE YOUNG MAN.  THIS LOSS IS HARD TO  COMPREHEND.  GO WITH GOD.  >> KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR REACTED  TO THE NEWS OF KOBE BRYANT  DEATH.  I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE  OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT THAT WE  ARE SEEING.  BEGINNING TO SEE FOR THE FAMILY  OF KOBE BRYANT, FOR HIS WIFE  AND HIS OTHER DOCTORS.  CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  THAT KIND OF SUPPORT. WHICH I  IMAGINE WILL BE A FLOOD, HERE  IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  >> IT WILL BE A COMPLICATED  REALITY.  THE FAMILY WILL HAVE A LEVEL OF  SUPPORT AND LOVE OF WELL WISHES  AND KINDNESS FROM LOS ANGELES  AND BEYOND.  THROWN THEIR WAY.  I WOULD IMAGINE ALSO HAVING TO  DEAL WITH THE DESIRE FOR THE  PRIVACY THEY WILL NEED TO MOURN  A FATHER AND HUSBAND IN THE  SECOND OLDEST DAUGHTER.  AS A PARENT, AS AWFUL AS THE  STORY IS, 41 IS A YOUNG.  AS PRESIDENT OBAMA NOTED AND AS  OTHER FOLKS HAVE SAID, THE  REALITY IS IT IS KOBE BRYANT  AND HIS DAUGHTER. THAT IS A  DIFFICULTY THAT I COULD NOT AND  WOULD NOT WANT TO UPPER HAND AS  A PARENT.  AND BEYOND LOS ANGELES, THERE  WILL BE SO MUCH LOVE AND  SUPPORT.  THERE WILL BE A BALANCE HAS TO  BE STRUCK FOR FAMILY IN THE  SPOTLIGHT IN A WAY THEY NEVER  HAPPEN.  IN TERMS OF THE MORNING AND  SADNESS.  THEY WILL WANT THE PRIVACY.  >> TO KEEP VIEWERS UPDATED, WE  ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THIS  PICTURE OUT OF CALABASAS,  CALIFORNIA.  ON THE RIGHT, IS WHERE WE  EXPECT LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO  HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE.  NOW, WE ARE GETTING GUIDANCE  THAT PERHAPS, THE NEWS  CONFERENCE MAY BE PUSHED BACK A  LITTLE BIT.  IT WAS ORIGINALLY SET FOR THE  TOP OF OUR.  IT IS LOOKING LIKE IT WILL BE  THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUR.  5:30 EASTERN, 2:30 LOCAL.  WE WILL CONTINUE, AS SOON AS  THE NEWS CONFERENCE GETS  UNDERWAY, WE WILL BRING IT TO  YOU.  AS IT HAPPENS.  AS A SAINT A MOMENT AGO, WE ARE  WATCHING SOCIAL MEDIA, TO SEE  WHAT KIND OF TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN  COMING IN.  I WANT TO SHOW A TWEET FROM  SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WHO CO-WEIGHT  IN A SHORT TIME AGO.  ABOUT POSTING. YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S NO WORDS TO EXPRESS THE  PAIN IM GOING THROUGH WITH THIS  TRAGEDY OF LOOSING MY NEICE  GIGI & MY BROTHER @KOBEBRYANT I  LOVE U AND U WILL BE MISSED.  MY CONDOLENCES GOES OUT TO THE  BRYANT FAMILY AND THE FAMILIES  OF THE OTHER PASSENGERS ON  BOARD.  IM SICK RIGHT NOW.   AS SOMEONE WHO IS COVERED  PROMINENT SPORTS FIGURES, THAT  >> WE SEE MORE ACTIVITY.  THERE IS NO SIGN OF THE NEWS  CONFERENCE STARTING.  AS SOMEONE WHO IS COVERED  PROMINENT SPORTS FIGURES, I  WOULD IMAGINE THE IMPACT OF THE  LOSS OF SOMEONE LIKE KOBE  BRYANT.  I IS GOING TO BE UNIQUE, GIVEN  THE LONGEVITY OF HIS CAREER  WITH THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS.  THE FACT THAT HE STAYED IN THIS  ONE COMMUNITY AND ACCOMPLISHED  ALL THAT HE DID IN BASKETBALL.  EMAINING WITH THE TEAM. AS WE  KNOW, LOYALTY OFTEN TIMES, IS  SOMETHING THE FANS ARE VERY  TUNED INTO.  WHEN THERE IS A PERCEIVED  DISLOYALTY, FANS DO NOT TAKE TO  IT KINDLY.  CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT A  LITTLE BIT?  YOU HAVE FIGURE HERE, WHO  UNDOUBTEDLY COULD HAVE GONE TO  ANY NUMBER OF TEAMS, I WOULD  IMAGINE.  HE STAYED WITH THE LOS ANGELES  LAKERS.  >> IT IS AN AMAZING POINT.  I AM A FAN. WE ARE IRRATIONAL  WHEN IT COMES TO THESE HUMAN  BEINGS. THEY HAVE CAREERS AND  FAMILIES.  THEY WANT TO LIVE IN DIFFERENT  CITIES.  YOU CAN ASK LeBRON JAMES, WHAT  IT IS LIKE WHEN HE CHANGES  CITIES.  IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE.  IT REALLY BECAME TRUE FOR KOBE  BRYANT, WHERE IT BECAME  COMMONPLACE FOR PLAYERS TO MOVE  ON EMMETT TO OTHER PLACES.  KOBE BRYANT, AT THE END OF HIS  CAREER, HAD HE GONE SOMEWHERE  ELSE THE LAST FEW YEARS,  OPERABLY THAT IT ABSOLUTELY  COULD HAVE PLACED HIMSELF ON  THE TEAM WE HAD A CHANCE TO WIN  ANOTHER CHAMPIONSHIP.  HE WAS A WAS A LIQUOR.  HE WAS GOING TO BE A LAKER,  THROUGH GOOD AND BAD.  THERE IS A JUXTAPOSITION AND  HIM AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.  SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WAS DRAFTED BY  THE ORLANDO MAGIC.  HE BECAME A LAKER.  ONE OF THE IRONIES IN  APPLICATIONS OF KOBE BRYANT IS,  HE AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL WERE  UNABLE TO GET ALONG.  SHOCK LEFT AND WENT TO OTHER  TEAMS.  INCLUDING THE HEAT. KOBE BRYANT  ONE 2 WITHOUT HIM.  IN THE END, THERE WAS RESPECT  AND LOVE THAT BROUGHT THEM BACK  AND CREATED A FRIENDSHIP POST  PLAYING CAREER.  ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE WRAPPED  UP IN WHY KOBE BRYANT IS  BLOCKED HERE.  HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A  LAKER. HE WAS NEVER GOING TO GO  ANYWHERE ELSE.  THE CLOSEST IT CAME WAS WHEN HE  WAS FRUSTRATED MIDWAY, STARTING  TO BE A CLIPPER. THE STORY IS  DR. JERRY BUSS BROUGHT HIM TO  HIS HOME AND SAID, YOU WILL BE  A LAKER FOR LIFE. WE ARE  COMMITTED TO THAT.  I REMEMBER TALKING TO JERRY  BUSS, THE CONTROLLING OWNER OF  THE LAKERS AND HE SAID, FOR THE  LAKERS FAMILY, KOBE BRYANT WAS  ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PART OF  THE FAMILY.  NOT JUST A PART OF THE  ORGANIZATION.  THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  DEFINED THE LAKERS.  THEY ARE A FAMILY RUN BUSINESS.  WHAT HAS BECOME A MULTI-BILLION- DOLLAR CORPORATELY RUN  ENTERPRISE.  THAT IS HARD TO HOLD ONTO.  TO HAVE A FAMILY RUN BUSINESS  WITH AN NBA TEAM.  YOU HAVE TO HAVE NBA PLAYERS  WHO WANT TO REGARD THEMSELVES  AS FAMILY.  AS MUCH AS EMPLOYEES.  KOBE BRYANT DID THAT.  THAT WILL ALWAYS BE PART OF THE  REASON THAT HIS CONNECTION WITH  THE CITY WILL BE LASTING AND  WILL BE REAL.  NO JUDGMENT ON LeBRON JAMES OR  THE CONTEMPORARIES.  KOBE BRYANT WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO  BE A LAKER AND ALWAYS WILL BE.  IT IS RARE AND IN LOS ANGELES,  IT IS SPECIAL.  >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR  SHARING INSIGHTS AND  REFLECTIONS WITH US.  THE  >>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR  THE NEWS CONFERENCE EXPECTED TO  HAPPEN WITHIN THE HOUR.  PERHAPS, THE BOTTOM OF THE  HOUR.  RIGHT NOW, LET'S TAKE YOU BACK  TO CBSN LOS ANGELES FOR THEIR  CONTINUING COVERAGE.   >>> WE JUST GOT THE NEWS.  LIKE I SAID, I WAS GETTING  DRESSED.  SOMEBODY TOLD ME AND I STOPPED  WHAT I WAS DOING.  I WAITED A MINUTE AND I ASKED  THEM TO RECONFIRM IT.  >> I THINK ALL OF US DID.  >> I DID NOT BELIEVE IT.  I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT.  EVERY TIME WE CAME ACROSS EACH  OTHER, I LET HIM KNOW I WAS A  FAN.  HE WAS ALWAYS CLASSY.  HE WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE  MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS.  >> SINCE THE BEGINNING OF KOBE  BRYANT CAREER, AS A FAN AND A  MOTHER MYSELF, MY HEART GOES  OUT TO HIS WIFE.  THAT IS THE SAME WORD WE KEEP  HEARING ON THE CARPET.  WILL CONTINUE TO GET REACTION,  AS THE GRAMMYS CONTINUE.  WE LIVE IN DOWNTOWN LOS  ANGELES.  >> IS HARD TO CELEBRATE UNDER  CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS.  A DARK CLOUD IS CAST OVER THE  EVENT AT STAPLES CENTER.  WHERE HE SAYS MUCH OF HIS  CAREER.  >> TWO OF HIS JERSEYS HANG IN  THE RAFTERS OF STAPLES CENTER.  HE HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE  MUSIC INDUSTRY AS WELL.  HE TRANSCENDED SPORTS AND A LOT  OF PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO THAT  FROM THE RED CARPET.  FROM CALABASAS TO HIS HOME.  >> WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WE  HAVE REPORTERS FANNING OUT ALL  OVER THE AREA.  WILL CONTINUE TO COVER BREAKING  NEWS.  SUCH A TREMENDOUS LOSS FOR LOS  ANGELES.  ACTION HAS BEEN POURING IN.  JUST INTO THE NEWSROOM, WE ARE  GETTING A STATEMENT FROM NBA  COMMISSIONER, ADAM SILVER,  ACCORDING THE DEATH OF KOBE  BRYANT.  WE WILL READ SOME OF IT TO YOU.  IT SAYS, THE NBA FAMILY IS  DEVASTATED BY THE TRAGIC  PASSING OF KOBE BRYANT AND HIS  DAUGHTER, GEMMA.  FOR 20 SEASONS, KOBE BRYANT  SHOWED US WHAT IS POSSIBLE WHEN  REMARKABLE TALENT WAS WITH THE  DEVOTION TO WINNING.  HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXTERNAL  PLAYERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE  GAME WITH THE CONGRESSMAN'S  THAT ARE LEGENDARY.  FIVE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP'S, MVP  AWARD, 18 NBA ALL-STAR  SELECTIONS AND TO A BIG OLD  METALS.  >> YOU WILL BE MOST REMEMBERED,  TALKING ABOUT KOBE BRYANT, FOR  INSPIRING PEOPLE AROUND THE  WORLD TO PICK UP A BASKETBALL  AND COMPETE TO THE VERY BEST OF  THEIR ABILITY.  HE WAS GENEROUS WITH THE WISDOM  HE ACQUIRED.  HE SAW AS HIS MISSION TO SHARE  WITH FUTURE GENERATIONS OF  PLAYERS.  TAKEN SPECIAL LOVE OF THE GAME  AND PASSING ATTACK TO GIANNA.  >> WITH AN CONDOLENCES  TO HIS  WIFE IT IS A, AND THE FAMILY.  THE LAKERS ORGANIZATION AND THE  ENTIRE SPORTS WORLD.  THE STATEMENT IS FROM NBA  COMMISSIONER, ADAM SILVER.  I BELIEVE IT WILL BE ONE OF  MANY STATEMENTS THAT WE SEE  THIS EVENING.  I IMAGINE THE LAKERS THEMSELVES  WILL BE PUTTING SOMETHING OUT.  WE MAY HEAR FROM JERRY BUSS AND  THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE  SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.  >> YOU ARE TAKING PICTURES FROM  THE SCENE THIS MORNING IN  CALABASAS.  AROUND 9:45.  KOBE BRYANT, DEAD AT THE AGE OF  41 HIS DAUGHTER, GIANNA, AS  WELL ONE OF THE VICTIM'S.  ABOUT 9:45 THIS MONEY.  WE EXPECT LOS ANGELES COUNTY  FIRE DEPARTMENT PRESS  CONFERENCE AT 2:00.  WE WILL TAKE IT LIVE WHEN IT  OCCURS.  WE UNDERSTAND THEY WILL BRIEF  US FROM THE SCENE, RELATED TO  THE ACCIDENT.  WE DO KNOW NTSB IS SENDING A GO  TEAM.  A SPECIAL TEAM TO INVESTIGATE  THE CRASH.  THERE SET TO ARRIVE IN LOS  ANGELES THIS EVENING.  WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION THAT  THE FLIGHT WITH KOBE BRYANT AND  HIS DAUGHTER, ORIGINATED FROM  LONG BEACH THIS MORNING.  >> YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT THE AREA WHERE THE CRASH  HAPPENED.  AN AREA YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH.  IT IS A HILLY AREA.  WE TALKED WITH AN EYEWITNESS  EARLIER WHO HEARD AND SAW THE  CRASH.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW THERE  ARE SOMETIMES LOW-FLYING  HELICOPTERS IN THE AREA.  YOU AND I HAVE BOTH COVERED  WILDFIRES THAT HAVE HAPPENED  HERE IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES  AREA.  RESIDENTS ARE USED TO, IN SOME  WAY, SEEING LOW-FLYING  HELICOPTERS.  WHAT IS EXCEPTIONAL TODAY, IS  THE FOG. WE IS SEEN THROUGHOUT  THE EVENING ALL OVER LOS  ANGELES AREA.  IT IS VERY DENSE FOG.  THE INVESTIGATION INTO HOW THE  CRASH HAPPENED IS GOING TO TAKE  SOME TIME.  EXPANDS TELLS US IT COULD TAKE  UP TO A YEAR BEFORE WE FIND  COMPLETE CONCLUSIONS AS TO WHAT  HAPPENED.  CERTAINLY, VISIBILITY COULD  HAVE BEEN VERY BAD TODAY.  >> THESE ARE LARGE HELICOPTERS.  THIS ONE COULD HOLD 12 PEOPLE  WITH FIVE ON BOARD.  THE LARGE HELICOPTERS DO YOU  HAVE THE BOXES, WHICH HAVE BEEN  RECOVERED.  IT COULD GIVE THEM INFORMATION.  WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS FROM THE  ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE VICTIM  ON BOARD WAS AN ORANGE COUNTY  COACH BY THE NAME OF JONATHAN.  HE  WAS ON BOARD WITH KOBE  BRYANT AND HIS DAUGHTER,  GIANNA.  THAT IS THE LATEST INFORMATION  WE HAVE ON THE TRAGEDY.  IT HAPPENED AT 9:45 IN BASIS.  IT WAS A SIKORSKY HELICOPTER.  IT APPEARS THAT ALL FIVE  PERISHED AND INCLUDED KOBE  BRYANT AND HIS DAUGHTER GIANNA   AND A COACH FROM ORANGE COUNTY.  HE WAS A COACH AT ORANGE COAST  COLLEGE.  HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE HEAD COACH  OF THE BASEBALL TEAM.  HE SAID IS THE LONGEST TENURED  BASEBALL COACH IN THEIR  HISTORY.  THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER IS  REPORTING THE MAN WAS THE HEAD  COACH OF BASEBALL.  PERHAPS YOU ARE WONDERING WHY  WE ARE NOT HEARING MORE ABOUT  THE OTHER VICTIMS IN THE CRASH.  THE ANSWER TO THAT IS SIMPLY WE  ARE JUST NOW GETTING THIS  INFORMATION.  WE ONLY KNEW WITH CERTAINTY  THAT KOBE BRYANT HAVE BEEN ONE  OF THE FIVE PEOPLE WHO PERISHED  IN THE CRASH.  NOW THIS BREAKING NEWS.  THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER FAMILY  LIVING THROUGH THIS NIGHTMARE.  THIS IS JUST AS SAD AND AWFUL.  IT IS REALLY HARD.  IS A JOURNALIST AND FATHER YOU  FEEL THE SAME WAY.  ANY STORY THAT WE COVER,  HEARING ABOUT A CHILD LOSING  THE LIFE, LOSING A CHILD, IT  HIT YOU IN SUCH A PERSONAL AND  UPSETTING WAY.  AND TO HEAR ABOUT THE LOSS OF  THE COACH, AND A FAMILY AS  WELL.  AND A HEARING A LOSS OF A 13- YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.  FOR SO MANY PEOPLE, IT PUTS THIS IN A DOCKER AND UPSETTING WAY.  IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR A PARENT  TO LOSE THEIR CHILD.  OUR THOUGHTS WITH OUR WITH THE  FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THE  TRAGEDY.  >> A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN HE  FIRST HEARD THIS NEWS, THEY  THOUGHT IT MAY BE THE SITUATION  WITH HIS DAUGHTER.  THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME  TOGETHER.  THAT IS WHAT HE DID . HE  SUPPORTED HIS DAUGHTER IN  ATHLETIC ENDEAVORS.  THEY PLAYED SOCCER AND  BASKETBALL.  WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THIS, BUT  WE HAD REPORTS THAT THEY WERE  HEADED FROM A BEACH IN INTO A  FACILITY.  A SPORTS VENUE PRACTICE  FACILITY IN THOUSAND OAKS.  THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE WITH THE  COACH, WHO MAYBE A TEAMMATE OF  HIS DAUGHTER, GIANNA.  WE HAVE CONTINUING COVERAGE OF  KOBE BRYANT'S DEATH.  >> WE HAVE OUR REPORTERS FANNED  OUT ALL OVER THE AREA.  WE ARE BRINGING YOU EVERY ANGLE  OF THE DEVELOPING STORY.  ONE OF OUR REPORTERS IS JUST  NOW AT STAPLES CENTER, WHERE  THERE IS A MEMORIAL GROWING.  A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERED.  THE GRAMMYS ARE GOING ON AS  WELL.  WE WANT TO CHECK IN WITH  LESLIE.  WHAT ARE YOU SEEN OUT THERE AT  THE STAPLES CENTER?  I CAN TELL YOU IT IS THE GRAMMYS . WHICH MEANS AT STAPLES  CENTER, THIS PLACE WILL BE  PACKED.  THEY NORMALLY SHUT DOWN ALL OF  THE STREETS SURROUNDING STAPLES  CENTER TO BEGIN WITH.  THAT IS WHY POLICE HAVE BLOCKED  THE ENTRYWAY RIGHT IN FRONT OF  THE STADIUM.  PAST THAT, YOU CAN SEE IN THE  ALLEY LIVE AREA, ALL OF THE  SCREENS HAVE IN LOVING MEMORY  OF KOBE BRYANT.  THEY HAVE HIS PHOTO EVERYWHERE.  AND THE ALLEY LIVE AREA.  WE CANNOT GET A GOOD LOOK AT  STAPLES CENTER.  RIGHT IN FRONT OF THOSE SIGNS,  THERE ARE TONS OF PEOPLE.  I'M SEEING A TON OF LAKER  JERSEYS.  ALL YOU CAN SEE OUR LAKERS  JERSEYS.  KOBE BRYANT JERSEYS.  WE HAVE EVANS FROM RIVERSIDE. I  SEE YOU HAVE FLOWERS. AND KOBE  BRYANT'S JERSEY.  WHY DID YOU FEEL SO COMPELLED  TO COME DOWN TO STAPLES CENTER?  >> I'M A HUGE KOBE BRYANT FAN.  AND I HEARD THE NEWS THIS  MORNING IT SHOOK ME TO THE POINT WHERE I KNEW I HAD TO COME TO  STAPLES CENTER.  I KNEW OTHER KOBE BRYANT FANS  WOULD DO THE SAME.  I WANTED TO SHOW MY RESPECT TO  A GUY THAT IS MY HERO MY WHOLE  LIFE.  >> YOU SAID THE LAST TIME YOU  WATCH KOBE BRYANT PLAY WAS WHEN  THEY PLAYED AGAINST THE  CLIPPERS.  >> HIS LAST GAME AGAINST THE  CLIPPERS.  THEY WERE DOWN BY 30 THE LAST  SEVEN MINUTES OF THE GAME.  EVERYONE KNEW HE WAS HURTING.  HE HAD ICE PACKS ALL OVER THE  CROWD STARTED TO CHANT HIS  NAME.  HE DID A COUPLE OF PUSH-UPS.  IT IS ICE PACKS OFF.  HE WALKED RIGHT PAST BYRON  SCOTT AND WENT TO THE GAME.  THAT IS HIS MENTALITY.  >> WE TALKED ABOUT THAT  EARLIER.  AS KOBE BRYANT.  THAT IS WHAT HE REPRESENTED.  WHY DO YOU THINK, WHAT IMPACT  HAS COBY HAD.  ON THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.  THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.  >> KOBE BRYANT, WE SHOWED THAT  YOU COULD BE BETTER EVERY DAY.  HE NEVER TOOK ANYTHING FOR  GRANTED.  HE LIVED 100 LIFETIMES AND THE  SHORT LIFE THAT WAS CUT TOO  SHORT.  I THINK HE TELLS PEOPLE IN A  RESONATES WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU  CAN BE BETTER.  HARD WORK AND DEDICATION.  AND IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF  PLACES, TO THE TOP.  >> HE MEANT A LOT TO THE LOS  ANGELES COMMUNITY.  PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING  TO US.  WE DO WANT TO TEST THE BACK TO  OUR ANCHORS.  WE BELIEVE THERE IS A PRESS  CONFERENCE THAT IS ABOUT TO  BEGIN.  >> AND LOTS OF FANS ARE  GATHERING.  THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE  STAPLES CENTER ITSELF.  THE LAPD WITH TWEETING OUT A  COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO THAT THE  AREA IS CLOSED OFF.  BECAUSE OF WHAT IS GOING ON  WITH THE GRAMMYS TONIGHT.  WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE  UNDER A DARK CLOUD WITH THE  LOSS OF KOBE BRYANT.  TERRIBLE NEWS TO RECEIVE THE  FOR WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A  CELEBRATORY EVENING IN LOS  ANGELES.  >> A LARGE MEMORIAL IS GOING AT  THE STAPLES CENTER.  WHERE THE LAKERS IS HOME.  AND AT THE CRASH SITE AND  CALABASAS, AS WE CONTINUE TO  COVER THE DEVASTATING NEWS OF  KOBE BRYANT FROM THE HELICOPTER  CRASHED THIS MORNING.  AS WE CONTINUE TO COVER CHAIR,  WE WILL BE STANDING BY.  THIS IS THE L.A.  COUNTY SHERIFF.   >>> WE ARE TAKING A NOW TO  CALABASAS, CALIFORNIA.  LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE GIVING AN  UPDATE ON TODAY'S DEADLY  HELICOPTER CRASH THAT KILLED  KOBE BRYANT AND SEVERAL OTHERS.  LET'S LISTEN IN.   >>> LET'S GO LIVE.  >> GOOD AFTERNOON.  MY NAME IS EARL, FIRE CHIEF OF  THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE  DEPARTMENT.  I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING  HERE TO THE BRIEFING OF THE  WILLOW INCIDENT.  TODAY, SHORTLY BEFORE 10:00 AT  9:40 7 AM, THE LOS ANGELES  COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED  A 911 CALL OF A POTENTIAL  HELICOPTER DOWN AND A BRUSH FIRE AT THE INTERSECTION OF LOS  FRESNOS ROAD AND WILLOW GLEN  STREET IN THE CITY OF CALABASAS  AND UNINCORPORATED LOS ANGELES  COUNTY. UPON ARRIVAL, WE  DISCOVERED A QUARTER ACRE  BRUSHFIRE, THE RESULTED FROM A  CRASH ON THE HILLSIDE.  THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE  DEPARTMENT INITIAL RESPONSE WAS  15 PIECES OF APPARATUS AND 56  PERSONNEL THAT CONSISTED OF  PARAMEDICS, FIRE COMPANY, HEAVY  RESCUE, CHUCK COMPANY, HAND  CREWS AND AIRCRAFT AND CHIEF  OFFICER TO OVERSEE THE  INCIDENT.  UPON ARRIVAL, DURING THE  INCIDENT, AND UPON ARRIVAL OF  THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, THE  RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS ENTERED  INTO UNIFIED COMMAND TO HANDLE  THE INCIDENT.  OUR FIREFIGHTERS ON SCENE  INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A  DEBRIS FIELD AND STEEP TERRAIN  WITH A QUARTER ACRE RUSH FIRE  AT THE TIME.  OR FIREFIGHTERS HIKES IN TO  THE ACCIDENT SITE WITH MEDICAL  EQUIPMENT.  AND HOSE LINES TO EXTINGUISH  THE STUBBORN FIRE. AS IT  INCLUDED THE BRUSHFIRE, DEBRIS  FROM THE HELICOPTER AND THE  FIRE ALSO INCLUDED MAGNESIUM,  WHICH IS HARD TO EXTINGUISH  BECAUSE MAGNESIUM REACTS WITH  OXYGEN AND WATER.  IN ADDITION TO FIREFIGHTERS  HIKING INTO THE INCIDENT, WE  HAD ONE HELICOPTER FLYING TO  THE INCIDENT WITH FIREFIGHTER  PARAMEDICS ON BOARD.  THE PARAMEDICS WERE PLACED AT  THE INCIDENT EARLY INTO THE  INCIDENT.  THEY DID A SEARCH OF THE AREA  FOR SURVIVORS.  UNFORTUNATELY, ALL SURVIVORS ON  BOARD WERE DETERMINED TO BE  PERISHED.  FIREFIGHTERS AND HAND CREWS  WERE TEXTING WAS THE FIRE WHILE  CAREFULLY PRESERVING THE  INCIDENT FOR INVESTIGATION.  CURRENTLY, THE INVESTIGATION IS  ONGOING.  I WOULD LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER  TO MY SHERIFF, TO CONTINUE THE  PRESS BRIEFING.  >> SHERIFF RESPONDED TO THE  SCENE OF THE CRASH SITE.  AND ASSISTED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A  CONTAINMENT AREA.  AND NOW OUR AIR BUREAU HAS A  HANDLE ON AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS  WHEN THERE IS A FATALITY.  AND HAS BEEN SWITCHED TO THAT  NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY  BOARD AND FEDERAL AVIATION  INDUSTRY, FAA.  THE FAA IS ON SCENE AND  ASSISTING. WE ARE AWAITING THE  ARRIVAL OF THE CORONER'S OFFICE  TO ASSIST IN THE RECOVERY OF  REMAINS.  AS THE CHIEF INDICATED, THERE  WERE NO SURVIVORS.  WE HAVE A MANIFEST THAT  INDICATES MY PEOPLE ON BOARD  THE AIRCRAFT.  THE PILOT. THERE IS WIDE  SPECULATION OF THE IDENTITIES.  HOWEVER, IT IS ENTIRELY  INAPPROPRIATE TO IDENTIFY  ANYONE BY NAME, UNTIL THE  CORNER HAS MADE EDIFICATION  THROUGH THE DELIBERATE PROCESS.  AND HAVE MADE NOTIFICATION TO  NEXT OF KIN.  IT WOULD BE ACTUALLY  DISRESPECTFUL TO UNDERSTAND  YOUR LOVED ONE HAS PERISHED AND  YOU LEARN ABOUT IT FROM TMZ.  IT IS WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE.  WE WILL NOT GO THERE.  WE WILL WAIT UNTIL THE CORNER  DOES THE JOB. AND WE ARE  ASSISTING THE FAMILIES OF THOSE  WHO BELIEVE THEY WERE IMPACTED.  IT IS A TOUGH PROCESS.  OUR HOPE GOES OUT TO ALL OF THE  FAMILIES AND OF EVERYONE ON  BOARD THE AIRCRAFT.  GOD BLESS THEIR SOULS THAT AT  THIS POINT IN TIME WE HAVE  NOTHING TO ADD.  UNTIL THE CORNER DOES THE JOB.  AND WE WILL BE MAKING THOSE  NOTIFICATIONS, WILL MAY HAVE  THE INFORMATION.  WHEN OF THE NEXT OF KIN HAVE  BEEN NOTIFIED AND THAT WE WILL  RELEASE INFORMATION PUBLICLY.  YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED IN A  SUBSEQUENT ANNOUNCEMENT.  >> Reporter: DO WE HAVE  CONFIRMATION OF NINE BODIES AT  THE SCENE?  >> THAT IS OUR BELIEF, YES.  >> Reporter: WE REALIZE AT THIS  POINT, THERE ARE SO MANY  QUESTIONS.  >> THERE IS A LOT OF  INFORMATION OUT THERE.  WE UNDERSTAND THERE IS  INFORMATION FLOATING.  WE CERTAINLY HAVE A  RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATION  AND RESPECT FOR THE FAMILIES.  THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME  FOR US ALL, AND THE MAYOR OF  CALABASAS IS HERE.  WE THANK THEM FOR BEING HERE.  WE WANT TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE,  FOR THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY, TO  GATHER HERE, YOU ARE WELCOME TO  JOIN OTHERS AT THE PARK IN  CALABASAS.  AT LOST HILLS UNLESS VIRTUOUS  ROAD.  WE WILL SEND OUT UPDATES IF  THERE WILL BE A PRESS ADVISORY.  IF THERE IS ANOTHER PRESS  CONFERENCE OR UPDATES THROUGH  TWITTER.  PLEASE LOOK FOR THAT.  WE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE  TODAY.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  TOOK SHERIFF?  ARE YOU SEALING OFF THE AREA?  WHEN THE NTSB HAS TO BE THERE.  IS A PUBLIC ABLE TO GET NEARBY?  WILL A STRETCH OF THE ROAD BE  SHUT DOWN? >> IT REMAINS SHUT DOWN.  >> Reporter: IS HEAVY FOG A  FACTOR?  >>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO  THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE  DEPARTMENT CHIEF AND THE LOS  ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF, GIVING  A BIT MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT  HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY.  A BIT OF NEW INFORMATION THAT  WE HAD NOT HEARD.  ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF THEY  HEARD MOMENTS AGO, SAYING THAT  NINE PEOPLE, THEY BELIEVE, WERE  ON BOARD THE HELICOPTER.  THE SHERIFF SAYING NINE PEOPLE  WERE ON BOARD. ALSO,  EMPHASIZING THAT THEY ARE NOT  IDENTIFYING ANY ONE PERSON BY  NAME, PENDING NOTIFICATION OF  CAN.  WE WERE TOLD BY THE FIRE CHIEF,  THAT THE CALL CAME IN AT 9:47  LOCAL TIME, OF A POTENTIAL  HELICOPTER DOWN AND BRUSHFIRE  IN CALABASAS.  THEY SENT 56 PERSONNEL,  INCLUDING PARAMEDICS. SOME OF  WHOM WERE FLOWN TO THE SCENE BY  HELICOPTER AND THEN LOWERED TO  THE AREA TO DO A SEARCH FOR  SURVIVORS.  HOWEVER, EVERYONE ON BOARD  PERISHED.  THE FAA, THE SHERIFF SAYS, IS  ON SCENE.  THEY ARE AWAITING THE ARRIVAL  OF THE NTSB.  INVESTIGATORS, AS WELL AS THE  CORNER -- BUT THAT IS THE  LATEST WE HAVE HEARD.  WITH RESPECT TO WHAT HAPPENED  IN THE HELICOPTER CRASHED.  EARLIER TODAY AND CALABASAS  COMPERDA.  RIGHT NOW, WE WANT TO PLAY A  BIT OF THE REPORT FROM KCBS  DIRECTOR JIM HILL, WHO HAD BEEN  DIPPING INTO CBSN LOS ANGELES  COVERAGE.  HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THE DEATH  OF KOBE BRYANT.  LET'S LISTEN TO SOME OF THAT.  >> THIS IS MORE THAN SAD.  IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.  WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE, WHO IS,  I SAY IS, BECAUSE HE LIVES IN  ALL OF US.  WHO IS SO YOUNG AND GIFTED. AS  A WONDERFUL.  WE ALL KNOW HE IS A GREAT  BASKETBALL PLAYER.  HE WAS A BETTER FATHER, HUSBAND  AND FAMILY MAN.  HE DID SO MUCH IN OUR  COMMUNITY.  THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT  KNOW ABOUT.  WHEN YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE  THINGS THAT HE DID.  BUT THERE ARE STORIES THAT I  KNOW OF, WHERE HE HAS HELPED  PERSONALLY TO HAVE YOUNG KIDS  GO TO SCHOOL.  HE GIVE THE MONEY TO GO TO  SCHOOL.  I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT  JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL.  I'M TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE.  AND THINGS LIKE THAT.  HE MADE THE ADJUSTMENT TO  RETIREMENT.  BETTER THAN ANYONE I HAVE EVER  MET.  YOU ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT ATHLETES,  WHO WHEN THEY RETIRE, THEY DO  NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.  THEY GET LOST. THEY GET SICK.  THE MONEY IS STOLEN.  THEY GET INTO ALL KINDS OF  TROUBLE AND THINGS LIKE THAT.  NOT HIM.  HE WAS PREPARING HIS ENTIRE  ATHLETIC LIFE FOR WHEN HE WAS  GOING TO RETIRE.  AND WHEN HE RETIRED, HE KNEW  EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS GOING TO  DO.  THERE IS NO GISSINGER ANYTHING  ABOUT IT.  ONE OF THE THINGS, HE BECAME AN  AUTHOR.  ONE OF THE BOOKS IS LEGACY AND  THE QUEEN.  I WENT OUT AND DID AN INTERVIEW  WITH HIM WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT  THAT.  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STUCK  OUT IN MY MIND AND I OPENED IT  UP, AND HE SAID TO HIS  DAUGHTERS, MY FORD BEAUTIFUL  STEARATE SPIRITED, STRONG  DOCTORS.  WHEN YOU FIERCELY PROTECT YOUR  PASSION NO ONE CAN STILL YOUR  DREAMS.  KOBE BRYANT.  >> IS ABOUT HIM IN A NUTSHELL.  HE IS SO MUCH THAT HE PLANNED  AHEAD.  SO MANY PLAYERS GO AND HIT THE  GOLF COURSE AND RETIRE.  HE HAD A PLAN NOT ONLY FOR IS  18, TO PLAY IN THE NBA.  BUT UP PLAN FOR AFTER THE MBA.  HE SUCCEEDED AT BOTH.  >> THE OTHER THING IS, WE ALL  HAVE OUR UPS AND DOWNS.  SHOWING TAPE OF WHEN I SAW HIM  AT LASC.  IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, IT IS THE  LAST TIME THAT I DID AN  INTERVIEW WITH HIM.  IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LAST TIME  ANYONE DID AN INTERVIEW WITH  HIM.  I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE HALL OF  FAME.  AND TYPICAL KOBE BRYANT  FASHION, IT IS OKAY.  I WILL WORRY ABOUT THAT WHEN IT  IS TIME.  HE ALWAYS DEFLECTED PERSONAL,  INDIVIDUAL GAME AND NOTORIETY.  HE ALWAYS PUT IT OFF TO THE  SIDE.  HE KNEW IT WAS WHAT IT WAS ALL  ABOUT.  IT WAS ALL ABOUT GIVING BACK  AND HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE.  YOU TALK ABOUT GIVING BACK, WE  JUST CELEBRATED MY LUTHER KING  JR.'S BIRTHDAY.  I WAS THINKING, THAT WAS A  STATEMENT THAT DR. MY LUTHER  KING SAID. MAYBE IT APPLIES TO  KOBE BRYANT TODAY.  THAT IS, GIVING BACK TO YOUR  FELLOW MY OWN KIND IS ONE OF  THE MOST NOBLE THINGS THAT  ANYONE CAN DO.  TO BE MORE NOBLE THAN HELPING  OUR YOUNG PEOPLE?  AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO  NOT MAKE THE MISTAKES THAT WE  HAVE MADE. THAT IS WHAT KOBE  BRYANT DOES.  THAT IS WHAT HE DID.  THAT IS WHAT LeBRON JAMES DOES.  THAT IS WHAT MAGIC DOES.  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BEING AT  THE FOREFRONT OF ALL THOSE  THINGS, KOBE BRYANT.  I REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF HIS  RETIREMENT AT STAPLES CENTER.  >> WHEN HE CAME BACK OUT WITH A  TOWEL WRAPPED AROUND HIS  SHOULDERS, THE LAST THING HE  SAID WAS, I AM OUT.  >> HE WAS READY FOR HIS NEXT  CHOPPER CHAPTER.  >> WE WANTED TO GET BACK OUT TO  CBSN LOS ANGELES.  FOR THEIR CONTINUING COVERAGE.  THERE SPEAKING TO ANOTHER NBA  LEGEND, MAGIC JOHNSON.  >> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MISS HIS  SMILE.  AND JUST MISS HIM.  BECAUSE KOBE BRYANT HAD AN AURA  ABOUT HIM.  I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LIVE  FOREVER.  I THOUGHT HE WAS INVINCIBLE.  HE PLAYED LIKE THAT.  HE WALKED LIKE THAT.  HE WAS A CONFIDENT YOUNG MAN.  WHEN JERRY WEST DRAFTED HIM, I  REMEMBER HIM WHEN HE WENT ONE- ON-ONE AGAINST KOBE BRYANT.  I'M SORRY, AGAINST MICHAEL  COOPER. THE KOBE BRYANT WAS THE  NEXT GREATEST PLAYER TO PLAY IN  THE LEAGUE.  HE WAS 17 YEARS OLD.  I WAS LIKE, WHAT?  ARE YOU SURE?  BOY, WAS HE RIGHT.  HE WAS SPOT ON.  WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER WHAT  KOBE BRYANT DID ON THE COURT.  WE WILL REMEMBER WHAT HE DID  OFF THE COURT AND FOR THE CITY.  I DO NOT THINK RIGHT NOW THAT  WE CAN PUT IT INTO WORDS WHAT  HE MEANT FOR LOS ANGELES.  I WILL MISS HIM.  WE USED TO TALK ABOUT BEING A  FATHER AND A HUSBAND.  THINGS THAT WERE SPECIAL TO THE  TWO OF US.  I WILL MISS THE CONVERSATIONS  THAT WE HAD.  I WILL MISS HIM AND THE IMPACT  HE MADE ON THE CITY.  >> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FAMILY.  HE WAS A TRUE FAMILY MAN.  HE LOVED THE IDEA THAT EVERYONE  IN THE FAMILY WERE RELATED.  MAN, I LIVE IN A HOUSE OF  WOMEN.  >> I KNOW.  WE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THAT.  I HAD THE HONOR OF BLESSING HIM . WHEN THEY PUT BOTH OF HIS  NUMBERS UP.  NUMBER 8 AND 24.  KOBE BRYANT IS UNIQUE IN SO  MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.  WHEN YOU PUT ON THAT UNIFORM,  THE LAKER UNIFORM, THERE WAS  NOBODY WHO TOOK MORE PRIDE IN  BEING A LAKER THAN KOBE.  IT WAS AMAZING.  THE CITY NEEDS HEROES. WE NEED  OUR HEROES TO BE HERE.  THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY FOR THE  CITY OF LOS ANGELES.  BECAUSE WE NEED KOBE TO BE  AROUND.  AND OUR KIDS, WHO IDOLIZED HIM.  AND THE FAN BASE WHO IDOLIZED  HIM.  THERE WAS MORE FOR HIM TO DO.  HE DIED WAY TOO EARLY.  AND HE IS LEFT QUITE A LEGACY.  BUT HE WAS STILL BUILDING ON  THAT.  THIS IS A SAD DAY FOR ALL OF  US.  >> I KNOW IN HIS POST CAREER,  HE WAS READY TO RETIRE.  WHEN HE SAID MOM BUT OUT, HE  WAS PREPARED.  HE, LIKE YOU, HAD PREPARED FOR  THE POST CAREER.  WHILE THEY WERE STILL PLAYING.  >> HE WAS A DECISIVE YOUNG MAN.  HE LEFT IT ALL ON THE COURT.  WE WERE ALL IN THERE WHEN HE  SCORED THE 60 POINTS.  THE LAST GAME.  WHO GOES OUT THAT WAY?  ONLY KOBE COULD GO AND DOMINATE  THAT LAST GAME TO SAY GOODBYE  TO ALL THE FANS.  HE WAS SPECIAL.  GOD CREATED THE SPECIAL  BASKETBALL PLAYER AND THE  SPECIAL MAN.  WE WILL MISS HIM.  AND WE WILL REMEMBER HIM FOR  HIS GREATEST THINKS.  WAS A MEMBER HOW HE AFFECTED  THE WORLD.  HE IMPACTED THE WORLD.  AND VERY FEW ATHLETES GET TO  IMPACT THE WORLD LIKE KOBE  BRYANT DID.  AND OUR CITY. THAT IS THE MAIN  THING.  HE TOUCHED OUR CITY. JUST LAST  NIGHT, EVEN WITH LeBRON PASSING  HIM, WE WERE CELEBRATING KOBE.  WE CELEBRATED LEBRON'S  GREATNESS.  WE WERE CELEBRATING KOBE'S  GREATNESS AS WELL.  AND TODAY, THAT THE SAY GOODBYE  TO A HERO TO A LEGEND TO AN  ICON.  AND THE GUY WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE  AND REMEMBER IN OUR HEARTS.  >> I WAS TALKING TO JERRY WEST.  A COUPLE OF MOMENTS AGO.  THIS WAS A PLAYOFF GAME IN  UTAH.  AND THE LAKERS WERE PLAYING  BAD.  IN BE AT HALFTIME STOOD UP AND  TOLD EVERYBODY, IF YOU ARE  AFRAID OF WINNING, GET OUT OF  MY WAY.  I WILL WIN MYSELF.  >> YOU KNOW KOBE'S MINDSET.  THIS GUY, HE WANTED TO WIN. AND  HE WOULD DO ANYTHING IT TOOK TO  WIN.  HE WAS A GREAT DEFENDER BESIDES  ONE OF THE GREATEST SCORES WE  HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE HISTORY  OF BASKETBALL.  HE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST  DEFENDERS ALSO.  IF YOU NEEDED A REBOUND, HE  WOULD GET THE REBOUND.  IF YOU NEEDED THE STEEL, HE  WOULD GET THE STEEL.  WHAT I LOVED ABOUT HIM WAS THE  PRESSURE MOMENTS IN HIM.  GIVE ME THE BALL.  EVERYBODY CALM DOWN.  I WILL LEAD US TO VICTORY.  MOST OF THE TIME, HE DID JUST  THAT.  SO CALM. OF THE CONFIDENCE THAT  HE LIVED WITH EVERY DAY.  AND EVERYTHING THEY WAS DOING  IN HIS LIFE.  THE MAN WAS CONFIDENT.  THE THING THAT I LOVE, HE  SHARED HIS TALENTS WITH OTHER  YOUNG PLAYERS.  HE WOULD WORK OUT FIVE OR 10  NBA PLAYERS EVERY SUMMER.  HE WOULD WORK OUT WNBA PLAYERS.  THE YOUNG LADIES.  ANYONE THAT CALLED HIM, HE  WOULD WORK THEM OUT.  AND GIVE THEM ADVICE.  AND THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT  THE MAN.  >> HE, LIKE YOU WAS TOTALLY  PREPARED WHEN HE RETIRED.  YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL.  WE SET MAMBA OUT, HE MEANT IT.  SOME PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THIS,  HE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST  BUSINESSMEN. THAT IS WHAT WE  TALKED ABOUT.  WE WOULD SAY, WE WERE PREPARED  TO LEAVE THE GAME.  AND WE KNEW WE WANTED TO GET  INTO BUSINESS.  AND HE MADE SOME OF THE  INCREDIBLE INVESTMENTS.  HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO.  THAT WAS PRODUCE MOVIES OR  DOCUMENTARIES.  HE WON AN ACADEMY AWARD FOR  DOING THAT.  AND HE HAD SO MUCH TO GIVE.  IS A MUCH MORE TO DO.  I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING  THIS.  HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING.  HE IS WAY TOO YOUNG.  I WAS SUPPOSED TO PASS AWAY.  HE WAS TO TALK ABOUT ME.  THIS IS A SAD DAY.  >> WE ALSO KNOW HE WAS A  PRACTICAL JOKER.  FOR AS SERIOUS AS HE WAS, HE  HAD HIS LIGHTER MOMENTS WHEN HE  WANTED TO HAVE FUN AND POKE FUN  AT EVERYONE.  >> HE WAS A GREAT TEAMMATE.  HE WAS A GREAT TEAMMATE.  HE WOULD PLAY JOKES ON PEOPLE.  HE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT  EVERYBODY WAS OKAY.  HE ALSO UNDERSTOOD HOW HE COULD  BRING EVERY TEAMMATE ALONG FOR  THE RIDE.  ONE THING ABOUT GREAT LEADERS  AS THEY KNOW HOW TO MOTIVATE  PEOPLE HOW TO GET THEM TO BE  BETTER THAN THEY THINK THEY  REALLY ARE.  AND KOBE WAS A MASTER AT THAT.  HE REALLY PUSHED HIMSELF.  ALLOWED HIM TO PUSH HIS  TEAMMATES.  THE TEAM IS CANNOT COMPLAIN.  IS A HOW HOWARD HE WAS WORKING.  AND HOW MUCH YOU WANTED TO WIN.  AND SO, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.  KOBE BRYANT WANTED TO WIN.  AND HE KNEW WHAT BUTTONS TO PUSH WITH EVERY TEAMMATE.  TO GET THEM TO PLAY AT THEIR  BEST AND AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.  LIKE YOU SAID, BECAUSE OF THE  JOKES AND BECAUSE HE WAS A  PENTACLE JOKER, THAT ALLOWED HIM TO ALSO GET ON GUYS.  AND FOR GUYS TO GET ON HIM AT  THE SAME TIME.  THAT IS WHY WE WON FIVE  TEMPERATURES OF KOBE BRYANT.  HE WILL ALWAYS BE IN OUR HEART.  WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER HIM.  GOD BLESS HIS FAMILY AND HIS  WIFE.  AND HIS DAUGHTERS THAT HE LOVED  SO MUCH.  AND REST IN PEACE FOR KOBE  BRYANT AND HIS DAUGHTER,  GIANNA.  IT IS A DEVASTATING DAY  FOR  THE BASKETBALL WORLD.  AND FOR THE CITY OF LOS  ANGELES.  FOR LAKER NATION AND FOR ALL OF  US, WHO KNEW HIM SO WELL.  EFFORT THOSE WHO TRICKED HIM  FOR 20 YEARS.  >> IT IS AMAZING, AFTER HE  RETIRED. HE WOULD GO TO THE  STAPLES CENTER AND WITH THE  OTHER PLAYERS STEP UP THEIR GAME A LITTLE BIT MORE, JUST FOR THE  EVENING, TRY TO IMPRESS HIM.  >> FOR SURE.  THE KING IS IN THE BUILDING.  WHEN YOU HAVE KOBE BRYANT IN  THE BUILDING.  YOU WANT TO SHOW HIM THAT YOU  HAD A GREAT BASKETBALL GAME AS  WELL.  HE WANTED TO IMPRESS HIM.  MOST OF THE GUYS WHO ARE  PLAYING TODAY, IDOLIZE KOBE  BRYANT GROWING UP.  PROBABLY EVERY PLAYER THAT IS  PLAYING TODAY.  THEY WANTED TO BE LIKE KOBE  BRYANT.  THAT IS WHY HE WAS SPECIAL.  EVEN THE LAST GAME I SAW HIM AT, I WAS NOT THERE.  WHEN HE SAW THE CLIPS ON TV AND  THE OVATION FROM THE CROWD.  I LeBRON JAMES GIVING HIM FIVE.  HE ALWAYS KNEW HIS DAUGHTER  WOULD BE RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  SOMEWHERE SITTING WITH HIM OR  HIS FAMILY.  HIM MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE  NOT TOO FAR FROM HIM.  >> HE LOVED LIFE.  HE LOVED DOING THINGS.  GETTING UP IN THE MORNING WITH  A PASSION FOR HIM.  >> GETTING UP EARLY IN THE  MORNING.  HE GOT HIS WORK OUT AT 3:00 OR  4:00 IN THE MORNING.  HE WAS THAT GUY.  AND THAT ALSO, HE WOULD DRIVE  HIS DOCTORS TO SCHOOL.  -- DAUGHTERS TO SCHOOL.  HE WAS DRIVEN TO BE A GREAT  BASKETBALL PLAYER.  HE WAS DRIVEN TO BE A GREAT  FATHER AND A GREAT HUSBAND.  THOSE THINGS WERE IMPORTANT TO  HIM.  I REALLY LOVED TO TALK TO HIM  ABOUT IS REALLY.  WE BOTH HAD A PASSION FOR  ITALY.  WE TALKED ABOUT IT MANY TIMES.  HE SPOKE FLUENT ITALIAN.  MY LOVE FOR ITALIAN FOOD.  WE BOTH HAVE THOSE  CONVERSATIONS.  WE WOULD BE SITTING THERE FOR  30 MINUTES OR SO.  WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT  AND IT WOULD BE GREAT.  MAN, HE IS JUST SPECIAL.  WE CANNOT FORGET HOW SPECIAL HE  WAS. NOT JUST ON THE COURT, BUT  OFF THE COURT.  WE HAVE HAD SO MANY GREAT  BASKET BALL PLAYERS HERE THE  PLAY FOR THE LAKERS.  NINE GREATER THAN KOBE BRYANT.  >> I WANT TO IN THIS BY TALKING  ABOUT NUMBERS.  IT IS WANTING TO PLAY FOR THE  LAKERS.  WHICH IS GREAT.  IT IS ANOTHER THING TO HAVE  YOUR NUMBER RETIRED.  HE HAD TO NUMBERS RETIRED.  >> AND HE SHOULD HAVE.  AGAIN, YOU MAKE A DECISION TO  CHANGE AND NUMBER.  IT PUTS MORE PRESSURE. KOBE  BRYANT LOVED THE PRESSURE. TO  PERFORM AT A HIGH LEVEL.  WHAT I LOVED, WHEN WE RETIRED  BOTH NUMBERS, YOU  >> I LIKE MYSELF, KAREEM ABDUL- JABBAR, THE OLD-SCHOOL GUYS WHO  NEVER PLAYED WITH KOBE BRYANT.  WE WERE THERE CELEBRATING HIM.  JAMES WORTHY, MICHAEL COOPER  AND DON.  AND SCOTT.  WE WERE ALL THERE CELEBRATING  HIM.  THE LAKERS AND JEANIE BUSS. SHE  IS DEVASTATED.  THIS IS LIKE HER BROTHER.  IT WAS GREAT FOR HER FAMILY TO  DO THAT.  THAT IS HOW MUCH HE MEANT TO  HER FAMILY AND TO LAKER NATION  AND ALL THE GREAT LAKER FANS  THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE WORLD.  >> I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME  METRIC.  LIKE WE ALWAYS SAY, KEEP THE  FAITH.  >> YES. IT IS NOT A  CONVERSATION I EVER WANTED TO  HAVE.  MY HEART HAS BEEN BROKEN.  I GOT OUT OF CHURCH AND FOUND  THIS OUT.  I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE IT.  NOT KOBE BRYANT.  WE HAVE TO PRAY AND PRAY FOR  HIS FAMILY. AND ALSO FOR HIS  MOM AND DAD.  WE WANT TO PLACE FOR HIM AND  HIS SISTERS.  AND PRAY FOR HIS KIDS.  AGAIN, HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE.  THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE STRENGTH  TO CARRY ON.  THANK YOU. AND EVERYONE AT THE  STUDIO, FOR WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN  DOING FOR US TODAY.  TO SHARE MEMORIES AND SHARE  SOME CLIPS OF KOBE BRYANT  TELLING HIS STORY AS WELL.  THANK YOU.  GOD BLESS.  >> ONE OF THE MOST THOUGHTFUL  INDIVIDUALS I HAVE EVER BEEN  AROUND.  JUST TO HEAR ONE SUPERSTAR,  MEGASTAR TALK ABOUT BEING IN  ALL OF ANOTHER.  >> FOR HIM TO SAY HE WAS THE  GREATEST LAKER.  OH MY GOD.  IMMEDIATELY UPON HEARING ABOUT  THIS.  I WAS WITH WOMEN FOR MICHIGAN.  WE HAPPENED TO BE TALKING ABOUT  MAGIC ON OUR TRIP.  REMEMBER WHEN MAGIC RETIRED,  THAT WAS SUCH A BLOW,  ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES.  ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE, WHO HAVE  WATCHED THEM PLAY.  HE DID NOT HAVE HIS FAMILY AT  THE TIME.  WE ARE SO SADDENED TO HEAR HE  WOULD NOT PLAY ANYMORE.  THE QUESTION WAS, WHO COULD  POSSIBLY LIGHT UP THE CITY AGAIN ? WHO COULD POSSIBLY PROVIDE  THAT SPARK FOR THE LAKERS TO  WIN CHAMPIONSHIP'S?  LET'S FACE IT, THIS IS A  CHAMPIONSHIP NATION.  CHAMPIONSHIP CITY.  AND THEN, HERE COMES 17 YEAR  OLD KOBE BRYANT.  STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.  AND IMMEDIATELY, HE BECAME THE  SUPERSTAR WITH THE LAKERS.  TO LISTEN TO MAGIC AND WATCH  KOBE BRYANT, BOTH OF THEM WHEN  THEY GOT MARRIED.  AND THEY HAD CHILDREN.  TO WATCH THEM RAISE THEIR KIDS.  KOBE BRYANT TO TAKEN UNDER  MAGIC SWING.  IT IS SO SAD. IT IS ALSO VERY  TOUCHING AND HEARTWARMING.  >> YOU WILL ALWAYS LIVE IN OUR  HEARTS.  >> THERE IS NO QUESTION.  >> IT IS AMAZING WHAT MAGIC  SAID.  NOBODY TOOK MORE PRIDE PUTTING  ON A LAKERS UNIFORM KOBE  BRYANT.  >> THINK OF OF THE GREATS.  >> THAT WE HAVE SEEN.  >> KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, MAGIC  JOHNSON.  WHEN MAGIC INTO THE LAKERS, HE  WAS THE FIRST ONE.  TO ACTUALLY WITNESS AND HAVE  LeBRON JAMES BREAK HIS RECORD  LAST NIGHT.  WHAT REALLY TOUCHES MOST OF US,  SITTING HERE, ESPECIALLY AS JIM  HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT,  EVERYTHING THAT HE BROUGHT ME  ON THE GAME.  EVEN BEYOND THE BUSINESS.  AS A PERSON AND FAMILY MAN.  BELIEVING IN YOUNG PEOPLE AND  INSPIRING THEM TO DO GREAT  THINGS.  NOT ONLY IN BASKETBALL.  JUST TO LIVE YOUR LIFE WHILE.  AND CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY.  >> THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE,  THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WE  TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER.  YOU RECOGNIZE BY ONE NAME.  MAGIC, MICHAEL, TIGER,  MOHAMMED, LeBRON, KOBE.  >> IN THE SPORTS WORLD FOR  SURE.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.  >> TO HAVE THE RESPECT OF THOSE  COMPETITORS.  DOC RIVERS, WE HAVE SOUND FROM  HIM.  >> I JUST DO NOT HAVE A LOT TO  SAY.  THE NEWS IS DEVASTATING TO  EERYBODY, WHO KNEW HIM. I KNEW  HIM A LONG TIME.  YOU KNOW, HE MEANS A LOT TO ME,  OBVIOUSLY.  YOU KNOW, HE WAS SUCH A GREAT  OPPONENT, YOU KNOW.  IT IS WHAT YOU WANT IN SPORTS.  HE HAD THAT DNA THE VERY FEW  ATHLETES CAN EVER HAVE.  TIGER WOODS AND MICHAEL  JORDAN'S.  YOU KNOW, IT IS FUNNY, I WAS  GETTING TO KNOW HIM MORE, SINCE  HE RETIRED.  THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.  WE HAVE TO GO PLAY.  THE NEWS IS DEVASTATING FOR  VANESSA AND HIS FAMILY.  THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT  HE TOUCHED.  >> YOU JUST HEARD A HEARTBROKEN  DOC RIVERS, COACH OF THE L.A.  CLIPPERS.  BEFORE WE GO, THERE ARE  DEVASTATED FANS AT L.A.  LIVE.  WE DID IDENTIFY ANOTHER PERSON  THAT WAS ON THE TOP OR.  A HERO IN HIS OWN RIGHT.  HIS NAME IS JOHN ALTOBELLI  THE  COACH OF THE ORANGE COAST  BASEBALL TEAM.

A LOT OF TEARS AND ALSO, A LOT  OF KOBE BRYANT JERSEYS.  A LOT OF LAKERS JERSEYS.  BEHIND ME, WE ARE AT L.A.  LIVE.  THE AREA IN FRONT OF STAPLES  CENTER IS BLOCKED OFF DUE TO  THE GRAMMYS.  YOU CAN SEE, EVERY ONE OF THE  TV SCREENS OUT HERE TO HAVE  KOBE BRYANT'S PHOTO.  IN LOVING MEMORY OF KOBE  BRYANT.  FROM THE YEAR HE WAS BORN, 1970- TWO 2020 WHEN HE DID DIE.  FANS OCCASIONALLY WILL START  CHANTING, KOBE, EVERY START.  THEY WILL CHANT MVP.  THERE ARE SEVERAL MEMORIALS AS  EVERY IS PLACING FLOWERS OR  BOUQUET.

THEY ARE YELLING, KOBE AND THEY  ARE YELLING HIS DAUGHTER'S  NAME, WHO PASSED AWAY AS WELL.  OCCASIONALLY, THE CROWD WILL DO  THAT.  THEY WILL START CHANTING.  WHAT IS THE FEELING OF BEING  HERE WITH OTHER PEOPLE? IS IT  HELPING?  >> YES.  THEY ARE OUR FAMILY.  THEY ARE MY FAMILY.  I DO NOT GROW UP WITH THE  BIOLOGICAL FAMILY, BUT THESE  GUYS ARE MY FAMILY.  EVERY TIME WE COME TOGETHER, IT  IS UNITY AND LOVE.  THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE.  WE ARE SHOWING THE WORLD WHAT  WE ARE ALL ABOUT WE ARE HERE  TOGETHER FOREVER.  TO THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US.  OF COURSE, IT IS GRAMMYS  SUNDAY.  LAPD HAS ASKED PEOPLE NOT TO  COME DOWN HERE.  MANY ON THE STREETS ARE NEAR  BLOCKED OFF AND SHUT DOWN  STREETS.  THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY  HOLD THE GRAMMYS AT STAPLES  CENTER EVERY YEAR.  I WILL TELL YOU, IT HAS NOT  STOPPED ANYONE.  PEOPLE CONTINUE TO STOP BY.  I WOULD SAY THERE ARE HUNDREDS  OF PEOPLE HERE.  PEOPLE BRINGING FLOWERS AND  POSTERS.  I DON'T SEE IS STOPPING.  YOU SEE PEOPLE ATTENDING THE  GRAMMYS.  AT LEAST IT LOOKS LIKE IT.  THERE DRESSED TO THE NINES.  THEY HAVE COME DOWN AS WELL TO  PAY RESPECTS.  WE WILL SCANNED THE CROWD FOR  YOU.  YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF LEAKER  GEAR.  A LOT TO BE JERSEYS.  IT IS AN UNREAL MOOD BEING DOWN  HERE.  \u00faA LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DESCRIBING  THE MOMENT THEY GOT HERE.  THEY WERE IN DISBELIEF.  WAS THEY GOT HERE, IT HIT THEM  THAT KOBE HAD PASSED AWAY.  YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE ELSE HOLDING MORE KOBE MEMORABILIA.  IT IS SOMETHING WE WILL  CONTINUE TO SEE.  THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  THE CROWD CONTINUES TO GROW.  IT IS NOT THE NEWS ANYONE  WANTED TO HEAR.  PEOPLE ARE IN DISBELIEF.  THEY FEEL LIKE IF THEY COME  TOGETHER IT WILL HELP THEM WARN . I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND  \u00faTHAT.  WHAT YOU COME DOWN HERE, YOU  CAN SEE THE FEELING.  IT FEELS GOOD TO BE AROUND  \u00faOTHER PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND  THE EMOTIONS AND THE FEELINGS  THAT EVERYONE IS GOING TO RIGHT  NOW.  OF COURSE, WE WILL BE NOAH FANT  ALL DAY.  FOR NOW, WE TURN BACK TO YOU.  >> THANK YOU FOR THAT PROGRAM  TURNED TO FIND EXACTLY THE  YEARS, I'M SURE SOMEBODY WILL  TELL ME.  KOBE BRYANT WON TEMPERATURES  WITH THIS GUY.  THE BIG GUY.  SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.  I WILL READ YOU A TWEET THAT  JUST CAME IN FROM SHAQUILLE  O'NEILL.  HE SAID HE WAS MUCH MORE THAN  AN ATHLETE.  HE WAS A FAMILY MAN.  THAT IS WHAT WE HAD IN COMMON.  I WOULD HAVE HIS CHILDREN LIKE  THEY WERE MY OWN.  HE WOULD EMBRACE MY KIDS LIKE  THEY WERE HIS.  HIS BABY GIRL GIANNA WAS BORN  THE SAME DAY AS MY YOUNGEST  DAUGHTER . I HAVE TO TELL YOU,  WHEN THEY WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP,  WE WOULD HAVE THE LAKERS  PAADE, THE PEOPLE WE WANTED TO  SEE MOST, SHOCK AND KOBE.  THEY WERE SUCH A POWERFUL TEAM.  THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES.  >> WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS  THREAD, IS WE TALK TO JERRY WEST AND DOC RIVERS.  YOU MENTIONED SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.  MAGIC SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR TO  WHAT CHUCK SAID.  WHAT HE WILL MISS ABOUT KOBE,  ARE THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HIS  FAMILY.  AND HIS DAUGHTERS.  HOW MUCH OF THE FAMILY UNIT WAS  IMPORTANT TO HIM.  >> HE WAS VERY DEEP.  KOBE WAS DEEP.  HE CAME TO THE MBA RIGHT OUT OF  HIGH SCHOOL.  >> 17.  >> JUST IN TERMS AND AS LEARNED  AS HE WAS.  PLAYING AND LIVING OVERSEAS AND  IN EUROPE.  HE BROUGHT A DIFFERENT  PERSPECTIVE.  I'M SURE IT HELPED HIM IN TERMS  OF CREATING WHAT KIND OF MAN HE  WANTED TO BE.  THERE WERE SOME OBSTACLES.  HOW ELSE DO YOU LEARN AND GROW?  YOU DO THAT FROM THINGS THAT  ARE PUT BEFORE YOU.  AND THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR  LIFE.  TO COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE A  BETTER PERSON.  ISN'T THAT A GREAT THING?  WE THINK ABOUT THE WISDOM THAT  HE DID PASS ON TO HIS OWN  CHILDREN.  AND KIDS AROUND THE WORLD.  THE KOBE BRYANT BASKETBALL  CHAMPION. HE WOULD SHOW UP.  IT COULD BE THE FIRST DAY OR  THE LAST DAY.  HE WOULD BE THERE.  AND HE WOULD TALK TO THE KIDS.  AND TELL THEM YOU SHOULD BE  DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE THIS  ARE LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT.  IT IS ONE THING TO SAY HE WAS  ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.  JUST A LEAKER.  TO PLAY THE GAME OF BASKETBALL.  HE ALSO GREW MONTHS SIT BY AND  ABBY AT BAT.  >> MAYBE THAT IS WHAT THEY WERE  GOING TO.  TO A BASKETBALL FACILITY IN  THOUSAND OAKS, IS WHAT WE ARE  HEARING. I WILL CONTINUE TO GET  INFORMATION RELATED TO THAT.  VERY RARELY DO THE GRAMMYS GET  OVERSHADOWED.  >> WE WILL GO TO WHITNEY HOPPER  AT THE GRAMMYS IN JUST A  MOMENT.  FIRST WE WILL GO TO JOY ADDICT,  IN NEWPORT COAST.  WHERE KOBE BRYANT CALLED HOME.  TO HEART BREAKING SCENE OUT  HERE.  SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  GATHERING ALL AFTERNOON.  SIMPLY TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS.  I WANT TO SHOW YOU A SMALL  MEMORIAL THAT IS STARTING TO  GROW.  IN FRONT OF THIS GATED  COMMUNITY AS FOLKS UP AND  COMING BY WITH FLOWERS AND  BALLOONS.  TO FEEL HIS PRESENCE.  THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE IS  TELLING ME.  I KNOW THEY DO NOT WANT ME TO  DO THIS, BUT THEY ARE ALL  BEHIND THE CAMERA.  I SEE 30 OR SO PEOPLE.  IF WE COULD TURN THE CAMERA  AROUND.  THAT IS WHY THEY ARE HERE.  THEY WANT TO FEEL HIS PRESENCE.  THEY CERTAINLY WANT HIS FAMILY  TO KNOW THEY OFFERED THEIR  STRENGTH.  ARE COMING WITH JERSEYS, T- SHIRTS, BALLOONS AND FLOWERS.  EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE AROUND.  MOST OF YOU ARE VERY SILENT.  I DO NOT KNOW IF ANY OF YOU  HAVE A STORY YOU FEEL UP TO  SHARING.  I WAS TALKING TO YOU EARLIER  TODAY.  YOU GO TO THE SAME CHURCHES HIS  FAMILY, CORRECT?  >> I DO, I AM A MEMBER OF OUR  LADY, QUEEN OF ANGELS IN  NEWPORT BEACH.

AT OUR NOON MASS, OUR FATHER  SAID A SPECIAL PRAYER TO THE  ENTIRE CHURCH FOR KOBE AND  EVERYONE INVOLVED.  FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.  >> Reporter: IT REALLY IS A  LOSS.  YOU CAN TELL THAT BY THE NUMBER  OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE.  AND OTHER THINGS WE ARE  HEARING.  EVERYBODY HAD A KOBE STORY.  I TALKED TO A YOUNG MAN EARLIER  TODAY.  HE WAS A TEENAGER.  HE SAID, I WOULD SEE HIM IN THE  GROCERY STORE AND I ASKED FOR A  PHOTO.  I TOLD HIM, I DO NOT PLAY  BASKETBALL, BUT I PLAYED  FOOTBALL.  WILL BE TOLD HIM, WHAT IS  IMPORTANT, IS YOU PLAY WHAT YOU  WANT TO AND STICK WITH IT.  BE ATHLETIC AND BE A PART OF  THE TEAM.  HE REALLY PUSHED THAT TO  EVERYBODY WHO WAS OUT HERE.  THAT IS WHAT YOU HEAR.  IT IS A COMMUNITY THAT HAS SEEN  KOBE FOR YEARS.  HE WAS NOT THE NOVELTY UP HERE.  HE WAS THE GUY YOU SAW AT THE  GROCERY STORE.  HE WAS THE GUY YOU SAW AT THE  GYM.  HE WAS THE GUY YOU SAW WALKING  ACROSS THE STREET.  IT WAS JIM HILL WHO SAID, HE  LITERALLY STOPPED TRAFFIC.  EVEN IN HIS OWN COMMUNITY.  AS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE WANTING  TO SHOW THEIR RESPECT.  AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE  DOING.  I SEE A LOT OF FOLKS NODDING  THEIR HEAD AT ME.  NOT WANTING TO TALK.  HE IS SOMEWHAT YOU SAW  EVERYWHERE.  I AM ASSUMING IT IS THE SAME  FOR YOU.  >> YES, ABSOLUTELY.  I HAVE A COLLAGE OF PICTURES  AFFECTING MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD.  AT EVERY AGE AND A PICTURE WITH  KOBE.  I WILL CHERISH THAT FOREVER.  >> Reporter: WHAT IS IT ABOUT  KOBE BRYANT THAT MADE HIM SUCH  A MAGNETIC PERSONALITY?>> HE WAS THE MAMBA OUT MENTALITY.  HE WAS A FAMILY MAN.  HEWAS A GOOD FATHER.  >> Reporter: SOMEBODY OUT HERE  HAD A VIDEO OF HIM LAST NIGHT  AT THE MALL.  WALKING AROUND WITH HIS SECOND  YOUNGEST DAUGHTER.  THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE OUT HERE.

ARE STOPPING TO SAY HELLO AND  SHAKE THEIR HAND.  THESE ARE HAPPY MEMORIES.  >> I KNOW CALIFORNIA COLD IS  DIFFERENT THAN REAL COLD.  WE HAVE TO REPRESENT.  ALWAYS LOVE KOBE.  >> Reporter: NO MATTER WHICH  NUMBER YOU HAVE.  8 ARE 24, IT IS A LOT OF HEART  AND A LOT OF MEMORIES.  AS I HAVE SAID ALL AFTERNOON,  HE WAS JUST A FORCE TO BE  AROUND.  IN THE COURT, LOCKER ROOM OR  COMMUNITY.  KOBE BRYANT HAVE THE MAGNETIC  PERSONALITY.  PEOPLE WOULD FOLLOW HIM ALL  AROUND.  PEOPLE WOULD FOLLOW HIM THROUGH  THE HOTEL OR THE HALLS.  EVERYONE WANTED A CHANCE TO SAY  HELLO.  I AM A BIG FAN OF YOURS AND I  LOVE TO HAVE YOU AROUND.  THAT IS THE KIND OF PERSON HE  WAS.  IT IS A MEMORY MANY HAVE.  A PRESENCE THAT WILL SURELY BE  MISSED.   >>> THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT  THE JOY.  WE ARE GOING TO GO TO AN EVENT,  A MAJOR EVENT IN LOS ANGELES.  THE GRAMMY AWARDS.  YOU TALK ABOUT CELEBRITIES AND  THE MUSIC STARS. SO MANY PEOPLE  THERE, I AM SURE, ARE SADDENED  TODAY.  BECAUSE THEY WERE IN AWE OF  KOBE BRYANT.  IF I CAN HAVE A LIST OF ALL OF  THE SONGS THE KOBE BRYANT NAME  SHOWED UP, WE WOULD BE HER  FOREVER.  THESE ARE PEOPLE, THAT IN THEIR  OWN RIGHT ARE MUSIC GENIUSES.  BUT THEY ALSO IDOLIZED KOBE  BRYANT.  WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE DID.  >> THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE  STAPLES CENTER.  ALL OF THE GREAT GAMES THAT  KOBE HAD THEREFORE THE LAKERS  AND HIS TWO JERSEYS, 8 AND 24,  HANGING FROM THE RAFTERS DURING  THE GRAMMYS TONIGHT.  >> WHEN WE TALK TO BRITNEY  HOPPER, I AM SURE THE SCRAMBLE  TO MAKE CHANGES FOR TONIGHT  SHOW.  >> Reporter: THAT IS CORRECT.

FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE  PRIVILEGED TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY  IN GOOD HEALTH AND A GOOD  FAMILY AROUND YOU.  MAKE SURE YOU GIVE THEM A  SPECIAL HUG AND KISS.  >> >> Reporter: HAVE YOU TALKED TO  ANYONE WITHIN THE SPORTS WORLD  PERSONALLY? >> I HAD 50 TEXTS AND E-MAILS  FROM PEOPLE, THIS IS REALLY  SHOCKING.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE PRAY FOR  HIS FAMILY.  HIS WIFE AND HIS KIDS.  HOPEFULLY, GOD WILL COVER THEM  RIGHT NOW.  SHOUT OUT TO BE.  LONG LIVE KOBE. THIS IS KOBE'S  HOUSE FOREVER.  >> I'M NOT SURE HOW TO PUT IT  INTO WORDS.  I JUST GOT THE NEWS.  I WAS GETTING DRESSED. I  STARTED I WAS DOING.  I WAITED A MINUTE AND ASKED  THEM TO RECONFIRM THAT.  I DO NOT BELIEVE IT. EVERY TIME  WE CAME ACROSS EACH OTHER'S  PATHS, I DO NOT IS A GENUINE  FAN OF HIS WORK.  HE WAS ALWAYS SO CLASSY.  HE WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE AND IS A  HUGE LOSS.  >> Reporter: IT IS SO  UNBELIEVABLY SAD.  WE ARE HERE AT WHAT IS SUPPOSED  TO BE A JOYOUS EVENT.  SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE WORKED HARD  ON THE MUSIC TO GET THEIR MUSIC  OUT AND GET NOMINATED FOR  GRAMMY.  WHICH IS MUSIC'S BIGGEST NIGHT.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO CELEBRATE.  AS YOU MENTIONED, KOBE HAD THAT  EFFECT ON NOT ONLY PEOPLE IN  THE SPORTS WORLD, BUT PEOPLE  ALL OVER.  INCLUDING MYSELF, A FAN FROM  THE MOMENT HE STARTED AT THE  LAKERS.  AND AS A MOTHER, YOUR HEART  NATURALLY GOES OUT TO VANESSA.  EVERYONE HERE WALKING, AND IS  SUPPOSED TO BE A JOYOUS NIGHT.  HAS TURNED INTO A SOMBER  EVENING.  I AM BEING TOLD THAT THE  GRAMMYS WILL PERHAPS, PAY SOME  TYPE OF TRIBUTE TONIGHT TO KOBE  BRYANT.  NATURALLY, OF COURSE, WE WOULD  EXPECT THAT.  FOR NOW, WE WILL CONTINUE TO  GET REACTION.

TO BE HIS FAMILY, I WANT TO  SEND MY MOST SINCERE AND  HEARTFELT REGRETS AND PRAYERS.  AND MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU  GUYS.  KOBE BRYANT WAS AN INCREDIBLE  FAMILY MAN.  HE LOVED HIS WIFE AND  DAUGHTERS.  HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE ATHLETE.  AND A LEADER IN A LOT OF WAYS.  HE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF  ATHLETES.  HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO  LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL AND GO TO THE  NBA INDUCIBLE.  DOMINATING THE GAME.  AND BECOMING ONE OF THE BEST  SCORES AT THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS AND THAT THEY HAVE EVER SEEN.  I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING  THERE WHEN HE SCORED HIS 81  POINT GAME.  IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WILL  ALWAYS REMEMBER AS ONE OF THE  HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT I HAVE  LEARNED AND OBSERVED IN SPORTS.  KOBE, MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU.  REST IN PEACE YOUNG MAN.  THIS LOSS IS HARD TO  COMPREHEND.  GO WITH GOD.  >> THE GREAT KAREEM ABDUL- JABBAR.

THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT NOT  CONFIRMING AT THIS POINT, THAT  KOBE BRYANT WAS ON BOARD.  YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR THE CURRENT FINAL CONFIRMATION FROM THE  CORONER'S OFFICE.  BACK HERE LIFE, YOU CAN SEE  FOLKS IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT  THAT ARE HERE.  WE DO EXPECT TO GET AN UPDATE  AT SOME POINT.  I CAN TELL YOU WHEN THE PRESS  CONFERENCE WAS HELD AND WE  LEARNED THAT MY PEOPLE HAD DIED  THERE WAS A GASP THE WENT UP  FROM EVERYONE HERE.  SO MUCH LOSS.  >> THAT IS WHY WE WAIT FOR  INFORMATION TO BE CONFIRMED.  THIS IS SOMETHING WE FOUND OUT  LATER TODAY.  WE WILL HAVE MORE BREAKING NEWS . I BELIEVE WILL GO TO JIM, WHO  WILL TALK WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS  LOVED KOBE BRYANT.  >> HE IS JOHN ARLAND, THE VOICE  OF THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS.  YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING A  LITTLE BIT ALREADY.  I KNOW YOU ARE IN SHOCK AS THE  REST OF US.  >> I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING WITH  THE LAKERS FOR 22 YEARS.  AND HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS EACH  YEAR.  THIS WAS THE WORST PLANE FLIGHT  I HAVE EVER BEEN ON.  ABOUT AN HOUR INTO IT, WE  NORMALLY FLY HOME AFTER THE  GAMES.  THE GAME IN PHILADELPHIA WAS  THE LATE LAST NIGHT.  A NATIONALLY TELEVISED GAME.  IT DID NOT START UNTIL 830 IN  PHILLY.  BECAUSE OF THAT, THE DECISION  WAS MADE TO SPEND THE NIGHT  THERE IF I HOME THIS MORNING TO  GET EVERYBODY ON A REGULAR  SLEEP SCHEDULE.  AN HOUR INTO THE FLIGHT TODAY  IS WHEN THE NEWS BROKE.  WE WERE ALL HOPING AND PRAYING  IT WAS WRONG.  AND THEIR A SOCIAL MEDIA.  YOU SEE SOMEBODY OR SOME ENTITY  TWEET THE SOMETHING AS HORRIBLE  AS THIS IS HAPPENED.  WE WERE HELPING THAT IT WAS  SOME TYPE OF SICK COAX.  WE FOUND OUT IT WAS NOT, YOU  CAN IMAGINE, EVERYBODY ON THE  PLANE IS CONNECTED TO BE.  AND HE WAS THE BRIGHTEST STAR  IN OUR GALAXY FOR EVERY YEAR WE  WERE THERE.  I TO GET THE NEWS IN THE AIR,  AND TO WATCH THE REACTIONS OF  EVERYBODY ON BOARD WAS THE  WORST.  >> WHAT WERE SOME OF THE  REACTIONS COMING FROM THE  PLAYERS IN SHOP ON THE PLANE?  >> THIS BELIEF.  COME ON, WHAT NOW WILL TURN OUT  TO BE HIS LAST TWEET CAME LAST  NIGHT. AFTER LeBRON JAMES PAST  HIM ON THE NBA  ALL-TIME  SCORING LIST.  HE WAS MAGNANIMOUS.  HE HAS BEEN DOING INTERVIEWS  TALKING ABOUT HOW HE THOUGHT IT  WAS A COOL THING THE GUY IN  ILLEGAL UNIFORM WAS GOING TO  MOVE BY HIM ON THE LIST AND HOW  HE WAS HAPPY FOR LeBRON JAMES.  THAT WAS THAT WEEK.  WAY TO GO, MAN.  KEEP IT MOVING.  NOTHING BUT NICE THINGS TO SAY  ABOUT LeBRON JAMES.  THOSE GUYS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A  MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY.  WE HAVE PEOPLE IN A TRAVELING  PARTY AND I AM ON THIS LIST.  OUR LIVELIHOODS OTHER JOBS ARE  AS GOOD AS THEY ARE BECAUSE OF  HIM.  I KEEP USING THE WORD STAR.  IN HOLLYWOOD AND LOS ANGELES,  IT IS A STAR DRIVEN TOWN.  AND HE WAS THE BRIGHTEST ONE OF  ALL.  HE CAME TO THE LAKERS AND  TEAMED UP WITH SHACK.  AND BROUGHT US ALL THE  EXCITEMENT WAS STABLE CENTER  OPENED.  WHEN KOBE AND SHAQUILLE O'NEAL  WON THOSE TITLES, THERE WAS NO  L.A.  LIVE.  YOU BEEN DOING TO REPORT THAT  L.A.  LIVE WHEREVER ONE IS GOVERNED.  L.A.  LIVE DID NOT EXIST.  AND MAYBE NEVER WOULD HAVE COME  ALONG IF IT WERE NOT FOR KOBE  BRYANT.  THOSE GUYS DEALT DOWNTOWN  STAPLES CENTER ENERGY UP.  AND THEY PUT THE BIG HOTEL UP.  THEY PUT UP THE NOKIA THEATER  AND THE MICROSOFT THEATER.  THE NEWS TODAY, MY REACTION TO  ALL OF THIS IS BETWEEN SADNESS,  DISBELIEF AND SHOCK.  IN PARTS, ALL THREE.  >> YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEEN KOBE BRYANT FROM  DAY ONE, UP UNTIL TODAY.  YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE  OPERATES.  HOW HE FEELS.  A PASSION THAT HE HAS.  IN HIS HEART.  HE WAS A GUY WHO REALLY, REALLY  CARED ABOUT WEARING PURPLE AND  GOLD.  >> MAYBE MORE THAN ANYONE. IF  YOU ASK WHO IS THE GREATEST  LAKER OF ALL TIME, SOME PEOPLE  WILL SAY, THE MOST POPULAR  LAKER WAS MAGIC.  THE ALL-TIME LEADING SCORER IN  THE NBA IS KAREEM.  THE LAKERS HAVE A RICH HISTORY.  THE BRIGHTEST LAKER STORE EVER  WAS KOBE BRYANT.  HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO PLAYED  20 YEARS WITH THE LAKERS.  HE HOLDS ALMOST EVERY RECORD.  BECAUSE OF THAT, WE USED TO USE  HIS NAME AS A VERB.  WE USED TO TELL PEOPLE, WHEN I  WAS WORKING WITH YOU AT CHANNEL  2 AND THEN, WHEN I TRANSFERRED  TO BECOME A LAKER BROADCASTER,  IF WE COULD KEEP THE GAME  CLOSE, WE COULD KOBE IT IN THE  FOURTH QUARTER.  WHICH WE WILL FOUR, WE JUST  GIVE HIM THE BALL AND LET HIM  WIN THE GAME.  HE WAS LIKE THE PIED PIPER.  HE HAS SUCH A FOLLOWING BECAUSE  OF THAT.  HE BROUGHT SO MUCH FUN AS MUCH  ENERGY.  IS A MUCH STAR POWER.  THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY TODAY,  IS REACTING WITH SO MUCH  EMOTION.  EVEN PEOPLE HE HAD NEVER MET,  HE HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR WORLD  BY PERFORMING AS WELL AS HE  DID.  AND THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SAYING  THIS REACTIONS FROM REPORTERS,  WHEN THEY ASK PEOPLE ABOUT THE  NEWS.  KOBE'S WORK ETHIC AND HIS  DRIVE.  AND HIS POSITIVITY.  IT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN TAKE IF  YOU ARE A POLICEMAN OR FIREMAN  OR AN ACTOR. OR AN ACCOUNTANT  OR SPORTS CASTER AND A PLATE TO  YOU.  IS WHAT WE USED TO CALL THE  MAMBA MENTALITY.  I THINK THAT IS WHY YOU SEE THE  REACTION YOU SEE TODAY.  HE HAD THE ENERGY AROUND HIM,  WHEREVER HE WENT.  >> KEEP THE FAITH.  >> THAT IS THE VOICE OF THE LOS  ANGELES LAKERS.   >>> A TREMENDOUS WORK ETHIC.  WE ALWAYS WANT TO SEE THE LAST  SHOTS THAT KOBE BRYANT WOULD  MAKE, TO WIN THE GAME FOR THE  ESSENTIALS LAKERS.  WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT KOBE  BRYANT.  AND HIS BEAUTIFUL, LOVELY  DAUGHTER.  THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAT  WERE ON BOARD THE HELICOPTER.  SEVEN OTHERS. WE ARE LIVE WITH  A FAMILY MEMBER OF ONE OF THOSE  VICTIMS.  >> Reporter: FOR THE PAST FEW  HOURS THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS  OF PEOPLE COMING OUT HERE TO  ORANGE COAST COLLEGE.  SPECIFICALLY TO THE BASEBALL  DIAMOND.  PEOPLE HERE, GRIEVING.  THAT IS BECAUSE JOHN ALTOBELLI,  THE HEAD COACH  FOR MANY, MANY  YEARS ON THIS CAMPUS, IS  BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF  THOSE KILLED, ALONG WITH HIS  WIFE, CARRIE AND HIS DAUGHTER,  ALYSSA. WITH ME HERE, IS HIS  BABY BROTHER, TONY. TONY, LET'S  FIRST TALK ABOUT, WITH REGARD  TO THE CRASH, THERE IS SO  LITTLE THAT YOU KNOW AT THIS  POINT.  >> I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT.  I WAS WALKING AROUND BALBOA. I  GOT A TEXT MESSAGE FOR MY OLDER  BROTHER.  ASKING IF I HAD HEARD ABOUT  KOBE BRYANT HELICOPTER  INCIDENT.  HE DID NOT KNOW THAT MY BROTHER  MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE CHOPPER.  I DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT  IT.  I STARTED TO CHECK THE INTERNET  AND EVERYTHING WAS OVERLOADED.  I CANNOT GET A RESPONSE FROM  THAT.  REACHED OUT TO ONE OF OUR  COACHES.  HE ASKED ABOUT MY BROTHER.  IT MADE ME CURIOUS.  IS STARTED TO TEXT COACHES ON  THE BASEBALL FIELD.  ONE MY ASSISTANT COACHES AND  TOLD ME THE NEWS.  THAT WAS THE FIRST I HEARD OF  IT.  >> Reporter: WE WILL STEP ASIDE , AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK.  SO THAT WE CAN SEE ALL OF THESE  PLAYERS WHO ARE SHOWING UP AND  EMBRACING ONE ANOTHER.  THERE ARE SO MANY TEARS BEING  SHED.  WHAT THEY ARE TELLING ME ABOUT  YOUR BROTHER, IS THAT THIS WAS  A FAMILY. HE WAS A FATHER AND A  MENTOR.  YES, IT WAS ABOUT BASEBALL, BUT  THERE WAS MUCH MORE GOING ON  HERE.  >> YES, WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT  THE PIRATE FAMILY.  WE TALKED ABOUT THAT TODAY.  WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE MEANT  TO EVERYONE.  NOT JUST THE PLAYERS.  BUT THE PARENTS.  THE TIME AND EFFORT HE PUT IN  OVER THE 20 YEARS HE HAS BEEN  HERE.  YOU LOOK AT THE FIELD AS THE  TESTAMENT TO MY BROTHER.  THIS FIELD WAS NOT IN THE  GREATEST SHAPE WHEN HE TOOK  OVER THE PROGRAM.  IT IS NOW ONE OF THE TOP  PROGRAMS IN THE NATION.  IT IS A LEGACY THAT  UNFORTUNATELY, WAS CUT OFF WAY  TOO SHORT.  IT WILL LIVE ON FOR MANY YEARS.  >> Reporter: I WANT TO MENTION  YOUR BROTHER WON FOUR DIGIT  NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS HERE AT  ORANGE COAST COLLEGE. LAST  YEAR, HE WAS THE NATIONAL COACH  OF THE YEAR.  WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR  SHARING WITH US.  WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LOST NOT  ONLY HER BROTHER, BUT SISTER IN  AND AND EAST.  WE APPRECIATE IT.  WE ARE ALL, AS A COMMUNITY  GROUPING WITH YOU.   >>> THE RED CARPET IS GOING ON  IN ANTICIPATION OF THE GRAMMY.  BRITNEY HOPPER IS THERE.  >> OKAY, WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM  BRITNEY HOPPER ANY MINUTE NOW.  BECAUSE THE LIVE SHOW FOR THE  RED CARPET SHOW WILL START  SOON.  WE DID WANT TO GET A LAST- MINUTE HIT. TO GET MORE  INFORMATION FROM HER.  THERE SHE IS.  >> Reporter: A LOT OF PEOPLE  ARE SHOWING UP ON THE RED  CARPET.  IT IS A VERY SOMBER, SOMBER  FEELING.  IF WE CAN MOVE THE CAMERA OVER  HERE.  WE HAVE BILLY RAY CYRUS.  WE JUST SAW BLAKE SHELTON.  I WANT TO LIVE WITH SHEILA E.  YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION TO MANY  IN THE MUSIC WORLD.  YOU SADLY WERE TELLING ME  EARLIER TODAY, YOU WERE DONE  WITH PARCELS AND YOU WILL BE  PERFORMING TONIGHT.  TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU  HEARD THIS HORRIBLE, TRAGIC  NEWS OF KOBE BRYANT.  >> WE JUST GOT OFFSTAGE AT THEY  LET US KNOW THAT KOBE HAD  PASSED AWAY.  THEY GRABBED MY ARM AND SAID,  WE HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS.  MY KNEES BUCKLED.  I WAS IN DISBELIEF.  WE ARE IN KOBE'S HOUSE.  WE ARE DOING A SALVATION OF  PRINTS AS WELL.  >> Reporter: AND NIPSEY HUSSLE.  >> IT IS HORRIBLE, WHAT IS  HAPPENING.  WE NEED TO CELEBRATE LIFE. WE  WILL DO THAT TONIGHT.  >> Reporter: CLEARLY, KOBE  BRYANT WAS A HUGE FEATURE IN  THE SPORTS WORLD.  ALSO, IN EVERYONE'S WORLD.  >> HE HAS AFFECTED PEOPLE,  THERE WAS NOT JUST WITH  BASKETBALL.  THE THINGS HE HAS DONE WITH HIS  PHILANTHROPY.  THERE ARE TONS OF THINGS.  TOOK SUCH A CHARITABLE MAN,  FATHER AND HUSBAND.  >> THIS LOSS AND HIS DAUGHTER,  IS TRAGIC.  >> Reporter: AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, HAVE A NICE TIME TONIGHT.  ENJOY YOURSELF.  I APPRECIATE YOU COMING AND  TALKING TO US ON LIVE TV.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOURS.  WE TALKED TO A LOT OF OTHER  PEOPLE TONIGHT.  IT IS THE SAME THING.  A SOMBER DAY.  I THINK WE WILL GO TO A COUPLE  OF SOUND RIGHTS.  I KEEP SAYING THIS.  RICK ROSS DOES NOT SHOW MUCH  EMOTION.  HE SHOWED A LOT OF EMOTION.  TO LISTEN.  >> LOSING A MASSIVE SUPERHERO  FOR US LIKE THAT.  >> HEARTBROKEN.  WE GREW UP WITH KOBE.  I KNOW THE CITY IS HURTING.  I AM DEFINITELY HURTING.  MOST UP URGENTLY, WE ARE  PRAYING FOR HIS FAMILY.  HIS WIFE AND HIS FOR KIDS.  HOPEFULLY, GOD WILL COMFORT  THEM RIGHT NOW.  A SHOUT OUT TO KOBE BRYANT.  WE ARE IN HIS HOUSE.  IT IS HIS HOUSE FOREVER.  >> I'M NOT SURE HOW TO PUT IT  INTO WORD.  I JUST GOT THE NEWS.  I WAS GETTING DRESSED.  SOMEBODY TOLD ME. I STOPPED  WHAT I WAS DOING.  I WAITED A MINUTE.  I ASKED THEM, WE CAN FROM THAT.  I DO NOT BELIEVE IT. I DO NOT  WANT TO BELIEVE THIS.  EVERY TIME WE CAME ACROSS EACH  OTHER, I LET HIM KNOW I WAS DID  GENUINE FAN.  HE WAS ALWAYS SO CLASSY.  HE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF SO  MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS.  >> Reporter: WE ARE TOLD THE  GRAMMYS HAVE HAD TO CHANGE  THINGS UP TONIGHT. IN ORDER TO  PAY TRIBUTE TO KOBE BRYANT.  LIKE TO AT THE STAPLES CENTER.  KOBE BRYANT'S HOME AWAY FROM  HOME.  BRITNEY HOPPER, BACK TO YOU.   >>> BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD,  BRITNEY TALKED ABOUT CHANGING  THE SHOW AT THE GRAMMYS.  SO MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.  DURING THE GRAMMYS, AND A  COINCIDENCE OF COURSE.  I REMEMBER, SEVERAL YEARS AGO.  WHITNEY HOUSTON DIED  PREMATURELY.  THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE SHOW FOR  TRIBUTES TO HER.  SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS  WITH A SUPERSTAR LIKE KOBE  BRYANT.  BELOVED BY SO MANY.  THAT IS HIS HOUSE.  >> IN KOBE'S HOUSE.   >>> WHAT IS SO INTERESTING, IS  WILL BE WINDS'S A SPORT.  HE INFLUENCES MUSIC AND  CULTURE.  AND TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN IN HIS  HOUSE.  THE GRAMMYS. ON THE NIGHT OF  HIS DEATH.  IT IS AMAZING HOW IT  INTERTWINES.  >> I HEARD SOMEONE ON THE RADIO  EARLIER.  I HAD JUST LANDED, COMING TO  WORK.  DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE  WHEN JOHN KENNEDY DIED?  THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT  WILL SAY, I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I  WAS DOING WHEN KOBE BRYANT DIED  HE WAS PART OF A NEW  GENERATION.   >>> WE WILL BREAK AWAY FROM  CBS2 TO TAKE YOU TO THE  GRAMMYS.  WE WILL CONTINUE OUR  CONVERSATION HERE AND TO BE  COVERAGE ON KCAL 9 THROUGHOUT  THE EVENING.  WILL CONTINUE TO BRING IT HERE  ON KCAL MY DIJ AND KICK OUT MY  DIJ.COM.  AND CBS2 DID GO TO THE GRAMMYS.  >>> THE WORLD JOINS THE CITY  AND MORNING THE SUDDEN DEATH OF  KOBE BRYANT.  >>> HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW.  ABOUT THE TRAGEDY THAT IS  HITTING ALMOST EVERYONE VERY  HARD.  NINE PEOPLE ON BOARD THE  AIRCRAFT.  IT WAS A SIKORSKY HELICOPTER.  THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO A  POSSIBLE GAME IN THOUSAND OAKS,  WHEN THE CHOPPER WENT DOWN.  >>> IN ADDITION TO KOBE BRYANT  AND HIS DAUGHTER GIANNA, ORANGE  COAST COLLEGE BASEBALL COACH,   JOHN ALTOBELLI HAS BEEN  IDENTIFIED AS A VICTIM.  THE NTSB IS ON THE SCENE  INVESTIGATING HOW THE  HELICOPTER WENT DOWN.  WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WEATHER  CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW.  IT WAS VERY FOGGY.  >> SO MANY FANS ARE SHOCKED AND  SADDENED ABOUT THE NEWS.  OF KOBE BRYANT'S DEATH.  >> WE WILL GO TO STAPLES  CENTER.  THAT IS KOBE'S HOUSE, LET'S  FACE IT.  WE HAVE SO MANY FANS THAT ARE  OUT TO GIVE THEIR RESPECTS TO  KOBE AND HIS FAMILY.  LESLIE MARINE IS LIVE NOW.  I CAN JUST IMAGINE THE SEA OF  FANS, SHOWING UP FOR A VERY  DIFFERENT REASON TODAY.  IF YOU CAN THINK ABOUT ALL THE  TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP FOR AT  LAKERS PARADE, TO CHAIR KOBE  BRYANT.  THIS TIME, IT IS VERY  DIFFERENT.  AND VERY PAINFUL.  >> Reporter: I WOULD SAY IT IS  SURREAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.  A LOT OF SHOCK.  IF WE COULD SWITCH A CAMERA  AROUND, YOU WILL SEE GROWN MEN  AND WOMEN IN TEARS, AS THEY  DROP OFF FLOWERS AND JERSEYS  AND BASKETBALLS. PHOTOS OR  WHATEVER THEY HAVE.  TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO KOBE  BRYANT.  THERE ARE LITERALLY SO MANY  PEOPLE IN TEARS.  YOU CAN FEEL THE EMOTION.  IT IS SOMBER.  MANY PEOPLE TELLING ME THE  REASON THEY CAME TO STAPLES  CENTER IS BECAUSE THIS WAS  KOBE'S SECOND HOME.  THIS IS WHERE THEY HAD JOYCE  MOMENTS WITH HIM.  IF YOU WANTED TO SEE KOBE  BRYANT, YOU CAN FIND HIM HERE.  EVEN AFTER HE STOPPED PLAYING  FOR THE LAKERS.  FANS LOOK FORWARD TO HIM  STOPPING BY.   TO SPEAK TO GABRIEL HERE. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST FANS HERE, HE BROUGHT DOWN A FLORAL ARRANGEMENT. GABRIEL, WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE FOR YOU TO BE HERE? I KNOW THIS MOMENT LS VERY SURREAL FOR A LOT OF >>> WELL, WE'RE HERE, AND IT'S  A SOMBER MOMENT, AND AT THE  SAME TIME, WE'RE CELEBRATING  KOBE FOR ALL THE GREATNESS HE'S  BROUGHT TO L.A., BEING AN  AMAZING FATHER, A HUSBAND, A  FRIEND, A BROTHER, EVERYONE  THAT HE'S BEEN HERE.  A SON.  AND THE BEST BASKETBALL PLAYER  OUT THERE.  >> YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE  ACTUALLY OUT DOING THINGS WHEN  YOU HEARD THIS.  WHEN YOU WENT TO GET THAT  FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.  WHY DID YOU NEED TO BE AT THE  STAPLES CENTER IN.  >> BECAUSE THIS IS THE HOUSE  THAT KOBE BUILT.  THIS IS HIS DOMAIN, AND I FELT   COMPELLED THAT AT HIS FAN, TO  PAY RESPECTS TO KOBE, GIGI,  EVERYONE WHO HAS PASSED.  I JUST FELT I HAD TO COME DOWN  HERE.  >> Reporter: WHEN YOU BROUGHT  THIS FLOWER ARRANGEMENT DOWN,  YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT HIS WIFE  GIGI.  AS A FATHER, CAN YOU IMAGINE  THIS EVER HAPPENING?  >> NO, IT'S SO WE'RE ALL IN  SHOCK, IT'S JUST TERRIBLE, BUT  WHEN I FOUND OUT IT'S JUST  HEART WRENCHING FOR EVERYONE.  EVERYONE HAS A BROKEN HEART.  I FELT HER MEMORY NEEDED TO BE  SHARED AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE  THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THIS.  I FEEL THAT EVERYONE HERE IS  JUST, WE'RE STILL IN SHOCK, AND  WE'RE SHOWING OUR LOVE FOR  KOBE, AND HIS FAMILY, AND  EVERYONE.  >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, GABRIEL,  FOR TALKING TO US.  AS SUZANNE WOULD SHOW YOU,  THERE ARE PLENTY OF KOBE  MEMORABILIA AROUND HERE, BUT  ALSO ALL THE TV'S HERE AT L.A.  LIVE HAVE THIS IN LOVING MEMORY  OF KOBE BRYANT SIGN FLASHED  ACROSS THE SCREEN.  YOU CAN SEE ALL AROUND HERE,  EVERY SO OFTEN, FANS WILL START  TO CHEER KOBE.  THEY'RE GOING RIGHT NOW, YOU  CAN HEAR THEM.  THEY'LL BE CHANTING MVP.  I WILL TELL YOU, WE'VE BEEN  HERE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS NOW,  AND SOME FANS THAT ARE STANDING  IN FRONT OF THIS MEMORIAL HAVE  JUST NOT LEFT.  THEY'RE IN TEARS, THEY'RE IN  DISBELIEF.  ACROSS THE STREET, OF COURSE,  THE GRAMMYS GOING ON.  AND LAPD HAS ALERTED PEOPLE NOT  TO COME DOWN HERE, OBVIOUSLY,  IT HASN'T STOPPED THEM, BUT  THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO  STRESS, OBVIOUSLY, THEY HAVE  ALL THE STREETS AROUND HERE  BLOCKED OFF, BECAUSE THE  GRAMMYS IS GOING ON AT STAPLES  CENTER.  BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, HUNDREDS OF  FANS ERE, I'LL TELL YOU AS TIME  GOES BY, THIS L.A.  LIVE AREA GETS EVEN MORE  PACKED.  BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, PEOPLE  BRINGING DOWN FLOWERS THERE,  IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL TO BE OUT  HERE, BECAUSE PAT, LIKE YOU  WERE SAYING, PEOPLE CAME HERE  TO CELEBRATE KOBE, FOR SO MANY  YEARS, CELEBRATE THE  CHAMPIONSHIPS, CELEBRATE HIS  RETIREMENT.  CELEBRATE HIS JERSEY BEING  RETIRED.  ANYTIME THAT THEY WANT TO  CELEBRATE KOBE, THEY WOULD COME  DOWN IN FRONT OF STAPLES  CENTER, AND TODAY THEY'RE  REMEMBERING THIS GREAT LEGEND  AT HIS SECOND HOME.  >> OKAY, LESLIE.  YOU WERE MENTIONING SOME OF THE  STATISTICS THERE, PAT, WE  SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A MOMENT  TO JUST KIND OF UNFURL JUST THE  SUCCESS THAT HE HAD.  HE WAS A FIVE TIME NBA  CHAMPION.  KOBE, EIGHT TIME NBA ALL-STAR.  TWO TIME NBA SCORING CHAMPION,  AND THEN AFTER BASKETBALL, HE  WON THAT OSCAR, AND HE'S ALSO A  TWO TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST.  >> I'M HOPING WE CAN GET SOME  VIDEO OF THAT LATER FOR OUR  AUDIENCE.  THAT WAS JUST A VERY BEAUTIFUL  PIECE, TOUCHING PIECE.  AND YOU MENTIONED HIM WINNING  THOSE GOLD MEDALS FOR THE  UNITED STATES.  HE WAS JUST SUCH AN  ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG MAN, BUT  MORE IMPORTANTLY, I BELIEVE A  FAMILY MAN.  >> JUST AS JIM HAD MENTIONED  THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOWN  BY THEIR FIRST NAME, AND KOBE  IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM.  >> THE CHOPPER THAT KOBE BRYANT  AND EIGHT OTHER PEOPLE WERE  RIDING IN WAS ACTUALLY HEADED  TO A YOUTH BASKETBALL  TOURNAMENT IN THOUSAND OAKS.  >> JAKE REINER IS OUTSIDE THE  MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY, WHERE  KOBE'S DAUGHTER WAS SET TO PLAY  TODAY.  >> Reporter: JEFF AND PAT,  WE'VE BEEN TALKING ALL  AFTERNOON ABOUT WHAT KOBE HAS  MEANT TO THE COMMUNITY, AND I  THINK THIS ILLUSTRATES IT.  SO YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE  CROWD THAT HAS BEEN GATHERED IN  THOUSAND OAKS.  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DROPPING OFF  FLOWERS, TELLING KOBE STORIES.  I SPOKE TO A FATHER WHO TOLD ME  HIS DAUGHTER WAS SET HERE TO  PLAY TODAY, BUT ALL OF THOSE  GAMES HAVE BEEN CANCELED.  HE ALSO TOLD ME KOBE WAS  SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TO COACH  HIS DAUGHTER IN A BASKETBALL  TOURNAMENT CALLED THE MAMBA  CUP, WHICH IS A SERIOUS OF  BASKETBALL TOURNAMENTS FOR  YOUTH BASKETBALL HERE, AND IT  IS A WEEKEND TOURNAMENT THAT  WAS SUPPOSED TO END TODAY.  HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE AT  2:00 TO COACH THAT GAME.  SO VERY SOMBER MOOD HERE.  PEOPLE SHARING STORIES, AND  OBVIOUSLY TEARS AS WELL.  I SPOKE WITH A NUMBER OF THE  KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN FITTED FROM  THE MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY TODAY.  ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY GOT TO  SPEND SOME TIME WITH KOBE  DURING A SPORTS, A BASKETBALL  CAMP, ONE SUMMER, AND I SPOKE  TO HIM ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE  TO LEARN FROM THE GREAT KOBE  BRYANT.  >> I WAS AWE STRUCK.  IT WAS AMAZING.  IT FELT LIKE I WAS IN HEAVEN.  HAVING FUN.  LEARNING STUFF.  >> WHAT DID YOU LEARN?  >> I LEARNED THAT, HOW TO GET  OFF YOUR DEFENDER AND LIKE GET  OFF OF HIM, AND STUFF.  >> HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY,  BUDDY?  >> SAD.  DEPRESSED.  >> WHAT DID KOBE MEAN TO YOU AS  A LAKERS FAN, AND BASKETBALL  FAN?  >> HE MEANT TO ME AS MY DAD.  >> AND THAT KIND OF ILLUSTRATES  HOW A LOT OF KIDS LOOKED UP TO  HIM AS A FATHER FIGURE.  AS SOMEONE THAT WAS VERY  INFLUENTIAL IN THEIR LIVES.  AND BACK LIVE, YOU CAN SEE THE  CROWD STILL OUT HERE.  THEY HAVE BEEN COMING IN DROVES  ALL AFTERNOON.  IT'S JUST REMARKABLE TO HEAR  EVERYBODY'S STORY, THEIR  CONNECTION, WHEN THEY'VE EITHER  SEEN KOBE AT A GAME, OR MET HIM  IN PERSON.  I KNOW THAT I'VE HAD MANY  ARGUMENTS OVER MY LIFETIME  ABOUT WHO THE GREATEST  BASKETBALL PLAYER IS OF ALL- TIME.  I'M ALWAYS ARGUING, THAT IF YOU  WANT SOMEONE IN THE FOURTH  QUARTER, WITH THE BALL, THE  GAME ON THE LINE, IT'S A CLOSE  TIE, I THINK BETWEEN KOBE AND  MICHAEL JORDAN.  BUT YOU KNOW, AS SOMEONE THAT'S  GROWN UP IN LOS ANGELES, OF  COURSE, I WOULD TAKE KOBE  BRYANT IN THAT MATCH UP.  OF COURSE, WITH THE GAME ON THE  LINE, YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE IT TO  THE MAMBA.  SO THAT'S THE SCENE OUT HERE.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING YOU  THE LATEST, AND STICK WITH US  ON KCAL9, AND CBS 2. WE'LL SEE  YOU IN THE STUDIO.  >> LOVE THOSE MEMORYING, JAKE.  I CERTAINLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT  HE'S TALKING ABOUT.  FOR THOSE OF US THAT HAVE GROWN  UP WITH SO MANY OF THESE  WONDERFUL PLAYERS TO HEAR JAKE  SAY THAT.  I DON'T KNOW, WOULD IT BE KOBE,  WOULD IT BE MICHAEL JORDAN?  I'M JUST GOING TO MENTION  LeBRON, SINCE HE DID BREAK  KOBE'S RECORD LAST NIGHT.  HE IS GOING TO BE SPOKEN OF,  ALREADY IS, IN THAT VEIN.  CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT IS NOW,  WHAT IT IS GOING TO BE?  THAT'S ALL BECAUSE OF WHAT HE  BROUGHT TO THE GAME.  VERY QUICKLY, JEFF, I  INTERVIEWED KOBE, I WANT TO SAY  MAYBE 2008, WE WERE STILL  SHOWING THE LAKERS ON KCAL.  I WENT TO MEET HIM ACTUALLY IN  SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA, AND I  TALKED TO JOHN IRELAND BEFORE I  DID IT, TO SAY, YOU KNOW, I'M  NOT GOING TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT  STATS AND THINGS LIKE THAT,  THAT'S NOT MY LANE.  AND YOU HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT HOW  KOBE WAS PRETTY QUIET.  HE DIDN'T JUST LIKE TO TALK TO  EVERYBODY.  HE DIDN'T LIKE TO ANSWER A LOT  OF QUESTIONS.  HE SAYS PAT, I BET IF YOU ASKED  HIM ABOUT HIS FAMILY, HE WILL  JUST OPEN UP.  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID.  AT THE TIME, THE TWO OLDEST  BOYS WERE BORN, AND IT WAS LIKE  WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EACH  OTHER, LIKE ON A LIVING ROOM  SOFA, TALKING FOR THE FIRST  TIME, LAUGHING AND SMILING.  AND YOU KNOW, I'M OBVIOUSLY  GOING TO REMEMBER THAT, BUT  AGAIN, I WAS SUCH A HUGE FAN.  I JUST REMEMBER WHEN HE CAME  HERE.  >> THAT WAS ON THE MIND OF SO  MANY PEOPLE THIS MORNING, WHEN  THEY HEARD THAT KOBE BRYANT WAS  POSSIBLY WITH ONE OF HIS  DAUGHTERS.  OBVIOUSLY, HE WAS GOING WITH  HIS DAUGHTER TO THE MAMBA  SPORTS ACADEMY FOR A BASKETBALL  GAME.  THAT IS JUST LIKE THE FAMILY  MAN THAT WE'VE HEARD OVER AND  OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  WHAT IS INTERESTING, YOU  MENTIONED JOHN IRELAND, HE HAD  MENTIONED BEFORE, THERE WAS A  POINT IN TIME WHERE KOBE'S NAME  BECAME A VERB.  THEY WOULD SAY, WE WOULD JUST  KOBE IT AT THE END, IN A TIGHT  GAME.  HE WOULD JUST TAKE HIM OVER THE  TOP.  AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THESE LIVE  PICTURES.  THIS IS THE STAPLES CENTER  WHERE THE GRAMMY'S ARE GOING  HOLD, AND THESE PEOPLE ARE  THERE FOR KOBE BRYANT.  >> WE'VE SEEN THIS OUTPOURING  BEFORE, BUT FOR VERY, VERY  DIFFERENT REASONS.  REMEMBER WHEN HE RETIRED?  THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST  ILLUMINATING NIGHTS.  NOT JUST IN SPORTS HISTORY, BUT  HISTORY, PERIOD.  BECAUSE FOR PEOPLE TO COME UP  AND SHOW THE LOVE, AND TO THANK  HIM FOR ALL THOSE YEARS THAT HE  GAVE TO THE CITY OF LOS  ANGELES.  THE FIVE CHAMPIONSHIPS.  JUST THE 150% EFFORT THAT HE  GAVE EVERY TIME HE WAS ON THE  COURT.  TO SEE THEM NOW, I WOULD BE  SURPRISED IF THIS IS SOMETHING  THAT IS NOT JUST THIS EVENING.  AGAIN, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK  ABOUT SO MANY OF THE YOUNG  PEOPLE THAT HE TOUCHED, AND  WANT TO BE LIKE KOBE, BUT ALSO  WERE JUST INSPIRED TO BETTER  THEMSELVES, BECAUSE HE PROVED  WHAT YOU CAN DO THROUGH HARD  WORK.  THAT'S WHAT HE'S ABOUT.  I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER REASON  WHY IN THE BEGINNING, YOU  DIDN'T JUST WELCOME MEDIA  ATTENTION, BECAUSE HE WAS ABOUT  THE WORK, AND I LET THE WORK  SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.  >> WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF  REACTION HERE ON KCAL 9. WE  CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ALL OF THAT  REACTION COMING IN ON SOCIAL  MEDIA.  >> THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO  HAVE WEIGHED IN ON SOCIAL  MEDIA, INCLUDING PRESIDENT  BARACK OBAMA.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.  WE'RE GOING TO GO NOW TO TINA  WITH MORE ON THIS.  >> YOU CAN IMAGINE, JUST  EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE AN  OPINION, BECAUSE KOBE HAS BEEN  PART OF OUR COLLECTIVE LIVES  FOR SO LONG.  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, SHAQ,  JUST A FEW OF THE PEOPLE  TWEETING ABOUT THIS.  SHAQ SAID THERE'S NO WORDS TO  EXPRESS THIS PAIN I'M GOING  THROUGH, LOSING MY NIECE GIGI  AND MY BROTHER KOBE BRYANT.  I LOVE YOU, AND YOU'LL BE  MISSED.  MY CONDOLENCES GOES OUT TO THE  BRYANT FAMILY AND THE FAMILIES  OF THE OTHER PASSENGERS  ONBOARD.  I AM SICK RIGHT NOW.  AND KOBE, WE LOVE YOU BROTHER,  WE APPRECIATE THE LIFE YOU  LIVED AND ALL THE INSPIRATION  YOU GAVE.  JOHN LEGEND TWEETED I'M SO SAD  AND STUNNED RIGHT NOW.  IN STAPLES ARENA, PREPARING TO  PAY TRIBUTE TO ANOTHER  BRILLIANT MAN WE LOST TOO SOON.  NIPSEY HUSSLE, LIFE CAN BE SO  BRUTAL, AND SENSELESS.  HOLD ONTO YOUR LOVED ONES.  FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID  KOBE WAS JUST GETTING STARTED  IN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS  MEANING AS A SECOND ACT. TO LEASE GIANNA IS JUST AS  UNTHINKABLE TO US.  KOBE BRYANT, KNOWN IN SO MANY  DIFFERENT WORLDS IS GONE.  JUST A FEW OF THE TWEETS WE'RE  SEEING, ALL OF THESE FOLKS  TALKING ABOUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.  >> VERY BIG OUTPOURING TINA,  ALL OF THAT COMING TO US FROM  SOCIAL MEDIA.  LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS  PICTURE HERE.  THIS IS GOING TO BE THE LIVE  LOOK AT THE STAPLES CENTER.  THIS IS WHERE THE GRAMMYS ARE  TONIGHT, BUT YOU SEE THERE IN  THE BILLBOARD, YOU SEE THE  CROWDS.  THEY'RE ALL THERE FOR KOBE  BRYANT.  WE CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FLIGHT  FROM LONG BEACH WAS TO MAMBA  SPORTS ACADEMY IN THOUSAND OAKS  WHEN THAT HELICOPTER WENT DOWN  ABOUT 9:45 THIS MORNING IN  CALABASAS.  9 PEOPLE ONBOARD.  WE HAVE CONFIRMED NOW OF SIX  VICTIMS.  WE HAVE KOBE OF COURSE, HIS 13- YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, GIANNA.  WE HAVE JOHN ALTOBELLI, HIS  WIFE CARRIE, AND DAUGHTER  ALLISSA, ALONG WITH CHRISTINA  MAUSER, WHO IS A BASKETBALL  COACH AT HOWARD DAY.  >> SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO SEE  PLAY OUT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE  OF DAYS, THIS IS NOT A SCENE  WE'RE GOING TO SEE JUST FOR  THIS EVENING.  I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE  CREATING MORE MEMORIALS, AND  GATHERING IN PLACES ALL OVER  L.A.  FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.  YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE, THERE ARE  FUNERALS THAT NEED TO BE  PLANNED FOR KOBE BRYANT.  I IMAGINE THAT WILL INCLUDE  SOME KIND OF LARGE PUBLIC  GATHERING IN LOS ANGELES.  >> LET'S ASSUME THE STAPLES  CENTER.  >> ABSOLUTELY.  OF COURSE, WE DON'T HAVE  DETAILS ON ANY OF THAT YET, AS  THIS IS JUST DEVELOPING.  A LOT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO  PROCESS THIS INFORMATION FOR  THE FAMILIES.  TO PROCESS THIS INFORMATION.  THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL  OSTENSIBLY BE SEEING IN THE  COMING WEEKS.  I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE  ANOTHER MOMENT WHEN THE CITY  PAUSES AND REALIZES THE IMPACT  THAT KOBE BRYANT HAD ON THIS  COMMUNITY, AND LOVERS OF  BASKETBALL.  PEOPLE REALLY, ESPECIALLY  GROWING UP HERE, PEOPLE REALLY  BONDED OVER KOBE BRYANT, AND  WHAT HE DID FOR THE LAKERS, AND  PEOPLE REALLY BONDED, JUST, YOU  KNOW FAMILIES.  I'VE BEEN GETTING TEXTS FROM  FRIENDS WHO ARE JUST TALKING  ABOUT WHAT AN INCREDIBLE ROLE  KOBE PLAYED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD,  IN THEIR ADULTHOOD, AND JUST  THEIR LOVE OF THE GAME OF  BASKETBALL.  IT'S TRANSFORMATIVE, AND IT'S A  REALLY SAD DAY.  I DO WANT TO SAY, IT'S SUCH A  SAD DAY FOR HIS DAUGHTER, AND  FOR VANESSA AND THEIR FAMILIES.  HIS COACH'S FAMILY, THIS IS AN  EQUALLY SAD, AND DEVASTATING  DAY FOR THEM.  >> YOU MENTIONED THOSE  MEMORIALS.  THOSE ARE GROWING.  WE HAVE AT THE CALABASAS CRASH  SITE.  WE HAVE THEM AT STAPLES CENTER,  WHICH YOU SEE THERE.  WE KNOW IT'S AT HOME AND  NEWPORT BEACH, WE UNDERSTAND,  IT'S ALSO OUT AT THE MAMBA  ACADEMY IN THOUSAND OAKS.  THIS IS JUST A FEW HOURS OLD,  AND THIS IS GOING TO GROW AND  GROW.  >> LOOK AT THIS LIVE SHOT.  IT'S JUST AMAZING TO SEE HOW  MANY PEOPLE ARE GATHERED DOWN  THERE.  I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING IN  THE LAST HOUR OR SO, SAYING  LAPD WAS TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO  GATHER.  OBVIOUSLY, RESOURCES ARE ARE  GOING TO BE THIN WHEN YOU HAVE  THE GRAMMYS, AND ALL THE  RESOURCES POURED INTO THAT  EVENT.  AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS LARGE  GATHERING OF PEOPLE, WHICH LAPD  NOW HAS TO CONTEND WITH, SO  THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST  TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE STAY SAFE  IN THIS KIND OF A SITUATION.  I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY  THEY'RE ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO  STAY BACK.  THIS GOES TO SHOW JUST HOW MUCH  PEOPLE REALLY LOVE KOBE AND  WHAT HE MEANS TO THEM AND HOW  MUCH HE'LL BE MISSED.  >> ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW IS  THE NTSB, THEY'LL BE  INVESTIGATING THIS HELICOPTER  CRASH IN CALABASAS.  THERE ARE 18 MEMBERS OF THE  NTSB.  WE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE  EARLIER.  THEY SAID THIS IS NO SMALLER,  OR LARGER THAN ANY OTHER NTSB  INVESTIGATION.  THEY SAID THAT THE BODIES, THE  NINE BODIES REMAIN THERE ON THE  SCENE, AND THAT'S PART OF THE  INVESTIGATION THAT WILL  CONTINUE WITH NTSB.  ANY NEW INFORMATION WE GET ON  THAT, OF COURSE, WE'LL BRING  THAT TO YOU HERE ON KCAL9.  WE TALKED WITH JERRY WEST, WHO  SAID THAT KOBE HAD AN ENORMOUS  DESIRE TO SUCCEED, WAS AN  INSPIRATION TO ALL.  MAGIC JOHNSON SAID NOBODY TOOK  MORE PRIDE IN PUTTING ON A  LAKERS UNIFORM, AND DOC RIVERS  SAYS, A GREAT OPPONENT, AND  THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT IN SPORTS.  SOMEBODY TO PLAY AGAINST LIKE  KOBE BRYANT.  >> AND HE WAS REALLY, REALLY  EMOTIONAL, AS THE CLIPPERS HAD  THEIR MATCH UP TODAY, CRYING TO  THE MEDIA, TALKING ABOUT HOW HE  NEEDED TO GO TALK TO THE TEAM.  HIS VOICE WAS SHAKING.  IT WAS REALLY, REALLY SAD JUST  TO SEE HOW MUCH PAIN HE WAS IN.  THE ROCKETS PLAYING.  TYSON CHANDLER WAS CRYING.  SOMETIMES SOME OF THE PLAYERS  IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS  WERE GETTING THE NEWS ON THE  COURT.  THERE IS A LOT OF CONVERSATION  ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHETHER THE  GAMES SHOULD BE PLAYED, OR WHY  THEY'RE STILL BEING PLAYED, AND  OBVIOUSLY, A LOT GOES INTO  CANCELING GAMES AT THE LAST  MINUTE.  CERTAINLY FANS ARE BEING  CONSIDERED IN THIS PROCESS AS  WELL.  BUT IT IS A HARD DAY FOR  PLAYERS IN THE NBA TODAY, WHO  HAVE TO GO ON AND PLAY THEIR  GAMES LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.  THIS MAN WAS A FRIEND TO THEM.  AND OBVIOUSLY, JUST THIS LOSS  OF LIFE IS SO DEVASTATING FOR  THESE PLAYERS.  WE DO HAVE SOME NEW  INFORMATION, ASIDE FROM KOBE  BRYANT, WE HAVE CONFIRMED  IDENTITIES OF SOME OF THE OTHER  VICTIMS.  WE ARE WORKING TO BRING YOU  THAT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW.  A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  ASKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHO  ELSE WAS ON THIS AIRCRAFT.  WE KNOW MULTIPLE VICTIMS  INVOLVED.  WE'VE CONFIRMED KOBE BRYANT'S  13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, GIANNA  WAS ALSO KILLED.  >> KOBE HAD ALSO COACHED  GIANNA'S AAU TEAM.  THEY WERE ALL REPORTEDLY HEADED  TO THAT AAU GAME WHEN THAT  HELICOPTER CRASHED.  >> WE KNOW JOHN ALTOBELLI WAS  AMONG THE VICTIMS AS WELL AS  HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER.  JUST DEVASTATING FOR THIS LOCAL  FAMILY.  ALTOBELLI WAS ENTERING HIS 24th  SEASON AS ORANGE COAST  COLLEGE'S COACH.  HE WAS SELECTED AS THE AMERICAN  BASEBALL ASSOCIATION'S NATIONAL  COACH OF THE YEAR AFTER HE LED  THE PIRATES TO A STATE  CHAMPIONSHIP.  IT IS JUST HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT  COACH ALTOBELLI'S FAMILY IS  FEELING NOW.  WE WANT TO SEND OUR DEEPEST,  DEEPEST, CONDOLENCES TO THEM.  THIS IS JUST A TERRIBLE DAY FOR  THAT COMMUNITY, FOR THAT FAMILY  AS WELL.  HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, AND  WE'RE JUST THINKING OF THEM  NOW.  >> THIS IS A PICTURE OF  ALTOBELLI'S WIFE HERE, HER NAME  IS CARRIE.  JOHN ALTOBELLI KNOWN BY HIS  COACH SQUAD AS COACH ALTO, SHE,  AND DAUGHTER ALLISSA WERE ALSO  ONBOARD THAT HELICOPTER IN THE  CRASH.  MAUSER WAS A BASKETBALL COACH,  WHERE KOBE'S DAUGHTER ATTENDED.  HE AND HIS CHILDREN OF COURSE  DEVASTATED.  >> JUST A REALLY TOUGH DAY FOR  ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES.  WE'RE THINKING ABOUT ALL OF  THEM TODAY, AND THE PAIN THEY  MUST BE FEELING IS IMMENSE.  OBVIOUSLY, KOBE BRYANT WAS WELL  KNOWN, BUT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE  HAD FAMILIES WHO CARE ABOUT  THEM.  IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY HARD,  AND A DIFFICULT STORY FOR US TO  COVER FOR SURE.  WE HAVE REPORTERS ALL OVER THE  AREA.  WE KNOW JEFF NGUYEN WAS AT THE  PRACTICE FACILITY.  >> HE'S AT THE LAKERS PRACTICE  FACILITY.  LET'S GO TO HIM NOW.  JEFF, WHAT'S THE LATEST?  >> Reporter: HEY, IF I'D BE  ABLE TO ASK MARK TO PAN THE  CAMERA OFF ME, A UNDERSTAND  SHOW YOU THE DOZENS OF PEOPLE  WHO HAVE GATHERED OUT HERE.  THERE IS A GROWING MEMORIAL OF  PEOPLE HERE, SHEDDING TEARS,  BUT ALSO SMILING AND SHARING  STORIES ABOUT KOBE BRYANT.  SOME OF THEM HERE ARE MY NEW  FRIENDS TAYLOR AND KEENAN.  YOU COACHED SOME YOUNG PLAYERS  THAT KOBE WAS VERY ACTIVE IN  COACHING AS WELL.  TALK TO ME ABOUT HIS  PARTICIPATION IN THAT PROGRAM,  AND WHAT HE MEANT TO THE KIDS  AND TO YOU.  >> WE HAD A CHAMPIONSHIP  BASKETBALL TEAM FOR YEARS.  YEARS AND YEARS.  COACH OUT TO COACH M. HE WAS  THE ONE WHO GOT KOBE TO COME.  KOBE WOULD LITERALLY COME AND  SIT WITH ALL OF OUR BASKETBALL  PLAYERS AND TELL THEM.  BECAUSE WESTCHESTER WAS A  PREDOMINANTLY BLACK SCHOOL, IT  BEING A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK  SCHOOL, AND GROWING UP AS A  MINORITY.  YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH TOLD, YOU  WON'T MAKE IT.  IT'S NOT A POSSIBILITY.  HE WOULD COME AND TELL THESE  KIDS, AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THAT  WORK ETHIC, AS LONG AS YOU KEEP  TRYING, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.  THAT MAN HAD SO MANY RINGS, SO  MANY REWARDS, JUST DID SO MUCH  FOR THE COMMUNITY, AND HE  WASN'T EVEN FROM HERE.  TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS WHO LIVE  IN L.A.  BLACK KIDS, HISPANIC KIDS,  ANYONE, THAT'S NOT COMMON OUT  HERE.  ESPECIALLY FOR A CELEBRITY.  SO SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT BIG OF,  JUST EVERYTHING UPON HIM.  YOU CAN'T PUT ONE THING ON THIS  MAN, AND HE DID EVERYTHING IN  HIS POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT  THOSE BASKETBALL PLAYERS KNEW  THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE.  AND A LOT OF THEM DID GO AND  GET SCHOLARSHIPS FOR  BASKETBALL.  A LOT OF THEM ARE VERY  SUCCESSFUL NOW.  I'M PRETTY SURE THEY CAN SAY  THE SAME THING.  LIKE MEETING HIM THOSE FOUR  YEARS CHANGED THEIR LIVES.  IT CHANGED MY LIFE, AND I JUST  GOT TO WORK WITH THE MAN.  IMAGINE PLAYING WITH HIM.  >> YOU MENTIONED YOUNG PEOPLE  OF COLOR IN WESTCHESTER.  FOR THOSE OF US FAMILIAR, THIS  IS A WORKING NEIGHBORHOOD,  RIGHT, AND TO SEE SOMEONE LIKE  KOBE WHO WAS FLUENT IN ITALIAN.  FLUENT IN SPANISH.  TALK TO ME ABOUT THE IMPACT  THAT THAT HAD ON YOUNG PEOPLE  OF COLOR.  >> YEAH, I'VE NEVER BEEN TO  ITALY, BUT GROWING UP IN L.A.,  YOU HAVE FRIENDS OF ALL  DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES.  WE ALL KNOW EVERY ETHNICITY HAS  DIFFERENT CULTURES, AND THIS  MANMADE ALL THE CULTURES HE  LEARNED INTO ONE COHESIVE  THING, AND TAUGHT EVERYBODY  THAT.  HIS TEMPERAMENT.  ME BEING AN ATHLETE MYSELF, IF  YOU GET ON THE COURT,  EVERYONE'S AN ENEMY, BUT OFF  THAT COURT HE WAS A GENTLEMAN.  HE DID THINGS FOR PEOPLE THAT  YOU WOULDN'T EVEN EXPECT A  CELEBRITY TO DO HE PUT HIS HAND  OUT TO SHAKE PEOPLE'S HANDS,  AND SOME CELEBRITIES JUST  WALKED PAST.  THIS MAN PLAYED WITH A TORN  ACHILLES.  THERE'S THING THIS MAN HAS  DONE, NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF, FOR  HIS TEAM, FOR HIS FAMILY, FOR  EVERYONE IN L.A.  THAT WILL FOREVER BE  REMEMBERED.  AND THE DIFFERENT CULTURES THAT  HE LEARNED DEFINITELY MADE HIM  A BETTER PERSON, BECAUSE OF THE  TEMPERAMENT HE HAD.  JUST THE WAY HE CARRIED  HIMSELF.  TO SAY THE CULTURES HE HAD  DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH  THAT, TO BE EMBRACED THAT WOULD  BE INSANE.  >> IF YOU WERE SOMEONE FROM A  WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD, THE  IDEA OF HAVING TO GRIND IT OUT,  DAY IN AND DAY OUT WITHOUT A  MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT,  THAT'S A TEMPERAMENT.  >> I REMEMBER BEING 17, MY  SENIOR YEAR, HAVING SURGERY ON  MY STOMACH AND THEY TOLD ME I  COULDN'T PLAY.  I THOUGHT IF KOBE PLAYED WITH A  TONE ACHILLES, I CAN PLAY WITH  TEN STITCHES IN MY STOMACH.  EVERYONE WHO GOT HURT, WHO WAS  AN ATHLETE, THEY'RE LIKE, IF  KOBE CAN DO IT, I CAN DO IT.  KOBE HAD AN IMPACT, IF YOU'RE A  FEMALE, A MALE, NO MATTER WHAT  YOU DID IN LIFE, YOU SAID KOBE.  YOU WOULD SHOOT A PAPER BALL  INSIDE OF A TRASH CAN  SO KOBE IS SYNONYMOUS TO L.A.  YOU CAN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN  KOBE.  SO THE FACT THAT HE'S GONE,  GIGI'S GONE, HER TEAMMATE, THAT  TEAMMATE'S PARENT.  IT'S SAD.  THAT PILOT, IT'S REALLY SAD.  ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS TO  WHERE YOU WOULD NEVER THINK  THAT SOMEONE LIKE KOBE,  ESPECIALLY HIS 13-YEAR-OLD  DAUGHTER, WOULD BE TAKEN LIKE  THAT.  ESPECIALLY ON SOMETHING THAT HE  DOES ON A DAILY BASIS.  I'VE PASSED THAT HELICOPTER PAD  BEFORE.  IT'S A LITTLE SHAKEN, YOU KNOW?  TEARS HAVE BEEN FALLEN.  TODAY'S GOING TO BE A HARD DAY  FOR EVERYONE IN L.A.  FOR SURE.  >> I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE TO  KEENAN, HE'S BEEN SO POLITE.  YOU LED THE FOLKS OVER HERE IN  A CHANT.  YOU'RE SMILING ABOUT IT.  SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT  THAT CHANT?  A LOT OF PEOPLE GAVE YOU A LOT  OF PROPS FOR IT WHEN THEY  PASSED BY EARLIER.  CAN YOU KIND OF REPLICATE THAT  FOR ME?  >> I WAS SAYING, IF KOBE AND  HIS DAUGHTER WERE BEING  INTRODUCED INTO HEAVEN, WHOEVER  YOU BELIEVE, GOD, ALLAH,  BUDDHA, WHOEVER, IT WOULD GO A  LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE  INTRODUCING THE 6'6\" SHOOTING  GUARD FROM LOWER MERIAN HIGH  SCHOOL, TWO TIME MVP, HOLDS THE  SECOND MOST POINTS IN A GAME AT  81, FIRST TIME UNANIMOUS BALLOT  FOR THE HALL OF FAME,  INTRODUCING, GOD YOU GOT A GOOD  ONE, KOBE BEAN BRYANT!  SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  THEY LOVED IT.  AND IT MADE ME FEEL BETTER.  I'VE BEEN DOWN.  SHE WOULD TELL YOU TOO, I'M A  SHOE CONNOISSEUR SOMETIME.  SO I CAME AND BROUGHT MY MOM  OUT.  SIGNED THEM.  IT'S GOING TO BE A HARD DAY.  AS WE WERE SAYING TOO, KOBE DID  PUT A TEMPLATE OUT, JUST TO SAY  SOMEBODY ON KOBE'S SYSTEM,  PLAYING HEART.  THE LANGUAGE HE USED THAT ON  THE COURT.  HE LEARNED FRENCH TO TALK MESS  TO TONY PARKER.  TALKING TO LUKA ON THE SIDELINE  LAST WEEK.  NOW WE'RE SITTING AT HERE  LOOKING AT HIM FROM THIS SIDE  OF THINGS, AND THE DAUGHTER,  AND UNFORTUNATELY THE PEOPLE  WHO WERE ON THE HELICOPTER.  I'M JUST GLAD, OF COURSE MY  CHILDREN WHEN I DO HAVE THEM,  ONE DAY, I'M HAPPY AND BLESSED  TO SAY I LIVED IN THE SAME  WORLD AS KOBE BRYANT.  >> YOU WERE SAYING, HIS LEGACY  WASN'T JUST BASKETBALL.  THE MAN WON AN OSCAR.  HE'S BEHIND A MILLION DOLLAR  INVESTMENT FUND.  TO SEE SOMEONE PUT FORTH HIS  MONEY TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS  AND TELL STORIES THAT ARE  OTHERWISE NOT TOLD, YOUR  REACTION TO THAT.  >> IT IS VERY NECESSARY, AND IS  STILL NECESSARY.  YOU COME ACROSS ATHLETES, AND  MOST OF TIME YOU'RE DONE.  SOME COACH, SOME DO TRAINING ON  THE SIDE.  KOBE WROTE BOOKS, KOBE  DIRECTED, KOBE COACH.  THAT'S THE MEANING OF THAT,  KOBE SAYS SOMETHING, YOU DON'T  PUT A CEILING ON YOURSELF.  YOU BE AN ANIMAL OF A DIFFERENT  BEAST, AND I MIGHT GET THAT  TATTOOED ON ME.  WE'LL SEE.  >> Reporter: TAYLOR, LET ME  TURN THE CAMERA BACK TO YOU ONE  MORE TIME.  YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SORT  OF DAD HE WAS, A LOT OF PEOPLE  TALK ABOUT NOT HAVING A SON TO  CARRY ON HIS LEGACY.  YOU'RE SMILING.  TELL ME WHY YOU'RE SMILING.  >> FOR ONE, I'M THE MIDDLE  CHILDOF THREE GIRLS AND TWO  STEPSISTERS.  MY DAD IS ONE OF THOSE DADS,  WHO DIDN'T HAVE A SON TO  CONTINUE HIS LEGACY.  JUST LIKE KOBE WAS SAYING, MY  DAD WOULD SAY, IT DOESN'T  MATTER.  GIGI PLAYED BASKETBALL JUST  LIKE HE DID, AND WAS AN AMAZING  PLAYER.  HE HAS THREE OTHER DAUGHTERS  WHO ARE AMAZING.  AND HE HAS FOUR BEAUTIFUL  HEALTHY GIRLS AND THAT'S ALL I  CARE ABOUT.  IF THEY WANT TO PLAY  BASKETBALL, COOL.  IF NOT, THAT'S FINE.  AS LONG AS THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL,  AND HAVE PASSION WITH WHATEVER  THEY WANT TO DO, THAT'S EVERY  DAD'S DREAM.  JUST THINKING ABOUT MY DAD.  IF I DON'T FOLLOW IN HIS  FOOTSTEPS, HE WON'T BE  COMPLETELY UPSET.  IT'S VERY SAD AND HEART TURNING  TO KNOW THOSE THREE GIRLS HAVE  TO NOW GROW UP, AND THINK MY  DAD WOULD LOVE FOR ME TO DO  THIS.  I KNOW THOSE GIRLS ARE GOING TO  BLEED KOBE FOR THE REST OF  THEIR LIFE.  THAT'S ALL THEY KNEW, AND NOT  HAVING A SON IS NOT THE BIGGEST  DOWNFALL.  >> Reporter: YOU WERE BOTH SO  GRACIOUS.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THOSE  STORIES.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  BEFORE WE HAND IT BACK TO YOU,  I'M GOING TO STEP OUT OF THE  WAY, SO YOU CAN GET ONE MORE  LOOK AT THE GROWING MEMORIAL  HERE.  >> ONE OF THE MANY MEMORIALS  ACROSS THE SOUTHLAND.  THIS IS AT THE L.A.  LAKERS PRACTICE FACILITY.  THAT IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE  GATHERING.  THEY'RE ALSO GATHERING, OF  COURSE AT THE STAPLES CENTER.  THAT'S HOME OF THE LAKERS, AS  WELL AS THE CRASH SITE IN  CALABASAS, ALSO IN THOUSAND  OAKS AT THE MAMBA CENTER.  >> THAT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE  INTERVIEWS OF THE DAY, I THINK.  THAT WAS JUMP SO TOUCHING.  A BIG FAN OF KOBE BRYANT.  JAKE, I KNOW YOU GREW UP HERE  TOO, AND THIS IS HITTING YOU  HARD PERSONALLY.  YOU'RE STANDING IN THOUSAND  OAKS AT THE MAMBA SPORTS  ACADEMY.  THE TRAINING ACADEMY  ESTABLISHED BY KOBE BRYANT.  YOU'RE STANDING WITH A FAN NOW.  TELL ME WHO YOU'RE WITH.  >> Reporter: HEY THERE, SARAH,  YEAH, IT'S BEEN A REALLY TOUGH  DAY FOR EVERYBODY HERE, THAT  HAS BEEN GROWING UP A LAKERS  FAN, OBVIOUSLY, HERE IN  THOUSAND OAKS WE'RE AT THE  MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY, WHICH WAS  THE KOBE BRYANT WAY OF GIVING  BACK TO THE COMMUNITY.  I'M JOINED BY LAKER FAN, JOSH  ALBERT.  TELL US WHY YOU DECIDED TO COME  OUT, I SAW YOU STARING AT THE  GROWING MEMORIAL.  YOU'VE GOTTEN VERY EMOTIONAL.  >> YEAH, SO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,  THIS MORNING STARTED OUT AS A  REGULAR DAY.  ALL OF A SUDDEN, ONE OF MY  NEIGHBORS FROM THE CALABASAS  AREA POSTED THAT KOBE BRYANT  WAS DEAD.  I JUST HAD LIKE A PANIC ATTACK,  AND I BROKE DOWN.  I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE FAKE NEWS  FOR A MOMENT.  I COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT IT  WOULD BE TRUE.  AND THEN I WENT CRAZY LOOKING  FOR SOME CREDIBLE NEWS SOURCES,  AND FOUND OUT IT WAS TRUE.  AND JUST SAT IN MY CHAIR ALL  DAY, WATCHING, YOU KNOW,  DIFFERENT NEWS CLIPS OF  WHATEVER WAS GOING ON.  AND I'M JUST SITTING THERE,  LIKE MOURNING ALMOST LIKE A  FAMILY MEMBER.  I HAVEN'T FELT THIS WAY SINCE  MY FATHER DIED MAYBE 10 OR 11  YEARS AGO, AND I KIND OF FEEL  CRUSHED BY IT.  KOBE WAS, NOT ONLY WAS HE A  SUPERB ATHLETE, HE WAS AN ICON.  NOT ONLY A LOS ANGELES ICON, HE  WAS A WORLDWIDE ICON.  THIS ONE JUST HIT EXTRA HARD.  THERE'S CELEBRITIES AND  ATHLETES THAT DIE ALL THE TIME,  BUT THIS ONE REALLY GOT TO ME.  I FELT LIKE I HAD TO COME HERE,  BEING THAT IT'S REASONABLE  DISTANCE, AND PAYING MY  RESPECTS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.  >> WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING HERE  WITH ALL OF THESE LAKERS FANS,  MOURNING TOGETHER?  >> IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN BEING  AT A FUNERAL.  IT'S VERY SOMBER, AND IT'S  TERRIBLE.  I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO  DESCRIBE IT.  IT LITERALLY FEELS NO DIFFERENT  THAN BEING AT A CEMETERY RIGHT  NOW.  IT'S PRETTY BAD.  >> Reporter: SOME FANS HAVE  BEEN SHARING THEIR KOBE  MEMORIES.  EVERYONE HAS A STORY, WHETHER  YOU MET HIM, OR YOU WERE AT A  PIVOTAL GAME.  DO YOU HAVE ANY MEMORIES OR  THOUGHTS THAT YOU CAN SHARE  WITH US?  >> SO I MOVED OUT HERE FOUR  YEARS AGO.  GREW UP IN NEW YORK, AND I WAS  ALWAYS A KOBE BRYANT FAN FROM  ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  EVEN BEFORE I CLAIMED TO BE A  LAKERS FAN.  I WOULD ALWAYS CATCH HIM AT  MADISON SQUARE GARDEN WHENEVER  POSSIBLE.  I CAUGHT THE END OF HIS CAREER  OUT HERE WHEN I MOVED HERE A  FEW YEARS AGO.  I THINK MY BEST MEMORY  SURROUNDED BY KOBE WAS THE DAY  OF HIS LAST GAME.  I HAD FULL INTENTIONS OF GOING  TO THAT GAME, AND I FORGOT THAT  I BOOKED A BUSINESS TRIP TO NEW  YORK.  AND I WAS SO ANGRY, BECAUSE I  REALLY WANTED TO BE THERE.  BECAUSE I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO  BE SPECIAL.  AND YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T WATCH  THESE THINGS LIVE ON THE PLANE,  BUT SOMEHOW MY FLIGHT GOT  CANCELED, AND THEY HAD DIRECTV,  AND I GOT TO WATCH THE WHOLE  GAME GOING HOME.  IT WAS SUCH A HAPPY MOMENT.  THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THEM.  THAT ONE STICKS OUT IN MY MIND  THE MOST.  THAT EXPERIENCE AND THE FACT  THAT HE HAD SUCH AN  EXTRAORDINARY OUTRO FOR HIS  CAREER.  >> Reporter: WE'RE HERE AT THE  MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY, HE,  ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE  HERE, WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE  TODAY TO COACH HIS DAUGHTER IN  A BASKETBALL GAME AS A PART OF  THE MAMBA CUP TOURNAMENT SERIES  HERE, AND IT JUST ADDS TO THE  WHOLE DAY, JUST BEING JUST A  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.  BUT IT ALSO SHOWS THAT HE WAS  ALWAYS WILLING TO GIVE BACK TO  THE COMMUNITY, AND I THINK THAT  THAT'S KIND OF WHAT'S DEFINING  HIM TODAY.  >> YOU'RE RIGHT.  HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE WAS  HERE YESTERDAY.  THEY HAVE THIS BIG TOURNAMENT  GOING ON.  I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE LAST  NIGHT.  I DECIDED AT THE LAST MINUTE  NOT TO GO.  I DO KNOW FROM PEOPLE PLAYING  IN TOURNAMENTS TODAY, BETWEEN  HERE AND OAKS CHRISTIAN,  EVERYTHING GOT CANCELED.  HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE WITH  HIS DAUGHTER TO CONTINUE  PLAYING.  SO YEAH, IT'S VERY  HEARTBREAKING.  I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO  COMPARE THIS TO, LIKE BESIDES  WHEN A CLOSE FAMILY COULD DIE.  I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY I FELT  HE WAS A CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER,  BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE IMPACT  ON SOMEONE THAT BRINGS SO MUCH  JOY TO YOUR LIFE AFTER 20 YEARS  HAS ON PEOPLE.  >> Reporter: RIGHT, AND HE  SPENT EVERY YEAR WITH THE  LAKERS.  ALL 20 YEARS HE SPENT HERE IN  LOS ANGELES.  THAT MEANS SOMETHING.  YOU DON'T SEE THAT EVERY DAY  FROM PLAYERS.  >> NO, NOT AT ALL.  IT'S A VERY RARE THING FOR  PLAYERS TO HAVE LONGEVITY WITH  ANY TEAM.  A LOT OF PLAYERS GO HOPPING  AROUND FOR MORE MONEY, OR TO  WIN RINGS.  HE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH ON DRAFT  DAY TO GET TRADED TO L.A.  HE WENT ON TO WIN HIS FIVE  CHAMPIONSHIPS, AND HE DID IT  ALL HERE.  THAT'S VERY SPECIAL.  SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE OFTEN  ANYMORE.  >> JOSH, APPRECIATE YOUR  THOUGHTS AND YOUR EMOTIONS HERE  AS WELL AT THE MAMBA SPORTS  ACADEMY.  IF I CAN JUST STEP OUT OF THE  WAY JUST TO SHOW YOU GUYS KIND  OF THE CROWD THAT'S BEEN  GATHERED HERE ALL AFTERNOON,  PEOPLE COMING BY, AND DROPPING  OFF MEMENTOS, PICTURES,  JERSEYS, FLOWERS, YOU NAME IT.  PEOPLE SHARING THEIR STORIES  ABOUT WHAT THIS GUY MEANT NOT  ONLY TO LOS ANGELES, BUT TO THE  WORLD.  HE DEFINED THAT MAMBA MENTALITY  OF NEVER GIVE UP.  YOU ALWAYS HAVE A SHOT TO WIN A  GAME.  AS A FAN, WATCHING, TO HAVE A  PLAYER ON YOUR TEAM KNOWING  THAT AT ANY POINT, NO MATTER  WHAT THE DEFICIT WAS, YOU  ALWAYS HAD A CHANCE TO COME  BACK AND WIN, THIS WAS SUCH A  THRILL TO WATCH FROM A FAN  STANDPOINT, AND BEING OUT HERE  TODAY, IS ALSO SPECIAL TO BE  AMONGST EVERYBODY HERE, PAYING  THEIR RESPECTS TO KOBE BRYANT.  WE'LL SEND IT BACK TO YOU GUYS  IN THE STUDIO.  >> THE GENTLEMAN SAYS IT'S WHAT  MOST PEOPLE ARE FEELING, IT'S  LIKE A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY  PASSED AWAY.  I HAVE MEMBERS IN CHICAGO,  HOUSTON, DETROIT, AND ALL OF  THOSE PEOPLE TEXTED ME TODAY TO  TALK ABOUT KOBE BRYANT.  CAN JUST SHOWS THE GLOBAL  APPEAL, AND IT REALLY IS TRULY  LIKE SOMEONE HAS LOST A MEMBER  OF THE FAMILY.  ESPECIALLY HERE.  >> I JUST FEEL LIKE FOR SO MANY  YEARS IN L.A., THAT KOBE'S  MILESTONES WERE ALMOST ALL OF  OUR MILESTONES, THAT THEY  PUNCTUATED SO MANY IMPORTANT  MOMENTS IN ALL OF OUR LIVES.  JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, I  REMEMBER GOING ON YOUTUBE, AND  WATCHING KOBE BRYANT'S 81 POINT  GAME IN 2006.  EVERY POINT THAT HE SCORED, AND  IT WAS JUST, I FEEL FORTUNATE  NOW TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WATCH  HIM PLAY IN PERSON AT STAPLES  CENTER.  SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE  OPPORTUNITY TO SEE KOBE PLAY  OVER THE YEARS, FEEL THAT VERY  SAME WAY, THAT IT WAS A  PRIVILEGE TO WATCH HIM PLAY  THAT GAME, THE WAY VERY FEW  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO  BEFORE, OR SINCE.  >> I WAS HERE IN 2016 WITH THAT  LAST GAME.  THAT SEASON WAS NOT A GOOD  SEASON FOR THE LAKERS, BUT THAT  LAST GAME OF KOBE BRYANT, HE  ROSE TO THE OCCASION.  IT JUST WAS AMAZING HOW YOU SAW  HIM PUT IN THE WHOLE CAREER,  THE WHOLE LIFE EFFORT INTO THAT  LAST GAME.  >> IT WAS SUCH AN APPROPRIATE  WAY TO END HIS CAREER.  THAT GAME WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR  SO MANY REASONS, YOU KNOW, FOR  SO MANY PEOPLE, AND IT WAS SO  IMPORTANT FOR LAKERS FANS TO  SEE HIM END THAT WAY, AND IT  WAS JUST SO FITTING FOR THE WAY  HE PLAYED THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE  CAREER.  JAKE BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT.  I REMEMBER WATCHING GAMES HE'D  PLAY, EVEN IN GAMES WHERE THE  LAKERS WERE STRUGGLING.  IF KOBE WAS ON THE COURT, YOU  KNEW THERE WAS A CHANCE.  TRULY, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, A  PERSON WHO'S IMPACTED THE L.A.  AREA IN A LOT OF WAYS BEYOND  THE SPORT OF BASKETBALL.  >> THE PLAY-BY-PLAY RADIO  ANNOUNCER SAID IT JUST GOT TO  THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD PUT  THE TEAM ON HIS BACK.  THEY WOULD USE THE NAME KOBE AS  A VERB.  IF THEY WOULD JUST GET TO THE  FOURTH QUARTER, THEN THEY WOULD  JUST KOBE IT INTO THE VICTORY  COLUMN.  WE TALKED TO SO MANY PEOPLE  LIVE ON KCAL9, JERRY WEST, AND  JIM HILL SAID HE'S LARGELY TO  BE CREDITED FOR DISCOVERING  KOBE.  FORMER LAKERS PLAYER, GM OF THE  LAKERS, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST  HORRIBLE DAYS OF MY LIFE, JUST  LIKE I LOST A SON.  LIKE THAT FAN SAID HE LOST A  FAMILY MEMBER.  >> JEFF NGUYEN IS AT THE LAKERS  PRACTICE  FACILITY AT THOUSAND  OAKS.  I HAVE TO SAY, YOU'VE HAD A  COUPLE OF MY FAVORITE  INTERVIEWS OF THE DAY, ABOUT  HOW HE TAUGHT THEM TO PLAY  THROUGH ADVERSITY, AND PLAY  THROUGH INJURY.  WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY WAS WHAT A  LOT OF PEOPLE GOT OUT OF HOW  KOBE BRYANT WAS SO INSPIRING AS  A PLAYER.  >> Reporter: YEAH, I THINK  THAT'S THE RUNNING THEME HERE,  IS THAT WORK ETHIC, THAT MAMBA  MENTALITY, THAT SO MANY OF US  REMEMBER, AND SO MANY OF US  SPEAK ABOUT.  RIGHT NOW, I'M BEING JOINED BY  RICK MERCIA, WHO GREW UP IN  INGLEWOOD, WHICH IS IN THE  SHADOWS OF THE FORUM, WHERE  KOBE PLAYED INITIALLY FOR DEL  HARRIS, BEFORE THE TEAM MOVED  TO STAPLES, AND WERE LED BY  PHIL JACKSON.  SO FOR YOU, YOU KNOW, WHEN KOBE  WAS 17, AND WHEN HE WAS 19,  WHEN HE WON THAT FIRST  CHAMPIONSHIP.  YOU WERE A YOUNG MAN.  TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME OF THE  MEMORIES THAT KOBE BROUGHT INTO  YOUR FAMILY, BECAUSE YOUR MOM  AND YOUR WIFE, AND YOUR SISTER  ARE HERE WITH YOU.  >> I SAW HIS FIRST GAME AT THE  LONG BEACH PYRAMID WITH D FISH.  GREAT MEMORIES.  I SAW HIM PLAY AT THE FORUM.  I SAW HIM MOVE TO STAPLES.  I SAW HIM WIN HIS FIRST  CHAMPIONSHIP.  I SAW HIM LOSE HIS FIRST  CHAMPIONSHIP.  I HAVE SO MANY GREAT MEMORIES  OF HIM.  HE'S LIKE FAMILY TO ME.  ME AND MY WIFE HAD OUR  ENGAGEMENT PHOTOS AT STAPLES  CENTER BECAUSE OF HIM.  I'M GOING TO NAME MY FIRST  CHILD AFTER HIM, AND EVERYBODY  TOLD I WAS CRAZY.  IT WAS A BLOW TODAY.  I FEEL SO BAD FOR VANESSA AND  THE KIDS, AND GIGI.  I'M TRYING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER,  BUT I'M REALLY TRYING TO  REMEMBER SOME OF THE GOOD RIGHT  NOW, BUT IT'S JUST TOUGH.  I CAN REMEMBER MY FIRST LAKER  GAME THAT MY WIFE TOOK ME TO  FOR MY BIRTHDAY, KOBE SHOOK ONE  PERSON'S HAND, IT WAS MY HAND  BY LUCK, AND SHE WAS MORE  EXCITED ABOUT IT THAN I WAS.  AND MEMORIES LIKE THAT WILL  ALWAYS STICK WITH ME.  I MEAN, HE'S AN AMAZING HUMAN  BEING.  I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE LIKE HIM,  TALK LIKE HIM.  MOVE MY MOUTH LIKE HIM.  HE WAS A SPITTING IMAGE OF  MICHAEL JORDAN SOMETIMES, AND  YOU KNOW HE WAS PROBABLY THE  GREATEST PLAYER I EVER GOT TO  SEE LIVE.  >> FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE  GEN  XERES AND THE LIKE, HIS COMING  OF ANYONE WAS OUR COMING OF  AGE.  YOU'RE SMILING.  TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT THAT WAS  LIKE FOR YOU AS A YOUNG PERSON.  THE CITY GETTING THAT FIRST  CHAMPIONSHIP AGAIN AFTER THE  ERAS OF MAGIC AND KAREEM.  >> IT WAS WONDERFUL.  I REMEMBER IT.  WE HAD BARBEQUE.  WE SAW THEM WIN THEIR FIRST  CHAMPIONSHIP.  EVERYBODY WAS POPPING  CHAMPAGNE.  I REMEMBER BEING ONE OF ONE  MILLION THAT SHOWED UP TO THAT  PARADE, SEEING KOBE, AND  VANESSA ON THE TRUCK.  IT WAS WONDERFUL.  IT WAS A WONDERFUL THING TO  SEE, AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.  >> GROWING UP IN INGLEWOOD, WAS  IT EVEN AN OPTION TO LIKE  ANOTHER TEAM?  >> MY DAD IS A MAGIC GUY.  WE GREW UP IN A LAKER  HOUSEHOLD.  THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE BUT TO  BE A LAKER FAN.  THAT'S THE TRUTH.  >> DO YOU WANT TO JOIN US, MOM?  NO?  SISTER?  NO?  WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO COME DOWN,  AS WE'RE SHOWING THEM?  >> MY MOM, MY SISTER.  LET'S STOP BEING HERE, LET'S GO  PAY OUR RESPECTS.  I TOLD THEM LET'S GO.  WE WENT TO THE FORUM.  AFTER WE WENT TO THE FORUM, WE  DECIDED TO COME DOWN HERE.  WE JUST WANTED TO LAY SOME  FLOWERS, AND SAY SOME GOOD  THINGS ABOUT HIM, AND SEND OUT  OUR PRAYERS TO HIS FAMILY AND  THE REST OF THE FAMILIES THAT  WERE AFFECTED BY THIS.  >> Reporter: RICK THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR GIVING ME YOUR TIME.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  AND FROM THE LAKERRER TRAINING  FACILITY HERE IN EL SEGUNDO,  WE'LL SEND IT BACK TO YOU.  >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, LIVE FROM  THE LAKER TRAINING FACILITY.  SERVING AS JUST ONE OF THOSE  PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE  GATHERING THROUGHOUT THE  SOUTHLAND.  WE KNOW IT'S THERE.  WE KNOW IT'S IN THOUSAND OAKS  AT THE MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY.  WE KNOW IT'S AT THE CRASH SITE  IN CALABASASS AS WELL AS HIS  HOME, AS WELL AS THE STAPLES  CENTER.  >> CONSIDERING THE GRAMMYS ARE  DOWN THERE AS WELL.  LAPD BY THE WAY, KEEPING AN EYE  ON THAT.  THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE  STAYS SAFE.  OBVIOUSLY, THEY WERE PLANNING  FOR THE GRAMMYS.  THAT'S A HIGH LEVEL OF SECURITY  OVER THERE.  NOW THEY HAVE THIS LARGE  GATHERING OF PEOPLE TO CONTEND  WITH.  I'M SURE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE  EVERYTHING STAYS CALM IN THE  DOWNTOWN AREA.  THEY WERE INITIALLY ASKING  PEOPLE NOT TO SHOW UP.  >> IT APPEARS THEY'RE EMBRACING  IT.  WHICH IS A GOOD THING, BECAUSE  L.A.  LIVE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE  STAPLES CENTER, THEY PUT A  BILLBOARD UP IN REMEMBRANCE  OFHIM.  I THINK THERE'S A GOOD  OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO COME  DOWN THERE.  AS SOMEBODY SAID, THIS IS THE  HOUSE OF KOBE, THIS IS HIS  HOME.  STAPLES CENTER.  MAGIC JOHNSON, DOC RIVERS, AND  JERRY WEST AS WELL.  LET'S HEAR FROM JERRY NOW.  >> TO HEAR THIS NEWS THIS  MORNING, FRANKLY, AT FIRST I  WAS SHOCKED.  AND THEN AFTER A WHILE, IT  REALLY SUNK IN.  AND YOU KNOW, TO SEE THE  TRANSFORMATION OF HIM FROM A 17- YEAR-OLD KID WHO USED TO SPEND  TIME AT MY HOUSE WITH ME, TO MY  SON RYAN DRIVING HIM AROUND,  BECAUSE HE COULDN'T EVEN DRIVE,  HE COULDN'T EVEN SIGN A  CONTRACT, BECAUSE HE WAS TOO  YOUNG.  TO HIM, THE CONSTANT QUESTIONS  ABOUT THE NBA.  WANTING ME TO GO TO A GYM WITH  HIM TO WATCH HIM WORK OUT, AND  MAYBE MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO HIM.  IT WAS MORE THAN, I REALLY FELT  LIKE A SURROGATE FATHER TO HIM.  AND THEN AS HIS CAREER  BLOSSOMED, AND YOU KNOW HE  STARTED TO ESTABLISH THIS  ENORMOUS REPUTATION AS A  PLAYERER, AND ALSO FILLED WITH  ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BUT HIS   CHARISMA ON TOP OF IT, WAS  SOMETHING MOST GREAT PLAYERS  DON'T HAVE, AND HE HAD IT.  BUT TO WAKE UP TO THIS NEWS,  THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST  HORRIBLE DAYS OF OUR LIFE.  I FELT LIKE I'VE LOST A SON,  AND FRANKLY I'M NOT DOING VERY  WELL.  >> I THINK SOME OF THE MOST  EMOTIONAL SOUND THAT WE'VE  HEARD AND INTERVIEWS THAT WE'VE  GOTTEN HAVE BEEN FROM NBA  EXECUTIVES, FORMER NBA PLAYERS.  CURRENT PLAYERS OUT THERE  PLAYING GAMES RIGHT NOW.  THERE ARE GAMES ONGOING AS WE  SPEAK.  IT'S JUST BEEN SO HARD TO SEE  THEIR REACTION TO THIS, AND  SOME OF THEM FINDING OUT ON THE  COURT, IT LOOKED LIKE FROM SOME  VIDEO FROM EARLIER.  SO THIS IS JUST A REALLY HARD  DAY.  OBVIOUSLY, JERRY WEST,  INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL, AND SOME  OTHER FORMER PLAYERS ARE  POSTING ONLINE AS WELL.  >> HE SAID KOBE HAS A DESIRE TO  SUCCEED.  AN INSPIRATION FOR ALL.  HE WAS AN INSPIRATION FOR  EVERYBODY.  NOT JUST PEOPLE INTO ATHLETICS.  WE HAD A SOUND BITE, I THINK IT  WAS FROM JOHN IRELAND.  HE SAID IT DIDN'T MATTER IF YOU  WERE A POLICE OFFICER, OR A  PLUMBER, OR A DOCTOR, YOU FOUND  INSPIRATION FROM KOBE BRYANT.  >> ONE OF THE FORMER PLAYERS,  NBA LEGENDS THAT POSTED ABOUT  THIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH THE  VIDEO RESPONSE OF FAIRLY  QUICKLY AFTER THIS NEWS SPREAD  WAS KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR.  HE POSTED TO THE NEWS OF THE  DEATH OF KOBE BRYANT.  >> IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME  TO PUT INTO WORDS HOW I FEEL  ABOUT THE LOSS OF KOBE BRYANT.  AS A YOUNG BOY, I MET HIM WHEN  HE WAS 11 OR 12 YEARS OLD.  I WAS FRIENDS WITH HIS DAD,  JOE.  WE WERE FORMER ADVERSARIES.  JOE PLAYED FOR THE 76ERS, BUT  HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND, AND  SOMEONE THAT I SHARED A  FRIENDSHIP.  AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO  UNDERSTAND NOW HOW THIS IS  EFFECTING JOE AND HIS WIFE.  SO TO KOBE'S FAMILY, I WANT TO  SEND MY MOST SINCERE AND  HEARTFELT THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.  KOBE WAS AN INCREDIBLE FAMILY  MAN.  HE LOVED HIS WIFE AND  DAUGHTERS.  HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE ATHLETE,  AND A LEADER.  HE INSPIRED A WHOLE GENERATION  OF ATHLETES.  HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO  LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL AND GO TO THE  NBA.  DOMINATING THE GAME, AND BECOME  ONE OF THE BEST SCORERS THE LOS  ANGELES LAKERS HAVE EVER SEEN.  I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING  THERE WHEN HE SCORED HIS 81  POINT GAME.  IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WILL  ALWAYS REMEMBER AS ONE OF THE  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE THINGS THAT I  HAVE LEARNED AND OBSERVED IN  SPORTS.  KOBE, MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU.  ABSOLUTELY.  REST IN PEACE, YOUNG MAN.  THIS LOSS IS, IT'S JUST HARD TO  COMPREHEND.  GO WITH GOD.  >> ANOTHER LAKER GREAT, KAREEM  ABDUL-JABBAR TALKING ABOUT  LAKER GREAT, KOBE BRYANT.  >> WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING  TRIBUTES ALL THROUGHOUT THE  EVENING.  ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WHO REALLY  STANDS OUT IN PARTICULAR  BECAUSE OF HIS GREATNESS IN  COACHING THESE BASKETBALL  PLAYERS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,  HIM BEING A FATHER ALSO, HE WAS  SO EMOTIONAL TODAY.  REALLY OUR HEARTS FEEL BAD AT  THE SAME TIME FOR CLIPPERS  COACH DOC RIVERS, AND WE DO  HAVE SOME SOUND FROM HIM THAT  WE WANT TO PLAY RIGHT NOW.  >> LISTEN -   YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.  YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T HAVE A  LOT TO SAY.  THE NEWS IS JUST DEVASTATING TO  EVERYBODY WHO KNEW HIM.  I KNEW HIM A LONG TIME AND, YOU  KNOW, HE JUST HE MEANS A LOT TO  ME OBVIOUSLY.  YOU KNOW HE WAS SUCH A GREAT  OPPONENT, YOU KNOW?  IT'S WHAT YOU WANT IN SPORTS.  HE HAD THAT DNA THAT VERY FEW  ATHLETES CAN EVER HAVE, THAT  TIGER WOODS AND THE MICHAEL  JORDANS, YOU KNOW.  IT'S FUNNY, I WAS GETTING TO  KNOW HIM MORE SINCE HE RETIRED,  YOU KNOW.  YEAH, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.  I DON'T -- WE HAVE TO GO PLAY.  AND THE NEWS JUST IS  DEVASTATING FOR VANESSA AND HIS  FAMILY AND, IT'S JUST SO MANY  PEOPLE HE TOUCHED, YOU KNOW.  AND YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT MY  YOUNG PLAYERS AND SEEING HOW  EMOTIONAL THEY ARE.  THEY KNOW HIM, YOU KNOW AND IT  JUST TELLS YOU HOW FAR HIS  REACH WAS.  THIS IS JUST SHOCKING NEWS FOR  ALL OF US.  I'M SORRY, I DON'T HAVE A LOT  TO SAY.  I JUST CAN'T, I HAVE TO GO TALK  TO A TEAM BEFORE A GAME AND  TELL THEM TO PLAY A GAME.  >> WHAT WAS YOUR LAST  INTERACTION WITH KOBE LIKE?  >> IT WAS GREAT.  WE WERE AT A FUNCTION ABOUT  THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO, AND WE  SAT AND TALKED FOR PROBABLY 45  MINUTES.  WE ALWAYS LIKED TO REMINISCE.  WE WOULD ALWAYS LAUGH AT OUR  VERSIONS OF OUR LOSSES, YOU  KNOW WHEN WE BEAT THEM IN 2008  HE HAD HIS VERSION AND WHEN  THEY BEAT US IN 2010, I HAD MY  VERSION.  AND WE WOULD LAUGH AT HOW  DIFFERENT WE LOOKED AT THE  GAMES.  THIS IS A GREAT LOSS FOR THE  LEAGUE AND I THOUGHT HE HAD SO  MUCH MORE LEFT TO DO, YOU KNOW?  AND HE WAS STARTING TO DO IT.  NEVER SEEN HIM HAPPIER, YOU  KNOW.  SO I DON'T KNOW.  >> DO YOU FEEL BLESSED?  >> YEAH, I'M LUCKY.  I WAS LUCKY THAT I, YOU KNOW  GOT TO COACH AND COMPETE, YOU  KNOW, AGAINST HIM.  AND YOU KNOW I FEEL FOR SO MANY  PEOPLE.  OBVIOUSLY HIS FAMILY.  I CAN'T IMAGINE.  TY LU PLAYED WITH HIM.  KAUAI WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HIM,  AND SO WAS PAUL GEORGE.  HE MEANT A LOT OF GOOD FOR OUR  LEAGUE, AND ESPECIALLY THE  COMPETITIVE PART OF OUR LEAGUE.  YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THINGS  DON'T MAKE SENSE, YOU KNOW AND  WE, THERE'S TIMES YOU SHOULD  FEEL, YOU KNOW, JUST -- JUST  FEEL SAD.  AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM.  YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET  THROUGH IT.  WE WILL.  WE ALL WILL.  WE HAVE TO BE STRONG, YOU KNOW.  AGAIN WE LAUGHED AND JOKED  ABOUT THE MAMBA MENTALITY.  WE ALL ARE GOING TO NEED IT  RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, AND  THERE'S NOBODY, I THINK  EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW IS A LAKER  FAN.  YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL LAKERS  TODAY.  YOU FEEL FOR THAT COMMUNITY,  FOR JEANNIE, AND FOR EVERYONE  ELSE.  I THINK PEOPLE THINK, BECAUSE  YOU COMPETE AGAINST PEOPLE  SOMETIMES, THAT YOU DON'T HAVE  A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND  YOU DON'T LIKE, AND IT'S  PROBABLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE.  I THINK SOMETIMES THE MORE YOU  COMPETE, THE MORE RESPECT YOU  HAVE FOR THE OPPONENT, YOU  KNOW?  I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE WAY I  FELT WITH KOBE.  SO THAT'S ALL.  I JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY.  >> JUST MOVING STATEMENTS THERE  FROM COACH DOC RIVERS.  A FATHER, SOMEONE WHO KNEW KOBE  BRYANT VERY, VERY WELL.  AND IN JUST PICKING ON SOME OF  THE MORE POIGNANT STATEMENTS  THAT HE MADE.  HE STILL HAD SO MUCH TO DO.  HE HAD SO MUCH LEFT, AND HOW  TRUE.  HE HAS A BABY GIRL WHO EITHER  IS A YEAR, OR HASN'T QUITE  TURNED A YEAR.  A 3-YEAR-OLD, AND THEN POOR,  THE OTHER TWO GIRLS AND GIANNA  LOSING HER LIFE TODAY, AND  THINKING ABOUT VANESSA.  I BELIEVE JIM HAD MENTIONED IT  EARLIER, WE REMEMBER JOE, JELLY  BEAN BRYANT.  HIS DAD, HIS MOM, HIS SISTERS,  AND VANESSA'S FAMILY.  THERE'S JUST SO MUCH HEARTBREAK  AND SADNESS IN A CLOSE KNIT  FAMILY, AND IN SUCH A WIDE  FAMILY SUCH AS THE LAKER  NATION.  PEOPLE OF LOS ANGELES WHO MAY  NOT NECESSARILY HAVE BEEN LAKER  FANS, BUT STILL ADMIRED, AND  RESPECTED KOBE BRYANT.  AND YOU CERTAINLY COULDN'T TAKE  THAT AWAY FROM HIM, NOT ONLY  HIS ABILITY TO PLAY BASKETBALL,  BUT JUST HIS TIRELESS WORK  ETHIC.  I CAN REMEMBER KIDS, SARAH,  JUST, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO  PRACTICE LIKE KOBE, BECAUSE  THAT'S HOW I'M GOING TO IMPROVE  MY FREE THROWS, I'VE GOT TO BE  IN THE GYM.  >> HE INSPIRED A GENERATION.  INCLUDING ME AND SO MANY OF MY  FRIENDS, JUST THE WAY HE PLAYED  THE GAME, IT MADE YOU LOVE  BASKETBALL AND THE SPORT MORE.  I KNOW PAT, AS A MOM, YOU FEEL  THE SAME WAY THAT I DO, THAT  IT'S JUST SO AWFUL TO HEAR  ABOUT THE LOSS OF A CHILD,  LOSING A CHILD IS OBVIOUSLY NOT  NATURAL, AND WE FEEL SO BAD FOR  NOT ONLY KOBE BRYANT'S FAMILY,  BUT FOR THE FAMILIES WHO LOST  LOVED ONES IN THIS CRASH.  REMEMBER, MULTIPLE VICTIMS IN  THIS PLANE CRASH AND A LOT OF  QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.  CERTAINLY QUESTIONS THAT ARE  TRYING TO BE ANSWERED RIGHT NOW  BY THE INVESTIGATORS.  >> THREE PEOPLE WHO STILL HAVE  YET TO BE IDENTIFIED.  OUR CARA FINSTROM IS STANDING  BY, ANDS THAT MORE INFORMATION  FOR US NOW.  >> Reporter: PAT WE HAVE  LEARNED FROM THE SHERIFF'S  DEPARTMENT, IT'S UNLIKELY WE'RE  GOING TO GET MORE INFORMATION  ABOUT THOSE NINE PEOPLE WHO  LOST THEIR LIVES TONIGHT.  AND ALSO FOR NTSB INVESTIGATORS  WHO ARE FLYING IN FROM THE EAST  COAST TO ARRIVE.  THEY SAY IT'S MOST LIKELY WE'LL  HAVE ANOTHER UPDATE TOMORROW.  THE HERE'S WHAT SHERIFF ALEX  VILLANUEVA TOLD US EARLIER  TODAY.  >> THERE WERE NO SURVIVORS.  WE HAVE A MANIFEST THAT  INDICATES THERE WERE NINE  PEOPLE ONBOARD THE AIRCRAFT.  THE PILOT, PLUS EIGHT  INDIVIDUALS.  THERE IS WIDE SPECULATION AS TO  WHO THE IDENTITIES ARE,  HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY  INAPPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW TO  IDENTIFY ANYONE BY NAME UNTIL  THE CORONER HAS MADE THE  IDENTIFICATION THROUGH THEIR  DELIBERATIVE PROCESS, AND HAVE  MADE NOTIFICATIONS TO NEXT OF  KIN.  >> Reporter: THE FIRE  DEPARTMENT SAYS THEY GOT A 911  CALL REPORTING A HELICOPTER  DOWN AND A BRUSH FIRE AT 9:47  THIS MORNING.  THEY SAY FIREFIGHTERS WITH  METAL EQUIPMENT HIKED IN.  OTHERS WERE DROPPED FROM A  HELICOPTER TO TRY TO REACH AND  HELP ANYONE WHO WAS ONBOARD,  BUT AGAIN, SADLY, THEY THEN  DISCOVERED THAT ALL NINE PEOPLE  ONBOARD HAD DIED.  THE FIRE CHIEF SPOKE ABOUT THE  SPECIFIC CHALLENGES FIRE CREWS  HAD TO FACE AS THEY WORKED TO  PUT OUT THOSE FLAMES.  >> OUR FIREFIGHTERS HIKED INTO  THE ACCIDENT SIGHT WITH THEIR  MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, AND HOSE  LINES TO EXTINGUISH THE  STUBBORN FIRE, AS IT INCLUDED  THE BRUSH FIRE, DEBRIS FROM THE  HELICOPTER, AND THE FIRE ALSO  INCLUDED MAGNESIUM, WHICH IS  VERY HARD FOR OUR FIREFIGHTERS  TO EXTINGUISH, BECAUSE  MAGNESIUM REACTS WITH OXYGEN,  AND WATER.  >> Reporter: AND PAT, AND  SARAH, A VERY EMOTIONAL DAY OUT  HERE FOR ALL THE FIRST  RESPONDERS AS WELL.  YOU CAN SEE THERE WAS A SENSE  OF SHOCK, DISBELIEF AMONGST THE  LEADERS AS THEY HELD THEIR NEWS  CONFERENCE.  EVERYONE, JUST REALLY HARD TO  GRASP AND TO ACCEPT THAT THIS  HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY.  >> ALL RIGHT, CARA, AS YOU  MENTIONED, YES, IT'S GOING TO  TAKE SOME TIME TO GET  INFORMATION TO FIGURE OUT  EXACTLY WHY THIS CHOPPER WENT  DOWN, FOR ONE, AND OF COURSE,  TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE OTHER  PEOPLE THAT WERE ONBOARD THAT  PLANE.  THREE OTHER VICTIMS, BECAUSE  THEY HAVE TO NOTIFY NEXT OF  KIN.  THIS IS JUST A VERY, VERY  EMOTIONAL DAY ALL AROUND.  >> WELL THIS IS JUST IN THE  PRELIMINARY STATUS WHEN IT  COMES TO THE NTSB  INVESTIGATING.  THEY BROUGHT 18 PEOPLE IN.  IT'S CALLED THEIR GO-TEAM TO GO  TO THAT LOCATION, AS WE  UNDERSTAND IT, AS WE GO TO THE  SHERIFF'S PRESS CONFERENCE, THE  BODIES AT THE SCENE, SO WHEN  THEY GET THERE, THEY HAVE TO GO  THROUGH AND FIND ALL THAT THEY  CAN, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE  SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE WE GET A  CAUSE.  >> TIME-CONSUMING, BUT  EVENTUALLY, WE WILL GET THE  IDENTITIES OF THE OTHER  VICTIMS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE  FAMILY MEMBERS.  WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING BREAKING  NEWS ALL DAY SINCE THIS  HAPPENED AT 9:45 THIS MORNING,  I BELIEVE.  THE DEATH OF LAKERS LEGEND KOBE  BRYANT AND HIS DAUGHTER.  WE HAVE SIX OTHER PEOPLE WHO  WERE KILLED IN THAT PLANE  CRASH.  SOME OF NOTE, WHEN I SAY THAT,  THAT COULD BE WELL KNOWN IN THE  ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY.  MR.JOHN ALTOBELLI.  >> WE HAVE CHRISTINA MAUSER,  SHE'S A BASKETBALL COACH.  WE HAVE JOHN ALTOBELLI, THE  BASEBALL COACH THERE, HIS WIFE  CARRIE, AND DAUGHTER ALLISSA.  WE BELIEVE ALLISSA WAS A  TEAMMATE OF GIANNA AND THEY  WERE GOING TO THE MAMBA SPORTS  COMPLEX IN THOUSAND OAKS.  >> THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT HAVE  BEEN JUST TORN APART BY THIS  NEWS.  AND OF COURSE, HE WE ARE  TALKING ABOUT KOBE BRYANT,  BECAUSE OF HOW WELL KNOWN KOBE  BRYANT WAS.  HOW MUCH HE WAS ADMIRED ALL  OVER THE WORLD, NOT JUST HERE,  AND CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF THE  CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT HE BROUGHT  TO LOS ANGELES, BECAUSE WE ARE  KNOWN FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS, OF  COURSE, BUT JUST EVERYTHING HE  GAVE TO THE GAME, AND TO THE  FANS.  AND HIS APPRECIATION.  THE NIGHT THAT THEY RETIRED HIS  JERSEYS, AND HIS FAREWELL TO  HE FANS, IT WAS JUST SO  HEARTFELT.  I THINK HE JUST TOOK EVERYTHING  IN, COMING FROM THEM, BECAUSE  HE GAVE SO MUCH BACK.  >> DO YOU REMEMBER THAT LAST  GAME?  THAT SEASON WAS NOT A VERY GOOD  SEASON FOR THE LAKERS, BUT THAT  LAST GAME, YOU COULD FEEL THAT  HE WAS PUTTING WHATEVER HE  COULD TO PUT THE LITTLE,  EXCLAMATION POINT ON HIS  CAREER.  >> AND HE DID.  HOW MANY POINTS DID HE SCORE?  WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO JIM AND  HE CAN TELL US.  BUT AT THE SAME TIME, EVEN THE  OTHER TEAM, THEY WANTED KOBE TO  GO OUT, AND BOY DID HE.  HE PUT ON A CLINIC, RIGHT?  THAT'S FOR SURE, THAT WILL  NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.  EVERYONE WILL REMEMBER THAT.  >> IT'S NOT JUST LOS ANGELES.  OF COURSE, HE HAS GLOBAL  APPEAL.  HE'S FROM PHILADELPHIA.  I BET YOU THERE'S SOME  MEMORIALS GOING UP THERE, IN  THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE.  YOU JUST KNOW WE'VE GOT SEVERAL  HERE.  AND HIS  >>> BOTH ON THE BASKETBALL  COURT AND OFF THE BASKETBALL  COURT.  AND -- AT THE SAME TIME, JUST  WHAT HE MEANT TO -- WE'RE  GIVING THE SCOPE OF CELEBRITIES  AND PEOPLE WELL-KNOWN.  OTHER SUPERSTAR ATHLETES BUT HE  ALSO TOUCHED JUST THE LITTLE  GUY.  I WAS JUST TALKING TO SOMEONE  OUT IN THE LOT AND JUST HOW SAD  THEY WERE AND HOW THEY REMEMBER  WATCHING HIM GROW UP.  THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT  WE HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM, JEFF.  THAT HE HAS TOUCHED.  SO WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO  OUR BREAKING NEWS.  LAKERS' LEGEND KOBE BRYANT  KILLED IN A TRAGIC HELICOPTER  CRASH IN CALABASAS.  >> ALL WE'RE TOLD, NINE PEOPLE  ABOARD KILLED INCLUDING KOBE'S  13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.  THE STUNNING NEWS LEAVES FANS  AND THE WORLD IN COMPLETE  SHOCK.  >> TONIGHT, EVERYONE AS WE'VE  BEEN MENTIONING FROM FANS TO  CELEBRITIES TO THOSE WHO KNEW  HIM BEST ARE DEVASTATED BY THIS  HEART-BREAKING NEWS.  >> JUAN FERNANDEZ LIVE IN THE  NEWSROOM RIGHT NOW WITH WHAT WE  ARE LEARNING TONIGHT.  >> PAT AND JEFF, L. A. OF  COURSE IN TEARS OVER THE MAN  THEY CALLED THE BLACK MAMBA.  KOBE BRYANT WHO CEMENTED HIS  LEGACY WITH NBA CHAMPIONSHIPS  AND GIVING BACK TO THE CITY HE  LOVED SO MUCH WAS KILLED IN A  CHOPPER CRASH IN CALABASAS THIS  MORNING.  AND HERE'S WHAT WE'RE LEARNING  RIGHT NOW.  ALL THIS INFORMATION COMING  INTO OUR NEWSROOM RIGHT NOW.  NINE PEOPLE WERE ON BOARD THAT  SIKORSKY S 76 WHEN SOMETHING  WENT WRONG WHERE'S BEFORE 10:00  THIS MORNING.  THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO A  TRAVEL BASKETBALL GAME WE'RE  TOLD WHEN THE CHOPPER WENT  DOWN.  HERE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT  RIGHT NOW IS THE FLIGHT PATTERN  OF THE HELICOPTER JUST MOMENTS  BEFORE IT CRASHED AND CAUGHT  FIRE.  WE OBTAINED THIS FROM FLIGHT  AWARE AND YOU CAN SEE THERE  TOWARDS THE END, IT GOES FROM  ORANGE COUNTY TO THE SAN  FERNANDO VALLEY WHEN IT STARTED  SPINNING INCONTROLLABLY.  THIS WILL OF COURSE BE PART OF  THE NTSB INVESTIGATION OF HOW  EXACTLY THAT CHOPPER WENT DOWN.  WELL, IN ADDITION TO BRYANT AND  HIS DAUGHTER, THREE MEMBERS OF  ONE FAMILY DIED IN THE CRASH.  JOHN ALTOBELLI WAS THE HEAD  COACH, BASEBALL COACH AT THE  ORANGE COAST COLLEGE IN COAST  TAMASHA.  HIS WIFE CAREY AND THEIR  DAUGHTER ALYSSA WERE ALSO ON  BOARD.  THE HUSBAND OF CHRISTINA MOUSER  POSTED ON FACEBOOK SHE ALSO  DIED IN THE HELICOPTER CRASH.  SHE WAS A BASKETBALL COACH IN  NEWPORT BEACH WHERE KOBE'S  DAUGHTER ATTENDED SCHOOL.  HER HUSBAND SAYS HE AND HIS  KIDS ARE DEVASTATED.  WELL, AS WE LEARNED THE NAMES  OF MORE OF THESE VICTIMS COMING  INTO THE NEWSROOM WE'LL LET YOU  KNOW RIGHT AWAY.  MEANTIME REPORTING LIVE, I'M  JUAN FERNANDEZ, BACK TO YOU PAT  AND JEFF.  >> ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR THAT JUAN FERNANDEZ.  AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR  JIM HILL WHO HAS BEEN TALKING  WITH SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED.  NOT ONLY IN THE SPORTS WORLD,  BUT JUST IN LIFE.  PEOPLE REALLY LOVED AND ADMIRED  KOBE.  >> Reporter: I JUST GOT OFF THE  PHONE WITH THE BRILLIANT TIMES  WRITER BILL PLASCHKE.  BILL ARE THROUGH?  >> YES I AM.  >> THIS IS A BAD DAY BILL.  FOR ALL OF US AND I KNOW  PARTICULARLY FOR YOU BECAUSE  YOU HAD A VERY SPECIAL  RELATIONSHIP WITH KOBE.  >> YEAH, I'M DEVASTATED.  HE -- HE AND I, OUR JOURNEYS  KIND MIRRORS EACH OTHER.  WE TALKED ABOUT THE THAT A LOT.  HE CAME TO L. A. IN '96 AND I  STARTED WRITING MY SPORTS  COLUMN FOR THE \"L.A.  TIMES\" ART A MONTH LATER.  I'VE BEEN WITH HIM THROUGH THE  UPS AND DOWNS AND EVERYTHING  AND YOU KNOW, HE'S THE ULTIMATE  -- I'VE YELLED AT HIM AND HE'S  YELLED AT ME AND WE'VE HAD OUR  FIGHTS AND WE'VE EMBRACED.  I'VE SEEN HIM AS HE GREW UP.  IN MY COLUMN.  THE CITY GREW UP.  I THINK THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY SO  AFFECTED TODAY.  BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SPORTS FANS  IN L. A. AND EVERYONE IN L. A.  FEELS LIKE THEY GREW UP WITH  THE GUY AND I DID WHAT MIGHT BE  -- MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LAST  INTERVIEW WITH HIM.  I CALLED -- WE JUST TALKED LAST  WEEK.  I CALLED HIM ABOUT THE LeBRON  JAMES PASSING HIM ON THE ALL- TIME SCORING LIST AND I  EXPECTED KOBE TO BE DEFIANT AND  SAY DON'T MESS WITH MY LEGACY.  BUT HE WAS INSTEAD WARM AND  EMBRACING OF LeBRON AND URGED  LAKER FANS TO CONSIDER LeBRON A  REAL LAKER AND SAID STOP WITH  THE DEFACING THE MURALS AND ALL  THAT JUNK.  AND CELEBRATE LeBRON FOR WHO HE  IS AND KOBE WAS YOU KNOW, HE  SAYS A MARK OF GREATNESS IS  THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO PASS THAT  GREATNESS ALONG.  HE REALLY SOUNDED LIKE HE HAD  REALLY GROWN UP AND BECOME A  WISE AND -- ATTEMPT TO BECOME  LIKE A COMMUNITY LEADER.  >> IT WAS ALMOST -- BILL, LIKE  HE HAD COME TO GRIPS WITH  HIMSELF ABOUT WHAT HE WAS  SUPPOSED TO DO IN HIS  POSTATHLETIC CAREER.  >> YES.  YES.  HE REALLY -- THAT'S WHAT'S SO  SAD.  HE TALKED ABOUT HIS GIRLS AND  GIANNA AND THE BASKETBALL AND  SUCH A FAN OF WOMEN'S  BASKETBALL AND SUCH A SUPPORT  EVERY OF IT.  HE WAS ROADWAY -- HE HAD BECOME  YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE CITY I  THINK REALLY FELT LIKE THEY  DIDN'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL  BECAUSE HE WAS SO TOUGH ON THE  COURT AND OFF THE COURT.  ALWAYS HAD THE SCOWL.  BUT HE'S REALLY A SWEETHEART OF  A GUY AND I THINK HE REALLY  LOVED L. A..  THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME IN  THE CONVERSATION BEFORE HE HUNG  UP.  WE TALKED A WHILE.  IS THAT HE SAID AND I DIDN'T  EVEN ASK HIM THIS.  JUST MAKE SURE L. A. KNOWS HOW  MUCH I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING  THIS CITY HAS DONE FOR ME AND I  COULD NEVER PAY THE CITY BACK  FOR ALL IT'S BEEN TO ME.  AND HE SAID THAT WITH  UNPROMPTED BY ME.  AND THAT WAS THE LAST WORDS TO  ME.  AND I THINK THAT'S HOW HE WANTS  TO BE REMEMBERED.  IS A PERSON WHO REALLY  APPRECIATED, HE KNEW THIS CITY  HAD GROWN UP WITH HIM AND SEEN  HIS FOIBLES AND SEEN HIS  GREATNESS.  AND WENT THROUGH ALL THE OFF  THE COURT STUFF WITH HIM.  AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.  AND STILL AT THE END OF THE DAY  SUPPORTED HIM AND CHEERED HIM.  AND LIFTED HIM UP LIKE HE  LIFTED US UP.  HE'S THE MOST -- I'D SAY JIM,  HE MAY BE THE MOST -- EVEN THE  ERA OF SOCIAL MEDIA, MAY BE THE  MOST FAMOUS ATHLETE IN THIS  CITY'S HISTORY IF YOU THINK  ABOUT IT, GIVEN THE EYEBALLS ON  THE SOCIAL COMMUNICATION WE  HAVE TODAY, HE MAY BE THE MOST  CELEBRATED ATHLETE IN THE CITY.  MAY BE THE MOST CELEBRATED  HUMAN BEING IN THE CITY RIGHT  NOW.  YOU KNOW.  AND AT HIS PASSING AND HIS  IMPACT JUST CUTS A HOLE IN OUR  HEART.  L. A. GOSLETS A LITTLE CHUNK OF  ITS HEART.  >> I KNOW BILL, AND ONE OF THE  THINGS THAT IN YOUR COLUMN YOU  SAY HIS LEGEND WASN'T SUPPOSED  TO END THIS WAY.  >> I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T THINK  -- I DIDN'T THINK KOBE -- I  DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING COULD  BRING HIM DOWN.  MAMBAS DON'T DIE.  I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE 70  YEARS OLD AND WOBBLING TO THE  STAPLES CENTER AND HE NEVER GOT  TO SEE A STATUE OF HIMSELF.  HE NEVER GOT TO SEE HIMSELF IN  THE HALL OF FAME.  NEVER GOT TO SEE HIS GIRLS --  WALK THEM DOWN THE AISLE.  NEVER GOT TO SEE HIS GIRL PLAY  HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL.  IT'S JUST TRAGIC BEYOND  PROPORTIONS.  AND JUST -- IT'S JUST  OVERWHELMINGLY AND I JUST  DIDN'T THINK -- I THOUGHT IT  WAS A JOKE.  I HEARD THE NEWS AND I THOUGHT  IT WAS A JOKE.  I THOUGHT -- I DIDN'T THINK IT  WAS A JOKE, I THOUGHT SOMEBODY  WAS WRONG.  IT WASN'T KOBE.  COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIS  HELICOPTER.  HE COULDN'T SUCCUMB.  NOTHING COULD BEAT HIM.  THAT'S THE WAY HE PLAYED.  HIS MENTALITY OVERTOOK THIS  CITY.  AND WE BELIEVED IN HIM AND  BELIEVED IN OURSELVES.  >> I --  >> MAMBA MENTALITY TO WORK  EVERY DAY.  >> OH, YEAH.  GIVE IT ALL YOU GOT.  DON'T LET -- YOU KNOW DON'T  SAVE ANYTHING.  BUT YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALSO  BILL, ANOTHER THING THAT YOU  WROTE IN OUR COLUMN.  AND IT IS SIMPLY WHEN YOU SAY  KOBE BRYANT IS GONE.  THOSE ARE THE HARDEST WORDS I  HAVE EVER HAD TO WRITE FOR THIS  NEWSPAPER.  >> I WAS CRYING WHEN I WROTE IT  JIM AND I WAS SCREAMING.  I'M HERE IN MIAMI AT THE SUPER  BOWL AND I'M COMING HOME  TOMORROW BUT I WENT OUTSIDE AND  SCREAMED OUT INTO THE -- INTO  THE AFTERNOON AIR.  IT'S -- IT'S YEAH.  I'VE NEVER -- I CAN'T BELIEVE  IT.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M -- I EVEN  WROTE THAT.  I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT'S  REAL.  I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE NOT GOING  TO SEE HIM IN A COUPLE OF DAYS  FROM NOW AT THE LAKER CLIPPER  GAME OR -- I CAN'T BELIEVE  WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE HIM  DOING SOMETHING AT THE YOU  KNOW, AT THE OSCARS OR  SOMETHING.  I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.  IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST -- IT'S  JUST NUMBING.  IT'S JUST -- IT'S BEYOND  EXPLANATION.  AND IT REALLY IS -- IT REALLY  DOES STRIKE INTO EVERY LITTLE  PART OF THIS CITY.  EVEN -- EVEN PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T  LIKE HIM, AND HE HAD HIS  DETRACTORS AND YOU KNOW THAT  VERY WELL JIM AS YOU AND I HAVE  BEEN HIS DETRACTORS OVER THE  YEARS.  EVEN PEOPLE WERE MOVED BY HIM  OR TOUCHED BY HIM.  AND EMPATHIZE WITH HIM.  >> IT'S REALLY AMAZING TOO,  BILL, BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE KOBE  AROUND OTHER PEOPLE, THEY GET  EXCITED.  THEY GET HAPPY.  PEOPLE START CRYING.  IT'S -- IT'S JUST AMAZING THAT  HE HAS -- HE WAS GIVEN THIS  GIFT THAT HAS AFFECTED US ALL  FROM A VERY POSITIVE  STANDPOINT.  >> OH MY GOSH.  HE SHOWS UP IN A ROOM AND HE  LIGHTS UP A PLACE.  HE WAS AT STAPLES CENTER WITH  GIANNA THIS YEAR.  REMEMBER THAT?  HE WAS COURTSIDE AND THE WHOLE  -- HE'S THE ONLY -- THE ONLY  PERSON ALIVE I THINK WHO CAN GO  TO THE LAKER GAME AND THE  PLAYERS -- THEY ALL WATCH HIM.  HE WANTS TO WATCH THE GAME AND  THEY WATCH HIM.  >> ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE  TALKED ABOUT IS THAT WHEN HE  WENT TO LAKER GAMES AND SAT AT  COURTSIDE, THAT WOULD MAKE THE  PLAYERS NO MATTER WHETHER IT  WAS THE LAKERS OR THE VISITING  TEAM, THEY WOULD ALL WANT TO  PUT ON A SHOW FOR HIM.  >> YES.  AND THAT'S -- THAT WAS WHAT THE  BIGGEST PROBLEM LeBRON JAMES  HAD LAST YEAR WHEN HE CAME HERE  WAS THAT HE WASN'T -- KOBE  BRYANT.  BECAUSE KOBE AND I SAID THIS --  I DON'T CARE HOW INJURED HE  WAS.  KOBE -- REMEMBER HE DRAGGED  THAT TEAM.  HE TORE HIS HEEL AND DRAGGED  THAT TEAM TO THE PLAYOFFS.  KOBE YOU KNOW, NEVER EVER GAVE  IN.  NVER GAVE IN.  NEVER -- EITHER HE WON IT ALL  OR HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF A  LOSER.  NEVER GAVE IN.  EVER.  AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO STUNNING  TODAY IS THAT SOMETHING OUT OF  HIS CRIMINAL KILLED HIM.  I MEAN KOBE BRYANT IS DEAD.  JIM, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY  THAT.  I NEVER THOUGHT I'D THINK THAT.  >> I KNOW.  I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL  SAYING RIGHT NOW.  YOU KNOW, HOW -- HOW CAN THIS  BE?  AND HOW CAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS  HAPPEN?  AND THEN I'M REMINDED OF A  SAYING THAT SAYING IS \"THE  GOOD, THEY DIE YOUNG.\"  >> YEAH, WELL, HE WAS JUST  COMING INTO HIS OWN TOO.  JUST COMING INTO HIS OWN AS A  -- CIVIC AND CULTURAL LEADER.  AND REMEMBER JIM?  YOU AND I JOKED ABOUT THIS.  THE MINUTE HE RETIRED HE WAS  DONE WITH THE LAKERS, ALWAYS  GOING TO COME BACK AND COACH OR  GENERAL MANAGE THE LAKERS.  HE WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH  RUNNING BASKETBALL.  HE HAD BIGGER THINGS IN HIS  MIND AND LIFE.  HE WAS YOU KNOW, HE WAS GOING  TO BE A CONTRIBUTOR TO A LOT OF  DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE TOWN.  AND HE GAVE SO MUCH AND IT JUST  -- IT SHOWS I JUST HEARD THE  NEWSMAN SAY THERE ARE PEOPLE ON  THE HELICOPTER WITH HIM WERE  PEOPLE FROM HIS DAUGHTER'S  SCHOOL AND FROM HIS LOCAL  COMMUNITY COLLEGE.  AND HE LIFTED EVERYBODY UP.  HE TOOK PEOPLE WITH HIM  EVERYWHERE HE WENT.  >> AND HE --  >> THAT'S HOW HE ROLLED.  >> HE MADE THE TRANSITION FROM  ATHLETE TO BUSINESSMAN EASIER  THAN ANYONE ELSE I HAVE EVER  SEEN.  >> THE NEXT JIM -- I TALKED TO  HIM THE DAY AFTER HIS  RETIREMENT.  THE DAY AFTER HE SCORED 60  POINTS AGAINST UTAH.  EQUALED ME AND WANTED TO TALK  ABOUT A BUSINESS IDEA.  DAY AFTER.  AND I SAID WELL, HOW ABOUT THE  LAKERS AND HOW ABOUT BYRON  SCOTT AND THAT'S NOT MY  BUSINESS ANYMORE.  I'M DONE WITH THAT.  HE WAS DONE.  HE REALLY MADE THE TRANSITION  PERFECTLY AND AGAIN, IN HIS  WORDS TO ME AND I'D URGE ANYONE  TO GO BACK AND READ THE COLUMN  I WROTE LAST WEEK ABOUT LeBRON  JAMES AND KOBE AND KOBE SAID  GIVE PROPS TO LEBRON.  I PLAYED FOR THE PURPLE AND  GOLD.  I DON'T PLAY FOR MYSELF.  THIS IS BIGGER THAN ME.  GIVING PROPS TO HIM.  BUT ALSO THINK ABOUT THE -- THE  IRONY IN THIS THE DAY AFTER  LeBRON PASSED HIS RECORD.  KOBE BRYANT PASSED AWAY.  >> YEAH.  >> THAT'S JUST -- WHOLE THING  IS JUST -- IT'S DOING TO TAKE  US A LONG TIME TO GET OVER THIS  ONE JIM.  THIS WAS -- THIS WAS -- THIS  WAS A STUNNING OF A DEMISE AS  THE DEATH IN THIS CITY AS SEEN  ATHLETIC-WISE IN MANY, MANY  YEARS.  >> I KNOW YOU WERE TALKING  ABOUT THE LAST INTERVIEW I DID  WITH HIM WAS JUST ABOUT TEN  DAYS AGO AND WE WERE TALKING  ABOUT LeBRON PASSING HIM AND  STUFF LIKE THAT.  AND HE SAID HE TURNED TO THE  CAMERA AND HE SAID LeBRON  CONGRATULATIONS, THAT'S THE WAY  TO GO YOU KNOW WE LOVE YOU BRO  AND THAT'S LIKE -- LOVE YOU  BROTHER.  AND THAT'S THE BROTHERHOOD OF  THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS.  >> AND THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED TO  -- HE KEPT TELLING ME RIGHT  ABOUT THAT, WRITE ABOUT OUR  BROTHERHOOD.  WE'RE ALL -- LeBRON IS ONE US.  IN FACT, YEAH I ASKED IF LeBRON  COULD HAVE BROKEN THE RECORD  AGAINST THE CLIPPERS.  TUESDAY NIGHT.  AND I SAID KOBE, WOULD YOU BE  THERE?  HE SAID NO I'M NOT GOING TO  THAT GAME.  THAT'S LeBRON'S MOMENT.  GOING TO GIVE HIM THAT MOMENT.  HE COULD HAVE HIJACKED THAT IN  A MINUTE.  PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO SAY  KOBE BRYANT'S TOWN.  IT JUST WAS.  >> ALSO READING IN THE ARTICLE  THAT YOU WROTE, YOU SAY GO  AHEAD, KEEP CRYING.  YOU WON'T BE ALONE.  A HUGE HOLE HAS BEEN CUT OUT OF  LOS ANGELES' HEART AND THE  WOUND IS BREATHTAKING.  >> IT IS RIGHT AND I'M BEING  TEXTED AND YOU ARE TOO TEXTS  FROM ANYONE.  EVERYWHERE.  PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST CASUAL FANS  AND PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN LIKE  HIM AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO  REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HIM.  AND WE KNOW OF ALL THE REASONS  WHY.  THE OFF THE COURT ISSUES.  THE -- THE SELFISH ON THE COURT  ISSUES THE PERCEPTION OF THAT.  PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HIM.  I DIDN'T LIKE HIM SOMETIMES.  YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM SOMETIMES.  THERE'S -- HE DIDN'T LIKE.  HE DIDN'T LIKE US SOMETIMES.  BUT HE ALWAYS SHOWED UP AND HE  ALWAYS PLAYED HARD AND HE GAVE  HIMSELF COMPLETELY TO THE TEAM,  TO THE COMMUNITY, TO THE WORLD.  AND TO HAVE HIM TAKEN AWAY SO  SOON IS JUST -- IT'S TRAGIC  BEYOND -- YOU KNOW RECOGNITION.  >> BILL, YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW  PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF THAT --  AND THERE'S A SELECT GROUP OF  US HERE -- WHO HAVE WATCHED  KOBE BRYANT AND WATCHED HIM  COME INTO TOWN AND WATCHED HIM  GROW AND WATCHED HIM MATURE.  WATCHED HIM -- DEVELOP.  >> WE WERE AT THE FIRST GAME  AND WE WERE AT HIS FIRST GAME  AND HIS LAST GAME.  >> YEP.  >> AND YOU KNOW, REMEMBER?  REMEMBER THE THREE -- REMEMBER  THE AIR BALLS IN UTAH?  YES.  >> YOU WERE THERE NEXT TO ME  SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WATCHING  HIM AND SAYING THIS KID IS  NUTS.  IS IT HIS FIRST PLAYOFF GAME  AND HE KEPT SHOOTING AND DIDN'T  CARE.  HE KEPT SHOOTING.  >> I REMEMBER BILL AT HALFTIME.  THEY GO-GO THE LOOKER ROOM AFT  AT HALFTIME AND KOBE SAID YOU  GUYS ARE SCARED.  GET OUT OF THE WAY, I'LL WIN IT  MYSELF.  >> THA'S WILD.  AND HE IS JUST AN 18-YEAR-OLD  KID SAYING THAT.  YEAH, THAT'S -- THAT'S CRAZY.  YEAH, IT'S -- IT'S ALL YOU  KNOW, THE 81 POINTS AGAINST  TORONTO.  THE CHAMPIONSHIP AGAINST  BOSTON.  ALL RIGHT JIM HERE'S ONE.  HE NEVER GET TO -- HE AND I  TALKED ABOUT THIS.  ABOUT POSSIBLE STATUES.  HE DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS WHAT  HIS STATUE WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT  HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO  SEEING IT AND NOW HE'LL NEVER  SEE IT.  WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STATUE  SHOULD BE OF HIM?  WHAT DO YOU THINK?  WHICH POSE DO YOU THINK HE  SHOULD TAKE?  I THINK HIM STANDING ON THE  PRESS TABLE BASKETBALL IN HIS  HAND AND HANDS UP RAISED.  BUT THERE'S SEVERAL -- YOU KNOW  HIM SHOOTING AND HIM TAKING A  FADE AWAY.  ALL KINDS OF POSES YOU CAN DO  FOR HIM.  >> TWO JERSEYS RETIRED.  >> TWO JERSEYS RETIRED AND HE  NEVER GOT TO GO INTO THE HALL  OF FAME.  IMAGINE THAT.  >> I KNOW -- I KNOW BILL,  THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT  KOBE WILL NEVER GET TO DO BUT  THE THINGS THAT STICK OUT IN MY  MIND IS WHAT YOU MENTIONED  EARLIER IS ABOUT WATCHING HIS  -- WATCHING HIS GIRLS GROW UP.  WATCHING HIS GIRLS WALK DOWN  THE AISLE.  >> AND HE TOLD ME HE SAID BILL,  YOU DON'T KNOW PRESSURE -- HE  WAS JUST -- WHEN WE TALKED.  YOU DON'T KNOW PRESSURE UNTIL  YOU HAVE TO MEET SOMEONE WHO  WANTS TO DATE YOUR 17-YEAR-OLD  DAUGHTER AND THAT'S -- YEAH.  AND CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING TO  MEET THE MAMBA ON THE DOORSTEP?  >> YEAH.  >> YOU KNOW MOST GUYS ARE  AFRAID OF MEETING THE MOM.  HE'S AFRAID OF MEETING THE  MAMBA.  HE WAS -- YEAH, HE WAS -- HE  WAS SO DOTING TO HIS DAUGHTERS  TOO.  SO DOTING TO THEM.  JUST -- YOU KNOW, AND AGAIN,  LITTLE GIANNA WAS HIS  BASKETBALL BUDDY.  SHE WENT WITH HIM EVERYWHERE.  >> HE LOVED SHOWING OFF HIS  GIRLS DIDN'T HE?  >> YES.  I CAN'T IMAGINE THE PAIN  VANESSA FEELS RIGHT NOW.  I CAN'T IMAGINE.  I CANNOT IMAGINE.  I JUST -- I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO  IMAGINE AND MY HEART AND  PRAYERS GO OUT TO ALL OF THEM.  ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE  CRASH.  WE CAN'T FORGET THE OTHERS WHO  ARE PERISHED AS WELL.  THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND  COMING DAYS YOU KNOW JIM, IT'S  IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE  BASEBALL COACH.  ALTOBELLI.  REMEMBER THE HIGH SCHOOL  BASKETBALL COACH, REMEMBER ALL  THEM.  IT'S SO IMPORTANT.  BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THEY'LL GET  INITIALLY INITIAL SHOCK,  THEY'LL GET LEFT OUT.  BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE  FORGOTTEN.  >> NO.  YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.  BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH.  IT'S -- AMAZING, YOU COVERED  HIS FIRST GAME AND LIKE YOU  MENTIONED AND YOU COVERED HIS  LAST GAME.  >> SO DID YOU JIM.  AND I'M FLYING BACK -- I'M  FLYING BACK FROM MIAMI AND I'M  AT THE SUPER BOWL.  I'M CANCELING THE SUPER BOWL  AND I'M COMING BACKING FROM  MIAMI TO GO TO THE GAME TUESDAY  BECAUSE I WANT TO BE THERE FOR  THE COMMOTION TO SEE THE FULL  CIRCLE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT  THE LAKERS ARE GOING TO DO.  I'M SURE.  >> KNOWING THE LAKERS, THE WAY  THAT WE DO, AND I KNOW YOU KNOW  JEANIE VERY WELL.  IT WILL BE FULL OF PASSION AND  IT WILL BE FULL O --  >> SHE HAS TO BE CRUSHED.  >> OH MY GOODNESS YEAH.  >> I CAN'T IMAGINE.  ALL RIGHT BUDDY HANG IN THERE  JIM.  >> THANKS A LOT BILL.  APPRECIATE YOUR TIME MAN.  THAT'S -- THAT'S BILL OF THE  \"LOS ANGELES TIMES\" AND BILL IS  ONE OF THE PREMIERE WRITERS IN  OUR PROFESSION.  NOT ONLY IN LOS ANGELES AREA,  BUT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.  AND I TELL BILL A LOT OF TIMES  YOU KNOW, NOT -- I LIKE SITTING  NEXT TO THE WRITERS BECAUSE IF  THEY SAY SOMETHING CRITICAL  ABOUT A GUY.  THEY'RE THERE THE NEXT DAY.  TO FACE HIM WITH IT AND I'VE  SEEN -- I'VE SEEN HIM WRITE  SOME PRETTY TOUGH STUFF ABOUT  PEOPLE.  BUT HE'S RIGHT THERE THE NEXT  DAY AND KOBE WAS ALWAYS ONE WHO  WAS THERE, NOSE TO NOSE WITH  HIM EXPLAINING WHY HE DID WHAT  HE DID.  SO --  >> YOU KNOW WHAT ALSO I SO  LEARNED AND ADMIRED ABOUT KOBE  OVER THE YEARS, HE DIDN'T LIKE  HYPOTHETICALS.  YOU COULD ASK HIM A  HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.  WHAT IF LIKE TODAY, WHAT IF YOU  WERE PLAYING -- WAIT A MINUTE.  I'M NOT PLAYING AGAINST -- SO  I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT  BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW.  I CAN ONLY TALK ABOUT WHEN I  PLAYED WHAT I DID.  THEN.  WHAT HAPPENED THEN.  >> I GIVE YOU ANOTHER ONE.  I WAS TALKING TO HIM ABOUT THE  HALL OF FAME.  I SAID YOU KNOW, IF EVER THERE  WAS A SUREFIRE HALL OF FAMER  YOU WERE IT.  HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU  ARE GOING TO SAY?  LIKE YOU SAID, NO.  HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT YET.  I'LL WAIT AND DEAL WITH THAT  WHEN THE TIME COMES.  >> WHEN IT HAPPENS.  >> HE ALWAYS DEALT IN THE  PRESENT.  AND HE'S --  >> YOU KNOW, WE'RE SO LUCKY TO  HAVE THE PERSPECTIVE OF YOU,  JIM, AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU  HAVE INTERVIEWED TODAY.  WE WANT DO GO BACK TO THE FIRST  TIME THAT YOU MET KOBE BRYANT I  THINK WE HAVE SOME VIDEO.  IF YOU DON'T MIND WALKING US  THROUGH THAT.  HE'S 17 YEARS OLD.  AND YOU ARE INTERVIEWING HIM.  AT STAPLES CENTER.  >> HE APPEARED ON ARLESS.  REMEMBER THE TV SHOW?  >> I REMEMBER THAT.  >> AND I WAS TALKING TO HIM  ABOUT THAT.  AND WE WERE JUST LAUGHING AND  JOKING AND GOING ON AND KOBE  THEN ACTED LIKE HE HAS BEEN IN  THE BUSINESS 15, 20 YEARS.  HE WAS JUST -- HE WAS JUST  ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.  AND HE -- HE KNEW HOW TO HANDLE  HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA.  HE -- AND THIS PARTICULAR CLIP,  HE WAS SPEAKING ENGLISH AND  ITALIAN.  WHICH KIND OF THREW ALL OF US  OFF.  BUT WE WERE LAUGHING AND JOKING  ABOUT HIM, WHAT HE WAS GOING TO  DO WITH THE LAKERS.  HOW HE FELT ABOUT BEING A  LAKER.  THE RESPONSIBILITY HE FELT TO  THE COMMUNITY AS BEING A MEMBER  OF THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS.  WHO'S GOING TO BE -- THE LAKERS  ICONIC TEAM IN YOU KNOW, ONE OF  THE TOP ICONIC TEAMS IN ALL OF  THE WORLD.  AND SO THIS WAS THE FIRST  INTERVIEW WITH HIM WHEN I DID  AND ARLESS AND WE LAUGHED AND  JOKED ABOUT THAT.  EVEN UNTIL A COUPLE OF WEEKS  AGO.  >> WHEN THERE'S YOUNG MAN THAT  COME INTO THE TOWN AND ARE IN  SPORTS AND OUTSIDE OF SPORTS,  WE KNOW THE AUDIENCE KNOWS  ABOUT SPORTS.  THEY GET TO KNOW JIM HILL.  AND MOST OF THEM ARE SMART  ENOUGH -- OH COME ON TAKE IT. % THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW  OKAY I CAN LEARN A LOT FROM HIM  AND YOU TAKE THE TIME WITH  THEM.  TO WHISPER SOME THINGS IN THEIR  EAR.  TO PULL THEM TO THE SIDE.  AND JUST GIVE THEM A LITTLE YOU  KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF  INFORMATION.  THAT'S WONDERFUL.  I LOVED TO WATCH YOU TWO BANDER  BACK AND FORTH OVER THE YEARS.  >> WE CAN'T DISCUSS EVERYTHING.  SOME OF THE THINGS WE TALKED  ABOUT WE TALKED ABOUT STRATEGY.  AND WE TALKED ABOUT HIS HEART.  AND HOW BIG A HEART HE HAS.  AND HOW HE WILL GO TO THE ENDS.  HE WILL GO TO THE DEPTHS AND  THE DEEPEST PART OF THE OCEAN  TO HELP HIS TEAMMATES.  TO DO WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE  DONE IN ORDER TO WIN -- IN  ORDER TO WIN GAMES.  HE MAY HAVE PROBABLY -- IS THE  MOST SINGULARLY FOCUSED ATHLETE  I HAVE EVER MET.  YOU KNOW --  >> THAT'S SAYING A LOT.  >> THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE  BECAUSE THERE WAS A QUOTE ABOUT  KOBE BRYANT THAT SAID HE WAS  RELEAPTLESS AND COMPETITIVE AND  HAD A WORK ETHIC AND I  UNDERSCORED ETHIC BECAUSE THERE  ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE PASSION.  THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE  ABILITY.  AND CAN BE COMPETITIVE BUT IF  THEY DON'T HAVE THE ETHIC THEY  CAN'T REACH THE HEIGHTS OF LIKE  A KOBE.  >> ONE PERSON LIKE BILL, BILL  SAW THAT.  BILL -- THERE WERE A FEW OF US  THAT SAW THAT PASSION.  THAT WORK ETHIC.  THERE WERE SOME OF US THAT SAW  HIM WHEN THEY WENT ON THE ROAD  AND HE HAD A BAD GAME ON THE  ROAD.  AND HE WOULD ASK THE ARENA TO  KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AT NIGHT  AFTER EVERYBODY LEFT SO HE  COULD GO TO THE VISITING TEAM'S  ARENA AND SHOOT.  AND THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO DO  THAT FOR HIM.  HE -- YOU KNOW, HE HAD THE IT  FACTOR.  YOU KNOW, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE  TO SPELL IT.  BUT YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE  IT.  >> AND YOU CERTAINLY HAD IT.  AND I LIKED LISTENING TO BILL  TOO TALKING ABOUT WELL, THERE  ARE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T LIKE  KOBE.  DIDN'T LIKE THAT MAYBE HE WAS  GETTING THE ATTENTION.  OR THAT HE WAS GETTING THE  BALL.  BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE  DID TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO  STEP BACK AND GIVE HIM CREDIT.  HE WAS ONLY WORKING SO HARD TO  IMPROVE HIMSELF AND THAT WAY,  HE COULD IMPROVE OTHERS AROUND  HIM.  SO WHILE YOU GOT UPSET BECAUSE  HE WAS PRACTICING LATE, HE WAS  PRACTICING LATE.  >> HE WAS PRACTICING LATE.  >> WHAT WERE YOU DOING?  >> HE WAS -- HE WAS ONE OF THE  MOST BRUTALLY HONEST PEOPLE I  HAVE EVER MET.  IF HE LIKED YOU, HE TOLD YOU.  IF HE DIDN'T LIKE YOU, HE TOLD  YOU EVEN FASTER.  THAT'S -- YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW  -- HE WOULD DO THINGS -- AND  THERE WERE OTHER TIMES HE WENT  DOWN TO SPEAK TO THE UNIVERSITY  OF ALABAMA FOOTBALL TEAM AND  THEY WERE IN AWE.  AND HE SPOKE TO THE CHARGERS  AND THEY WERE IN AWE.  HE WALKED INTO THE ROOM AND THE  CHARGERS -- ARRANGED TO HAVE  HIM COME AND SPEAK TO THEM AND  WHEN HE WALKED IN THE ROOM,  THEY WERE -- THESE ARE NFL  PLAYERS.  WHO WERE IN AWE OF HIM.  >> YOU KNOW WHAT?  WE WANT TO GO FULL CIRCLE HERE  BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT THE  FIRST TIME AND FIRST INTERVIEW.  NOW THAT WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE  OF THE LAST INTERVIEW.  WHICH WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.  TELL US ABOUT THAT INTERACTION  AND THE LAST INTERVIEW WITH  KOBE BRYANT.  >> ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO.  WE WERE AT LAFC.  AND THE SOCCER TEAM OVER THERE.  AND HE IS AN INVESTOR IN THE  SPORTS DRINK.  AND WHEN YOU HAVE KOBE BRYANT  OBVIOUS YOUR TEAM, IT'S AN  INSTANT WINNER AND KOBE IS A --  HE'S A VERY, VERY SMART SAVVY  BUSINESSMAN.  AND SO WE WENT OVER THERE AND I  I TOLD HIM I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT  IF YOU DIDN'T PLAY BASKETBALL  YOU WOULD HAVE PLAYED SOCCER.  HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE  DOES THIS WITH HIS DAUGHTERS.  AND THEN WE WENT OFF AND WE GOT  READY VIDEO THE INTERVIEW WITH  HIM AFTERWARDS AND JUST BEFORE  HE WALKED AWAY AND GOT IN THE  CAR AND DROVE AWAY FROM LAFC  OVER BY THE COLISEUM, THIS IS  THE LAST INTERVIEW WITH KOBE  BRYANT.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT  YOU KNOWS THAT IF YOU HADN'T  BEEN A HALL OF FAME PLAYER,  YOU'D BE A GREAT SOCCER PLAYER  AS WELL.  YOU LOVE THIS SPORT.  >> WELL I DO LOVE IT.  I MEAN YOU KNOW GROWING UP IN  ITALY.  THAT WAS A PRIMARY SPORT.  WHEN I FIRST MOVED OVER THERE  IT WAS YOU KNOW BASKETBALL WAS  AN AFTERTHOUGHT.  SO YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE A  RELIGION.  YOU HAD TO PLAY SOCCER EVERY  DAY.  >> YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ONE  WHO'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE YOUNG  PLAYER AND THEIR HEALTH.  >> IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.  IT'S ALL EDUCATION.  ALL RIGHT?  IF WE ARE LOOKING AT THE YOUTH  AND WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR  THEM ARE TWO THINGS.  IT'S EDUCATION AND INSPIRATION.  ALL RIGHT AND WE HAVE TO  PROVIDE THE TWO THINGS.  THE PARTNERSHIP WITH MLS WE'RE  LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THAT  AND EDUCATING THEM ON WHAT IT  MEANS TO BE HEALTHY.  BUT IT MEANS TO BE ACTIVE.  WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HEALTHY AND  ACTIVE.  AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE A FUN  PARTNERSHIP.  >> AS FAR AS THE LAKERS  CONCERNED, THEY'RE PLAYING LIKE  OGS MAN.  I MEAN THEY'RE PLAYING LIKE  THEY WANT IT.  >> ROB DID GREAT JOB ASSEMBLING  THE TEAM.  REALLY SMARTLY WITH SIZE AND  VERSATILITY AND TENACITY.  THESE ARE GUYS THAT ARE REALLY  COMPETITIVE AND THEY ALL HAVE  SOMETHING TO PROVE.  BUT THEY ALL HAVE A VERSATILE  SKILL SET.  THAT THEY BRING TO THE  BASKETBALL FLOOR.  AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING  TREMENDOUSLY WELL.  >> I'VE NOTICED WHENEVER YOU GO  TO THE GAME, LeBRON'S GAME  STEPS UP JUST A LITTLE BIT.  YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT.  >> HE'S ALWAYS PLAYING HOOT A  HI LEVEL MAN.  AND IT'S BEEN FUN TO WATCH.  I MEAN, IT'S BEEN SO MUCH  CHATTER ABOUT HIM KIND OF BEING  OVER THE HILL.  YOU KNOW, COMING AFTER LAST  SEASON.  AND YOU KNOW HE CAME INTO THE  SEASON WITH A CHIP ON HIS  SHOULDER AND CERTAINLY PLAYING  LIKE IT.  >> CONGRATULATIONS HOF.  IF THERE WAS EVER A SAFE BET IT  WAS YOU GOING INTO THE HALL OF  FAME.  >> WELL I APPRECIATE MAN.  THANK YOU.  >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?  HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SIT  AND THINK ABOUT IT?  NO.  >> NOT TOO MUCH.  YOU KNOW ME I TRY TO LOOK  FORWARD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN THAT MOMENT  COMES, CAN'T HELP BUT BECOME A  LITTLE NOSTALGIC.  >> SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?  WANT TO END WITH THIS.  THIS BOOK IS CALLED \"LEGACY AND  THE QUEEN\" AT THE BEGINNING OF  IT HE WROTE TO MY FOUR  BEAUTIFUL SPIRITED STRONG  DAUGHTERS.  WHEN YOU FIERCELY PROTECT YOUR  PASSION, NO ONE CAN EVER STEAL  YOUR DREAMS.  THAT'S WHAT I'LL ALWAYS  REMEMBER ABOUT HIM.  >> SO TRUE JIM.  AND MAYBE JUST -- SEVEN MONTHS  OLD.  ALL RIGHT, THANKS SO MUCH JIM.  WE KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT MORE  WORK TO DO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT  WANT TO TALK TO YOU.  AND GIVE THEIR CONDOLENCES AND  TRIBUTES.  SO WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU GO DO  THAT.  THANKS SO MUCH JIM HILL.  WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO MICHELLE  WHO'S IN NEWPORT BEACH AND  MICHELLE IS GOING TO BE TALKING  ABOUT ONE OF THE OTHER VICTIMS  TODAY IN THIS HORRIFIC CRASH.  ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE  BASEBALL COACH JOHN ALTOBELLI  AND HE WAS ALSO THERE I BELIEVE  WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER,  MICHELLE?  >> Reporter: PAT, THAT'S RIGHT.  WE ARE ON THE BASEBALL FIELD  HERE AT ORANGE COAST COLLEGE  BETTER KNOWN AS OCC HERE IN  ORANGE COUNTY.  AND I DO WANT TO MENTION BEFORE  WE GET TO THE COACH THE FACT  THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD THIS  HELICOPTER LIVED IN ORANGE  COUNTY.  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE LOCAL  MOTHERS.  TWO DAUGHTERS ON BOARD.  THAT IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM  ALL KINDS OF SOURCES HERE IN  ORANGE COUNTY.  MANY OF THESE PEOPLE HAD  CONNECTIONS TO NEWPORT BEACH  AND OF COURSE KOBE BRYANT AND  HIS FAMILY LIVED IN NEWPORT  COAST.  ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE  CONNECTED TO KOBE THROUGH MAMBA  BASKETBALL.  THERE WAS ALSO A DAD ON BOARD  AND THAT'S THE COACH YOU WERE   JUST MENTIONING, HIS NAME IS  JOHN ALTOBELLI.  HE'S LEGENDARY HERE AT ORANGE  COAST COLLEGE.  I'M GOING TO BRING IN HIS  ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH IN JUST A  SECOND.  BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT  COACH ALTO.  HE IS -- HE WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN  HIS 28th YEAR HERE AS A MATTER  OF FACT OPENING DAY IS THIS  COMING TUESDAY.  AND SINCE ABOUT 12:30 TODAY,  HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE JUST  SPONTANEOUSLY SHOWED UP HERE AT  THE FIELD AND WERE CALLING THIS  A FIELD OF DREAMS.  AND NATE JOHNSON HERE IS GOING  TO EXPLAIN TO US WHY AND COACH  ALTO MADE IT HAPPEN.  BUT COACH WAS ON BOARD WITH HIS  WIFE CARRIE AND HIS DAUGHTER  ALYSSA WHO PLAYS BASKETBALL.  AND I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN MORE  ABOUT THAT -- NATE, YOU KNEW  THEY TOLD YOU, THAT THEY WERE  GOING ON THIS FLIGHT TODAY.  >> YEAH, WE HAD A SCRIMMAGE  YESTERDAY.  AND HE WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT  HOW HE'S GOING ON THE CHOPPER  WITH KOBE.  SO NO DIFFERENT.  YESTERDAY HE WAS SAYING YEAH  I'M GOING ON THE CHOPPER WITH  KOBE TOMORROW MORNING AND WE'RE  GOING TO GO UP TO THOUSAND OAKS  AND WATCH A FEW GAMES.  AS SOON AS I HEARD KOBE  BRYANT'S HELICOPTER WENT DOWN I  KIND OF HAD THE IDEA THAT ALTO  WAS MORE THAN LIKELY ON BOARD  THERE.  >> OKAY SO HE TOOK OFF AS FAR  AS YOU KNOW FROM JOHN WAYNE  AIRPORT AND THEY WERE LANDING  IN CAMARILLO?  >> YEAH THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.  THEN DRIVE DOWN TO THOUSAND  OAKS FROM THERE.  >> Reporter: OKAY AND THEN FLY  BACK HERE OF COURSE AFTER THE  TOURNAMENT WAS OVER.  >> YEP.  >> Reporter: SO TELL US ABOUT  -- FIRST OF ALL, THIS FIELD.  FOR YEARS, COACH ALTO DREAMED  OF HAVING A TURF FIELD.  SO WE ARE CALLING THIS HIS  FIELD OF DREAMS.  >> YEP, YES, MA'AM.  THIS IS THE HOUSE THAT ALTO  BUILT.  HE DID IT ALL AND FUND RAISED  FOR IT ALL AND THERE WAS  NOTHING ELSE HE WANTED BUT  TURF.  I'VE BEEN HERE SEVEN YEARS AND  HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TURF FOR  SEVEN YEARS AND HE FINALLY GOT  IT DONE BEFORE THE 2018 SEASON.  AND I MEAN, IT WAS HIS DREAM.  ALL HE WANTED -- HE WANTED TO  BE LIKE ALL THE GYM COACHES  UNLOCK THE DOORS AND AS SOON AS  PRACTICE IS OVER LOCK THEM BACK  UP.  HE GOT THAT DREAM.  >> Reporter: SO THIS IS THE GUY  WHO LED HIS TEAM FOUR TIMES TO  THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP, WINNING  FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES.  LAST YEAR HE WAS NAMED NATIONAL  COACH OF THE YEAR AND AS WE  SAID HE WAS BEGINNING HIS 28th  YEAR HERE AT ORANGE COAST  COLLEGE.  AND THIS IS A UNIQUE POSITION  TO BE IN.  BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT HANGING ON  TO YOUR PLAYERS FOR DEAR LIFE  BECAUSE YOU ARE SHEPHERDING  THEM ON TO OTHER THINGS.  TO PERHAPS D-I BASEBALL AND  OTHER PLACES.  TELL ME ABOUT THAT  RELATIONSHIP.  >> THAT WAS HIS GOAL.  THAT'S WHAT HE LOVED DOING  HERE, HE WANT -- HE DIDN'T WANT  GUYS TO COME TO OCC TO PLAY FOR  OCC.  HE WANTED GUYS TO COME HERE TO  MAKE OTHER PROGRAMS.  TO MAKE CAL STATE FULLERTON'S  TEAM AND UCI AND YOU KNOW,  UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND  AUBURN AND UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS  AND UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON.  I MEAN WE'VE SENT GUYS ALL OVER  THE PLACE AND THAT'S WHAT HE  WANTED.  THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT HIM THE  MOST JOY.  >> Reporter: OPENING DAY IS  TUESDAY, YOU WILL LIKELY TAKE  OVER THE REINS FOR YOUR BELOVED  FRIEND.  HOW ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO GET  THROUGH THIS?  >> I DON'T KNOW.  YOU KNOW, SPORTS -- IT'S JUST  CRAZY THING.  IT'S -- IT KIND OF BRINGS  EVERYONE CLOSER TOGETHER.  AND I BROUGHT EVERYONE TOGETHER  TODAY.  EVERYONE GATHERED HERE AND OUR  TEAM GATHERED HERE AND I JUST  TALKED TO THEM I SAID HEY  PRACTICE TOMORROW.  IF YOU WANT TO WE WILL.  IF YOU DON'T WE WON'T.  IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ON TUESDAY,  WE WILL.  THEY SAID WE WANT TO PRACTICE  TOMORROW AND PLAY ON TUESDAY  YOU KNOW.  AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW SPORTS  IS.  EVERYONE SAYS THAT'S THE WAY  THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED.  THAT'S THE WAY HE WOULD HAVE  WANTED IT.  >> Reporter: THANK YOU; THAT'S  NATE JOHNSON THE ASSOCIATE HEAD  COACH HERE AT ORANGE COAST  COLLEGE.  AND ONE OTHER THING THAT'S  ESPECIALLY POIGNANT HERE TODAY,  TONY ALTOBELLI IS THE BROTHER  OF JOHN.  OF COACH ALTO.  AND HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF SPORTS  INFORMATION HERE AT THIS  COLLEGE.  AND WE INTERVIEWED HIM EARLIER  AND RIGHT NOW, HE IS IN HIS  OFFICE WRITING THE PRESS  RELEASE ABOUT HIS BROTHER'S  DEATH.  THAT'S THE LATEST LIVE HERE IN  COAST TAMASHA.  BACK TO YOU GUYS.  >> MICHELLE THANK YOU.  CERTAINLY A DAY THAT HAS BEEN  TURNED UPSIDE DOWN FOR SO MANY  PEOPLE JEFF.  SO MUCH LOSS.  SO MUCH TRAGEDY.  AND JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAS  HAPPENED TODAY AND LOOKING BACK  ON THE LIFE CERTAINLY OF SOME  OF THE FAMILIES AND THE OTHER  VICTIMS WHO HAVE YET TO BE  IDENTIFIED.  ANOTHER PERSONAL NOTE ABOUT  KOBE, HE WAS SO GENEROUS.  IN TERMS OF JUST THE CHARITABLE  WORK THAT HE DID.  OR HIS WILLINGNESS TO HELP  NONPROFITS.  >> YEAH.  >> I WAS CO-CHAIR OF A  NONPROFIT.  AND I BELIEVE WE NEEDED LIKE  BASKETBALLS OR SOMETHING SIGNED  OR JERSEY.  AND DIDN'T YOU KNOW -- WASN'T  QUITE SURE LIKE WE'RE GOING TO  APPROACH KOBE BRYANT OR WE'RE  GOING TO GET KOBE BRYANT TO BE  INVOLVED.  AND HE JUST GENEROUSLY AND  HAPPILY GAVE US SOME ITEMS TO  AUCTION OFF.  I THINK YOU KNOW WHENEVER HE  HEARD ABOUT THINGS THAT PEOPLE  WERE DOING THAT WOULD UPLIFT  OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY  TO CELEBRATE PEOPLE THAT GAVE  SO MUCH OF THEMSELVES TO HELP  OTHERS THAT WE DON'T CELEBRATE  THE PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW  ABOUT.  HE WAS THERE TO LEND A HELPING  HAND.  AND TO LIFT THEM UP.  AND I JUST DON'T WANT THAT TO  GET LOST IN HOW WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT HIM.  AND OF COURSE WE'VE MENTIONED  IT AND JUST THE AURA OF WHO HE  WAS AND WHAT HE MEANT TO THE  GAME OF BASKETBALL.  AND TO THE CITY OF L. A. FOR  BRINGING CHAMPIONSHIPS.  BUT GOD HE WAS SO MUCH MORE  THAN THAT.  AND TO WATCH HIM GROW INTO THAT  ROLE, THAT'S -- THAT'S JUST  AMAZING.  IT'S JUST AMAZING AND MAKES IT  EVEN SO MUCH MORE -- SO MUCH  MORE SAD.  >> WELL, FOR OUR VIEWERS THAT  MAY WONDER WHEN IS THE NEXT  TIME THE LAKERS PLAY, IT'S  GOING TO BE ON TUESDAY.  IT WILL BE AT THE SAMEMENTS  CENTER AGAINST THE CLIPPERS.  AND THAT'S A LIVE LOOK AT THE  STAPLES CENTER.  OF COURSE THE GRAMMY'S GOING ON  INSIDE BUT OUTSIDE A DIFFERENT  TRIBUTE IS GOING ON.  NOT TO MUSIC, BUT TO KOBE  BRYANT.  LESLIE MARINE IS THERE WITH THE  LOOK AT THE VERY LATEST FROM  THE STAPLES CENTER AND LOS  ANGELES LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE  STREET.  LESLIE?  >> Reporter: YEAH, AND I WILL  TELL YOU THERE'S SOME PEOPLE  THAT HAVE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS  AND JUST WANT THE BASK IN THE  EXPERIENCE.  THEY TELL ME THEY DIDN'T KNOW  WHERE ELSE TO GO BUT OF COURSE  KOBE'S SECOND HOME STAPLES  CENTER.  JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HERE.  IF YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK -- YEAH.  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHANTING ALL  DAY.  KOBE, MVP.  AND JUST WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.  I DO WANT TO TALK TO A FAMILY  THOUGH RIGHT HERE.  THIS IS MAURICE OWE.  WHAT DOES HE MEAN TO YOU?  >> HE'S ONE OF MY IDOLS.  I GREW UP WATCHING HIM PLAY  BALL.  THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY.  KOBE AND VANESSA, SORRY, OUR  CONDOLENCES TO ALL YOU GUYS.  >> Reporter: I HOPE THAT THEY  CAN STILL HEAR US IS WHEN HE  ACTUALLY POINTED AT YOU DURING  A PARADE.  >> YES, KOBE BRYANT DID  ACTUALLY POINT AT US.  ME AND MY FAMILY.  SAYING HOLDING THE TROPHY  POINTING TO YOU AND HITTING HIS  CHEST.  THAT'S WHAT KOBE DID.  ALWAYS TRYING TO HIT HIS CHEST.  BLACK MAMBA MENTALITY.  >> Reporter: YOU CAN HEAR THE  PEOPLE HAVE SO MUCH LOVE FOR  KOBE BRYANT.  I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE MARQUEES  THOUGH.  TAKE A LOOK, YOU CAN SEE THE  RITZ-CARLTON BEHIND US THERE.  THEY HAVE THE LARGE IN LOVING  MEMORY OF KOBE BRYANT POSTED UP  THERE.  I WOULD SAY THERE ARE HUNDREDS  OF PEOPLE HERE AND DIFFERENT  MEMORIALS.  SPREAD OUT THROUGH L. A. LIVE  RIGHT NOW.  PEOPLE JUST WANT TO BE HERE.  THIS FAMILY IN FACT HAS BEEN  HERE FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS AND  THEY SAY THEY DON'T WANT THE  LEAVE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHERE  ELSE THEY CAN MOURN AND THIS IS  REALLY HELPING THEM WITH THE  MOURNING PROCESS REALLY.  BEING WITH OTHER LAKER FANS AND  YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE ARE JUST  DECKED OUT IN PURPLE AND GOLD.  AND I WILL TELL YOU IT'S REALLY  INTERESTING, BECAUSE THE  GRAMMY'S ARE HAPPENING TONIGHT  AND EITHER YOU ARE SEEING  PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPER DRESSED  UP GOING TO THE GRAMMY'S OR YOU  ARE SEEING PEOPLE IN THEIR  LAKER GEAR IN THEIR KOBE'S  JERSEYS.  AND EVERYONE IS JUST OUT HERE  SUPPORTING AND HONESTLY THERE'S  SO MUCH LOVE IN THE AREA.  PEOPLE HAVE COME DOWN HERE FOR  CHAMPIONSHIP WINS AND THEY'VE  CAME DOWN HERE WHEN KOBE  RETIRED.  AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HOPEFUL  OBVIOUSLY THAT THE LAKERS CAN  CONTINUE WITH KOBE'S LEGACY.  FOR NOW YOU GUYS BACK TO YOU.  >> ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT  LESLIE.  >> YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN  SOMETHING TO SEE WHAT HAS  HAPPENED AT THE CRASH SITE IN  CALABASAS.  WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF REPORTERS  THERE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING  AND THE AFTERNOON AND INTO THE  EVENING.  AND THERE'S A MEMORIAL THERE AS  WELL.  AT THE CRASH SITE.  JUST OFF OF LAS VIRGINS.  >> AND OUR CHRIS HOME STROMB IS  THERE NOW AND IT'S GOT TO BE --  DARK AT THIS TIME I WOULD THINK  IF NOT IT'S CLOSE TO IT.  BUT I IMAGINE STILL SO MANY  PEOPLE THERE CHRIS AS WELL AS  LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OF COURSE  THE INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL  TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW THIS  HELICOPTER WENT DOWN.  CHRIS?  >> Reporter: YEAH, THAT'S  RIGHT.  STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS OUT  HERE AS TO WHAT HAPPENED AND  YOU ARE RIGHT.  IT IS GETTING DARK RIGHT NOW.  BUT YOU KNOW, FANS ARE STILL  COMING HERE AND FANS HAVE BEEN  HERE OUT HERE ALL DAY BECAUSE  THIS IS A HEART-BREAKING STORY  AND THIS IS A MAN WHO MADE SO  MANY PEOPLE SO HAPPY FOR SO  LONG.  WELL LET ME TALK TO YOU A  LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE  INVESTIGATION.  RIGHT NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY ZOOM  IN YOU CAN STILL SEE A LITTLE  BIT OF THE CRASH SITE.  YOU CAN STILL SEE SMOKE HOURS  LATER COMING FROM WHERE THE  HELICOPTER IS.  AND I BELIEVE THERE'S STILL  INVESTIGATORS OUT THERE WORKING  INTO THE NIGHT TRYING TO FIGURE  OUT WHAT CAUSED THIS HELICOPTER  OF NINE PEOPLE ON BOARD TO  CRASH.  BUT IF YOU ZOOM OUT A LITTLE  BIT IF YOU LOOK ALONG THE LINE,  THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF FANS OUT  HERE WHO ARE PAYING THEIR  RESPECTS TO KOBE BRYANT.  THE GOAT FOR MANY PEOPLE HERE  IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  AND IT'S ALSO AMAZING TO SEE  ALL THE LOVE FROM THE STAPLES  CENTER AND DOWN TO ORANGE  COUNTY AND UP HERE TO CALABASAS  AND I WANT TO BRING INTO THE  CAMERA ARMANDO.  HE ACTUALLY CAME FROM WEST KOA  VEENA THIS MORNING.  TOOK YOU AN HOUR AND A HALF TO  COME UP HERE.  TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  YOU KNOW, YOUR REACTION WHEN  YOU HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED  THIS MORNING.  >> MAN, I WAS -- I WAS VERY  SHOCKED.  IT FELT SO SURREAL.  I FELT LIKE I HAVE KNOWN THIS  MAN MY WHOLE LIFE.  WATCHED HIM GROWING UP AND I  MEAN I KNOW HE WASN'T PLAYING  ANYMORE BUT STILL FOLLOWED HIM  ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ANY OUTING  IN THE PUBLIC HE HAD I WOULD  GO.  SUCH A BIG PART OF LOS ANGELES  IT WAS CRAZY.  >> Reporter: YOU ARE  REPRESENTING HIM WITH THE  NUMBER 24 JERSEY.  A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT HERE  WEARING THE BLACK AND GOLD AND  PURPLE AND BOLD AS WELL.  SO SEEING ALL OF FANS OUT HERE  AS WELL, WHO HAVE DROVE -- WHO  CAME FROM SO FAR AWAY, WHAT IS  IT LIKE TO HAVE THAT  CAMARADERIE WITH THE OTHER  PEOPLE?  >> I JUST FEEL LIKE WE ALL  SHARE THE SAME LOVE FOR THE  LAKERS, FOR KOBE AND I MEAN  KOBE BECAME A PART OF OUR HOME.  IT WAS ALMOST LIKE EVERY NIGHT  WE WOULD GO HOME AND JUST WATCH  THE LAKERS WHEN HE WAS ON.  SOMETHING YOU COULDN'T MISS.  NEVER KNEW WHAT YOU WOULD GET  WITH HIM.  HE WAS SCORING 40 OR EITHER  WINNING FIVE CHAMPIONSHIPS.  >> Reporter: HE WAS AMAZING FOR  SURE.  TRULY TALENTED AND WE TALK  ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW GREAT HE WAS  HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT  AROUND THE WORLD, THIS IS NEWS,  THIS IS A TRAGEDY THAT'S  AFFECTING PEOPLE FROM AROUND  THE WORLD.  >> OH DEFINITELY.  I WAS ACTUALLY TELLING MY  FRIEND IT'S CRAZY HOW THIS MAN  LITERALLY YOU WERE ABLE TO HEAR  ACROSS THE WORLD I MEAN NEM AR  HAD A GAME TODAY IN FRANCE AND  HE SHOWED HIS RESPECTS TO KOA  BOW DURING THE GAME AFTER HE  SCORED A GOAL.  NOT JUST LOS ANGELES, IT'S  WORLD WIDE.  WE'RE ALL HURTING.  >> Reporter: WHERE GO YOU GO  FROM HERE?  >> MAN JUST GOING WAIT FOR THE  NEWS OF THE MEMORIAL AND NOW I  HOPE THE LAKERS CAN HONOR HIM  WITH AL CHAMPIONSHIP THIS YEAR.  IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO.  >> Reporter: THANK YOU SO MUCH.  SO ARMANDO JUST ONE OF  THOUSANDS PROBABLY MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE  MOURNING WHO ARE TRULY  HEARTBROKEN BY THIS NEWS THAT  HAPPENED.  YOU KNOW, WE HEAR ABOUT KOBE  BRYANT BUT ALSO YOU CAN'T  FORGET ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER OR  THE OTHER EIGHT PEOPLE ON  BOARD.  BUT OUT HERE IN CALABASAS YOU  DEFINITELY FEEL IT.  DEFINITELY A LOT OF HEARTBREAKS  OUT HERE.  AND YOU KNOW, CREWS  INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL OUT ON  THE MOUNTAIN INTO THE NIGHT  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT  HAPPENED.  HOURS LATER.  SEVERAL HOURS LATER, STILL  SMOKE COMING FROM THIS CRASH  SITE.  I MEAN, PAT AND JEFF, IT  DEFINITELY IS HEART-BREAKING TO  SEE ALL THIS.  BUT YOU KNOW, THE LOVE AND  SUPPORT I HOPE THAT HELPS HIS  FAMILY AND HIS LOVED ONES JUST  KIND OF GET THROUGH THIS  PROCESS TOGETHER.  BECAUSE YOU KNOW, DEFINITELY  GOING TO BE A LOT BUT I'M NOT  SURE IF YOU GUYS CAN SEE THIS.  MAYBE YOU CAN SEE SOME LIGHTS  UP THERE OF INVESTIGATORS  TRYING TO YOU KNOW DO WHAT THEY  CAN.  THE CORONER IS GOING TO BE  CALLED OUT HERE AS WELL.  TO YOU KNOW POSITIVELY IDENTIFY  YOU KNOW, THESE OTHER EIGHT,  SEVEN BODIES.  >> YOU KNOW, CHRIS I WANTED TO  ASK YOU.  SINCE YOU ARE ON THE SCENE  THERE, IF THERE'S BEEN ANY WORD  ABOUT THE CONDITIONS AT THE  TIME OF THIS CRASH.  WE UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE LAW  ENFORCEMENT HELICOPTERS WERE  GROUNDED BECAUSE OF THE FOGGY  CONDITIONS.  HAS THERE BEEN ANY WORD ABOUT  IF THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THIS?  >> Reporter: YEAH, YOU KNOW,  THAT'S A BIG QUESTION OUT HERE.  AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT  ACTUALLY CAUSED THE CRASH.  THAT'S STILL UNKNOWN BUT I  ACTUALLY SPOKE TO A MAN WHO WAS  WALKING HIS DOG AT 9:46 THIS  MORNING.  OR 9:56 THIS MORNING WHEN HE  HEARD -- HE HEARD THE  HELICOPTER FLY OVER.  ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE HEARD A  LOUD BOOM.  HIT THE MOUNTAINSIDE.  YOU KNOW, HE CALLED THE  SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND LET  THEM KNOW.  HE -- I ASKED HIM WHAT THE  CONDITIONS WERE LIKE AND HE  SAYS CONDITIONS WERE AWFUL.  IT WAS -- THERE WAS HEAVY FOG  IN THIS AREA.  THIS WAS EARLY IN THE MORNING.  AND HE SAID IT WAS OVERCAST.  AND YOU KNOW, AND YOU IMAGINE  YOU ARE FLYING IN THE AREA I  MEAN IT DEFINITELY MAKES IT  HARD TO SEE BUT WHETHER OR NOT  THAT CAUSED THE ACTUAL CRASH  STILL TOO SOON TO TELL.  BUT THE GUY JUST TALKING TO HIM  HE WAS ACTUALLY WORKING WITH L.  A. COUNTY FIRE AS WELL AND THEY  WERE HELPING HIM OR HE WAS  ACTUALLY HELPING THEM LOCATE  WHERE THE FIRE WAS BECAUSE OF  THE HEAVY FOG.  ONCE HE FOUND OUT WHO IT WAS,  YOU KNOW DEFINITELY HARD TO  HEAR FOR HIM FOR SURE.  >> SURE IT WAS TOO CHRIS.  WE UNDERSTAND WE KNOW THE  CORONER IS OUT THERE.  AND WILL BE OF COURSE UNTIL  THEY HAVE THE BODIES  NOTIFICATION OF THE FAMILIES.  BEFORE THEY TRANSPORT THE  BODIES.  AS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING,  CHRIS, WE'VE BEEN SHOWING  PICTURES FROM YOU KNOW,  DIFFERENT POINTS OF REFERENCE  AROUND L. A. AND THE FERRIS  WHEEL AT SANTA MONICA.  THE PYLONS AT L. A. X. LIT UP  IN PURPLE AND GOLD.  BUT YOU KNOW JEFF AND I WERE  JUST TALKING AND READING SOME  INFORMATION ABILITY THE WEATHER  WAS SO BAD THIS MORNING.  THAT EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT  HELICOPTERS SOME CHOPPERS WERE  -- THEY WERE GROUNDED.  THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO TAKE TO  THE SKIES.  >> WE DO KNOW THAT THAT  ORIGINATED FROM THE LONG BEACH  -- OR THE JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT  AREA IN ORANGE COUNTY.  AND THEN FROM CAMARILLO DRIVE  TO THE MAMBA SPORTS COMPLEX IN  THOUSAND OAKS.  AND SO WE HAD REPORTS THAT THEY  HAD TO CIRCLE IN ORDER FOR THE  WEATHER TO CLEAR AT SOME POINT  IN TIME.  SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR OR THE  SOURCE OF THE CRASH BUT  SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT  BECAUSE THIS WAS HEAVY FOG AT  LEAST AT SOME POINTS THIS  MORNING.  >> YEAH.  CHRIS, HAVE YOU HEARD ANY MORE  INFORMATION?  I'M SURE YOU HAVE HEARD A LOT  OF YOU KNOW, REPORTS OR I DON'T  WANT TO CALL IT GOSSIP BUT JUST  SOME YOU KNOW TRAJECTORIES  WHERE YOU ARE WITH PEOPLE  TALKING ABOUT WHAT POSSIBLY  COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND  DEFINITELY WHAT THEY SAW.  >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, IT'S --  IT'S TOO HARD TO SPECULATE OUT  HERE.  BUT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO  LIVE IN THIS AREA.  IT KEEPS GOING BACK TO WEATHER.  AND YOU KNOW, JUST TALKING  ABOUT HOW FOGGY AND YOU KNOW,  HOW BAD THE CONDITIONS WERE  THAT THEY COULDN'T REALLY SEE I  MEAN LIKE I MENTIONED THAT GUY  THAT I TALKED TO.  HE WAS WALKING HIS DOG.  HE HEARD THE CRASH BUT THEN HE  HAD NO IDEA WHERE YOU KNOW,  THAT -- THAT HELICOPTER CRASHED  INTO.  BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SEE THE FOG  LEVELS WERE SO LOW.  EVEN WHEN WE WERE DRIVING OVER  HERE EARLIER, YOU KNOW, THIS  AFTERNOON, SHORTLY AFTER NOON,  YOU KNOW THE FOG HAD LIFTED A  LITTLE BIT AND IT'S CLEAR NOW.  BUT HE'S LIKE IT WAS A  COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY YOU  KNOW, 9:00, 10:00 THIS MORNING.  >> RIGHT.  >> BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT'S  HARD AND YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,  SHERIFF'S DETECTIVES AREN'T  SAYING MUCH RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY  BECAUSE IT'S STILL TOO EARLY.  NTSB NEEDS TO COME OUT HERE AND  DO THE INVESTIGATION AS WELL.  THE FAA WILL BE OUT HERE AS  WELL.  AS YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE WORKING  INTO THE NIGHT.  SO THIS IS DEFINITELY YOU KNOW  ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE  THEY'RE TRYING TO TO BE VERY  CAREFUL AND PIECE IT ALL  TOGETHER AS FOR WHEN WE CAN  HEAR ANOTHER UPDATE, THAT'S  STILL UNKNOWN.  BUT THE LAST UPDATE WAS AROUND  2:45 THIS AFTERNOON.  AND YOU KNOW I'M SURE ONCE THE  SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT GETS MORE  INFORMATION, THEY'LL GIVE IT TO  US.  BUT RIGHT NOW, NOT WHOLE LOT AS  THEY INVESTIGATE OUT HERE.  BUT DEFINITELY A LOT OF LOVE  AND A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM THEIR  FANS AND I CAN IMAGINE THEY'LL  BE OUT HERE THROUGHOUT THE  NIGHT BECAUSE THIS WAS -- THE  MAN WAS A LEGEND AND HE MEANT A  LOT TO TEAM AND BROUGHT A LOT  OF HAPPINESS TO A LOT OF  HOUSEHOLDS FOR MANY, MANY  YEARS.  AND YOU DEFINITELY -- YOU FEEL  THAT OUT HERE.  >> CHRIS, LIVE AT THE CRASH  SITE IN CALABASAS.  PAT I WANT TO MENTION  SOMETHING.  THERE OF THE STAPLES CENTER THE  GRAMMY'S GOING ON INSIDE.  I CAN TELL YOU THEY OPENED UP  THE GRAMMY'S TONIGHT WITH A  TRIBUTE TO KOBE SAYING THIS IS  FOR KOBE TONIGHT.  >> WELL, IT'S JUST SURREAL  JEFF.  BECAUSE THE GRAMMY'S ARE GOING  ON ON THE SISTER STATION.  CBS 2. AS WE SPEAK.  BUT THIS IS THE CROWD OUTSIDE.  WHILE THE GRAMMY'S ARE GOING ON  INSIDE STAPLES CENTER AND OUR  DESMOND SHAW IS OVERHEAD IN SKY  # AT THIS HOUR GIVING US THE  PICTURES.  DESMOND, THIS IS PRETTY  INCREDIBLE AND PRETTY SURREAL.  >> YEAH.  ABSOLUTELY PAT AND JEFF.  WE ARE JUST OUTSIDE OF L. A.  LIVE HERE NEXT TO STAPLES  CENTER.  YOU CAN SEE THE THOUSANDS OF  MOURNERS IN THE PLAZA HERE.  I ZOOM IN HERE AND YOU CAN SEE  THE CANDLES THAT HAVE BEEN SET  UP.  THE INCREDIBLE MAKESHIFT  MEMORIALS WITH JERSEYS AND  ALMOST EVERYONE DOWN HERE IS  WEARING SOME SORT OF LAKERS  REGALIA RIGHT NOW.  AND YOU CAN SEE THE TRIBUTE ON  THE SCREEN HERE LET ME JUST  KIND OF IRIS DOWN SO YOU CAN  SEE MORE CLEARLY.  SORRY ABOUT THAT.  KOBE BRYANT'S IMAGE RIGHT HERE  ON THE SCREEN.  SO THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE HAS  BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT AND I'LL  ZOOM OUT AND SHOW YOU AS WELL  THE L. A. SKYLINE.  A LOT OF BUILDINGS HERE LIT UP  IN PURPLE AND YELLOW.  THESE BUILDINGS DOWN HERE I  BELIEVES THIS CALLED OCEAN VIEW  PLAZA RECENTLY OPENED.  THOSE ARE IN YELLOW AND PURPLE  AND THEN OVER HERE AT THE  INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, IS LIT UP  AS WELL.  THE U.S. BANK BUILDING.  QUITE OFTEN WE SEE THEM YOU DO  THE LEDs IN VARIOUS COLORS AND  THEY ARE IN LAKERS' COLOR THIS  IS EVENING AS WELL.  SO A MASSIVE OUTPOURING OF  EMOTION TAKING PLACE ALL OVER  THE CITY.  BUT ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE  HEART OF LOS ANGELES.  PAT AND JEFF BACK TO YOU.  >> OKAY DESMOND THANK YOU.  WE CAN KIND OF PUT THIS TO  REST.  WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT  THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THAT LAST  GAME OF KOBE BRYANT.  THEY WERE PLAYING UTAH AND THEY  WON THAT GAME 101-96 AND IT WAS  BECAUSE OF KOBE BRYANT.  HE WENT 22-0 SHOTS AND FOURTH  QUARTER ALLY ALL BECAUSE OF  KOBE AND I GUESS THE PLAYERS  THE TEAMMATES TOLD HIM WE'RE  NOT GOING PASS IT TO YOU.  YOU TAKE THE BALL AND THIS IS  YOUR LAST GAME.  AND THAT'S HOW HE ENDED HIS  CAREER.  AT THE STAPLES CENTER.  >> 60 POINTS JEFF?  >> YEAH, AND IT WAS -- AND IT  WAS -- AND THE JAZZ WERE UP  UNTIL THE FOURTH QUARTER.  LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.  THAT LAST SECOND RALLY.  >> I THINK JEFF, THEY WERE --  EVERYONE IN THAT BUILDING WAS  JUST MESMERIZED INCLUDING THE  UTAH JAZZ.  AND DID YOU -- DID YOU THINK  THAT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN?  >> I MEAN I REMEMBER WATCHING  THAT.  BECAUSE HE RETIRED IN 2016 HIS  LAST GAME AND I WAS JUST LIKE  OH, YEAH.  SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN  HERE.  SOMETHING SPECIAL IS GOING TO  HAPPEN HERE.  WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE THIS  GAME.  >> THAT WAS SUPERSPECIAL.  I MEAN FOR HIM TO TAKE OFF LIKE  THAT AGAIN IT WAS JUST AN  INCREDIBLE SIGHT TO BEHOLD.  I CAN REMEMBER THE GASPS AND  CHEERS AND SCREAMING.  I THINK THE VISITING TEAM AND  EVERYBODY IN THERE WAS JUST LET  HIM WORK.  DO HIS THING HE CERTAINLY DID.  THAT WILL -- OH.  YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH JEFF IS  JUST UNREAL TO TALK ABOUT STATS  AND THINGS OF THIS NATURE.  SO EARLY IN HIS CAREER.  BUT THIS IS -- THIS IS HOW HE'S  GOING TO BE REMEMBERED.  BY THE STATS BY THE HISTORY  THAT HE LEFT BEHIND.  SO YOUNG.  AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AS  JIM MENTIONED AND BILL  MENTIONED, HE WON'T BE ALIVE TO  SEE HIMSELF BEING INDUCTED INTO  THE BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME.  AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THOUGH, WE  HAVE TO GO BACK TO HIS FAMILY.  HIS DAUGHTERS YOU HAVE GOT  THREE SISTERS WHO LOST ONE OF  THEIR SISTERS.  AT VERY, VERY YOUNG AGES.  BUT CERTAINLY THE OLDEST WILL.  AND THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S HEART- BREAKING IN ITSELF.  >> IT IS.  >> IT REALLY IS.  >> AND OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS  GO OUT TO VANESSA HIS WIFE AND  WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH AT  THIS POINT IN TIME.  IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS  -- I HAVE A NEIGHBOR OF MINE  LIVES ACROSS THE STREET WHO'S A  LAKERS' FAN LIFELONG L. A.  RESIDENT.  AND I TEXTED HIM THIS MORNING  WHEN I GOT THE NEWS.  AND HE WAS ON THE GOLF COURSE.  HE HAD NO IDEA AT ALL.  BUT JUST TO KIND OF UNDERSCORE  HOW IMPORTANT KOBE BRYANT, HE  NEVER MET KOBE BRYANT.  HE'S A BIG FAN.  AND WHEN I TOLD HIM THE NEWS,  HE PHYSICALLY GOT ILL.  AND THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW  ABOUT HOW MUCH KOBE HAS  AFFECTED PEOPLE.  TO NOT EVEN MEET THEM BUT TO  HAVE -- TO HEAR THAT NEWS.  AND TO KNOW THAT THAT HAS  HAPPENED TO ONE OF YOUR HEROES.  HE TOLD ME THAT WAS SOMEBODY I  LOOKED UP TO AND IT WAS A HERO  OF MINE.  AND TO -- TO GET THAT REACTION  OUT OF SOMEBODY TELLS YOU SO  MUCH ABOUT HOW KOBE WAS LOVED  AND MEANT BY THIS COMMUNITY.  >> I WAS LANDING AND I HAD TO  -- WHEN I HEARD AS MY PLANE  LANDED, I CALLED MY DAUGHTER  BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THIS WOULD  AFFECT HER AND SHE WAS CRYING  UNCONTROLLABLY.  SHE PLAYED BASKETBALL AND BOY  HE WAS HER HERO ON ONE OF HER  SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES WHEN SHE WAS  ON IT, HER PROFILE PICTURE WAS  OF ALL THE TROPHIES THAT HE  WON.  AND HIM.  AND THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S JUST  HOW MUCH HE MEANT TO HER.  AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT YOUR  FRIEND.  THESE ARE PEOPLE ALL OVER THAT  I'M STILL GOING TO CALL HIM A  YOUNG MAN.  THAT LIVES THAT WERE AFFECTED  AND JUST THINK ABOUT THIS.  HIS OLDEST DAUGHTER IS 17.  KOBE CAMETO THE LAKERS WHEN HE  WAS JUST 17.  TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND ALL OF  THAT IS MIND-BOGGLING.  SO MANY THINGS THAT WILL BE  HAPPENING.  FIRST TO FIND OUT WHAT THE  INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO  UNCOVER.  THE OTHER POOR FAMILY MEMBERS  WHO DO NOT YET KNOW THE  IDENTITIES OF THEIR VICTIMS.  >> THREE MORE THAT WE'RE  UNAWARE OF THAT ARE  UNIDENTIFIED.  >> WE DON'T KNOW AT LEAST RIGHT  NOW.  I'M HOPING THE FAMILIES WILL  KNOW.  BUT THEN JEFF AS YOU JUST  MENTIONED THERE WAS GOING TO BE  LAKERS GOING TO PLAY TUESDAY  NIGHT AND PLAY THE CLIPPERS.  >> WE TALKED TO DOC RIVERS WHO  WAS EMOTIONALLY UPSET OVER THE  INFORMATION.  HE SAID A GREAT OPPONENT, KOBE,  THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT IN SPORTS.  THE TEARFUL ACCOUNT OF HIS TIME  SEPTEMBER AS A COMPETITOR.  AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING  ON TUESDAY.  THAT'S THE NEXT LAKERS GAME IS  AT THE TAPINGSS STAPLES CENTER.  >> YOU HAVE TO THINK THEY ALL  KNEW EACH OTHER AND MOST OF  THEM PROBABLY DID RUB SHOULDERS  WITH KOBE IF NOT PLAY WITH HIM.  THERE WILL BE SERVICES.  WE DON'T KNOW YET PLANS FOR  THAT.  BUT THERE WILL BE A MEMORIAL  I'M SURE OF SOME KIND.  IF THE PUBLIC INVOLVED  CERTAINLY LET YOU KNOW ABOUT  THAT BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER  FAMILIES.  THE COACHES.  THEIR FAMILIES WILL BE PLANNING  SERVICES FOR THEIR LOVED ONES  AS WELL.  >> AND FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.  >> ALWAYS SO VERY, VERY VERY  SAD.  >> NOT ONLY IS IT THE LAKERS'  NEXT GAME ON TUESDAY, BUT THE  ORANGE COAST BASEBALL TEAM AND  COACH ALTO WHICH THEY JUST LOST  IN THIS CRASH THEY HAVE THEIR  OWNING DAY ON TUESDAY.  AND WE TALKED ABOUT WHO THEY  CALLED COACH ALTO.  SO YOU KNOW, EMOTIONALLY AND  THAT WAS THEIR -- EMBRACE OF  HIM AND THE TEAM AND JOHN  ALTOBELLI IS GOING TO BE NOT --  YOU KNOW, NOT BE THE HEAD COACH  FOR OPENING DAY FOR THE FIRST  TIME IN A NUMBER OF YEARS.  STILL GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH  THE OPENING GAME BECAUSE THAT'S  WHAT THE PLAYERS WANT.  >> BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO.  THAT'S WHAT THEPLAYERS WANT.  BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S  WHAT THE COACH WOULD WANT.  YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST THINKING  EARLIER TONIGHT TOO JEFF, WE  HAVE HEARD FROM SOME COACHES  AND THERE ARE SO MANY THAT HAVE  YET I BELIEVE TO WEIGH IN.  OR AT LEAST THAT WE HAVE HEARD  ABOUT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE ON  SOCIAL MEDIA.  BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE  PHIL JACKSON, WHEN IT COMES  THAT MIND.  WASN'T MIKE BROWN COACH FOR A  MOMENT?  AND KOBE BRYANT PLAYED.  THEN TONY.  >> THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE -- I  MEAN WE -- DON'T YOU THINK IT  STILL HASN'T SET IN?  A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THIS  IS SO FRESH AND HURTFUL AND NEW  I DON'T KNOW -- SOME MIGHT NOT  BE ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING.  >> THE POISE TO SPEAK.  EXACTLY.  SO AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO BE  TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS TO  COME FOR SURE BUT JUST IN THE  COMING HOURS AND DAYS AND WEEKS  AHEAD.  IT IS SURGEONLY -- JUST  DEVASTATING AND IT'S TURNED  THIS CITY UPSIDE DOWN FOR SURE.  YOU ARE STILL LOOKING AT A LIVE  PICTURE OUTSIDE L. A. LIVE.  WHERE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS  OF FANS HAVE SHOWN UP.  TO MOURN KOBE BRYANT.  >> AND WHERE THAT DESTINATION  WAS FOR KOBE BRYANT AND HIS  DAUGHTER WAS IN THOUSAND OAKS.  AT THE MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY AND  THAT'S WHERE JAKE RAINER IS  STANDING BY NOW.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US JAKE?  >> Reporter: I INTERVIEWED  SOMEONE EARLIER GUYS THAT WAS  TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS KOBE  BRYANT -- THIS NEWS ABOUT KOBE  BRYANT WAS LIKE LOSING FAMILY  MEMBER.  AND THAT KIND OF RESONATED WITH  ME BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF THE  FEELING I'M GETTING BEING OUT  HERE AT THE MAMBA SPORTS  ACADEMY.  A STEADY STREAM OF PEOPLE.  PEOPLE COMING BY ALL AFTERNOON  AND OBVIOUSLY THE SUN IS GONE  DOWN NOW.  BUT THE MEMORIAL OUTSIDE THE  FRONT DOORS HERE HAVE -- HAS  GROWN.  FLOWERS AND CANDLES AND PEOPLE  HAVE SIGNED PICTURES OF KOBE  BRYANT.  PEOPLE HAVE LEFT LETTERS FOR  HIM.  THIS WAS HIS WAY OF GETTING  BACK TO THE COMMUNITY, THIS  MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY AND WAY OF  GIVING BACK TO YOUTH  BASKETBALL.  AND EARLIER WE SPOKE WITH A  YOUNG -- A YOUNG BOY WHO  BENEFITED GREATLY FROM THE  MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY.  HE WAS OUT HERE LAST SUMMER FOR  A SPORTS CAMP AND HE ACTUALLY  GOT TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT FROM  KOBE BRYANT AND WE SPOKE TO HIM  EARLIER.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> I WAS STAR-STRUCK.  AND IT WAS AMAZING.  IT FELT LIKE I WAS IN HEAVEN.  HAVING FUN.  >> WHAT DID YOU LEARN?  >> I LEARNED THAT HOW TO GET  AFTER A DEFENDER AND LIKE --  GET OFF OF HIM.  AND STUFF.  >> HOW ARE YOU FEELING  TODAY  BUDDY?  >> SAD.  >> YEAH.  >> DEPRESSED.  >> WHAT DID KOBE MEAN TO YOU AS  A LAKERS FAN, AS A BASKETBALL  FAN?  >> HE MEANT TO ME AS MY DAD.  >> Reporter: YEAH.  THAT BOY REFERRED TO HIM AS  LIKE A FATHER FIGURE TO HIM.  WHICH IS A REMARKABLE THING FOR  HIM TO SAY ABOUT THIS MAN, KOBE  BRYANT.  AND WE -- WE HEARD FROM ANOTHER  FATHER WHO HAS A DAUGHTER HERE  AT THE MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY WHO  TOLD US THAT KOBE WAS ACTUALLY  SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY TO  COACH HIS DAUGHTER GIGI IN A  BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT.  AND THIS WAS THE END OF A TWO  DAY BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT AS A  PART OF THIS MAMBA CUP SERIES  THAT HE STARTED.  THE CHAMPIONSHIPS BEING IN  MARCH.  AND SO HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE  HERE AT 2:00 TO COACH THAT  GAME.  THIS IS SUCH A TREMENDOUS LOSS  FOR ALL OF THESE LAKERS' FANS  HERE AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE  MYSELF IT'S A TREMENDOUS LOSS  FOR ME AND ALMOST DOESN'T SEEM  REAL.  I KEEP THINKING ABOUT IT YOU  KNOW, IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM  REAL.  THE WAY HE WENT OUT HIS FINAL  GAME WE'VE BEEN TALKING AT IT  ALL DAY LONG WHERE HE DROPPED  60 POINTS ON THE JAZZ.  SORT OF YOU KNOW WILLING THAT  LAKERS TEAM BACK TO VICTORY.  AND THAT TEAM WASN'T A GREAT  TEAM.  BUT HE WENT OUT WITH A BANG AND  SORT OF REMINDED ME OF HOW  DEREK JETER PLAYED IN HIS FINAL  HOME GAME AT YANKEES STADIUM  WHERE HE HAD THE WALKOFF  SINGLE.  THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF PLAYER  HE WAS.  AND NOT A LOT OF PLAYERS CAN  HAVE THAT KIND OF FINAL GAME  LIKE THE WAY HE DID.  JUST REMARKABLE TO LISTEN TO  ALL THE STORIES OUT HERE TODAY.  REPORTING LIVE IN THOUSAND  OAKS, I'M JAKE RAINER.  KCAL 9 NEWS.  >> YEAH JEFF, FOURTH QUARTER,  HE SCORED WHAT AND HE SCORED --  >> 50 POINTS IN THE FOURTH  QUARTER.  HE SCORED 60 OVERALL.  >> YES.  >> BUT HE HAD 22-50 HE SCORED  IN THE LAST QUARTER.  >> I DON'T KNOW --  >> TO WIN THAT GAME.  >> I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL SEE  THAT AGAIN.  OUR COVERAGE OF THE DEATH OF  KOBE BRYANT WILL CONTINUE AFTER  THIS SHORT BREAK.   AND WE WILL CONTINUE AFTER THIS SHORT BREAK. >>> WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, ALL DAY LONG WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS. LAKERS LEGEND KOBE BRYANT KILLED IN A TRAGIC HELICOPTER CRASH IN CALABASAS. >> IN ALL NINE PEOPLE KILLED, INCLUDING HIS 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER GIANNA. THE STUNNING NEWS LEAVES FANS AROUND THE WORLD IN COMPLETE SHOCK. NINE PEOPLE WERE ONBOARD THE S-76 WHEN SOMETHING WENT WRONG JUST BEFORE 10:00 THIS MORNING. WE'RE TOLD THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO A TRAVEL BASKETBALL GAME WHEN THE CHOPPER WENT DOWN. >> HERE'S THE FLIGHT PATTERN OF THAT HELICOPTER MOMENTS BEFORE IT CRASHED AND CAUGHT FIRE. YOU CAN SEE IT IN THIS ANIMATION HERE. WE OBTAINED THIS FROM FLIGHTAWARE, A POPULAR SITE THAT TRACKS AIRCRAFT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. YOU CAN SEE IT GOING FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHEN IT STARTED SPINNING UNCONTROLLABLY. THAT'S WHAT THE MAP REFLECTS. OF COURSE THIS IS GOING TO BE PART OF A LARGER NTSB INVESTIGATION ON EXACTLY HOW THE AIRCRAFT WENT DOWN. >> IN ADDITION TO BRYANT AND HIS DAUGHTER, THREE MEMBERS OF ONE FAMILY DIED IN THE CRASH. JOHN WAS HEAD COACH AT ORANGE COAST COLLEGE IN COSTA MESA. HIS WIFE CARRIE AND DAUGHTER ALYSSA WERE ONBOARD. THE HUSBAND OF CHRISTINA MAUSER POSTED THAT SEE DIED. SHE WAS A BASKETBALL COACH. THAT'S WHERE KOBE'S DAUGHTER ATTENDED SCHOOL. HER HUSBAND SAYS HE AND HIS KIDS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY DEVASTATED. >> I'M JUAN FERNANDEZ. TAKING OVER NOW FOR PAT HARVEY AND JEFF VAUGHN. THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS BREAKING NEWS STORY ALL DAY LONG HERE ON KCAL 9 CBS 2 AND CBSN LOS ANGELES. OF COURSE LAKER GREAT KOBE BRYANT AND HIS DAUGHTER ALONG WITH THOSE OTHERS WE JUST MENTIONED DYING IN A HELICOPTER CRASH THIS MORNING. >> WE'RE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES NOW. THIS IS L.A. LIVE, JUST NEXT TO THE STAPLES CENTER IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LIVE PICTURE OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE NOW GATHERING. THEY'VE CREATED A KIND OF MEMORIAL HERE TO REMEMBER KOBE. THERE ARE LIVE JUMBO TRONS IN THIS AREA THAT USUALLY DEPICT ADS. THE GRAMMYS IS HAPPENING STEPS AWAY FROM WHERE THIS IS. NOW THE ELECTRONIC BILLBOARDS ARE DISPLAYING IMAGES OF KOBE BRYANT TO HONOR HIS LIFE AND LEGACY AND THIS STRIKES ME, THIS IMAGE STRIKES ME BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THINGS LIKE THIS AFTER THE LAKERS CHAMPIONSHIPS. THEY'RE CELEBRATING. LOTS OF KOBE BRYANT JERSEYS. I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS. AND IT'S JUST REALLY A SURREAL EXPERIENCE TO SEE THIS. I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEARD THIS NEWS, THEY THOUGHT THIS COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE REAL. >> INCLUDING US IN THE NEWS BUSINESS. WE RECEIVED THE NEWS KOBE BRYANT DIED IN A CRASH. IN THIS MOMENT, WE'RE CALLING IT A NEWS MOMENT, BUT STILL VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO BELIEVE. IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES FANS HAVE BEEN GATHERING SINCE THE NEWS FIRST BROKE. >> WE'VE PUSHED BACK A LITTLE BIT WHERE THE CROWD IS GATHERED. IF WE CAN PAN OVER, YOU SEE THE STREETS ARE BLOCKED OFF. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE GRAMMYS. IF YOU KEEP GOING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER, YOU SEE THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE. THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT HERE FOR THE GRAMMYS. THEY'RE HERE FOR KOBE BRYANT. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE AREA OF L.A. LIVE RIGHT NOW. MARQUEES GLOWING AROUND L.A. LIVE ALL IN LOVING MEMORY OF KOBE BRYANT. IF WE CAN GET TO SOME VIDEO FROM CHOPPER EARLIER TODAY WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE JUST HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE GATHERED AT L.A. LIVE. FANS STARTED COMING OUT TO THIS AREA ABOUT 30 MINUTES AFTER THEY LEARNED OF THE DEVASTATING NEWS OF THE PASSING OF KOBE BRYANT. WE'VE BEEN CATCHING UP WITH FANS ALL DAY. THIS IS MAKAI. HE'S 19 FROM INGLEWOOD. YOU GREW UP WATCHING HIM AND HE'S INSPIRED YOU IN YOUR OWN SPORT. >> YES. HONESTLY KOBE HAS REALLY MADE THE IMPACT THAT HONESTLY NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND. EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT. BUT THE IMPACT HE'S HAD ON ME HAS BEEN GREATLY APPRECIATED. THE FACT THAT HE JUST PASSED THIS MORNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER, GIGI, REST IN PEACE, IT WAS REALLY UNFATHOMABLE. I COULDN'T DIGEST IT. I CALLED MY MOM. SHE WAS CRYING ON THE PHONE. I WAS CRYING. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT. EVERYTHING WITH THE NEWS STILL PROVES IT. REST IN PEACE AND I LOVE HIM. >> A LOT OF FANS STILL IN SUCH DISBELIEF. WHEN YOU WENT DOWN, YOU WERE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE OTHER FANS THAT CAME DOWN TO STAPLES CENTER. WHAT WAS IT FOR YOU AND YOUR MOTHER THAT YOU GUYS SAID WE NEED TO BE AT THIS LOCATION? >> IT WAS JUST THE FACT THAT HIS ENERGY WAS LEFT HERE. HIS ENERGY HAS LANDED ON CALIFORNIA, ON L.A. HE'S HAD AN IMPACT NOT ONLY ON L.A. BUT INTERNATIONALLY. IT'S JUST HARD TO SAY GOODBYE TO SOMEONE WHO'S THAT BIG. I WOULDN'T WANT TO SAY GOODBYE TO ANYONE BIG LIKE THAT. HE MADE ME THINK HE WAS GOING TO BE IMMORTAL. HE STILL IS. HE AIN'T GONE. HE'S ALWAYS GOING -- HIS NAME IS GOING TO REIGN THROUGH L.A. >> YOU CAN FEEL THAT HERE TONIGHT. A LOT OF FANS MAY BE IN DISBELIEF BUT THEY ARE KEEPING HIS SPIRIT ALIVE. THERE WAS A LOT OF LOVE IN THE AREA OF L.A. LIVE. SO IT'S BEEN IN THIS CASE TO SEE AND TALK TO FANS THAT REALLY APPRECIATED WHAT KOBE BROUGHT TO OUR CITY. I'LL TOSS IT BACK TO YOU GUYS IN THE STUDIO. >> THANK YOU FOR THAT LIVE REPORT FROM DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. AMAZING TO SEE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GATHERED THERE. ALL THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT MAN WHO ARE PERSONAL CONNECTIONS. THEY FEEL LIKE THIS WAS THE DEG OF A MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IT, HAVING GROWN UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THIS WAS SOMEONE IN OUR HOMES AND IN OUR LIVES. SOMEONE WE LOOK TO AND SOMEBODY WE FEEL LIKE WE KNEW. >> WHEN THE TEAM WON, WE FELT LIKE WE WON. WHEN THE TEAM LOST, WE WERE JUST AS SAD. FOR A LOT OF FATHERS AND SONS AND FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS, WATCHING KOBE PLAY WAS PART OF THEIR CONNECTION AS WELL. >> THAT'S SO TRUE WITH MY DAD. WE WERE A BASKETBALL HOME. KOBE BRYANT WAS A PLAYER THAT GOT US EXCITED ABOUT THE GAME. JIM HILL IS HERE. I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT. AND SO MANY PEOPLE, CELEBRITIES FOLLOWED THIS PLAN AND FOLLOWED HIS CAREER. >> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CELEBRITIES, KOBE WAS BIGGER THAN THE BIGGEST CELEBRITIES. THERE WERE CELEBRITIES IN AWE OF KOBE BRYANT. WHEN I THINK OF THE CELEBRITIES IN AWE OF KOBE BRYANT, ONE PERSON COMES TO MIND FIRST OF ALL. HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE LAKERS GAMES WHEN THE LAKERS WERE AT HOME. HE WAS ALWAYS SITTING AT THE VISITORS END OF THE BENCH. WE ALL KNOW HIM. WE'VE ADMIRED HIM FOR A LONG TIME. HE'S A FABULOUS ACTOR. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS ON CAMERA OR ON THE PHONE. JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT KOBE'S DEATH TO JACK NICHOLSON. >> WELL, JIM, YOU KNOW, MY REACTION IS THE SAME AS ALMOST ALL OF L.A. YOU JUST SUDDENLY -- WHERE EVERYTHING WAS SOLID, THERE'S A BIG HOLE IN THE WALL. I WAS SO USED TO SEEING AND TALKING TO KOBE, IT KILLS YOU. IT'S JUST A TERRIBLE EVENT. >> WHAT WILL YOU REMEMBER THE MOST ABOUT KOBE? >> WELL, I REMEMBER JUST IN TOTALITY HOW GREAT A PLAYER HE WAS. I TEASED HIM THE FIRST TIME WE MET. IT WAS IN THE GARDEN IN NEW YORK. I OFFERED HIM A BASKETBALL AND ASKED HIM DID HE WANT ME TO AUTOGRAPH IT FOR HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS CRAZY. >> ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM WAS HE HAD A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR AS WELL. WOULD YOU AGREE? >> YEAH. OH, YEAH. HE GOT ALL THE JOKES. THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND WE ALL WILL MISS HIM AND LOVE HIM AND YOU HAD A RINGSIDE SEAT. YOU GOT TO SEE THE BEST OF THE BEST FOR A LOT OF YEARS. >> YEAH. I SAT RIGHT BEHIND HIS JUMP SHOT ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE. I CAN SEE HIM GOING UP AND I CAN TELL THE FIRST INSTANT IF IT WAS IN. >> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE HOW THEY SHOULD REMEMBER KOBE BRYANT? >> YOU KNOW, JIM, I'M NOT A GUY WHO TELLS PEOPLE WHAT TO DO. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'LL REMEMBER FROM WHEN I FIRST TALKED TO HIM AFTER THAT FIRST MEETING, HE CALLED ME ON THE PHONE AND SAID, JACK, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO DO THIS BUT THEY MADE ME ASK YOU IF I'D BE AND HE WAS DOING A DOCUMENTARY OR SOMETHING AND THAT JUST SPEAKS TO KOBE'S SENSITIVITY. HE KNOWS HE WASN'T THIS PARTICULARLY BUT JUST IN GENERAL I DON'T DO TELEVISION INTERVIEWS. >> WE ALL LIKE AND LOVE HIM. >> WE'LL THINK OF HIM ALL THE TIME. AND WE MISS HIM. HE JUST WAS ONE OF THOSE TOUCHED PEOPLE. >> AND I WANT TO THANK JACK FOR TAKING THE TIME BECAUSE I KNOW HE DOESN'T LIKE TO DO A LOT OF INTERVIEWS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THANKS, JACK. THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO ADD IS WE WERE TOLD THAT THE DALLAS MAVERICKS HAVE DECIDED THEY'RE GOING TO RETIRE THE NUMBER 24 IN HONOR OF KOBE BRYANT. I CAN IMAGINE WE'LL SEE A LOT OF TEAMS THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE REST OF THE SEASON WHO WILL BE REMEMBERING KOBE IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY, BY RETIRING THAT NUMBER. >> I THINK SOME OF THE SADDEST TRIBUTES WE'VE SEEN PLAY OUT TODAY ARE FROM COACHES AND PLAYERS. PEOPLE WHO LOOKED UP TO KOBE AS THIS TREMENDOUS ATHLETE. YOUNGER PLAYERS WHO KOBE WAS THEIR HERO. I KNOW YOU SAW THE SAME AND YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE SPORTS WORLD ABOUT THIS AND IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY SHOCKING. >> SURE IS. >> WE'LL JUST KEEP THE FAITH. >> WE'LL BE BACK AFTER THIS SHORT BREAK WITH MORE CONTINUING COVERAGE. THE SANTA MONICA PIER NOW IN PURPLE AND GOLD IN MEMORY OF KOBE BRYANT.  GOLD IN MEMORY\nOF KOBE BRYANT. NO JAGER >>> WELCOME BACK TO OUR CONTINUOUS BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE OF THE PASSING OF KOBE BRYANT AND SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS ON A HELICOPTER. >> THE NTSB IS ALSO INVESTIGATING, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS THE SOURCE AND CAUSE OF THAT CRASH. WE KNOW WE'VE HAD VERY FOGGY CONDITIONS EARLY MORNING ALONG THE COAST. SO WHETHER OR NOT WEATHER WAS A FACTOR, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL. AGAIN, ONE OF THE LAKER GREATS, ONLY 41 YEARS OLD. THE FATHER OF FOUR. PROUD DAD. PROUD HUSBAND. AND A BUSINESSMAN IN OUR COMMUNITY. DYING THIS MORNING AFTER THE HELICOPTER THAT HE WAS IN CRASHED. WE KNEW KOBE USED TO LIKE TO TRAVEL USING THAT HELICOPTER. HE'D USE IT TO GET TO GAMES AT THE STAPLES CENTER AND ALSO TO GET AROUND TOWN WHEN HE NEEDED TO. >> JIM HILL HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT IN THE PAST ABOUT HOW CERTAIN PLAYERS OF A CERTAIN MAGNITUDE HAVE THAT PRIVILEGE AFFORDED TO THEM, BEING ABLE TO FLY TO STAPLES, TO GET THERE FOR PRACTICES AND WHATNOT. OBVIOUSLY KOBE WAS A PLAYER THAT WAS REVERED BY THE TEAM. AN EXTREME PRESENCE ON THAT BASKETBALL TEAM FOR SO LONG. BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE OTHER LIVES THAT WERE LOST IN THIS CRASH. AND ALL OF THEIR FAMILIES INCLUDING SEVERAL MEMBERS OF ONE LOCAL FAMILY WHO DIED IN THIS HELICOPTER CRASH. A LOT OF YOU ARE ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM. WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND CERTAINLY WE'RE TRYING TO GET REACTION FROM FAMILY MEMBERS AND TRYING TO DO THAT RESPECTFULLY. BUT OBVIOUSLY A TREMENDOUS LOSS FOR THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA, FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE SPORTS WORLD AT LARGE. >> NINE PEOPLE WERE ONBOARD THAT HELICOPTER WHEN IT CRASHED THIS MORNING. MANY PEOPLE WONDERING OF COURSE WHY THIS HAPPENED AND OF COURSE WE'RE ALL WONDERING AS WELL. KOBE BRYANT, MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY AS WE'RE MENTIONING A SHORT TIME AGO. HE WAS A BUSINESSMAN, A WRITER, A POET. HE HAD WON AN OSCAR. >> FOR THE SHORT ANIMATED FILM. HE REALLY WAS JUST SOMEBODY PEOPLE FELT THEY HAD A PARTICULAR CONNECTION TO. I'VE GOTTEN SO MANY CALLS AND TEXTS, A LOT OF FRIENDS CRYING TODAY, FEELING LIKE THEY LOST A FAMILY MEMBER. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT. NOT ONLY WAS KOBE A MEMBER OF THE LAKERS AND THERE WERE A LOT OF FANS OF THE LAKERS IN THE L.A. AREA BUT FANS OF KOBE EVERYWHERE. SO MANY OF HIS MILESTONES ARE REMEMBER BY PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN THE L.A. AREA AND BEYOND. HIS FINAL GAME OF HIS CAREER. WHEN HE WAS DRAFTED. WINNING THE DUNK CONTEST. KOBE IS A LEGENDARY ATHLETE IN SO MANY WAYS AND HE'S SET AN EXAMPLE FOR ATHLETES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NOT ONLY TO BE THE BEST AT THEIR SPORT BUT TO PLAY THROUGH ADVERSITY. HE WAS KNOWN THROUGH PLAYING THROUGH INJURIES. HE WAS KNOWN FOR BEING EXTREMELY FOCUSED WHEN IT CAME TO HIS TRAINING AND THAT SHOWED ON THE COURT. THAT'S SET THE EXAMPLE FOR YOUNGER PLAYERS, NAMELY LeBRON JAMES WHO HAS A LOT OF THAT SAME AMBITION AND DRIVE AND FOCUS WE SAW KOBE HAVE. I THINK HE SET THE BAR FOR A GENERATION OF BASKETBALL PLAYERS. >> I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO COVER THE LAKERS WHEN THEY WERE IN THE PLAYOFF GAMES AND WHEN THEY WOULD PRACTICE, THEY ALLOW THE MEDIA TO BE THERE ON THE COURT. YOU WATCH THEM PLAY. HIS INTENSE FOCUS WAS AMAZING AND ALSO WE KEEP HEAR FROM EVERYBODY INCLUDING JACK NICHOLSON AND EVERYBODY WHO REMEMBER THEIR FIRST INTERACTIONS WITH KOBE. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY WENT BY US TO GO BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM, HE WAVED AND YOU COULD TELL HE WAS LOOKING AT US. WE WERE SO EXCITED HE WAS THERE AND WE DON'T WERE ABOUT TO SEE ONE AMAZING GAME OF BASKETBALL. JUST FOR MANY YEARS THAT I WAS ABLE TO COVER THE LAKERS, I WAS VERY PROUD TO DO THAT. >> IT'S AMAZING TO GO TO ANY NBA GAME, NO MATTER WHO'S PLAYING. IT'S AMAZING TO SEE THE TALENT OF THESE ATHLETES AND JUST THE LEVEL OF COACHING AND JUST WHAT A SPECTACLE IT IS. BUT I THINK THERE ARE FEW PLAYERS GENERATIONALLY SPEAKING, YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER WATCHING THEM PLAY. MICHAEL JORDAN. KOBE BRYANT. LeBRON JAMES. THESE ARE THE ATHLETES AT LEAST IN MY GENERATION, I FEEL LIKE I WAS HONORED TO SEE THEM PLAY. SEEING KOBE BRYANT PLAY MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO ME NOW. >> WHEN THE LAKERS WERE THE GREAT LAKERS. THEY HAD FISH ON THE TEAM. JUST AMAZING NAMES GOING BACK. OUR JIM HILL ALSO SPOKE TO JERRY WEST. WE WANT TO GO TO SOME OF THOSE MEMORIES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP DURING THAT CONVERSATION. TAKE A LISTEN. >> TO HEAR THIS NEWS THIS MORNING, FRANKLY, AT FIRST I WAS SHOCKED. AND THEN AFTER A WHILE IT REALLY SUNK IN. AND TO SEE THE TRANSFORMATION OF HIM FROM A 17-YEAR-OLD KID WHO USED TO SPEND TIME AT MY HOUSE TO ME, TO MY SON AND HIM DRIVING HIM AROUND BECAUSE HE COULDN'T DRIVE. HE COULDN'T EVEN SIGN A CONTRACT BECAUSE HE WAS TOO YOUNG. TO HIM, THE CONSTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NBA, WANTING ME TO GO TO A GYM WITH HIM TO WATCH HIM WORK OUT AND MAYBE MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO HIM. IT WAS MORE -- I REALLY FELT LIKE A SURROGATE FATHER TO HIM. AND THEN AS HIS CAREER BLOSSOMED AND HE STARTED TO ESTABLISH THIS ENORMOUS REPUTATION AS A PLAYER AND ALSO FILLED WITH ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BUT HIS CRUR IZMUON TOP OF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MOST GREAT PLAYERS DON'T HAVE. AND HE HAD IT. BUT TO WAKE UP TO THIS NEWS, THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST HORRIBLE DAYS OF OUR LIFE. I FELT LIKE I'VE LOST A SON. AND FRANKLY, NOT DOING VERY WELL. >> YOU CAN HEAR THE EMOTION IN HIS VOICE. CONSIDERED HIM A SON. >> JERRY WEST CREDITED WITH DISCOVERING KOBE BRYANT, THOUGH HE TOOK ISSUE WITH THAT, VERY HUMBLING. SOME OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN FROM PEOPLE IN THE BASKETBALL WORLD. PEOPLE WHO KNEW HOW SPECIAL KOBE BRYANT WAS. ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WAS LAKERS LEGEND KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. HE POSTED A VIDEO ON TWITTER AFTER THIS HAPPENED REACTING TO THE NEWS OF KOBE BRYANT'S DEATH. >> IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO PUT IN WORDS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE LOSS OF KOBE BRYANT. AS A YOUNG BOY, I MET HIM WHEN HE WAS 11 OR 12 YEARS OLD. I WAS FRIENDS WITH HIS DAD, JOE. WE WERE FORMER ADVERSARIES. JOE PLAYED FOR THE 76ERS. BUT HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND AND SOMEBODY I SHARED A FRIENDSHIP. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND NOW HOW THIS IS AFFECTING JOE AND HIS WIFE. SO TO KOBE'S FAMILY, I WANT TO SEND MY MOST SINCERE AND HEARTFELT REGRETS AND PRAYERS. AND MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU GUYS. KOBE WAS AN INCREDIBLE FAMILY MAN. HE LOVED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS. HE WAS INCREDIBLE ATHLETE. AND A LEADER IN A LOT OF WAYS. HE INSPIRED A WHOLE GENERATION OF YOUNG ATHLETES. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL AND COME TO THE NBA AND DO SO WELL. DOMINATING THE GAME AND BECOMING ONE OF THE BEST SCORERS THAT THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS HAS EVER SEEN. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING THERE WHEN HE SCORED HIS 81-POINT GAME AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER AS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE LEARNED AND OBSERVED IN SPORTS. KOBE, MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU ABSOLUTELY. REST IN PEACE, YOUNG MAN. THIS LOSS, IT'S JUST HARD TO COMPREHEND. GO WITH GOD. >> TOUCHING, HEARTFELT WORDS, AND BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES FROM LAKER GREAT KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. CONTINUING COVERAGE HERE CONTINUES ON KCAL 9. THE LOSS OF LAKER LEGEND KOBE BRYANT. TAKING A LIVE LOOK AT THE SANTA MONICA PIER WHERE THE FERRIS WHEEL IS NOW IN PURPLE AND GOLD IN HIS MEMORY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. MEMORY.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. NOW >>> WELCOME BACK TO OUR EXTENDED SPECIAL BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE OF THE DEATH OF KOBE BRYANT. CHRIS JOINS US FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRASH WHERE THE HELICOPTER WENT DOWN EARLIER THIS MORNING. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SCENE FOR US AND TELL US WHAT YOU'RE SEEING? >> THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING OUT HERE HEARING ALL THE FANS AND ALL THE LOVE THEY HAD FOR KOBE BRYANT. THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS PROVIDED SO MUCH ENTERTAINMENT AND SO MUCH FUN FOR THESE FAMILIES FOR YEARS. THE CRASH HAPPENED IN THIS MOUNT UNYOU SEE BEHIND ME. IT'S HARD TO SEE BECAUSE IT'S DARK OUT THERE. EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU'LL SEE INVESTIGATORS OUT HERE WITH FLASHLIGHTS. THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CAUSED THIS HELICOPTER TO CRASH INTO THIS MOUNTAINSIDE. WE'RE ALSO TOLD THE CORONER'S OFFICE WILL BE OUT HERE AS WELL. WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN. BUT IF YOU SEE IT, YOU CAN SEE FLASHLIGHTS OUT THERE WITH THE INVESTIGATORS. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FANS OUT HERE. THEY'VE BEEN OUT HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THERE'S A CHURCH IN THE CANYON. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING A PRAYER SERVICE IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES. PEOPLE WILL BE GOING INSIDE THERE TO GIVE THEIR RESPECTS TO HIM AS WELL. I WANT TO TALK TO THIS GUY HERE. FRANKIE CAME FROM WEST COVINA. HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT? >> I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND I LOOKED AT MY PHONE AND I SAW TMZ AND IT SAID KOBE BRYANT HAS BEEN IN A HELICOPTER ACCIDENT. I WAS SHOCKED. I WAS LIKE, WHAT? I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. I WAS LIKE, CLOSE BY, I CAME, AND I SAW. AND I WAS SPEECHLESS. IT MAKES ME REALIZE HOW SHORT LIFE CAN BE. YOU'RE JUST GOING ON A RIDE AND THINGS COULD JUST HAPPEN IN SECONDS. IT MAKES ME APPRECIATE MORE ABOUT LIFE AND LIKE, ENJOY LIFE TO THE FULLEST. >> OBVIOUSLY IT MAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE EMOTIONAL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I WANT TO SAY YOU'RE 22 YEARS OLD. YOU WERE BORN, KOBE WAS ALREADY SCHOOLING PEOPLE ON BASKETBALL. WHAT HAS HE MEANT FOR YOU? WHY IS HE SUCH A LIVING LEGEND FOR YOU ASIDE FROM HOW AMAZING HE WAS AS A BASKETBALL PLAYER? >> HE'S BEEN SOMEONE, LIKE, VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE I LOOKED UP TO HIM BECAUSE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO STRIVE FOR THE BEST. HE ALWAYS MOTIVATED OTHERS. FOR EXAMPLE, LeBRON JAMES. HE LOOKS UP TO HIM SO MUCH THAT HE SPOKE ABOUT HIM LIKE YESTERDAY, AND IT'S CRAZY, LIKE, SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS THE NEXT DAY. HE WAS LIKE CONGRATULATING HIM ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS, THAT HE LOOKED UP TO HIM. THIS IS VERY TRAGIC. IT'S HURTFUL AND UNBELIEVABLE AND SPEECHLESS. IT GETS YOU THINKING. >> OBVIOUSLY COMING HERE TO THE CRASH SITE WHERE IT HAPPENED, YOU COULD HAVE ALSO WENT TO THE STAPLES CENTER. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE CALABASAS? >> BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE FOR MYSELF THE SITE AND ALSO TOO THE GRAMMYS ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW. IT WAS GOING TO BE SO FULL. I WAS CLOSER TO HERE. SO I WANT TO SEE FOR MYSELF. I GOT TO SEE AND I WAS VERY SPEECHLESS. I HAVE NO WORDS. I WAS LIKE HEART BROKEN. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING. I APPRECIATE IT. STAY STRONG. THIS IS ONE OF MANY PEOPLE OUT HERE. YOU CAN HEAR IN THEIR EMOTION, HOW MUCH THIS IS HITTING THEM. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING HOW DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN? INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL INVESTIGATING. I DID SPEAK TO A MAN EARLIER TODAY. HE WAS WALKING HIS DOG WHEN THE HELICOPTER CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN. THERE WAS SO MUCH FOG, IT WAS OVERCAST. HE COULD BARELY SEE IN FRONT OF HIM. THA GIVES YOU AN IDEA HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER. HE EVEN MENTIONED HE HELICOPTER L.A. COUNTY FIRE WHEN THEY WERE OUT HERE TO LOCATE WHERE THE HELICOPTER WAS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE, THE FOG WAS SO BAD. DEFINITELY STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS. IT'S INTO THE NIGHT, SEVERAL HOURS LATER, INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL OUT HERE. HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOME ANSWERS. IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, IT WILL DEFINITELY TAKE SOME TIME. BACK TO YOU. >> FOR THE FANS THINKING ABOUT COMING OUT THERE TONIGHT, ARE OFFICIALS BLOCKING THE ROAD OR NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO COME IN AT THIS POINT? >> YEAH, THE AREA IS BLOCKED OFF AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. AND FANS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY. THEY'RE PARKING IN NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODS AND WALKING OVER HERE. IT'S DEFINITELY QUIETING DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE AS IT GETS INTO THE NIGHT. AS THE SUN GOES DOWN, IT GETS PRETTY CHILLY. A LOT OF THOSE FAMILIES WITH KIDS WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR KIDS ARE STAYING WARM. THE PRAYER SERVICE WILL BE GOING ON. A LOT OF FAMILIES WENT INSIDE THERE TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT IN THAT WAY. IT WILL LIKELY BE BLOCKED OFF FOR SOME TIME. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS STORY. WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE STILL YET TO BE ANSWERED. WE'RE GOING TO BE CHECKING IN WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND ALL OUR SOURCES HERE ON K CAL 9. FOR NOW WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.  BREAK. >> WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE. OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE LOSS OF LAKER LEGEND, KOBE BRYANT. >> WE'VE BEEN SEEING SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GATHERING TRYING TO REMEMBER KOBE AND WHAT HE MEANT TO ALL OF THEM. ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE THAT'S HAPPENING IS AT THE MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY. THAT WAS KOBE BRYANT'S TRAINING ACADEMY HE ESTABLISHED THERE. THIS WAS OFF OF RANCHO CANEJO BOULEVARD. JAKE HAS BEEN THERE LIVE FOR THE LAST COUPLE HOURS. I WANT TO ASK YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU GREW UP HERE IN L.A. AS WELL. YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT JUST LOVES L.A. SPORTS. LOVES THE LAKERS. YOUR FAMILY LOVES THE LAKERS. I WODER WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS NEWS? >> I WANTED IT TO BE FAKE. I WANTED IT TO NOT BE REAL. I WAS WAITING FOR MORE SUBSTANTIAL REPORTING TO COME THROUGH BEFORE I COULD REALLY WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT. I'M STILL IN SHOCK. IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL. IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE HAD A DARK DAY HERE IN LOS ANGELES. BUT WHAT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE TO WATCH AND I'LL STEP OUT OF THE WAY SO I CAN SHOW YOU IS JUST THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN COMING OUT HERE TO MOURN TOGETHER. I SPOKE WITH A FAN WHO WAS TALKING TO US ABOUT YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY ELSE AND A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER BUT JUST STANDING THERE TOGETHER, LOOKING AT THIS MAKESHIFT MEMORIAL THAT PEOPLE HAVE BUILT THROUGHOUT THE DAY, YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY. AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE PLACES THAT KOBE BRYANT'S PRESENCE WAS FELT IS THIS MAMBA SPORTS ACADEMY. THIS IS SORT OF A SYMBOL OF WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S KIND OF WHO HE WAS. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOLDING YOUNG MINDS AND HAVING YOUNG KIDS LOOK UP TO HIM, YOUNG KIDS LEARNING FROM HIM, THIS SORT OF MAMBA MENTALITY THAT HE'S ALWAYS CARRIED THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. AND IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WATCH HIM GROWING UP IN LOS ANGELES, WATCHING HIM WIN MULTIPLE CHAMPIONSHIPS. I'M THANKFUL I'VE BEEN ALIVE TO HAVE SEEN ALL FIVE CHAMPIONSHIPS HE'S WON. IT SORT OF MAKES UP FOR THE FACT THAT THE DODGERS HAVEN'T WON ONE SINCE 1988. IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE CAREER TO WATCH. THE WAY HE WENT OUT SCORING 60 POINTS IN HIS FINAL GAME WAS JUST THE MOST KOBE THING YOU COULD EVER THINK OF. THE GUY WAS ON HIS LAST LEG. THE TEAM WASN'T VERY GOOD. AND HE BASICALLY WILLED THEM TO VICTORY, BEATING THE UTAH JAZZ IN HIS FINAL HOME GAME. SORT OF LIKE A WALK-OFF HIT A LA DEREK JETER AND HIS FINAL AT-BAT AT YANKEE STADIUM. THERE'S ONLY A FEW PLAYERS IN THE HISTORY OF SPORTS THAT COULD DO THAT AND HE WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS. EVEN WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE ODDS WERE STACKED AGAINST HIM OR YOU THOUGHT NO WAY THE LAIRKSS COULD WIN THIS GAME, HE WOULD PROVE YOU WRONG. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. I'VE HAD MANY, MANY TALKS WITH PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS ABOUT WHO THE GREATEST BASKETBALL PLAYER IS OF ALL TIME. OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY SAYS MICHAEL JORDAN. AS A LAKERS FAN, I'M BIASED. YOU'VE GOT TO SAY KOBE. WHO DO YOU WANT WITH THE GAME ON THE LINE IN 4TH QUARTER WITH THE BALL? YOU WANT KOBE. HE HAS ICE IN HIS VEINS. HE HIT MORE GAME WINNING SHOTS THAN I CAN REMEMBER. EVEN WHEN HE MISSED THOSE GAME WINNERS, YOU STILL WANTED HIM TO HAVE THE BALL. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT HERE FROM ALL THE LAKERS FANS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. AND I KNOW SARAH, YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY. GROWING UP HERE AND JUST YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S MEANT TO THIS CITY, WHAT HE'S MEANT TO EVERYBODY AROUND HIM UNLESS YOU'VE FOLLOWED HIM THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE LIFE. >> IT'S SO TRUE, JAKE, AND ALL THOSE STORIES YOU TELL. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM SO MANY PEOPLE WHO GREW UP HERE AND WHO LOVE THE LAKERS. LAKERS ARE AN INTERESTING TEAM BECAUSE THEY HAVE FANS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, NOT JUST FROM THE L.A. AREA. KOBE HAD FANS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE. I KNOW YOU'RE A LOS ANGELES SPORTS FAN THROUGH AND THROUGH. WE APPRECIATE YOUR MEMORIES AND YOUR TAKE ON KOBE AND THE TREMENDOUS LOSS THAT WE ALL FACE NOW. WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT THIS DAY, I THINK YOU CAN AGREE, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DAY OF CELEBRATION IN LOS ANGELES. IT IS. THE GRAMMYS ARE ON RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE GATHERING IN DOWNTOWN L.A. AT THE VERY VENUE THAT KOBE SPENT SO MUCH OF HIS CAREER, STAPLES CENTER. THERE WAS THIS DARK CLOUD OVER THE EVENT BECAUSE THE NEWS BROKE HOURS BEFORE THE RED CARPET OPENED UP. >> RIGHT WHEN CELEBRITIES WERE PROBABLY GETTING READY, IN MAKEUP CHAIRS GETTING READY. THEN THEY RECEIVED THIS NEWS. WE DID TALK TO A LOT OF CELEBRITIES EARLIER TODAY. THEY WERE SO IMPACTED BY IT. YOU'RE AT SUCH A HAPPY EVENT. YOU WANT TO SMILE, HAVE A GOOD TIME BUT YOU KNOW TONIGHT A LOT OF SPEECHES AT THE GRAMMYS ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDING KOBE BRYANT IN THEIR THANKS. HE MEANT SO MUCH TO ALL OF US. WHEN HE WON, THE TEAM WON. THE CITY WAS ELECTRIC. IT WAS SO EXCITING WHEN THE LAKERS WON AND WHEN THEY DIDN'T, WE WERE JUST AS SAD BUT ALWAYS HOPEFUL NEXT SEASON, THE NEXT GAME WE'D PICK IT UP AGAIN. >> KOBE WAS THE GUY TO DO IT. WE'VE BEEN REPORTING FROM THE RED CARPET PRIOR TO THE GRAMMYS AND TALKING TO A LOT OF CELEBRITIES ABOUT THEIR REACTION TO THIS NEWS. HERE'S WHAT SOME OF THEM HAD TO SAY. >> KOBE WAS MY FRIEND. WHAT HURTS ME EVEN MORE IS TO KNOW THAT AS A DAD MYSELF, TO KNOW THAT HIS BABY WAS ON THAT HELICOPTER WITH HIM AND HE WAS HELPLESS TO HELP HER. BREAKS MY HEART. MY YOUNGEST SON IS A BASKETBALL FANATIC. AND WHEN MICHAEL JORDAN WAS STILL PLAYING, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE HIM TO MEET MICHAEL. MICHAEL AND I PLAYED GOLF TOGETHER. MEET MICHAEL. AND HE WAS SO ELATED. THEN I HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE HIM MEET KOBE. AND IT WAS A GREAT MEETING. >> I FEEL THE SADNESS OF THE CITY. I FEEL THE SADNESS IN THIS ROOM. I FEEL THE SADNESS IN MY OWN HEART BREAKING. THEN YOU'RE ALSO TALKING TO A MAN -- NO MIDDLE FOR ME. WON MY FIRST TWO GRAMMYS TODAY. BUT YET I JUST DON'T FEEL THE JOY THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN FEELING. IT'S A DIFFERENT THING NOW. IT'S JUST BITTERSWEET. HE WAS NICE. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIST GUYS WHEN \"OLD TOWN ROAD\" STARTED BREAKING, HE POSTED ONE OF THE VIDEOS TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP. HIS FAMILY, SOME OF THE KIDS CAME TO HANNAH MONTANA TAPINGS. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD FELT LIKE THEY KNEW KOBE AND HIS FAMILY. I'M A FAN. I'M A HUGE FAN. I FELT LIKE I KNEW HIM JUST A LITTLE BIT. LIKE EVERYONE, ENOUGH TO LOVE HIM. >> HIS ATTITUDE WAS WHAT WAS A GAME CHANGER AND THE WAY HE'S TOUCHED SO MANY KIDS' LIVES. I'M SURE LIL NAS X WILL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU. IT'S A MIND LIKE KOBE BRYANT'S THAT BELIEVED IN DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE. AND BELIEVED IN GOING SOMEWHERE NO ONE HAD BEEN BEFORE. >> WHEN THE DAY STARTED OFF WITH SO MUCH JOY, AND THEN I'M JUST BROKENHEARTED. AS ARE SO MANY PEOPLE. TO LOSE KOBE BRYANT AND HIS DAUGHTER AND WHOEVER ELSE WAS ON THAT HELICOPTER. IT'S JUST A DAY FOR US TO REMEMBER TO CELEBRATE LIFE EVERY DAY. SO WE'RE DANCING THE FINALE AND WE'LL BE THINKING OF HIM WHEN WE'RE DANCING. WE'LL THINK OF KOBE. HE WAS ALL ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE ARTS. >> IT'S AN UNUSUAL FEELING IN THE AIR OF COURSE TODAY. FOR ME, HEARING ABOUT KOBE THIS MORNING, I DON'T KNOW. I WAS FILLED WITH A SENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE AND JUST THE PRECIOUS GIFT OF LIFE AND HOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE'RE EVER HERE FOR AND THE IMPORTANCE AND EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS. >> WE'VE BEEN HEARING THAT A LOT. ENJOY LIFE TO THE FULLEST. LIFE IS SHORT. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THIS WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH KOBE BRYANT. >> I THINK IT'S SO INTERESTING TO SEE HOW SO MANY PEOPLE, EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT CLOSE PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH HIM, THEY SAY I KNEW HIM WELL ENOUGH TO LOVE HIM. AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN L.A. ARE FEELING THAT TONIGHT. >> BILLY RAY CYRUS SAID THAT TONIGHT. I KNEW HIM WELL ENOUGH TO LOVE HIM. THE LOSS OF A LEGEND. CONTINUING COVERAGE ON KCAL9 CONTINUES AFTER THIS BREAK. E MY ENOUGH. KCAL NEWS COMING RIGHT AFTER THIS BREAK. >>> WELCOME BACK TO OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE PASSAGE OF KOBE BRYANT. ONE OF THE PEOPLE I WAS MOST INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM WAS SHAQUILLE O'NEAL. OBVIOUSLY LONG TENURE OF SUCCESS WITH THE LAKERS, WITH KOBE BRYANT. BASICALLY THE YIN TO HIS YANG. SHAQUILLE O'NEAL TWEETED THIS. THERE ARE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS THE PAIN I'M GOING THROUGH OF LOSING MY NIECE GIGI AND KOBE BRYANT. MY CONDOLENCES GO OUT TO THE BRYANT FAMILY AND THE FAMILIES OF THE OTHER PASSENGERS ONBOARD. I'M SICK RIGHT NOW. >> IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE SHAQ IS NOT SOMEONE WE HEAR A LOT FROM AND HERE HE IS EXPRESSING HIS DEEPEST SENTIMENTS. ALSO FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TWEETED THIS: KOBE WAS A LEGEND ON THE COURT AND JUST GETTING STARTED IN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS MEANINGFUL SECOND ACT. TO LOSE GIANNA IS EVEN HEARTBREAKING TO US AS PARENTS. WE SEND LOVE AND PRAYERS TO VANESSA AND THE ENTIRE BRYANT FAMILY ON THIS UNTHINKABLE DAY. >> ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE HEARD REACTION FROM AFTER THE NEWS BROKE OF KOBE BRYANT'S DEATH WAS DOC RIVERS. DOC WAS DOING SOME PREGAME INTERVIEWS. OBVIOUSLY THE NBA WENT ON SOMEWHAT BUSINESS AS USUAL TODAY. GAMES WERE PLAYED INCLUDING THE CLIPPERS WHO HAD A GAME I BELIEVE IN ORLANDO. DOC RIVERS HAD A VERY EMOTIONAL REACTION TO THE NEWS OF KOBE BRYANT'S DEATH. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. >> LISTEN, >> [ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ] >> I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY. THE NEWS IS JUST DEVASTATING TO EVERYBODY WHO KNEW HIM, KNEW HIM A LONG TIME. YOU KNOW, HE MEANS A LOT TO ME OBVIOUSLY. HE WAS SUCH A GREAT OPPONENT, YOU KNOW. IT'S WHAT YOU WANT IN SPORTS. HE HAD THAT DNA THAT VERY FEW ATHLETES COULD EVER HAVE. TIGER WOODS AND THE MICHAEL JORDANS. IT'S FUNNY, I WAS GETTING TO KNOW HIM MORE SINCE HE RETIRED. THIS IS A TOUGH ONE. WE HAVE TO GO PLAY. THE NEWS JUST IS DEVASTATING FOR VANESSA AND HIS FAMILY. THERE'S JUST SO MANY PEOPLE HE TOUCHED. AND LOOKING AT MY YOUNG PLAYERS AND SEEING HOW EMOTIONAL THEY ARE. THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIM AND IT JUST TELLS YOU HOW FAR HIS REACH WAS. THIS IS JUST SHOCKING NEWS FOR ALL OF US. I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY. I JUST CAN'T -- I HAVE TO GO TALK TO A TEAM BEFORE A GAME AND TELL THEM TO PLAY A GAME. >> WHAT WAS YOUR LAST INTERACTION WITH KOBE LIKE? >> IT WAS GREAT. WE WERE AT A FUNCTION, THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO AND WE SAT AND TALKED FOR PROBABLY 45 MINUTES. WE ALWAYS LIKED TO REMINISCE. WE WOULD ALWAYS LAUGH AT OUR VERSIONS OF OUR LOSSES. WHEN THEY BEAT US I HAD OUR VERSION AND WE'D LAUGH AT HOW DIFFERENT WE LOOKED AT THE GAMES. THIS IS A GREAT LOSS FOR THE LEAGUE. I THOUGHT HE HAD SO MUCH MORE LEFT TO DO. AND HE WAS STARTING TO DO IT. NEVER SEEN HIM HAPPIER. SO, I DON'T KNOW. >> DID YOU FEEL BLESSED -- >> YEAH, I'M LUCKY THAT I GOT TO COACH AND COMPETE AGAINST HIM AND I FEEL FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. OBVIOUSLY HIS FAMILY. CAN'T IMAGINE. TY LOU PLAYED WITH HIM. CLIFF COACHED WITH HIM. KAWHI WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HIM. AND SO WAS PAUL GEORGE. HE MEANT A LOT OF GOOD FOR OUR LEAGUE AND ESPECIALLY THE COMPETITIVE PART OF OUR LEAGUE. SOMETIMES THINGS DON'T MAKE SENSE. THERE'S TIMES YOU SHOULD FEEL JUST -- YOU JUST FEEL SAD. AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH IT. WE WILL. WE ALL WILL. WE ALL HAVE TO BE STRONG. WE LAUGHED AND JOKED ABOUT THE MAMBA MENTALITY. WE'RE ALL GOING TO NEED IT RIGHT NOW. AND THERE'S NOBODY -- I THINK EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW IS A LAKER FAN. WE'RE ALL LAKERS TODAY. YOU FEEL FOR THAT COMMUNITY, FOR JEANIE AND EVERYBODY ELSE. I THINK PEOPLE THINK BECAUSE YOU COMPETE AGAINST PEOPLE SOMETIMES THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND YOU DON'T LIKE THEM, AND IT'S PROBABLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE. I THINK SOMETIMES THE MORE YOU COMPETE, THE MORE RESPECT YOU HAVE FOR THE OPPONENT. I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE WAY I FELT WITH KOBE. SO THAT'S ALL. I JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY. >> IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY EMOTIONAL SOUND FROM DOC RIVERS THERE, IN TEARS. FRANKLY UNCONTROLLABLY CRYING AFTER NEWS BROKE OF KOBE BRYANT'S DEATH. I JUST WANT TO SAY THERE WERE SEVERAL GAMES PLAYED IN THE NBA TODAY. SOME PEOPLE ONLINE WERE CRITICAL OF THAT. BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO CANCEL A GAME AT THE LAST MOMENT FOR MANY REASONS. BUT IT WAS A REALLY HARD DAY. AND IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WAS FOR PLAYERS TO GET OUT THERE AND PLAY TODAY. SO MANY OF THEM WERE IN TEARS. TIM DUNCAN WAS CRYING. TYSON CHANDLER WAS CRYING. AUSTIN RIVERS WAS CRYING. JUST SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE IN TEARS TODAY AND HAD TO FIND THE STRENGTH TO PLAY A BASKETBALL GAME AFTER THIS SHOCKING NEWS THAT REALLY SHOCKED THE NBA TO ITS CORE. >> AND FOR COACHES LIKE DOC RIVERS WHO HAS TO REV UP HIS TEAM, FIRE THEM UP FOR THE NEXT TEAM, THAT'S WHEN HE CHOKED UP THE MOST. HE GOES, I HAVE TO GO INTO THE LOCKER ROOM AND TALK TO THESE YOUNG GUYS AND TELL THEM WHAT'S GOING ON AND TRY TO MOTIVATE THEM TO PLAY A GOOD GAME. CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE LOSS OF A LEGEND. KOBE BRYANT. CONTINUES RIGHT AFTER THIS SHORT BREAK. STAY WITH US. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THE LOSS OF A LEGEND, KOBE BRYANT. STAY WITH US WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >>> WALK BACK TO OUR CONTINUING BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE OF THE SUDDEN DEATH OF KOBE BRYANT IN A HELICOPTER CRASH. GAMES WENT ON SCHEDULED TODAY. THAT WAS A DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR PLAYERS, COACHES, AND FOR FANS. ONE OF THE MOST I THINK PROMINENT MOMENTS WE SAW, OBVIOUSLY YOU KNEW THESE GAMES WERE GOING TO PAY TRIBUTE SOMEHOW TO KOBE BRYANT. THESE TEAMS TAKING 24-SECOND SHOT CLOCK VIOLATIONS IN HONOR OF KOBE BRYANT. BASICALLY LETTING THE CLOCK RUN THERE AND SEE THAT AND IMAGINING FOR EACH AND EVERY PLAYER, EVEN PLAYERS WHO NEVER PLAYED WITH KOBE BRYANT, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER PLAYERS AND PLAYERS OF OTHER TEAMS, HE MEANT SOMETHING TO THEM IN A WAY THAT'S PROBABLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND FOR THOSE OF US WHO DON'T PLAY IN THE NBA. THIS IS A PLAYER WHO TRANSFORMED A GENERATION OF ATHLETES, NOT JUST BASKETBALL PLAYERS. SOMEONE WHO THIS MAMBA MENTALITY, THIS IDEA THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO PERFORM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE IT INJURY, BE IT ILLNESS. THIS MAMBA MENTALITY PERMEATED BASKETBALL AND TRANSCENDED SPORTS FRANKLY. >> HE HAD A 20-YEAR CAREER WITH THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS, BRINGING THEM TO MANY CHAMPIONSHIPS THERE. THE LOSS OF KOBE BRYANT IS A LOSS TO OUR CITY, A LOSS TO THE SPORT. AND I EVEN HEARD TODAY FROM A FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE TIME I FOUND OUT, HE FOUND OUT AND HE TEXTED ME, IS IT TRUE? DID KOBE BRYANT REALLY DIE? AND I CONFIRMED THE INFORMATION FOR HIM. A LOT OF PEOPLE, THIS IS WORLDWIDE NEWS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY IT. >> SOMETHING INTERESTING TO NOTE, OBVIOUSLY KOBE BRYANT HAD JUST RETIRED A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND PLAYED ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES I THINK OF HIS CAREER IN THAT FINAL GAME BECAUSE OF WHAT A TREMENDOUS PERFORMANCE IT WAS. 60 POINTS. REALLY POIGNANT. HE WAS REALLY RELAXED THROUGHOUT THAT GAME IF I CAN REMEMBER, I THINK EVEN THE ANNOUNCERS WHO WERE CALLING THE GAME MADE NOTE OF THAT. IT WAS JUST THE PERFECT ENDING TO SUCH A TREMENDOUS CAREER THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE WATCHED. AND I THINK WHAT'S REALLY HARD ABOUT THIS NEWS, AT LEAST IN MY OPINION, IS THAT KOBE BRYANT WASN'T DONE. HE HAD RETIRED FROM THE GAME BUT HE HAD HIS HANDS IN SO MANY THINGS. WE HEARD FROM JIM HILL AND SOME OF THE REPORTING HE DID THAT HE NEVER GOT TO SEE HIMSELF MEMORIALIZED AS A STATUE. THERE WAS SO MUCH AHEAD OF HIM IN THE WAY OF ACCOLADES AND HALL OF FAME HONORS AND THINGS STILL AHEAD OF HIM. >> HE'S ONLY 41 YEARS OLD. A VERY YOUNG MAN AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL POST-SPORTS CAREER THAN MOST PEOPLE. HE WAS A BUSINESSMAN. HE WAS AN AUTHOR. HE HAD SO MUCH MORE TO DO.

WE HAVE A MANIFEST THAT ", "fvmBMQRzeo4": "this is America hey everybody welcome back to my channel my name is America thank you so much for being here today I am reviewing some vapes from head base they are cvd vapes which are going to be legal in all 50 states so if you live in a non recreational a legal state you can still be puffing on CBD which has a lot of health benefits pempek has these cool CBD vapes that help you with whatever ailment you're facing for example they have a mimosa which is the recovery like when you have a say you're hungover tropic thunder focus it's meant for like if you have important things to do errands to run if you got to be present and then the Blue Dream p.m. and that is the sleepy time one it's gonna help aid in going to sleep at night so I'm gonna give it a shot you know I love CBD it's very popular it's become mainstream because it works and so people have started to realize that now that cannabis has become more accepted and open people are very much more open minded and even you see you can see DVDs sold at the grocery store so this is a very normal way to consume hemp or cannabis it contains less than 0.3 percent THC and there needs to be a little bit of THC in there to activate the CBD fully I want to show you how these baits work that's why you're here I'm gonna start with the mimosa nice packaging right here suggested use one-two-three second puff contains a hundred to 60 puffs I don't follow the rules here's the mimosa head base and let me read it to you it says whether it's been a long workout long day or long week kick up your feet with this juicy formula to briefs ahead this is Clementine and grapefruit blend helps relax the muscles and calm the mind so relaxation and mind call me perfect all right let's do this so also as you know I say Cheers too much and I've mentioned it on my Instagram a couple of times if you follow me there but I'm trying to think of something you to say and I would they light it up but this you can't like so puff it up boom I do taste grapefruit and Clementine so it tastes good and it hits really well and this lights up if you notice when it when it when I hit it it's a half a gram and two hundred milligrams of CBD that was really tasty do I seem more like do I seem relaxed I like the taste that's good okay there's that now we're gonna try the focus I guess I feel really good like sometimes I get anxiety or like embarrassment I'm like oh my god I can't believe I just got that especially I'm shooting videos I'm like do I make any sense subedi helps cause my nerves and it can help calm your nerves to like depression anxiety it's not like a instant fix but I can tell like if I continually take CBD I feel a little uplifted compared it's it like like tough you guys like this [ __ ] tough I think I feel good I feel good I feel great let's try this one see if it does anything it's the focus I'm gonna read it to you it says it's Tropic Thunder okay hitting that afternoon wall show those last few hours of work who's boss with this concentration in inducing blend sweet and citrus flavor keep you mellow and focused so you can get [ __ ] done that's what it says on their website is this okay focus Tropic Thunder here we go light it up a bit puff it up we're trying to not say cheers pinky oh I kept it pinky out tastes like bubblegum good oh I can see that this yeah this is good I like this a lot I like it a lot sorry my dumb and Dumberer quote so these are disposable vapes once you're done with them you just toss them there's no recharging and they retail online for $35 each for half a grant which is not a bad price for CBD CBD at the drugstore is very expensive okay that was the focus tropic factor am i talking faster now like can you even sell I don't know alrighty who are here at the p.m. one I don't think it'll make me fall asleep hopefully not because I am awake it's blue dream and again half a gram 200 milligrams of hex extract is what it say let me read it to you you made it you owned another day this bleep promoting formula encourages faster and better sleep to prepare you for another vibrant day something tells me I should not be smoking this right now it is like 3 p.m. in the afternoon on the Friday and I have things to do but in the name of science and for you I'm doing this for you to see if you want to buy this because CBD is good for you and I love helping people which includes you because you're my friend so let's try this blue dream p.m. sleepy time babe from his face pinky it didn't say the flavor there did it I don't know if I can tell what it it blueberry if I smoke the focus with the PN does it make it a hybrid I feel something uplifted but not elevated do you get what I mean like I feel you know like ask if you're starving and you eat a huge meal full of nutrients you get that natural high I feel like I have a natural high without smoking weed I mean it is kind of smoking weed but it's not really and if you want best if you want to kind of smoke weed but not really with me hit up head face y'all I'm gonna put their website and info here for y'all to see if I had to say which one was my favorite flavor I would say these two are my favorite flavors the focus and the p.m. the recover mimosa was really good too but I just liked the very ones better my honest expert opinion these are actually really nifty and I like that they're color-coordinated this is dope this is like something that I think my mom or grandma would enjoy because if I'd give them any other thing to smoke they'd be scared of it you know but since its CBD and since it's like so cute I think this is the way to help my asian family become more open-minded about hemp and cannabis as a medicine instead of as a party drug or a drug in general because it's not the drug it's a plant and on that note we are checking out thank you for joining me check out my website check out my Instagram and subscribe like this video comment pikiao oh my god I'm so lame thank you bye", "KMkmFvu-ntM": "Welcome to this edition of Mission Control the mini series of videos we talked about \nthe finer details of bike setup and skills that actually make a big difference to your riding. In this edition we're going to talk about bar height and how you can adjust it using a various different ways you might see plenty of pros of various races\nyou've been to doing this. and we're going to talk you through how to do\nand why you might want to do it. So the height you set your bars are at\nactually determines where your weight sits on the bike so the lower the bars are, the more that\nweight is going to tip towards that front wheel the higher they are the more it comes\nback towards the rear wheel. So bar height is often determined by the\ndiscipline you ride. For cross country, a lower bar height is gonna put\nyou in a more aerodynamic paddling position but more importantly for that is \nto keep the weight on the front tire that's going to stop you from wheelieing\non those steepest of climbs. With cross country, you're looking for a weight\nbalance of 60/40 to the front wheel. Polar opposite to cross country is\ndownhill They have aggressive geometry due to slacker head angle and also big suspension forks and that's naturally going to put your weight further back so it's going to be really good for steep terrain and also rough terrain You're going to find more stability With downhill,\nyou wanted to have 40% of your weight over the front and the remaining 60% over the rear. Somewhere in the middle is Enduro riding\nor normal trail mountain bike. When you're looking for much more\nbalanced stance on the bike something around 50/50 front to back\nwith your weight. So you want your bar height somewhere in the middle\nto keep some weight on the front tire for climbing but not to low so that feels sketchy going downhill. So, how do you change your bar height? Well the first and easiest way to do so is probably by adjusting your stem spacers As you can see here\nI've got a couple on top and a couple down below so if we want to raise it or lower it \nI've got plenty of options. The next one which isn't that cost\neffective is to change your handlebar Nowadays there are a variety of rises for handlebars ranging from 10 all the way up to 40 mm and this is a personal preference\nI'd suggest playing around. Personally I've got 20 mm raised bars\non at the moment. You can also change the stem you will\nsee that someone got a 0 degree rise which is really neutral but these go all\nthe way up to 15 degree rise and remember if you do change your stems\nyou actually change the length this will change where your bars are relative your\nbody position. The last way to adjust your bar height\nis with your fork. Now some manufactures and\nfor these Fox 36 is i have here it actually adjust them internally to increase the travel from 140 to 180 and other models do have on the fly adjustments. You can actually lower the travel for the climb and then raise it back up\nwhen you get to the top of the descent so you can rally all the way to the bottom Aside from the discipline of riding you do so low bars for cross country\nand higher bars for downhill there a couple of other factors might determine your bar height Your own height actual make a\ndifference. So if you were 6 foot 5 you're probably going to have higher bars then someone who is 5 foot 2 because your bikes are scales up. But also a lot of it does come down to personal preference. Whilst I like quite high bars \nthey're really confidence inspiring for going downhill, I can take some weight off the front tire\nand that doesn't help in cornering. so if you're sliding the front wheel and\nwashing out all the time maybe you need slightly lower bars to\nget a bit more weight onto that front tire it does make a big difference to cornering So to summarize.\nBy adjusting your bar height you'll actually find that by lowering it you're going to get more\nfront wheel grip and will be better for climbing by raising it you're going to get more back wheel grip and you're gonna be able to descend about\nthe easier with a lot more stability Personally l'd like to keep a couple of\nstem spacers spare so if I'm going somewhere like the Alps\nthat's predominantly downhill I'll stick an extra spacer underneath and raise that bar high top but I don't care about it too much. For you want to see more videos like this you click up there for stem length explained and why not click down there for\ntop 10 beginning mistakes give thumbs up enjoyed it \nclick in the middle to subscribe and leave us some other cool comments of videos you want\nto see like this down below what was that one that you said\nif the bar is closer to you then it's easier to get a drink it's easier to drink if the bar is higher low bar I have to right reach down there for the height Good examples into weight distribution.\nBar height, I always thinks about bar height.", "T46UGoQL4sE": "first thing is we satisfy the state to have a permit to start growing which we did month ago we started growing we completed the temporary certificate of occupancy for the building that allowed us to start growing then we finish the construction of our large growing facility to look inside the building that's over the last two weeks we finished that project and it's all inspected and all approved by the building inspector and in the building department and all the components of it it's a three hundred and fifty thousand dollar room we have to serve about fifteen hundred patients a month maybe less maybe a thousand patients a month to break free keep with our expenses are expensive our table will be a very small staff our staff is dictated by the amount of investment we can get going forward about producing more province if I had the proper lab if I had a million dollars now to build a lab I could just extract the CBD from it and put it into a melt away you know like a little tad the child just put it in their mouth of a melt and their tongue they won't have a seizure that day will you accept juvenile patience sure it's under the law if we had our way we would never give anything I do think anybody to look like marijuana my goal is to not have anything in here it looks like marijuana or cannabis is not to have buds or anything like that just had pharmaceutical products but that takes investment to manufacture those products to turn this into a from a true pharmaceutical industry you don't start a pharmaceutical industry in New Jersey with like with you know a million dollars it's a unless they change the regulations which everybody now agrees was a great experiment and how it's been done and all of that well look at these success we're gonna be the second one to open for you I really think that right now my my belief is under the current regulations and the current requirements are all that the program is going to collapse I think we're I think we're doomed", "fZv_afd-qao": "you know some of our surrounding states seem to be taking a serious look at legalizing marijuana for recreational use we've heard from the candidate hon representative Riley Gavin up here I would support it obviously not having seen any set of legislation I would refrain from saying what how I would support it but I would if it was done correctly the federal government this summer did obviously not choose to make it lesser a family or lesser classification and that will be difficult I think the difficulties are you know how do you transfer this money this money is it's federal money it's federally deposited money and they don't you can't take that money and put it in a bank you have to do certain things how do you you know how do you go about it and with the federal government not making it a lower class substance it makes it difficult I am in support of it I would suggest I have visited two of the facilities here in Eastern Connecticut that distribute marijuana I have two friends that are on it for MS and they are in complete agreeance that this has made their quality of life a whole lot better it's a much less severe drug than an opioid and I just don't understand why in a correct medical setting that this can't be expanded and used for personal use in their own home as well sure right and so so one of the important points about the the act the representative I lose talking about where the federal government failed to remove marijuana as a schedule 1 drug that has ramifications down through the state so if the state decided for instance it wanted to allow recreational use of marijuana you know that's going to necessitate people growing it selling it etc and federal government could still at any time step in and choose to exercise that federal law that has a Schedule one drug so so there's a potential conflict there and and like I said I I hope I'm not going to sound like a broken record but I probably will but when you talk about federalism and seeing what other states are able to do you know we've already got a few states out there who like Colorado have been the first through the door in in legalizing this recreationally so I would before voting for recreational use in this state like to see several years of information come out of these other states before we open that door and start to deal with unintended consequences that may arise from legalizing it in that fashion you know again I want underscore that I am fully in favor of legalizing it for medical use because I think that the statistics and the information bear out that that that has positive effects and and and very few negatives but with regard to recreational I would I would want to hold off on that and and wait for some more information just to clarify poison it sounds like you you'd like the federal government to get out of get out of the way and let the states sort this out yeah for the most part you know I'm very much in favor of you know strong strong state governments and you know returning federal government to what was designed as its limited role you know federal government supposed to have specific enumerated powers and they have gone well beyond that and have now taken control over the states and areas that they shouldn't have okay if I could very briefly very briefly return I I was just making my comment in response but there have been a number of studies which I have copied from Colorado and from Washington that have shown the their statistics for decrease in crime rate once especially in Colorado they did not get the kind of windfall benefit to their budget that they were hoping for but the other benefits that you had some concerns about you have proven not to be true they it does not expand the use of medicating narcotics or other drugs it is not it's not turning more people going from marijuana into harder drugs it just it has it's being shown that it's not and it hasn't actually decreased their crime rate so I would I'd be happy to share that with both alright well I'm gonna move on to the next question is from Claire Bessette and it's to mr. Dempsey", "TDrOHLr7FkU": "mightily scirus uh... had her pictures\ntaken when she was walking out of the marijuana dispensary at sherman oaks\ncalifornia you know if because she did everything concern

bob marley fan and uh... how that always does and it's sold for\nprinceton italics system but anyway the question is should we be\nconcerned that nineteen-year-old is walking everywhere want to spend

she's\ninnocent and which is not innocent she's not nineteen if she was a smoke pot who\ncares like wise i would always in her business letter smoke pot letter dams on\na stripper pole no one cares

marijuana you looked at me you know i mean look defining the mission made and the media\nare the ones that are in the background for summer he does this whatever i don't care tide's don't have to be

"like Massachusetts Connecticut is moving forward in the process to open medical marijuana dispensaries way today's reporter Caitlin ghazi is live in the newsroom with a closer look the rules regarding medical marijuana use is similar in Connecticut to what it is here in Massachusetts in both states patients will need certification from the doctor that proves they are seriously ill or will medically benefit from the marijuana use Connecticut is however the first state to use the pharmaceutical model for their dispensaries meaning the facilities will be operated by and the drug will be licensed dispensed by licensed pharmacists on Thursday the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection announced the names and locations of their first six medical marijuana dispensaries several major cities in Connecticut including their capital city were selected for dispensary locations now here in my sweat here in Massachusetts of the 20 licenses awarded across the Commonwealth earlier

tours today and have a new ribbon cutting so let's take a tour Matt Gallagher who's the general manager of Rise Erie is going to be the one this is Matt welcome to our eyes area so Matt can you just walk us through the so we're walking in here we will check everyone's card coming through here to make sure they're medical patients right here we actually [Music] so somebody would come in here and have a consultation first yeah basically the first time you come in you do a consultation to prescribe the limit and things like that basically decide which products you're gonna be purchasing from us let's talk a little bit about the differences Matt it's not that you get a prescription from your physician in Pennsylvania that's right it's take you through the process what person needs to do before they can actually buy medical marijuana doctors prescribe products that you can buy here or if they what they normally do is defer to the dispensary so they can tell us to actually prescribe those products for the patient's set up with the right product in the right amount of the product and so I think most doctors are deferring to the dispensary in that respect and the patients have to have a medical marijuana ID card from the State Health Department all day yes yes I do or it would be a caregiver as well oh that would be someone that that couldn't come and on their own if they're homebound something like that or a child so you would have a caregiver that would come in and chop before that person okay that's right yeah now when will folks be in here I was really impressed with the waiting room they've done a very nice job and all brand-new stuff there's been a lot of renovation work going on yeah what was this building before it became rise area it was a Realty I'm real estate office our real estate office yeah a lot of work needed to be done didn't yeah so when I when I showed up here about a month or so ago it was just bars and no walls or anything like that all right won't you take us through to the dispensary oh sure what's in there this is where all the fun stuff is we got a lot of people in here right now but yeah so we have a lot of displays out here we can talk about all the different patient care specialists the different POS stations in here and this is where he purchased on the medication so take me through a little bit now what does a patient care specialist do that's different than what we saw the the pharmacist doing talk about specific products rather than general products so like testing results for each product and so you figure out which for a patient to come into this part of the dispensaries unless they have a medical marijuana and the caregiver comes in or attend the other family member like a kid [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the syringes you know what how are those use are those under the tongue [Music] misconception some folks have had about this is that they're going to actually be selling marijuana buds

old clinic was also selling to people without licenses and not checking paperwork and your card but the new clinic says they're more strict we're go check out we'll verify everything and I'm right back they say they verify cards paperwork and don't let anyone even see the marijuana until they complete the verification process they wouldn't let us in to see it and the owner says he won't even go in unless he has his paperwork I can't even get in my home planet I have to go all the way back home we have my papers and grab my card but some in the medical marijuana community are worried about

I THINK ACROSS  THE STATES WE  JUST CANNOT HAVE  A BARS, I'M NOT  SURE THAT WE  SHOULD EVEN HAVE  RESTAURANTS WITH  SEATING INDOORS,  NIGHTCLUBS,  ANYTHING THAT  GATHERS PEOPLE  INDOORS AT THIS  MOMENT IS WAY  TOO RISKY AND  HAS TO BE DIALED  BACK.  >> WHAT DO YOU  ATTRIBUTE THIS  RISE TO?  SOME PEOPLE TALK  ABOUT MEMORIAL  DAY CROWDS AND  SOME WONDER IF  IT IS PROTESTS  THAT WILL LEAD  TO MORE VIRUS  CASES, THE LACK  OF WEARING MASKS  UNIFORMLY, WHAT  DO YOU THINK IS  BEHIND IT?  >> I THINK IT IS  A COMBINATION OF  ALL OF THOSE  THINGS, IF WE  THINK ABOUT  THINGS THAT ARE  REALLY RISKY,  MOST OF THE  STATES OPENED  WHEN THEIR  UNDERLYING LEVEL  OF CASES WAS  STILL HIGH AND  THEY WEREN'T  COMING DOWN.  SO THEY DIDN'T  MEET THE WHITE  HOUSE'S  GUIDELINES FOR  OPENING UP.  THEN GATHERINGS,  ESPECIALLY  INDOOR  GATHERINGS AT  BARS AND  RESTAURANTS, ARE  PARTICULARLY  RISKY AND NONE  OF THE STATES  HAD MANDATORY  MASK LAWS AND  YOU PUT THAT  TOGETHER AND I  DO THINK THAT IS  THE COMBINATION  OF FACTORS THAT  HAS LED US TO  WHERE WE ARE  TODAY.  >> NOW WE ARE  CLOSING IN ON  ANOTHER BIG  HOLIDAY, FOURTH  OF JULY.  WHAT WOULD YOUR  MESSAGE BE TO  PEOPLE WHO ARE  CONSIDERING A  GATHERING, EVEN  ONE OUTSIDE  RIGHT NOW?  >> IF YOU ARE IN  ONE OF THESE HOT  ZONES, AND  REALLY I THINK  PEOPLE OUGHT TO  RETHINK ANY  LARGE GATHERINGS  INDOOR OR  OUTDOORS BUT OF  COURSE INDOOR  GATHERINGS ARE  VERY RISKY SO  OUTDOORS IS  BETTER.  IF YOU WANT TO  HAVE A BACKYARD  BARBECUE AND CAN  KEEP SOCIALLY  DISTANT FROM  YOUR NEIGHBORS,  I THINK THAT IS  PROBABLY OKAY.  BUT  PEOPLE SHOULD BE  WEARING A MASK  AND WE GOT TO  REALLY TRY OUR  BEST   >> LONG LINES, PEOPLE WAITING  FOR T TO REDUCE THE  LEVEL OF RISK  BECAUSE OUR  HOSPITALS ARE  GETTING PRETTY  STRETCHED ACROSS  MANY PARTS  OF THE COUNTRY.  >> WE ALSO SAW  THOSE IMAGES OF  LONG LINES AND  PEOPLE WAITING  FOR TESTING IN  SOME OF THESE  HOTSPOT STATES  AND BY THE WAY  VERY CLOSE  TOGETHER WAITING  FOR TESTING.  WHAT DO YOU MAKE  OF THAT?  >> IT IS STILL  FRUSTRATING.  MANY OF US HAVE  BEEN TALKING  ABOUT TESTING  FOR MONTHS AND  PEOPLE ARE  GETTING BORED OF  THE FACT THAT  THESE PEOPLE ARE  ALL TALKING  ABOUT TESTING  YET HERE WE ARE,  WE STILL HAVEN'T  FIGURED IT OUT  THAT PEOPLE  SHOULDN'T HAVE  TO WAIT HOURS TO  GET A SIMPLE  MEDICAL TEST   WE'VE NEEDED FOR MANY, MANY  MONTHS. SO WHEN WE HEAR FROM OUR LEADERS WE H THAT WE AS A  COUNTRY KNOW  THAT WE'VE  NEEDED FOR MANY  MANY MONTHS.  SO WHEN WE HEAR  FROM OUR LEADERS  THAT WE HAVE TOO  MANY TESTS ARE  PLENTY OF TESTS  I THINK ALL OF  THOSE LINES SHOW  US THAT WE  DON'T.  AND IT REALLY  MAKES ME NERVOUS  TO HAVE ALL  THOSE PEOPLE SO  CLOSE TOGETHER,  IT WOULD BE MUCH  BETTER IF THEY  COULD SPACE OUT.  >> THESE ARE  URGENT  DAYS FOR SURE,  THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR YOUR  TIME.  >>> OVERNIGHT  THE WASHINGTON  POST REPORTING  THAT ACCORDING  TO US  INTELLIGENCE  ASSESSMENTS  RUSSIAN BOUNTIES  ON US TROOPS IN  AFGHANISTAN  OFFERED TO  TALIBAN MILITANTS .

IT'S A PLEASURE  TO BE HERE, A  BEAUTIFUL NEW  YORK CITY AND A  BEAUTIFUL DAY,  OVER TO MY FAR  RIGHT IS KEVIN  BOONE, THE FIRST  DEPUTY  SUPERINTENDENT  OF THE NEW YORK  STATE POLICE, TO  MY IMMEDIATE  RIGHT MELISSA  DEROSA SECRETARY  TO THE GOVERNOR  AND TO MY LEFT  DR. HOWARD  ZUCKER HEALTH  COMMISSIONER FOR  THE STATE OF NEW  YORK AND TO HIS  LEFT COL.  -- FROM THE NEW  YORK STATE  POLICE.  THANK YOU FOR  BEING HERE AND I  HOPE EVERYBODY  HAD THEIR COFFEE  THIS MORNING  BECAUSE IT IS  TIME TO WAKE UP  AMERICA.  THE WHITE HOUSE  HAS BEEN IN  DENIAL ON  CORONAVIRUS FROM  THE GET-GO. AND THE FEDERAL  RESPONSE  HAS JUST BEEN  WRONG.  THAT'S NOT A  POLITICAL  STATEMENT, IF  YOU LOOK AT THE  FACTS THAT IS  EXACTLY WHAT IT  SAYS.  YOU HAVE  CORONAVIRUS  INCREASING IN 32  STATES ACROSS  THE NATION.  THE RATE  OF INCREASE IS  ONLY GETTING  WORSE.  AND A NUMBER OF  EXCUSES HAVE  BEEN MADE FOR  THIS OVER THE  PAST WEEK.  TO FURTHER THE  DENIAL, FIRST  THEY SAID WELL  IT'S BECAUSE  THEY ARE DOING  MORE TESTING AND  THAT IS WHY THE  NUMBER OF  INFECTIONS IS  GOING UP.  NOT TRUE.  BECAUSE THE  NUMBER OF  HOSPITALIZATIONS  ARE ALSO GOING  UP.  PEOPLE DON'T GO  INTO A HOSPITAL  UNLESS THEY ARE  SICK.  THAT'S A FACT.  WELL BECAUSE  THEY THINK  THEY'RE SICK.  SO IT'S NOT A  QUESTION OF THE  NUMBERS GOING UP  DUE TO TESTING,  IT'S THE NUMBER  OF  HOSPITALIZATIONS  THAT ARE GOING  UP.  SO YOU KNOW THAT  THE VIRUS IS  INCREASING.  AND THIS HAS  BEEN GETTING  WORSE, IT IS NOT  GETTING BETTER.  AND YOU LOOK AT  WHERE THE UNITED  STATES IS NOW,  GLOBALLY, EUROPE  GOT HIT FIRST,  BEFORE US, WE  DIDN'T KNOW IT  BUT THE VIRUS  MOVED FROM CHINA  TO EUROPE, CAME  TO NEW YORK FROM  EUROPE, THAT'S  WHY WE HAD A BIG  SPIKE.  BUT AMERICA NOW  IS TRAILING  EUROPE IN THE  RECOVERY FROM  CORONAVIRUS.  THE WHITE HOUSE  HAS BEEN SAYING  REOPEN FAST  BECAUSE THAT IS  GOOD FOR THE  ECONOMY.  AND WE HAVE TO  GET THE ECONOMY  GOING.  YES WE HAVE TO  GET THE ECONOMY  GOING BUT  REOPENING FAST  WAS NOT GOOD FOR  THE ECONOMY.  WHAT HAS BEEN  HAPPENING IS  WHEN THAT VIRUS  SPIKES THE MARKET GOES DOWN.  NOT UP.  THIS WAS NOT A  SMART POLICY TO  RUSH REOPENING,  IT DID NOT HELP  THE ECONOMY.  IT DID THE EXACT  OPPOSITE.  THE VOLATILITY,  THE INSTABILITY,  THE CONCERN  ABOUT THE PATH  OF THIS NATION  HAS ROILED THE  MARKETS.  AND AT THE SAME  TIME FROM THE  PUBLIC HEALTH  POINT OF VIEW  THE NUMBER OF  DEATHS IS  INCREASING.  I A JIMMY, THE  MODEL THAT THE  WHITE HOUSE  FOLLOWS, JUST  INCREASED BY  10,000 THEIR  DEATH  PREDICTIONS, THE  NUMBER OF PEOPLE  WHO WILL DIE.  WHY?  BECAUSE THEY ARE  EXTRAPOLATING  OUT FROM THE  INCREASING  INFECTIONS AND  THE INCREASE IN  HOSPITALIZATIONS. THE WHITE HOUSE  HAS BEEN SAYING  IT IS UP TO THE  STATES, IT'S UP  TO THE STATES.  BUT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T REALLY  LEAVE IT UP TO  THE STATES, THE  PRESIDENT HAS  BEEN PRESSURING  THE STATES TO  REOPEN QUICKLY.  LIBERATE THE  STATE, LIBERATE  NEW YORK,  DEMONSTRATIONS  THAT I'VE BEEN  DEALING WITH ALL  ACROSS THE STATE. PRESSURING  GOVERNORS TO  REOPEN.  THE DENIAL BY THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT OF  THE SEVERITY OF  THIS VIRUS WAS  FOLLOWED BY THE  FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT  ABANDONMENT OF  RESPONSIBILITY.  IF YOU DON'T  BELIEVE IT'S A  PROBLEM YOU  DON'T TRY TO  FIND A SOLUTION.  AND THAT IS WHAT  HAPPENED WITH  THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT AND  CORONAVIRUS.  THEY NEVER  BELIEVED IT WAS  A PROBLEM SO  THEY DIDN'T  BELIEVE THEY  NEEDED TO SOLVE  IT.  THE KEY  BAROMETER AND  ALL OF THIS HAS  BEEN TESTING.  EVERYBODY SAID  THAT FROM DAY  ONE, EVERY  FEDERAL OFFICIAL  AND EVERY STATE  OFFICIAL.  GET THE TESTING  UP, GET THE  TESTING READY.  HOW MANY TESTING  SITES ACROSS  AMERICA HAS THE  FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT SET UP AND OPERATED?  41.  WELL, IS THAT A  LOT OF HER A  LITTLE?  FOR COMPARISON,  DO YOU KNOW HOW  MANY SITES WE  HAVE IN THE  STATE OF NEW  YORK?  750.  FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT HAS  PUT UP 41 SITES.  FEMA AND HHS  THAT THEY  OPERATE.  HOW CAN THAT BE?  BECAUSE FROM DAY  ONE THEY TOLD YOU THEY DIDN'T  BELIEVE IT WAS A  PROBLEM.  THEY STARTED DAY  ONE, IT'S LIKE  THE FLU.  IF IT'S NOT A  PROBLEM YOU  DON'T TRY TO  SOLVE IT AND  THEY DIDN'T TRY  TO SOLVE IT.  AS A MATTER OF  FACT THEY'VE  BEEN ADVOCATING  FROM DAY ONE,  REOPEN THE  ECONOMY REOPEN  THE ECONOMY AND  NOW WE SEE THE  RESULT.  IT JUST PLAIN  HASN'T WORKED  AND IT HAS BEEN  A FAILURE.  WILL ROGERS,  WHEN YOU FIND  YOURSELF IN A  HOLE, STOP  DIGGING.  NOT A NEW YORK  QUOTE BUT IT'S  RIGHT.  WHERE ARE WE IN  NEW YORK?  WE'VE BEEN SMART , WE DIDN'T DO  THIS  POLITICALLY.  WE FOLLOWED THE  FACTS AND FOLLOW  THE DATA AND IT  WORKS.  WE HAVE THE  LOWEST LEVEL OF  HOSPITALIZATIONS  SINCE THIS  NIGHTMARE BEGAN,  853.  AMEN.  WE HAVE THE  LOWEST THREE DAY  AVERAGE DEATH  TOTAL, WE ARE  DOWN TO EIGHT  DEATHS YESTERDAY. WE REMEMBER THE  EIGHT IN  OUR THOUGHTS AND  PRAYERS AND WE  DON'T WANT TO  LOSE ANYONE IN  THIS STATE BUT  YOU LOOK AT  WHERE WE ARE  COMPARED TO  WHERE WE HAVE  BEEN, YOU  REMEMBER AT ONE  TIME WE HAD 800  DEATHS PER DAY.  TODAY WE HAVE  EIGHT.  WE DO MORE  TESTING THAN ANY  STATE IN THE  UNITED STATES,  WE DID 46,000  TESTS YESTERDAY  ON A SUNDAY.  AND THE  INFECTION RATE  WAS .8.  WHEN YOU ARE  BELOW .1, THAT  IS OUR GOAL.  AND .8 IS LOWER  THAN IT WAS AT  SOME POINTS LAST  WEEK.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT  ALL THE  DIFFERENT  REGIONS, THE  NUMBERS HAVE  BEEN GOOD ALL  ACROSS THE  REGION.  REGIONS THAT ARE  OPENING GOING  THROUGH PHASED  REOPENING'S, THE  NUMBERS ARE ALL  CONSTANT.  YOU LOOK AT NEW  YORK CITY AND  WITHIN NEW YORK  CITY WE STARTED  TO STUDY THE  BOROUGHS BECAUSE  THERE IS A WIDE  VARIANCE IN THE  INFECTION RATES.  THEY TEND TO BE  WORSE IN THE  OUTER BOROUGHS.  BUT YOU CAN  FOLLOW THAT DAY  BY DAY AND THAT  IS GOOD.  WE HAVE A VERY  ELABORATE  TRACING SYSTEM  SO THAT WHEN WE  FIND A POSITIVE  CASE WE TRACE IT  BACK AND THAT  HAS BEEN WORKING  VERY WELL.  BECAUSE WE HAVE  FOUND TRACED  BACK TO CLUSTERS  OF CASES,  WESTCHESTER  COUNTY  GRADUATION,  WHERE THERE WAS  A YOUNG MAN WHO  APPARENTLY CAME  UP FROM FLORIDA  AND ATTENDED A  GRADUATION THAT  GENERATED 13  CASES.  THERE IS AN  ALUMINUM FACTORY  IN MONTGOMERY  500 EMPLOYEES,  74 POSITIVES.  WASHINGTON COUNTY A SLATE QUARRY,  12 CASES THAT WE  TRACED BACK,  THIS IS ACTUALLY  GOOD NEWS, IT  MEANS THE SYSTEM  WORKS.  YOU FIND THE  POSITIVE, YOU  TRACE IT BACK,  YOU FIND THE  COMMON  DENOMINATOR AND  THAT IS HOW YOU  STOP THE SPREAD.  YOU LOOK AT OUR  CURVE COMPARED  TO THE REST OF  THE COUNTRY AND  YOU SEE THE REST  OF THE COUNTRY  IS GOING UP AND  WE ARE GOING  DOWN.  AS WE CONTINUE  TO TEST, WE  CONTINUE TO  TRACE, WE HAVE  GOOD DATA AND WE  ARE CONTINUING  ON OUR REOPENING  PLAN.  PHASE 4 IS READY  FOR WESTERN NEW  YORK, TOMORROW.  WE ARE EXCITED  ABOUT THAT.  IN NEW YORK CITY  WE HAVE  COMPLICATIONS  THAT WE ARE  STUDYING NOW.  NEW YORK CITY IS  GOING INTO PHASE  2, PHASE 3 WILL  BEGIN ON MONDAY.  BUT THERE ARE  ISSUES WE HAVE  TO THINK THROUGH. ONE IS, THE LACK  OF COMPLIANCE  WITH SOCIAL  DISTANCING IN  NEW YORK CITY.  YOU CAN SEE IT  IN PICTURES, YOU  CAN SEE IT IF  YOU WALK DOWN  THE STREET, YOU  CAN SEE THE  CROWDS IN FRONT  OF BARS AND YOU  CAN SEE THE  CROWDS ON STREET  CORNERS.  IT IS  UNDENIABLE.  THAT IS  PARTIALLY THE  RESPONSIBILITY  OF CITIZENS.  NOT TO DO IT.  IT IS ALSO THE  RESPONSIBILITY  OF THE LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS TO  ENFORCE  COMPLIANCE.  WE ASK EVERYONE  TO COMPLY, BUT  WE ASK THE LOCAL  GOVERNMENT TO  ENFORCE THE  COMPLIANCE.  AND I'VE SAID  FROM THE VERY  OUTSET OF THIS,  TO ALL THE  COUNTY  EXECUTIVES AND  ALL THE MAYORS  ACROSS THE  STATE, LOOK, THE  STATE IS MORE  THAN DOING ITS  PART.  THE  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR THE LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS,  HELP WITH  TESTING, HELP  WITH TRACING,  BUT DO THE LOCAL  COMPLIANCE OF  THESE SOCIALLY  DISTANT AND MASK  WEARING.  THAT IS A  COMPLICATION IN  NEW YORK CITY.  THE OTHER  COMPLICATION IS  THE SPREAD  ACROSS THE NATION IS ALSO  PROBLEMATIC FOR  US.  WE ARE NOT A  SEPARATE COUNTRY , NEW YORK.  SOME PEOPLE  THINK WE ARE BUT  WE ARE REALLY  NOT.  AND WE ARE NOT  AN ISLAND, RIGHT? PEOPLE FROM THE  OTHER STATES  TRAVEL TO NEW  YORK.  AND NEW YORK IS  A HUB.  IF OTHER STATES  HAVE A HIGH  INFECTION RATE,  PROBABILITY IS  THEY ARE GOING  TO WIND UP  INCREASING THE  SPREAD AND THE  INFECTION IN NEW  YORK.  WE LEARNED THAT  THE HARD WAY.  WHY DID NEW YORK  HAVE THAT BIG  SPIKE WHEN WE  STARTED?  WHY WAS NEW YORK  SO DIFFERENT  FROM EVERY OTHER  STATE?  BECAUSE THE  VIRUS CAME FROM  EUROPE.  WHEN THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT WAS  TELLING US THE  VIRUS WAS IN  CHINA IT HAD  LEFT CHINA AND  WENT TO EUROPE.  WE HAD 3 MILLION  PEOPLE COME IN  FROM EUROPE ON  FLIGHTS,  JANUARY,  FEBRUARY MARCH.  THAT IS WHERE  THE VIRUS CAME  FROM IN NEW  YORK.  LIKEWISE, WE ARE  BRINGING THE  RATE DOWN BUT  OTHER STATES IT  IS GOING UP.  PEOPLE GET ON  PLANES IN THOSE  OTHER STATES,  FLY THROUGH NEW  YORK OR FLY TO  NEW YORK,  PROBABILITY IS  THEY WILL BRING  THE INFECTION.  ONE OF THE  ISSUES WE ARE  WORKING ON IN  NEW YORK CITY,  INDOOR DINING  HAS SHOWN THAT  IT HAS BEEN  PROBLEMATIC.  THAT THE VIRUS  SPREADS IN  CLOSED INDOOR  HOURS, AREAS  THAT HAVE AIR- CONDITIONED  SYSTEMS.  SO WE KNOW THAT  INDOOR DINING  HAS BEEN  PROBLEMATIC.  OUTDOOR DINING  HAS WORKED VERY  WELL ALL ACROSS  THE STATE, NEW  YORK CITY  INCLUDED.  THE STATE IS  GOING TO BE  REVIEWING THE  DATA AND  CONSULTING WITH  STAKEHOLDERS IN  NEW YORK CITY.  I STARTED  SPEAKING WITH  RESTAURANT  OWNERS AND  BUSINESS OWNERS  ABOUT THE RISK  REWARD ON INDOOR  DINING.  WE'VE BEEN  SPEAKING WITH  CONTROLLER SCOTT  STRINGER WHO  RAISES A LOT OF  GOOD POINTS  ABOUT THE RISK  OF INDOOR DINING, SPEAKER KORI  JOHNSON THE SAME  THING.  THE MAYOR THE  SAME THING.  SO I'M TALKING  TO BUSINESS  OWNERS ABOUT IT  AND WE ARE GOING  TO THE DATA BUT  THIS IS A REAL  ISSUE.  OUR REOPENING  HAS WORKED VERY  WELL, WE ARE NOT  GOING BACKWARDS,  WE ARE GOING  FORWARD.  A LOT OF THESE  OTHER STATES  ACTUALLY HAVE  HAD TO GO  BACKWARDS.  THEY STARTED TO  REOPEN AND THEY  HAD TO STOP.  BUT WE WANT TO  STUDY THIS ISSUE  PRIMARILY NEW  YORK CITY ON  INDOOR DINING.  AND WE WILL HAVE  A FINAL DECISION  BY WEDNESDAY.  SO PEOPLE WHO  OPERATE THOSE  TYPES OF  BUSINESSES WILL  KNOW WHAT WE ARE  DOING.  BUT THE  INCREASING VIRAL  SPREAD ACROSS  THE NATION IS  ALSO A PROBLEM  ESPECIALLY IN  NEW YORK CITY.  NEW YORK CITY IS  WHERE MOST OF  THE FLIGHTS  COME, YORK CITY  IS WHERE MOST OF  THE TRAVELERS  COME.  WE HAVE OFFERED  HELP TO ANY  STATE THAT IS  EXPERIENCING A  SPIKE.  WE HAVE  PERSONNEL WHO  KNOW THIS BETTER  THAN  ANYONE IN THE  UNITED STATES.  WE LEARNED THAT  THE HARD WAY, WE  HAVE EQUIPMENT,  WE HAVE TESTING  CAPACITY, SO ANY  STATE THAT NEEDS  HELP, WE STAND  READY.  I WILL NEVER  FORGET HOW GOOD  THIS COUNTRY WAS  TO NEW YORK AND  WE NEEDED HELP.  AND THE DOOR  SWINGS BOTH WAYS  IN LIFE.  RELATIONSHIPS  WORK BOTH WAYS.  WHEN I ASKED FOR  HELP WE HAD  30,000 PEOPLE  FROM ACROSS THE  COUNTRY,  HEALTHCARE  PROFESSIONALS  WHO VOLUNTEERED  TO COME TO NEW  YORK.  AT OUR PEAK.  I MEAN, THAT WAS  AN AMAZING SIGN  OF GENEROSITY.  SO WE DON'T  FORGET AS NEW  YORKERS AND WE  WILL BE THERE  FOR OTHER PEOPLE. A FEW ADDITIONAL  ANNOUNCEMENTS,  THE VIDEO MUSIC  AWARDS ARE GOING  TO BE HELD  SUNDAY, AUGUST  30 AT BERKELEY  CENTER.  THERE ARE AIR  FILTRATION  DEVICES, AIR  FILTERS, THAT  CAN ACTUALLY HELP WITH THE COVID  VIRUS.  AND NASA HAS  STUDIED THESE,  THERE ARE HEPA  FILTERS WHICH ARE HIGH EFFICIENCY  PARTICULATE AIR  FILTERS THAT CAN  ACTUALLY FILTER  OUT THE COVID-19  VIRUS, IT IS  POINT IT IS .1  HEPA FILTERS  THAT CAN FILTER  OUT .01  SO ANY MALLS  THAT WILL OPEN  IN NEW YORK,  LARGE MALLS, WE  WILL MAKE IT  MANDATORY THAT  THEY HAVE AIR  FILTRATION  SYSTEMS THAT CAN  FILTER OUT THE  COVID VIRUS.  FOR MANY OF  THESE SYSTEMS IT  DEPENDS ON WHAT  FILTER YOU  INSTALL.  IF THAT IS  CALLED THE MERV  RATING OF THE  FILTER BUT THERE  ARE DIFFERENT  FILTERS THAT  FILTER OUT  DIFFERENT SIZED  PARTICLES AND  THEY HAVE  FILTERS THAT CAN  ACTUALLY FILTER  OUT AND CATCH  THE COVID VIRUS.  FOR LARGE MALL  REOPENING'S  WHICH WE HAVEN'T  DONE YET, BUT WE  ARE GOING TO  MAKE THIS  MANDATORY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND , THE STATE  RECOMMENDS FOR  ALL BUSINESSES  AND OFFICES,  THEY EXPLORE THE  POTENTIAL FOR  THEIR AIR- CONDITIONING AIR  FILTRATION  SYSTEM ADDING A  FILTER THAT CAN  FILTER OUT THE  COVID VIRUS.  WE HAVE BEEN  LOOKING AT THIS  ISSUE BECAUSE  YOU LOOK AROUND  THE COUNTRY AND  YOU ARE SEEING  MALLS AND AIR- CONDITIONING  SYSTEMS, INDOOR  SPACES, THAT  HAVE BEEN  PROBLEMATIC AND  WE THINK THIS  OFFERS PROMISE.  ALSO, I'M A  QUEENS BOY.  AND I WANT TO  REMIND NEW  YORKERS THAT  FIREWORKS ARE  DANGEROUS AND  FIREWORKS ARE  ILLEGAL.  FIREWORKS ARE  ILLEGAL.  SOME NIGHTS IN  NEW YORK CITY IT  SOUNDS LIKE THE  WILD WEST WITH  ALL THE  FIREWORKS GOING  OFF.  I'VE NEVER HEARD  IT LIKE THIS  BEFORE.  THEY ARE  DISTURBING, THEY  BOTHER PEOPLE  AND THEY ARE  DANGEROUS.  AND CHILDREN,  PEOPLE, GET HURT  EVERY YEAR.  IT IS ILLEGAL.  YOU CAN'T DO IT,  IT IS ILLEGAL.  AND THE POLICE  DEPARTMENT NEEDS  TO ENFORCE THE  LAW.  BUT, THE STATE  POLICE ARE GOING  TO START A  FIREWORKS  ENFORCEMENT  DETAIL AND WE  ARE GOING TO TRY  TO PREVENT THE  FIREWORKS FROM  COMING INTO THE  STATE.  IN THE FIRST  PLACE.  BEFORE THEY GET  TREATED.  AND I WANT TO  THANK THE STATE  POLICE AND THE  DEPUTIES HERE,  THE KERNEL IS  HERE, THE  PRIMARY SUPPLIER  FOR NEW YORK  STATE IS THE  STATE OF  PENNSYLVANIA.  NOT THE STATE  ITSELF BUT  FIREWORKS  COMPANIES WITHIN  THE STATE OF  PENNSYLVANIA AND  WE ARE GOING TO  BE FOCUSING ON  THAT ROUTE FOR  THE TRANSMISSION  OF THE  FIREWORKS.  WE WILL ALSO BE  HELPING LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS DEAL  WITH THIS ISSUE  BUT I NEED THE  LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS IN  THIS STATE TO  TAKE IT  SERIOUSLY.  I KNOW THERE IS  A LOT GOING ON  ON A LOT OF  LEVELS BUT THIS  IS ILLEGAL AND  IT'S DANGEROUS  SO WE HAVE TO  STOP IT.  AND TO THE  PRESIDENT,  BECAUSE IF WE  ARE GOING TO  TURN THIS AROUND  IN THIS NATION  IT'S GOING TO  TAKE THE WHITE  HOUSE, AND TO  THE PRESIDENT I  SAY TODAY IF YOU  WANT TO HELP,  STOP COVID-19,  THEN THEY SHOULD  START TELLING  THE PEOPLE OF  THIS COUNTRY THE  TRUTH.  AND THIS TRUTH  STARTS WITH HOW  LARGE A PROBLEM  THIS IS AND HOW  REAL A THREAT  COVID IS.  IT IS THE  LEADERSHIP, THAT  NEEDS TO STAND  UP UNTIL THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE,  LOOK AT THE  INCREASE ACROSS  THE COUNTRY,  LOOK AT WHAT IS  HAPPENING TO  THIS COUNTRY VIS- @-VIS OTHER  COUNTRIES AND  LOOK HOW IT HURT  THE ECONOMY, IT  IS A REAL  THREAT.  AND TO START  SIMPLY, THE  PRESIDENT COULD  DO TWO THINGS.  FIRST SIGN AN  EXECUTIVE ORDER  DIRECTING  EVERYONE TO WEAR  A MASK.  HOW WE ARE AT  THIS POINT AS A  NATION AND WE  STILL HAVEN'T  DONE THE SIMPLE,  EASY, MINIMAL  STEPS OF SAYING  YOU MUST WEAR A  MASK WHEN YOU  ARE IN PUBLIC.  AND THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO  PASS A PIECE OF  LEGISLATION OR  CALL THE  CONGRESS, JUST  SIGNED AN  EXECUTIVE ORDER  SAYING WEAR A  MASK.  WE DID IT TWO  MONTHS AGO IN  THIS STATE, THE  OTHER STATES ARE  JUST STARTING TO  DO IT NOW.  STATES THAT WERE  RECALCITRANT,  GOVERNORS WHO  SAID WE DON'T  NEED TO DO THIS,  MASKS DON'T  WORK, ALL THE  POLITICAL  NONSENSE WE  HEARD.  NOW THEY ARE  DOING A 180 AND  YOU HAVE THE  SAME STATES NOW  WEARING MASKS.  LET THE  PRESIDENT HAVE  THE SAME SENSE  AND DO THAT AS  AN EXECUTIVE  ORDER AND THEN  LET THE  PRESIDENT LEAD  BY EXAMPLE AND  LET THE  PRESIDENT PUT A  MASK ON.  BECAUSE, WE KNOW  IT WORKS, WE'VE  PROVEN THAT IT  WORKS IN THE  STATE OF NEW  YORK.  AND THE PRESIDENT CAN STILL BE NEW  YORK TOUGH AND  NEW YORK SMART  AND UNITED AND  DISCIPLINED AND  LOVING.  I WANT TO SHOW  YOU ONE OTHER  THING.  IT MAKES THE  POINT. [ MUSIC ]  >>> YOU ARE  WATCHING NBC  NEWS NOW.   >>> WE'VE GOT  SOME BREAKING  NEWS.   >> IF THEY DO GO  BACK TO THEIR  JOBS THEY WANT  TO MAKE SURE  THAT THEY ARE  PROTECTED.  >> IT IS NEWS  RAISED MADE FOR  YOUR STREAMING  WORLD, LIVE  WEEKDAYS  STARTING AT 6 AM  EASTERN.  [ MUSIC ]  >>> IN CHINA'S  CAPITAL LOCKDOWN  NEIGHBORHOODS  AND RAMPED UP  RESTRICTIONS, A  FEW WEEKS AGO  OFFICIALS HERE  ARE VALID MORE  MEASURES AFTER  AN OUTBREAK AT A  WHOLESALE FOODS  MARKET.  THE FIRST  CLUSTER OF A FEW  DOZEN CASES  TRIGGERING A  MASSIVE  GOVERNMENT  RESPONSE WITH  QUARANTINES AND  CANCELED  FLIGHTS, NOW  JUST TWO WEEKS  LATER OFFICIALS  HAVE DECLARED  THE OUTBREAK  CONTINUED.  >> 42 DAYS, NEW  YORKERS DEALT  WITH THAT  INCREASE.  WHY DID WE HAVE  THIS SPIKE?  HOW DID WE GET  TODAY ONE?  BECAUSE THE  VIRUS CAME FROM  EUROPE AND  NOBODY TOLD US  IT WAS COMING  FROM EUROPE  BECAUSE THE  FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT  DIDN'T KNOW.  WE DEALT WITH IT. WE PAID THE  PRICE.  AND WE DEALT  WITH OUR SPIKE  AND WE CLIMBED  RIGHT OF THE  MOUNTAIN.  WE GOT SMART,  NEW YORKERS  STEPPED UP AND  WE WORE MASKS.  WE SOCIALLY  DISTANCED AND WE  CLOSED DOWN AND  WE STOPPED THE  CURVE.  WE PLATEAUED.  YOU LOOK AT  PROJECTIONS,  THEY ALL  PROJECTED THAT  THIS SPIKE WOULD  CONTINUE KILLING  TENS OF  THOUSANDS MORE  PEOPLE.  NEW YORKERS CAME  TOGETHER AND  THEY TURNED THE  CURVE.  AND THEN WE  PLATEAUED.  ON DAY 42.  AND THEN WE HAD  TO REDUCE THE  INFECTION RATE,  AND THAT DECLINE  WENT FROM DAY 42  TODAY 111.  THIS WAS THE  TRAJECTORY OF  COVID IN OUR  STATE.  WE DON'T WANT TO  CLIMB THIS  MOUNTAIN AGAIN.  WE DON'T WANT TO  CLIMB THIS  MOUNTAIN AGAIN.  AND THAT IS WHY  THE PHASED  REOPENING,  STAYING SMART,  STAYING  DISCIPLINED, AND  THAT IS WHY THE  SPREAD ACROSS  THE COUNTRY, IF  THAT SPREAD  COMES TO NEW YORK WE WOULD HAVE TO  DO THIS ALL OVER  AGAIN.  THAT IS WHY WE  PUT IN PLACE  QUARANTINES AND  THAT IS WHY WE  ARE OFFERING  HELP TO ALL THE  OTHER STATES,  THAT IS WHY WE  ARE SAYING THE  PRESIDENT HAS TO  STEP UP.  BECAUSE DOING  THIS ONCE IN  LIFE IS ENOUGH.  WE DON'T NEED TO  CLIMB ANOTHER  MOUNTAIN.  ONE MOUNTAIN WAS  ENOUGH.  WE DON'T WANT TO  CLIMB A MOUNTAIN  RANGE.  ONE MOUNTAIN IS  ENOUGH.  WE DON'T WANT TO  DO IT AGAIN. QUESTIONS?  >>> GOVERNOR --  ADDED TO THE  QUARANTINE IN  THE NEXT FEW  DAYS, HAS THERE  BEEN ANY  CONCRETE DATA ON  HOW MANY OUT-OF- STATE PEOPLE ARE  ALREADY --  >> LET'S  REMEMBER HOW  QUARANTINE WORKS, IT DOES NOT NAME  A STATE, ANY  STATE, IT  IS NOTHING TO DO  WITH POLITICS OR  I LIKE MINNESOTA  OR I DON'T LIKE  CALIFORNIA.  IT IS AN  EQUATION.  A SET OF NUMBERS. IF YOUR  INFECTION RATE  IS ABOVE?  THEN WHEN YOU  COME HERE PLEASE  QUARANTINE JUST BECAUSE WE  DON'T WANT THE  INFECTION TO  SPREAD AND YOU  DON'T WANT THE  INFECTION TO  SPREAD.  I DO NOT HAVE  NUMBERS FOR YOU  ZACH, WE JUST  PUT IT IN PLACE  BUT AS SOON AS  WE GET NUMBERS I  CAN GIVE THEM TO  YOU.  >> \u00c3WHAT IS  YOUR LEVEL OF  CONCERN ABOUT  THAT OUTBREAK?  THE SCHOOL  DISTRICT SAID  THEY FOLLOWED  ALL THE  PROTOCOLS SET IN  PLACE, THE  SUPERINTENDENT  SAID THE MESSAGE  TO THE COMMUNITY  SAYING  UNFORTUNATELY  DESPITE POLICE  PRESENCE  NUMEROUS  INDIVIDUALS  FAILED TO FOLLOW NUMEROUS TIMES TO COMPLY, AND BY THE WAY, THE COMPLIANCE RATE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. IT HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. YOU LOOK AROUND MANHATTAN. YOU GO TO ANY CITY IN THIS STATE. I WILL BET YOU IT IS 95% OF THE PEOPLE ARE WEARING MASKS. THINK HOW EXTRAORDINARY THAT IS. NO STATE IS DOING WHAT NEW YORK IS DOING. CALIFORNIA JUST WENT TO MASKS AS MANDATORY MASK WEARING A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, LITERALLY. I THINK IT WAS EVEN LAST WEEK. WE WERE DOING THIS TWO MONTHS AGO. THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF BEHAVIOR WE HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE. I LAID OUT THE FACTS TO NEW YORKERS AND THEY DID IT. GOD BLESS THEM. GOD BLESS THEM. AND THEY SAVED LIVES, BUT 95%. IT IS THE 5% THAT DON'T DO IT BECAUSE, FOR WHATEVER REASON, SOCIAL DISTANCING, EXCEPT THE 5% THAT DON'T DO IT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO DO THE ENFORCEMENT. THEY NEED TO DO THE COMPLIANCE. I TALKED TO MAYORS ALL DAY LONG AND I MAKE THIS POINT COMPLIANCE IS DIFFICULT. WHY? WELL, BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO WEAR MASKS AND WE HAVE TO TELL THEM TO DO IT AND THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. I UNDERSTAND ENFORCEMENT OF COMPLIANCE IS DIFFICULT, BUT IT IS THE LAW. AND LOOK, I SAID BLAME ME. IT IS MY LAW. I'M GUILTY LET THE POLICE GO UP TO SOMEONE AND SAY I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE TO WEAR YOUR MASK. IT IS NOT THE MAYOR. GOVERNOR CUOMO SAYS YOU HAVE TO WEAR THE MASK. BLAME ME. BUT THEY HAVE TO ENFORCE THE COMPLIANCE BECAUSE IT ONLY TAKES ONE. ALL OF THESE CLUSTERS IT WAS ONE PERSON. ONE TO 13, ONE TO 80. ONE TO 70. NEW ROCHELLE IN WESTCHESTER, WE LEARNED THIS LESSON IN WESTCHESTER. IT WAS ONE PERSON IN NEW ROCHELLE. WE HAVE THE FIRST HOT SPOT IN THE UNITED STATES. ONE PERSON LED TO HUNDREDS OF CASES. ONE PERSON. SO 95% IS GREAT, YEAH, BUT ONE PERSON IN THAT 5% CAN INFECT DOZENS. THAT IS WHY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO BE DILIGENT ON THE ENFORCEMENT. >> IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING LONG-TERM? UNTIL WE GET A VACCINE? OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT -- INAUDIBLE DEDUCTION. >> YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS ON THE COMBINATION OF FACTORS AND AGAIN, NOBODY HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE, SO LITERALLY, THIS NATION, YOU'RE FIGURING IT OUT AS YOU GO. MY M. O. HAS BEEN GET ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN, STUDY THE OTHER STATES, SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING, AND THEN MAKE A DECISION. IT IS NOT JUST INDOOR DINING ALONE. IT IS INDOOR DINING IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE YOU ALREADY HAVE ISSUES WITH HIGH CONGREGATIONS. YOU ALREADY HAVE ISSUES OF PEOPLE CLEARLY VIOLATING SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND YOU HAVE AN ADDED FACTOR OF VIRAL SPREAD ALL ACROSS THE NATION AND HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT THOSE PEOPLE WILL COME TO NEW YORK CITY. IT IS THAT COMBINATION OF FACTS THAT IS PRECARIOUS. WE DON'T HAVE A DECISION. I WANT TO TAKE TODAY, TOMORROW, TALK TO EVERYONE. WE'LL ANNOUNCE A DECISION ON WEDNESDAY, BUT ALL OF THESE DECISIONS ARE JUST FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME. ANYONE WHO SAYS, WELL, WHAT IS IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN TWO WEEKS? WHAT IS IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN THREE WEEKS, I WOULDN'T BELIEVE ANY OF THOSE ANSWERS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE VIRAL SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHAT IS THE VIRAL SPREAD IN NEW YORK CITY. WE TRACE IT EVERY DAY. IT WOULD BE ALL OF THESE SHORT-TERM MEASURES. [ INAUDIBLE ] . >> WELL, YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF ISSUES. FIRST, ANY MUNICIPALITY IN THE STATE THAT RUNS INTO FINANCIAL TROUBLE, WHO PAYS IF A MUNICIPALITY GETS INTO TROUBLE? THE CITIES ARE CREATED BY THE STATE, RIGHT? THEY'RE CREATED BY STATE LAW. IF A CITY OR A COUNTY RUNS INTO FINANCIAL TROUBLE, THE STATE STEPS IN. NEW YORK CITY WENT VIRTUALLY BANKRUPT IN THE '70s. THE STATE HAD TO STEP IN. YONKERS, THE CITY IN WESTCHESTER, WAS VIRTUALLY BANKRUPT. THE STATE HAD TO STEP IN. NASSAU COUNTY WAS VIRTUALLY BANKRUPT. THE STATE HAD TO STEP IN. ERIE COUNTY, WHERE BUFFALO IS IN ERIE COUNTY, WAS VIRTUALLY BANKRUPT. THE STATE HAD TO STEP IN. SO WHATEVER YOU ALLOW THE MUNICIPALITY TO DO, THE STATE IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE, SO YOU ALLOW A LOCALITY TO BORROW. IF THAT IS INPRUDENT, THEN IT IS GOING TO BE A STATE LIABILITY. SO THE STATE BORROWING, IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND WE WOULD PAY. A CITY BORROWING, IT IS A STATE RESPONSIBILITY ULTIMATELY IF IT GOES BAD. WHAT ALL OF THE LOCALITIES HAVE TO FIGURE OUT, WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS, I WANT TO BORROW X. WELL, HOW DO YOU PAY IT BACK? WHEN DO YOU PAY IT BACK? WHAT DO YOU THINK THE REVENUES ARE GOING TO BE NEXT YEAR? WHAT DO YOU THINK THE REVENUES ARE GOING TO BE THE YEAR AFTER? AND HOW FAST DO YOU THINK BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS GOING TO INCREASE? HOW FAST DO YOU THINK BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO BE BACK AT FULL CAPACITY AND RESIDENTS ARE GOING TO BE BACK AT FULL CAPACITY. SO IT IS A VERY COMPLICATED ECONOMIC EQUATION AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BIG QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOING TO DO AND HOW MUCH ARE THEY GOING TO PROVIDE? YOU WANT TO MAKE A POINT? >> IF I COULD JUST ADD, THE DEBT THE STATE ALLOWED US TO TAKE OUT WAS SHORT-TERM DEBT. WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MOVED THE TAX FILING DATE FROM APRIL TO JULY, IT DEFERRED BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR NEW YORK AND SO WE TAKE THIS OUT AS A WAY TO GET THROUGH TO JULY BECAUSE AS A RESULT, WE HAD TO MOVE THE STATE TAX DATE, SO THIS IS THE SHORT-TERM SITUATION FOR NEW YORK STATE AND WE HAVE COMMITTED TO PAYING IT BACK BY THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THIS IS NOT TALKING ABOUT LONG-TERM, SO WE'RE TALKING APPLES AND ORANGES AND ON THE MTA, THE MTA WASN'T GIVEN CARTE BLANCHE TO DO BORROWING. IT HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DIRECTOR AND MTA BOARD. THEY HAVE NOT ISSUED ANY DEBT TO DATE. THERE WAS A BACK STOP AND FISCAL WATCHDOGS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYTHING THEY DO THAT IS BEING DONE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLY SO THEY'RE NOT SIMILAR SITUATIONS. [ INAUDIBLE ] . >> WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS BUT WE DIDN'T FORM A REGIONAL COALITION YET. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS AN ISSUE. WE HAVE DONE STATE PURCHASING. WE HAVE MUNICIPALITIES WITHIN THE STATE WHICH WE DO COOPERATIVE PURCHASING FOR THE ENTIRE STATE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM WHERE AS MUCH AS PPE, GOWNS, MASKS, IT IS ALSO THE AVAILABILITY OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS AND SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT. [ INAUDIBLE ]      D YOU GUARANTEE THAT SUBWAY SERVICE WILL COME BACK? >> WE ALWAYS SAID THAT WHEN WE WERE STOPPING THE SUBWAY SERVICE FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, RIGHT? WHEN WE SAY 24/7, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS NOT A SEVEN DAY SYSTEM. IT OPERATES SEVEN DAYS. IT IS CLOSED FROM, LIKE, 1:00 A.M. TO 5:00 A.M.. DO YOU REMEMBER THE HOURS? >> 1:00 A.M. TO 5:00 A.M.. >> 1:00 TO 5:00. IT IS CLOSED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO DISINFECT TRAINS, AND AS SOON AS WE GET PAST THIS AND DON'T HAVE TO DISINFECT A TRAIN, THEN WE'LL BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE. ALSO REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOOD AT ALWAYS SEEING THE DOWN SIDE AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DOWN SIDE LATELY. IF I SAID TO A NEW YORKER, WE HAVE BEEN ARGUING ABOUT CLEANING THE TRAINS FOR DECADES, AND THE TRAINS HAVE BEEN DIRTY FOR DECADES, RIGHT? THEN IT BECAME A LEVEL OF HOW DIRTY. IF I TOLD YOU THAT WE WERE GOING TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE WERE GOING TO DISINFECT THE SUBWAY CAR, TO DISINFECT A SUBWAY CAR MEANS EVERY NEWSPAPER, EVERY COFFEE CUP, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE OUT OF THAT TRAIN. YOU CAN'T HAVE A NAPKIN IN THAT TRAIN. HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE TO BE OFF THE TRAIN. IF I HAD TOLD YOU THAT TEN MONTHS AGO YOU WOULD HAVE SAID IMPOSSIBLE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT IN NEW YORK CITY. IN MY 62 YEARS, I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT. EVER. AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE NOW DOING. WELL, TO DISINFECT TRAINS YOU HAVE TO CLOSE A COUPLE OF HOURS A NIGHT. >> YEAH. >> YES. IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DISINFECT A TRAIN EVERY NIGHT, THEN YES. >> DO YOU THINK THERE IS A POSSIBILITY YOU WOULD ACTUALLY DELAY FOR NEW YORK CITY IN THE EVENT OF COMPLICATIONS MEANING THE ENFORCEMENT OF LARGE GATHERINGS, ARE YOU SAYING MAYOR DE BLASIO ISN'T DOING ENOUGH? WHAT SHOULD THE NYPD AND MAYOR DE BLASIO BE DOING. THERE HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL ON HOW THE NYPD WAS ENFORCING WEARING THE MASKS, NOT SOCIAL DISTANCING, ET CETERA, AND IF YOU COULD ALSO TALK ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN BEHIND YOU, HOW IT WAS MADE. >> I MADE IT. I CARVED IT MYSELF. I'M A SCULPTOR. DID YOU KNOW? YES, IT IS THE ITALIAN -- YES, I AM AN ARTIST. I HAVE TAKEN MY ARTISTIC SKILLS. BEFORE I WOULD JUST DO DRAWINGS AND LIGHT PAINTING. NOW I HAVE INCREASED THAT TO SCULPTING. I DID IT IN MY GARAGE. IT IS MADE UP OF A BLEND OF PAPER MACHE, CEMENT, STYROFOAM, CLAY AND PLASTER. IT IS MY OWN FAMILY RECIPE, MY GRANDFATHER USED TO SCULPT WITH IT. NONE OF THAT IS TRUE, BY THE WAY. BUT IT IS, TELL THE TRUTH. I ALMOST HAD YOU FOR A SECOND. IT IS MADE OUT OF STYROFOAM, BUT IT IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE INCREASE AND THE DECLINE. THAT IS PROPORTIONATE. AND I WANTED TO SHOW, LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, I WANTED TO SHOW NEW YORKERS HOW -- WHAT WE DID. WHAT THEY DID. WHAT THEY DID. I DID NOTHING. I WANTED THEM TO SEE WHAT THEY DID AND REMEMBER WHAT WE WENT THROUGH AND REMEMBER WHY WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK THERE AGAIN. THAT IS HOW I SAW IT THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING. I WOULD SHOW YOU GUYS A CURVE EVERY DAY, RIGHT? IT WAS A CURVE. WE WOULD TALK ABOUT A CURVE, FLATTEN THE CURVE. IT FELT, TO ME, LIKE WE WERE CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN. YOU COULDN'T SEE THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN BECAUSE THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS LIKE IN CLOUDS. NOBODY COULD TELL YOU WHERE THE TOP WAS, SO IT WAS CLIMBING UP THE MOUNTAIN. EVERY DAY IS HARD. EVERY DAY CELL PHONE A STEEP INCLINE. 40 DEATHS, 50 DEATHS, 10,000 CASES. EVERY DAY IS A DIFFICULT, HELLISH DAY. HOW HIGH IS THIS MOUNTAIN? HOW HIGH DO WE HAVE TO CLIMB? NOBODY KNOWS. THE MOUNTAIN IS AS HIGH AS YOU MAKE IT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THE MOUNTAIN GOES UP UNTIL YOU FLATTEN THE CURVE BECAUSE YOU'RE DESIGNING THE MOUNTAIN BY YOUR ACTIONS. I MEAN, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW BIZARRE THIS WAS. SO WE CLIMB UP, 42 DAYS, WE'RE ABLE TO FLATTEN THE CURVE, WE HIT A PLATEAU, AND NOW WE'RE COMING DOWN THE OTHER SIDE. HOW LONG IS THE DESCENT? NOBODY KNOWS. IT DEPENDS ON HOW NEW YORKERS REACT AND HOW NEW YORKERS RESPOND. EVERY LINE ON THAT CHART, THAT WAS A DAY, THAT WAS A DAY. THAT WAS A NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS, A NUMBER OF DEATHS, EVERY DAY, AND WHAT WE DID TODAY DETERMINED THE NUMBER TOMORROW. WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS NOT KNOWING WHERE IT ENDED. 400 PEOPLE DIED TODAY. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW? WE DON'T KNOW. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. WHEN DOES IT STOP? WE DON'T KNOW. OF WE HAVE TO SEE. NEW YORKERS, NEW YORKERS CLIMBED THAT MOUNTAIN AND THEY FLATTENED THE CURVE. THE EARLY PROJECTIONS FROM ALL OF THE MODELS, WE HAD 18,000 PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE EARLY MODELS SAID? 120,000 PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL. THAT IS WHAT THE EARLY MODELS SAID. 120, 130, 140, 160. WELL, HOW FAR CAN WE GET THAT DOWN? NOBODY KNOWS. DEPENDS ON HOW YOU ACT. WE WENT FROM 120,000 PROJECTED HOSPITALIZATIONS, 18,000. GOD BLESS THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY DID. LITERALLY SAVED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES. REMEMBER WHAT WE DID AND WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK THERE. WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK THERE. [ INAUDIBLE ]      . >> WE HAVE BEEN ON SCHEDULE WITH THE ENTIRE PHASED REOPENINGS. THE OTHER REGIONS ARE AHEAD OF NEW YORK, RIGHT, IN TERMS OF REOPENING. WE HAVE DONE THE REOPENINGS, WE FOLLOWED THE DATA, AND THE DATA IS ALL STILL DOWN, RIGHT? THE INFECTION RATE IS DOWN ALL ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE GOING TO ENTER PHASE THREE. THE INDOOR DINING PIECE IS JUST ONE COMPONENT OF THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO STUDY BUT WE'RE ON TRACK FOR PHASE THREE. THIS INDOOR DINING, I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE STUDY, AGAIN, IN LIGHT OF EVERYTHING ELSE. IF IT WAS JUST INDOOR DINING, WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THE AIR FILTRATION SYSTEM WITH THE FILTERS THAT CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. IT WAS JUST INDOOR DINING IT WOULD BE ONE THING, BUT IT IS INDOOR DINING AND YOU HAD THE CONGREGATION PROBLEM AND YOU HAD THE VIRAL SPREAD ACROSS THE NATION, WHICH I THINK IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR US. WE ARE A STATE THAT IS A HUB. IT IS MORE OF A PROBLEM FOR NEW YORK THAN PROBABLY ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS WHY I IMPLORE THE PRESIDENT TO GET INTO THE GAME, FIRST AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, I WANT TO PROTECT THOSE OTHER CITIZENS AND GIVE THEM THE SUPPORT THEY GAVE US. SECOND, FOR THE ECONOMY, IF WE DON'T GET THIS UNDER CONTROL, THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO GET WORSE, AND THIRD, ON A PAROCHIAL LEVEL, THEY WILL COME HERE. IT IS A MATTER OF TIME. THEY WILL COME HERE. THE VIRUS CAME IN THROUGH OUR AIRPORTS ONCE BEFORE. IT WILL COME THROUGH AGAIN. >> [ INAUDIBLE ] . >> WELL, IT WAS A MAIN DRIVER. THE MAIN DRIVER IN NEW YORK CITY IN RETROSPECT NOW THAT WE HAVE THE FACTS, DR. FAUCI SAID THIS, CDC HAD SAID THIS, THE MAIN DRIVER WAS THE VIRUS CAME FROM EUROPE AND IT WAS THE GREATEST MISS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF ALL TIME. CHINA VIRUS, CHINA VIRUS, CHINA VIRUS, CHINA TRAVEL BAN. FORGET THE CHINA TRAVEL BAN. IT WAS IN EUROPE. THEY LITERALLY HAVE TRACED OUR STRAIN OF THE VIRUS BACK TO EUROPE. JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH, THREE MILLION PEOPLE COME THROUGH OUR AIRPORTS FROM EUROPE. THEN YOU HAVE THE DENSITY AND THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING, WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW. NOBODY SAID SCREEN PEOPLE COMING FROM EUROPE. NOBODY SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK, WATCH WHEN YOU GO HAVE A MEETING WITH PEOPLE IN EUROPE. WATCH IF YOU HAVE GUESTS WHO ARE COMING FROM EUROPE. IT WAS A TOTAL MISS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT WAS THE MAIN POINT. I GIVE YOU THE SEVEN DEATHS TODAY, EIGHT DEATHS IS THE THREE DAY AVERAGE. I'LL TAKE ONE MORE. I'M SORRY, DID I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? >> PARTS OF IT. >> SUBURBAN RURAL -- YOU SEE THAT MORE IN CLUSTERS. YOU SEE IN THAT IN THE WESTCHESTER CLUSTER, MONTGOMERY COUNTY NOW, YOU SEE THAT IN OSWEGO. WHERE WHEN YOU HAVE A FLARE UP, YOU CAN NORMALLY TRACE IT BACK TO A CLUSTER. IT SHOWS YOU HOW DANGEROUS ONE PERSON CAN BE. I'M SORRY. [ INAUDIBLE ] . >> THE WHOLE THING IS WHAT IS THE LOAN. HOW DO YOU PAY IT BACK? WHAT IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE? YOU KNOW? BORROWING IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT A GREAT THING, BUT IT IS NOT A BAD THING. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH, HOW DO YOU REPAY IT, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE ECONOMY? YOU KNOW, THERE IS A BIG QUESTION MARK ON HOW FAST THE NEW YORK CITY ECONOMY COMES BACK. A BIG QUESTION MARK ON HOW FAST THE NATIONAL ECONOMY COMES BACK. WITH THIS VIRUS SPREAD, THAT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION. HOW FAST DOES THE NATIONAL ECONOMY COME BACK? HOW FAST DOES THE NEW YORK CITY ECONOMY COME BACK? AND WE HAVE THE SAME QUESTION ALL ACROSS THE STATE. HOW FAST DOES THE NATIONAL ECONOMY COME BACK? HOW FAST DOES THE BUFFALO ECONOMY COME BACK? WHAT DO YOU THINK THE REVENUES ARE GOING TO BE? AND WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON, WHAT CAN WE DO TO ACTUALLY STIMULATE THE ECONOMY COMING BACK FASTER? IF YOU JUST WAIT FOR THE ECONOMY TO COME BACK, IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG FEW MONTHS BEFORE BUSINESSES REALLY RAMP UP BEFORE PEOPLE REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING TO PLACES OF DENSITY, GOING TO A BROADWAY SHOW, GOING TO A PACKED RESTAURANT, GOING TO A PACKED BAR, GOING TO A CONVENTION AT THE JAVITS CENTER OR IN A BIG HOTEL BALL ROOM. SO THAT IS A VERY LARGE QUESTION MARK AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT ANSWER BEFORE YOU HAVE ANY REASONABLE JUDGMENT OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY OKAY? THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. I'LL CHECK ON THE EXACT DATE FOR YOU. >> YOU'RE WATCHING NBC NEWS NOW. >> WUFB BREAKING NEWS. >> IF THEY DO GO BACK TO THE JOBS, THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE PROTECTED. >> NEWS MADE FOR YOUR STREAMING WORLD.

FEEDING THE HUNGRY ACROSS HIS CITY. SINCE MARCH, HE AND HIS STAFF DELIVERED AN ASTOUNDING 350,000 MEALS ACROSS DALLAS. THE MAJORITY GOING TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. >> THIS HAS BEEN A TRUE GAME CHANGER FOR OUR FAMILIES. THOSE WHO HAVE FOOD INSECURITIES AND THIS TOOK ONE HUGE WEIGHT OFF OF THEIR SHOULDERS. >> Reporter: THERE IS EVEN MORE TO THE STORY. THIS ISN'T CHEF HOUSER'S ONLY INFORMATION. >> OUR MISSION STATEMENT SAYS TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. >> Reporter: CAFE MOMENTUM DOESN'T JUST SERVE FOOD. IT PROVIDES A SECOND CHANCE, HIRING TUNES THAT HAVE BEEN IN JUVENILE DETENTION LIKE 17-YEAR-OLD ASA BREEZE. >> FACED A LOT OF HARDSHIPS WORKING HERE OUTSIDE OF THE JOB AND THERE WERE A LOT OF RESOURCES TO HELP ME, STAFF MEMBERS TO HELP ME. >> Reporter: JUFB FOR THEM IT IS A SCARLET LETTER THEY WEAR ON THEIR CHEST SAYING THIS IS WHO I AM. IT IS NOT WHO I WANT TO BE, BUT IT IS WHO IT HAS BEEN TOLD I AM. >> Reporter: CHEF HOUSER HAS BEEN STAFFING HIS WITH THE TEENS IN NEED. OF THE 900 YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORKED WITH THEM, ONLY 15% ENDED UP BACK IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW. HIS RESTAURANT IS SO SUCCESSFUL THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS COME TOGETHER TO SAVE IT. HIS OPERATION IS RUNNING ON DONATIONS TO FEED THE HUNGRY AND KEEP HIS TEAM, DEFYING EXPECTATIONS, EMPLOYED. >> THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WE PUT A LABEL ON, NOT ONLY SHED THAT LABEL BUT SHOWED THE WORLD HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE. THEY REALLY SHINED WHEN THE WORLD NEEDED THEM TO THE MOST. >> CHEF HOUSER HOPES HE CAN REOPEN CAFE MOMENTUM FOR SIT DOWN MEALS AS SOON AS IT IS SAFE. HE PLANS TO HAVE THE TEENS WORKING IN ALL AREAS OF THE RESTAURANT. >>> IT IS SAD SAID THERE IS NOTHING MORE POWERFUL THAN AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS PASSED. PERHAPS THE TIMES HAS COME. THE DREAM UPON WHICH THIS GREAT COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED, EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. >> YOU'RE WATCHING NBC NEWS NOW. >> WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS. >> WE ACTUALLY SAW A LARGE CONVOY OF THE NATIONAL GUARD COME THROUGH HERE. >> IT IS NEWS MADE FOR YOUR STREAMING WORLD, LIVE WEEK DAYS, STARTING AT 6:00 A.M. EASTERN. >> INTRODUCING PEACOCK. WHAT IS PEACOCK? THIS IS PEACOCK. >> LET'S GO! >> IT IS STREAMING, LAUNCHING, PREMIERING, IT IS TV, MOVIES, EXCLUSIVE ORIGINALS. ORIGINAL CHARACTERS. IT IS SPORTS, WAIT, THERE IS MORE. >> MORE? >> MORE. >> >> TONS. >> IT IS LOVE STUFF, IT IS TRENDING, MIND BENDING. IT IS LATE NIGHT, EARLY MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING. >> DID YOU SEE THIS? >> DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? YOU WATCH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE? IT IS FOR YOU, FOR AW. IT IS PAWNEE, MONKEYS, E. TECHD, AND IT IS FREE. >> FREE. FREE. FREE? >> WHO IS WITH ME? >> THAT IS PEACOCK. THAT IS WHO. THAT IS WHAT. THAT IS WHY. >> COME ON. >> MIC DROP. >> YOU CAN'T NOT WATCH. >>> WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE LIVE IN A POST RACIAL AMERICA. WE'RE REMINDED TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT WE DO NOT. >> I WATCH HER TRYING TO RAISE HER SON AND I THINK ABOUT YOU AND YOUR KIDS. >> I REMEMBER HER COMING HOME SAYING WHY DON'T I HAVE A PONYTAIL LIKE THE WHITE GIRLS. IT IS OKAY TO NOTICE YOU'RE DIFFERENT. YOU JUST HAVE TO FEEL NOT LESS THAN. THAT IS THE THING. >> I FEEL SAFE TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH YOU GUYS. >>> DR. QUINN SNYDER WORKS IN PHOENIX EMERGENCY ROOM AND HE RECENTLY WROTE AN OP-ED EXPRESSING HIS CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HIS STATE. GOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR TALKING WITH US. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> SO, CORONAVIRUS CASES RAPIDLY ON THE RISE THERE IN ARIZONA. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS CAUSING THE SURGE? >>. >> A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. STAY-AT-HOME ORDER LIFTED IN MAY. SINCE THAT TIME, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING OUT THERE PARTYING LIKE IT IS 2019. MEMORIAL DAY EVERYTHING WAS PACKED AROUND THE CASE. WITH THE CORONAVIRUS, ABOUT TWO TO THREE WEEKS LATER, YOU START TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF WHAT HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF LIFTING THE ORDERS AND WHAT NOT. SO AT THIS POINT, WE'RE STARTING TO SEE GROWTH IN OUR CONFIRMED CASES AND A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR IN PATIENT HOSPITALIZATIONS AS WELL. >> AND YOU WROTE, YOU KNOW, THERE IS ALSO THIS ISSUE WITH MASKS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC, EVEN NOW, THERE IS THE DEBATE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WEARING MASKS. WE HAVE BEEN WEARING THEM HERE IN NEW YORK FOR A LONG TIME NOW. ARIZONA JUST RECENTLY BEING MANDATED TO START WEARING MASKS ON JUNE 17TH. DO YOU THINK THE ABSENCE OF A STATEWIDE MANDATE REGARDING MASKS HAS BEEN A HUGE MISTAKE? >> JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT, ACTUALLY. ON THE 17th, THE GOVERNOR DECIDED TO LET THE MUNICIPALITITIES TO DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT MASK RESTRICTIONS AND AT THAT POINT, WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS, USUALLY MOST CITIES AROUND THE STATE AS WELL AS ALL OF MARICOPA COUNTY, IS NOW UNDER A MASK MANDATE. IN MY OPINION, LOOKING OVER THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, I THINK THE CONSENSUS IS MORE OR LESS CLEAR AT THIS POINT THAT MASK WEARING IS CRITICAL IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTAIN THIS PANDEMIC. NOT JUST MASK WEARING BUT CORRECT MASK USAGE, INCLUDING KEEPING THEM OVER THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE. >> SO GOVERNORS IN TEXAS AND FLORIDA ORDERED BARS TO ONCE AGAIN CLOSE. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING ARIZONA GOVERNOR HAS YET DONE. ARE YOU ALARMED BY HIS DECISION? I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TORN BECAUSE ECONOMICALLY, OBVIOUSLY, THE STATES HAVE TAKEN A HIT. ARE MASKS IN BARS ENOUGH OR SHOULD THEY CLOSE? >> I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE STATE. WITHOUT A DOUBT WE NEED TO CLOSE THE BARS IN OUR STATE. IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE 20 TO 44-YEAR-OLD AGE POPULATION AND MANY OF US EXPECT THAT THE OF THAT IS RELATED TO THE BARS CONTINUING TO BE OPEN AND TO ME THE FACT THAT THE BARS ARE STILL OPEN AND WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAD POTENTIALLY INTO A FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND WHERE THE BARS COULD REMAIN OPEN, IT COULD BE CATASTROPHIC IN OUR STATE. >> YOU'RE AN ER DOCTOR AND ON THE FRONT LINES. YOU'RE A RESPECTED VOICE AND YOU WROTE THIS BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE THE ARIZONA HOSPITAL SYSTEM IS PREPARED FOR WHAT IS TO COME. IN YOUR OPINION, WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN? >> REALLY GREAT QUESTION. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK YOURSELVES, REALLY, WHO WE ARE AND WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IN OUR STATE. THE REALITY IS THAT THE ARIZONA PANDEMIC REOPENING PLAN HAS FAILED. IT DIDN'T WORK. WE OPENED UP TOO QUICKLY. WE OPENED UP TOO MUCH, ALL AT ONCE IN MID-MAY AND WE'RE SEEING THE ILL EFFECTS OF THAT, SO TRULY THE SAFEST THING WOULD BE GO BACK TO A STAY AT HOME ORDER AT THIS POINT. WITHOUT A DOUBT, WE NEED TO CLOSE THE BARS AND NIGHTCLUBS IMMEDIATELY. I THINK LIKE TEXAS, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT REDUCING THE CAPACITY OF RESTAURANTS AT LEAST BY 50%. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ENGAGING IN APPROPRIATE SOCIAL DISTANCING IN RESTAURANTS, TABLES ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE SPACED SIX FEET APART TO KEEP PATRONS SAFE AND BEYOND THAT, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO STOP THINKING IN THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM STRATEGIES AND START LOOKING AT THE LONGER TERM AND THAT IS WHAT MY OP-ED WAS ABOUT IN THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO INCREASE THE TESTING CAPACITY. THE CONFIRMED POSITIVES RIGHT NOW ARE AT 22% WHICH MEANS THAT WE DON'T NEARLY HAVE ENOUGH TESTING CAPACITY IN OUR STATE AND INCREASE THE TESTING. WE'RE AT 1/30th OF WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN THE CONTACT TRACING APPARATUS AND CASES CONTINUE TO SKY ROCKET, THAT GOAL WILL CONTINUE TO JUST GET FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY, UNFORTUNATELY. >> REAL QUICKLY, RECENT STATS SUGGEST AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING COVID-19. ARE YOU SEEING THE SAME IN THE HOSPITAL? DO YOU THINK THE STATE MISSED THE WINDOW TO PROPERLY MANAGE THE SURGE? WHAT ARE YOU NOTICING? >> WE'RE NOTICING A BIG INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE 20 TO 44-YEAR-OLD AGE GROUP. I PERSONALLY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR 20s AND 30s, ADMITTED PEOPLE TO THE HOSPITAL IN THEIR 30s REQUIRING SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN. WE HAVE INTUBATED NUMEROUS PEOPLE IN THE AGE GROUP, IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND HAD TO ADMIT THEM. I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THAT AGE GROUP. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING WITH US THIS MORNING. WE ARE PRAYING THINGS GET BETTER IN ARIZONA. >> THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. >>> WELCOME BACK WITH THE COUNTRY FACING RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT AND MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLING, THE IDEA OF GUARANTEED INCOME OR A FIXED MONTHLY CASH PAYMENT FOR ALL IS GAINING TRACTION. >> TODAY MAYORS FROM TEN U.S. CITIES ARE EXCLUSIVELY ANNOUNCING THE FORMATION OF A GROUP CALLED MAYORS FOR GUARANTEED INCOME. HERE TO TELL US MORE ABOUT IT IS STOCKTON CALIFORNIA MAYOR MICHAEL TUBBS. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. >> GOOD MORNING. >> THIS IS A FASCINATING TOPIC. SOME MAYORS IN A PART OF THE COALITION INCLUDING KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS AND ERIC GARCIA YETTIE. >> GARCETTI. WE KNEW BEFORE COVID-19 IN THE UP RISING FROM THE GEORGE FLOYD MURDER THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR ECONOMY WERE SUFFERING. WE KNOW THAT IN AMERICA TODAY, THAT LESS THAN 1/10 OF AMERICANS OWN 90% OF THE WEALTH. WE KNOW WHITE AMERICANS HAVE TEN TIMES AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH WEALTH AS LATINO AMERICANS. WE KNOW THAT 40% OF ALL AMERICANS CAN AFFORD ONE $400 EMERGENCY AND THE STATUS QUO IS UNTENABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE WEDNESDAY ALSO KNOW THAT 50 YEARS AGO, WITH THE UP RISING AND UNREST THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, SAID WE HAVE TO REALLY BE SERIOUS ABOUT PROVIDING ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR ALL AND ABOLISH POVERTY. THE TOOL TO DO THAT IS GUARANTEED INCOME. THE MAYORS ARE SAYING WE WILL PILOT, TEST AND SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR THE CONSTITUENTS TO HAVE IMMEDIATE CASH ASSISTANCE NOW, PARTICULARLY DURING A TIME OF COVID-19 AND PARTICULARLY DURING A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT IN THE STREETS PROTESTING AND DEMANDING A CHANGE FROM THE STATUS QUO. >> THIS PROGRAM WILL WORK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY IN EACH CITY, SO IN ADDITION TO GOVERNMENT SOCIAL SAFETY NETS, OF COURSE, HOPING TO HELP NEARLY 6 MILLION AMERICANS, TALK ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE FUNDED AND HOW RECIPIENTS WOULD BE SELECTED. OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A HUGE NEED. >> IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT PER CITY. IN EVERY CITY, THE MAYOR WOULD BE COMMITTED TO WORKING AND FIGHTING TO LAUNCH A PILOT. IN STOCKTON WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 18 MONTHS. WHAT WE DID WAS ALLOWED 75% OF THE CITIES TO BE SELECTED, TO BE QUALIFIED AND 125 PEOPLE WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED. AT THE SAME TIME, WE'RE ALSO SAYING THAT BILLS LIKE SENIOR HARRISON'S BILL IN THE SENATE OR THE BILL IN THE HOUSE SHOULD ALSO BE PASSED. IT WOULD PROVIDE GUARANTEED INCOME FOR COVID-19 RELATED FOR ALL AMERICANS. >> SO IN STOCKTON WHERE YOU LAUNCHED YOUR OWN VERSION OF THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR, YOU PROVIDED $500 A MONTH TO 125 RESIDENTS SELECTED AT RANDOM. THE PROGRAM IS STILL ONGOING, BUT WHAT ARE YOU NOTICING FROM THE RESULTS. >> WHAT IS FASCINATING IS PEOPLE SPEND MONEY LIKE YOU AND I SPEND MONEY. PARTICULARLY DURING COVID-19, ALMOST 46% OF THE $500 HAD BEEN SPENT ON FOOD TO SHELTER IN PLACE. PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR KIDS. THE ONE MOTHER TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS ABLE TO SEND HER KID TO FOOTBALL CAMP PRECOVID-19. PEOPLE ARE ALSO ABLE TO WORK MORE, WHICH PEOPLE DIDN'T EXPECT, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE $500 WAS ENOUGH FOR FOLKS WHO WORK RETAIL OR HOURLY JOBS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE TIME OFF TO TRY AND INTERVIEW FOR JOBS THAT ARE MORE STABLE, PAY MORE, AND HAVE UNION BENEFITS. I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED AND SURPRISED WITH HOW EVERY SINGLE SPENDING DECISION TRACKED IS IN LINE WITH HOW I WOULD SPEND MONEY. AS AMERICANS, EVERY AMERICAN HAS A NEED FOR IT. AS A PERSON WHO HAS SIMILAR DESIRES WOULD SPEND MONEY THE SAME WAY YOU AND I SPEND MONEY. >> AND LET ME BE DEVILS ADVOCATE. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO CRITICS WHO SAY IT COULD BE USED FOR THE WRONG REASONS OR DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GETTING OUT AND GETTING A JOB. >> IN TERMS OF SPENDING, I THINK THE PAST 18 MONTHS, STOCKTON HAS PROVIDED HARD DATA FOR FOLKS GIVEN $500 A MONTH, HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT. 40% OF THE MONEY WAS SPENT ON FOOD, 20% WAS SPENT ON SALES AND MERCHANDISE. 10% SPENT ON UTILITIES, RENT, ET CETERA, AND SOME OF THE MONEY WAS SPENT ON HELPING OUT FAMILY MEMBERS AND HELPING OUT NEIGHBORS AND ENSURING THAT HAVE THE ECONOMIC RESILIENCE TO PERSIST DURING PANDEMICS LIKE THIS ONE. IN TERMS OF PEOPLE NOT WORKING, THAT WAS ONE OF MY CONCERNS. I REALIZED IN THE COUNTRY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORK, CAN'T WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE CHILDREN AND WE HAVE CHILD LABOR LAWS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING, PARTICULARLY WOMEN, BUT AREN'T COMPENSATED FOR THE WORK THEY DO AT HOME AND FOLKS WANT TO WORK. WE HAVE ESSENTIAL WORKERS PUTTING LIVES ON THE LINE DURING A HEALTH CRISIS WORRIED ABOUT BEING EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES. OR THEY'RE GOING TO FOOD BANKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD FOOD. >> I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR STORY AND YOUR FINANCIAL CHALLENGES GROWING UP. CLEARLY YOU BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD CHANGE A LIFE. >> 100 %. MY MOM WAS SINGLE, SHE WORKED HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE AND SOMETHING AS SMALL AS AN INCOME OF 4 OR $500 WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HER TO BE HOME AND ALLOWED HER TO BREATHE AND NOT BE SO STRESSED AND ANXIOUS AND BE FULLY HUMAN. >> MAYOR TUBBS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WE'LL CERTAINLY FOLLOW THIS PROGRAM TO SEE HOW IT WORKS. >> HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY. >> GOSH, TIME IS FLYING. THANK YOU.   HOLLYWOOD. >>> MY NAME IS CLEVELAND BROWN. >> THIS MORNING, A NEW COMMITMENT TO CASTING AUTHENTICITY FROM TWO OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND BELOVED ANIMATED SERIES. >> BREAKER, BREAKER, 1-9. 10-4. >> ON FOX'S FAMILY GUY, WHITE VOICE OVER ACTOR MICHAEL HENRY TWEETING HE WILL NO LONGER PLAY THE VOICE OF CLEVELAND BROWN, ONE OF THE SHOW'S BLACK CHARACTERS. I LOVE THIS CHARACTER, BUT PERSONS OF COLOR SHOULD PLAY CHARACTERS OF COLOR. SEPARATELY, THE PRODUCERS OF THE SIMPSONS ANNOUNCED THE SHOW WILL NO LONGER HAVE WHITE ACTORS VOICE NON-WHITE CHARACTERS. KRISTIN BELL, WHO PLAYS MOLLY ON CENTRAL PARK SAYS SHE WILL QUIT DOING THE CHARACTER, WRITING, CASTING A MIXED RACE CHARACTER WITH A WHITE ACTRESS UNDERMINES THE MIXED RACE AND BLACK AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. STEPPING DOWN FROM HER ROLE ON NETFLIX, BIG MOUTH, ACTOR JENNY SLATE SENT A SIMILAR MESSAGE, CASTING WHITE ACTORS TO PLAY NON-WHITE CHARACTERS HAS A LONG HISTORY IN HOLLYWOOD. EXAMPLES ARE ENDLESS INCLUDING 1965. >> NATALIE WOOD AND GEORGE CAST AS PUERTO RICANS IN WESTSIDE STORY, MICKEY ROONEY'S PORTRAYAL OF A JAPANESE MAN IN BREAKFAST AT TIFFANYS. AND HUNDREDS OF WHITE ACTORS LIKE ROCK HUDSON AS STEREO TYPICAL NATIVE AMERICAN CHARACTERS. >> ALL WHITE MEN ARE THIEVES. >> OUT RIGHT STEREO TYPES HAVE BECOME LESS COMMON IN RECENT DECADES, THE CASTING ISSUE HAS TAKEN LONGER TO CHANGE. IN 2015'S ALOHA, EMMA STONE PLAYED A CHARACTER WITH MIXED ASIAN AND HAWAIIAN HERITAGE. SHE LATER APOLOGIZED. >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I DON'T EVEN KNOW. THAT IS THE KIND OF BAD JOKE. I AM SO TIRED. >> AZARI VOICED APU ON THE SIMPSONS, ALONG WITH DOZENS OF OTHER CHARACTERS, BEFORE FINALLY ANNOUNCING HE WOULD STEP AWAY FROM THE ROLES. >> ONCE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT IT WASN'T JUST 17 HIPSTERS AND A MICRO BREWERY IN BROOKLYN DECIDING WHO SHOULD SAY WHAT AND HOW, BUT IT ACTUALLY AFFECTED PEOPLE OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS, IT WAS KIND OF AN EASY DECISION TO STEP AWAY. >> THE CHANGES COME AMID A BROADER DEBATE OVER AMERICA'S HISTORY OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. LEADING TO THE REMOVAL OF CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS AROUND THE NATION AND REAPPRAISAL OF PAST LEADERS. >> WHAT SIDE OF HISTORY DO YOU STAND ON? >> OVER THE WEEKEND, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY SAID IT WILL REMOVE WOODROW WILSON'S NAME FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY SCHOOL AND ONE OF THE RESIDENTIAL COLLEGES. WILSON'S RACISM WAS SIGNIFICANT AND CONSEQUENTIAL, EVEN BY THE STANDARDS OF HIS OWN TIME, WROTE THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT, CITING WILSON'S SEGREGATION OF THE FEDERAL CIVIL SERVICE AFTER IT HAS BEEN RACIALLY INTEGRATED FOR DECADES, ALONG WITH DOCUMENTED EXAMPLES OF WILSON'S WHITE SUPREMACIST VIEWS. NEW SCRUTINY ON REPRESENTATION FROM THE HALLS OF ACADEMIA, THE CHARACTERS CREATED IN HOLLYWOOD. THERE HAS EVEN BEEN A PUSH TO MAKE A CHANGE IN SPORTS. THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS REMOVED THE NAME OF A FORMER OWNER FROM ITS STADIUM BUT EXISTED CHANGE TO CHANGE THEIR NAME. >>> INTERNET ACCESS IS SOMETHING MANY AMERICANS TAKE FOR GRANTED. >> HOW CAN I SUBMIT EVERYTHING IF WE CAN'T LOG IN? >> FOR MILLIONS OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS WITHOUT ANY ONLINE ACCESS IT CAN BE DEVASTATING. INTERNET SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING THAT JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE AFFLUENT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE. >> IT IS NOT JUST THE INTERNET. IN THE AGE OF CORONAVIRUS, EVERY STUDENT NOW NEEDS A LAPTOP OR A TABLET JUST TO ATTEND SCHOOL, SO IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY MANY HAVE FALLEN BEHIND. >> COVID-19 HAS LITERALLY CHANGED THE NATURE OF K THROUGH 12 EDUCATION. >> Reporter: A NEW STUDY BY COMMON SENSE MEDIA FINDS 30% OF STUDENTS DON'T HAVE THE BASIC INTERNET SERVICE OR THE DEVICES THEY NEED TO ATTEND ONLINE SCHOOL. AROUND 10% OF TEACHERS, 300 TO 400,000 IN ALL LACK THE ESSENTIAL TOOLS TO REACH THEIR STUDENTS. >> IT IS FRUSTRATING FOR THE TEACHERS. THEY'RE CREATING CONTENT. THEY DON'T WANT THEIR STUDENTS TO FALL BEHIND. >> Reporter: THE COST TO EQUIP EVERYONE, BY ONE ESTIMATE IT WILL TAKE $6 BILLION FOR STUDENTS AND ANOTHER BILLION JUST FOR TEACHERS TO BE FULLY CONNECTED. >> THIS IS THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE IN AMERICA'S FUTURE AND IN AMERICA'S YOUNG PEOPLE. WHY NOT TURN THIS CRISIS INTO A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY? >> Reporter: FOR THE WALLACE FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA, IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE SINCE THE DISTRICT MOVED TO ONLINE LEARNING. >> WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO UPGRADE HER INTERNET YET EITHER BECAUSE IT IS NOT A BILL WE'RE READY TO FACTOR IN YET. >> Reporter: THEY DID RECEIVE CHROME BOOKS SO THE TWO SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN COULD CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. >> WE WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS ON OUR OWN, SO IT ALL CAME -- >> A BLESSING. >> A TABLET OR A COMPUTER, IT IS A NECESSITY. >> Reporter: SOMETHING STUDENTS NOW, MORE THAN EVER, CAN'T DO WITHOUT. RURAL AREAS HAVE THE BIGGEST GAP, BUT EVEN IN STATES WITH THE BEST INTERNET ACCESS, ALMOST ONE QUARTER OF STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE, ONLINE SERVICE. A LOT OF DISTRICTS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THIS, NOT WANTING TO LIMIT LEARNING BUT MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THAT LEARNING. SAVANNAH, WILLIE? >> SO INTERESTING. REMOTE LEARNING, DIFFICULT ENOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE INTERNET ACCESS. ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>> THIS MORNING, SOME ARE FURIOUS IN FLORIDA. AS A BATTLE OVER BEACH CLOSURES HEATS UP. THE MAYORS OF THREE FLORIDA CITIES SHOUTED DOWN BY HECKLERS WHILE ANNOUNCING THEIR BEACHES WILL CLOSE FOR THE UP COMING FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND. THIS AS INFECTIONS NATIONWIDE CONTINUE THEIR RAPID RISE. THE U.S., SURPASSING TWO AND A HALF MILLION CASES WITH MORE THAN 125,000 DEATHS. >> THE WINDOW IS CLOSING. WE HAVE TO ACT AND PEOPLE, AS INDIVIDUALS, HAVE TO ACT RESPONSIBLY. WE NEED TO SOCIAL DISTANCE. WE NEED TO WEAR OUR FACE COVERINGS. >> Reporter: THE HEALTH CRISIS, CAUSING TENSIONS TO SPILL OVER. A NORTH HOLLYWOOD WOMAN SHAMED FOR NOT WEARING A MASK INSIDE A TRADER JOE'S. >> SHE IS NOT WEARING A MASK. I HAVE A BREATHING PROBLEM. >> Reporter: IN CALIFORNIA, A CRUSH OF NEW CASES, ESPECIALLY IN L.A., FORCING THE GOVERNOR TO INTERVENE, ISSUING A STATE ORDER SUNDAY, CLOSING BARS AND NIGHTCLUBS IN L.A. COUNTY, AND SIX OTHERS WHILE RECOMMENDING EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA TAKE SIMILAR ACTIONS. OVER THE WEEKEND, RECORD NUMBERS RECORDED IN GEORGIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, NEVADA, AND FLORIDA, WHICH HAD MORE THAN 9,500 NEW CASES ON SATURDAY. GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS SAYS THE BIGGEST INCREASE IS AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE, 25 TO 34. >> THIS IS BASICALLY SOCIALIZING. YOU'RE GOING OUT, YOU'RE DOING DIFFERENT THINGS. >> TO STOP THIS, FLORIDA BANNING DRINKING IN BARS JUST THREE WEEKS AFTER MANY REOPENED. >> WE'RE SHUT DOWN, WE DON'T HAVE A KITCHEN, WE DON'T SERVE FOOD. WE CAN'T OPERATE. >> AFTER RECORDING NEARLY 10,000 CASES IN A SINGLE DAY HERE IN FLORIDA, WE ASKED MIAMI-DADE FLORIDA'S MAYOR ABOUT IT. WHAT HE FINDS UNNERVING IS NOT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CASES BUT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE TESTING POSITIVE. 22%, WHICH IS AN INDICATION OF A HIGHER RATE OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION.   HAS TAKEN A . THIS MORNING AS >>> THIS MORNING, AS CASES SURGE, TEXAS IS PUTTING THE REOPEN IN REVERSE, SETTING A TROUBLING NEW RATE FOR HOSPITALIZATIONS WITH ABOUT 5,500 PATIENTS NOW IN HOSPITAL BEDS. >> IT YOU DON'T NEED TO GET OUT, THERE IS NO REASON TO GO OUT. >> Reporter: TESTING SITES ARE OVERWHELMED. THE LINE AT THIS HOUSTON DRIVE-THRU LOCATION STRETCHING FOR BLOCKS. >> IT IS BETTER TO KNOW THAN NOT TO KNOW. >> SOME PARAMEDICS ARE FACING AN HOUR LONG WAIT TIME TO TRANSFER A PATIENT FROM THE AMBULANCE INTO THE HOSPITAL. BARS ARE CLOSED DOWN AGAIN, AND RESTAURANT CAPACITIES SCALED BACK. >> WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE GO BACKWARDS. >> Reporter: IN DALLAS, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE DONNED A MASK AT A CHURCH WHILE MORE THAN 100 CHOIR MEMBERS SANG SIDE BY SIDE WITHOUT THEM. THE VICE PRESIDENT LATER SAYING THIS -- >> WHERE YOU CAN'T MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING, WEARING A MASK IS JUST A GOOD IDEA. >> TO THE WEST, ARIZONA IS BREAKING RECORDS WITH MORE THAN 3,800 NEW CASES REPORTED SUNDAY AND HOSPITALS INUNDATED. >> WE DON'T HAVE SPACE TO SEE OUR PATIENTS WHO DON'T HAVE COVID. >> ARIZONA'S GOVERNOR HAS NOT REIMPOSED RESTRICTIONS AS CROWDS PACKED ARIZONA RIVERS WITH INNER TUBES THIS WEEKEND, TRYING TO BEAT THE TRIPLE DIGIT HEAT. >> THEY FEAR MEMORIAL DAY CELEBRATIONS PLAYED A ROLE IN SPREADING THE VIRUS. THEY'RE LOOKING AHEAD TO THIS HOLIDAY WEEKEND. THERE WILL BE A 15-MINUTE FIRE WORK SESSION. THEY'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO WATCH ON TV OR FROM THEIR YARD >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THAT O >>> HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. I'M SURE YOU HEARD THE HHS SECRETARY, ALEX AZAR'S WARNING THAT THE WINDOW IS CLOSING FOR US TO TAKE ACTION AND GET THIS UNDER CONTROL. DO YOU AGREE? WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW? >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON. I DO AGREE WITH SECRETARY AZAR. WINDOW IS NARROW. THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE VIRUS. IF YOU FALL BEHIND AS WE HAVE, YOU HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY AND AGGRESSIVELY. WE CAN'T HAVE BARS, I'M NOT SURE WE CAN HAVE RESTAURANTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE SITTING INDOORS, NIGHTCLUBS, ANYTHING THAT GATHERS PEOPLE IN DOORS I THINK AT THIS MOMENT IS WAY TOO RISKY AND HAS TO BE DIALLED BACK. >> WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS RISE TO? SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE MEMORIAL DAY CROWDS. SOME PEOPLE WONDER IF THE PROTESTS WILL LEAD TO MORE VIRUS CASES SPIKING. THE LACK OF WEARING MASKS UNIFORMLY. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEHIND IT? >> I THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE THINGS. THE THINGS THAT ARE RISKY, MOST OF THESE STATES OPEN WHEN THE UNDER LYING LEVEL OF CASES WAS SO HIGH, THEY WEREN'T COMING DOWN. I THINK THEY DIDN'T MEET THE GUIDELINES FOR OPENING UP AND THEN GATHERINGS, ESPECIALLY INDOOR GATHERINGS, BARS, RESTAURANTS, THOSE ARE PARTICULARLY RISKY. NONE HAD MANDATORY MASK LAWS. PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER, THAT IS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS THAT HAS LED US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. >> NOW WE'RE CLOSING IN ON ANOTHER BIG HOLIDAY, FOURTH OF JULY, WHAT WOULD YOUR MESSAGE BE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING A GATHERING, EVEN A GATHERING OUTSIDE OR EXPANDING THEIR CIRCLES RIGHT NOW. >> IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE HOT ZONES, THEN REALLY, I THINK PEOPLE HAVE TO RETHINK ANY LARGE GATHERING, WHETHER INDOORS OR OUTDOORS. IN DOOR GATHERINGS ARE VERY RISKY. OUTDOORS ARE BETTER. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A BACKYARD BARBECUE AND CAN KEEP SOCIALLY DISTANCED FROM YOUR NEIGHBORS, I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY OKAY. I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE WEARING A MASK AND WE HAVE TO REALLY TRY OUR BEST TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF RISK BECAUSE THE HOSPITALS ARE GETTING PRETTY STRETCHED ACROSS MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. >> WE SAW THE IMAGES, LONG LINES WAITING FOR TESTING IN THE HOT SPOT STATES. BY THE WAY, VERY CLOSE TOGETHER, WAITING FOR TESTING. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? >> MANY OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TESTING FOR MONTHS. MANY HAVE BEEN BORED TALKING ABOUT TESTING. HERE WE ARE. WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT TESTING. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT HOURS TO GET A MEDICAL TEST THAT MANY KNEW WE HAVE NEEDED FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS. WHEN WE HEAR WE HAVE TOO MANY TESTS OR PLENTY OF TESTS, REALLY THEY'RE MAKING PEOPLE NERVOUS. IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY COULD BE SPACED OUT. >> THESE ARE URGENT DAYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. WE APPRECIATE IT.   >>> OVERNIGHT, THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTING THAT ACCORDING TO U.S. INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS. >> RUSSIAN BOUNTDYS MAY HAVE RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF SEVERAL U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS.

HE WAS AN NF INNOCENT YOUNG  MAN WHO HAD  NEVER HAD  CONFRONTATIONS  WITH THE POLICE.  >>  ITHE AUTOPSY  WAS INCONCLUSIVE  FINDING THE  MANNER OF DEATH  TO BE ED UNDETERMINED  SAYING IT  COULD'VE BEEN AN  ACCIDENT,  NATURAL DEATH OR  HOMICIDE.  POLICE HAVE  BANNED THE USE  OF THE CHOKEHOLD  USED ON HIM.  >>> ACROSS THE  COUNTRY  CORONAVIRUS  CASES CONTINUE  TO BREAK  RECORDS.

THE WINDOW IS BL CLOSING.  WE HAVE TO ACT.  THE NUMBER \n AOF  WEEKLY DESK \nFROM  COVID-19 IS  DECLINING.  IT DIPPED INTO  THE HUNDREDS.  THAT IS DOWN  FROM THE TENS OF  THOUSANDS OF  WEEKLY DEATHS AT  THE HEIGHT OF  THE PANDEMIC IN  THE SPRING.  EXPERTS CAUTION  THE PUBLIC TO  REMEMBER THAT  HOSPITALIZATIONS  AND DEATHS ARE  LAGGING  INDICATORS OF  COVID-19.  >> SOON YOU TWILL  BE SEEING MORE  DEATHS.  THEY ARE COMING  DOWN AS A  COUNTRY BUT THAT  DOESN'T MEAN  THAT YOU'RE NOT  GOING TO SEE  THEM COMING UP.  >> THE  POSITIVITY RATE  IN CALIFORNIA,  TEXAS AND  ARIZONA ARE ON  THE RISE.

CONVEY THE VIRUS. PEOPLE ARE BEING  TREATED WITH  OXYGEN AND  PLACED ON THEIR  STOMACHS TO ALLOW BETTER BLOOD AND  O2 FLOW.  PATIENTS ARE  GETTING  CONVALESCENT  PLAZA AND  STEROIDS. STILL  EXPERTS ARE  REMINDING  AMERICANS NOT TO  LOSE  PERSPECTIVE.  >> 120 DAYS AGO  COVID-19 WAS NOT  IN THE TOP 75  CAUSES OF DEATH.  IN APRIL AND MAY  IT WAS THE  NUMBER ONE CAUSE  OF DEATH.  WE HAVE NOT ERSEEN  THAT HAPPEN  SINCE 1918.  WE ARE GOING TO  SEE THE NUMBER  OF DEATHS EGO UP  AGAIN.  IT WILL CYCLE UP  AND DOWN.  >> WE HAVE HEARD  THE TERM HERD  IMMUNITY.

IN ORDER TO GET  TO THE BIG  NUMBER THEY  SUGGEST  ULTIMATELY WE  WILL SEE 50 TO  70% OF THE  POPULATION  HAVING BEEN  EXPOSED TO  COVERT.  NOW YOU ARE  TALKING ABOUT  225 MILLION  PEOPLE IN A  POPULATION OF  320 MILLION.  WE HAVE A LONG  WAY TO TOGO BEFORE  WE HIT THOSE TT NUMBERS.  >> OKAY.

I WILL TELL YOU,  MY KIDS WERE  WATCHING TO.  I WAS P ND AAMAZED  BECAUSE I  I THOUGHT IT WAS  COOL.  I BRING THIS UP  BECAUSE IT MAKES  ME REALIZE THAT  THESE ARTISTS  HAVE SUCH A  POWERFUL  PLATFORM.  WHEN THEY SPEAK,  PEOPLE LISTEN.  >> YES.  IT'S HARD TO  IGNORE SOME OF E THAT.  >> THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  >> WITH ALL THE  WORRIES ABOUT A  SECOND WAVE OF  COVID-19 IN  CITIES WHAT IS  HAPPENING IN  BEIJING COULD AL PROVIDE A  GLIMPSE AT THE % FUTURE.  WHAT LIFE COULD  LOOK LIKE WHEN  THEY'RE FRESH  OUTBREAKS AND  THERE WILL BE  OUTBREAKS.  WITH NEW CASES  ANNOUNCED MOST  OLD RITUALS  RETURNED LIKE  TEMPERATURE  CHECKS.  THE REASON FOR  THE TOTAL  LOCKDOWN, NOBODY  WANTS TO DOSTIFLE  ANY MOMENTUM THE  ECONOMY MIGHT  HAVE.  THERE IS A MORE  RESTRAINED  APPROACH.  THE STRATEGY  HERE IS TESTING,  A LOT OF IT.  THERE ARE 5000  SITES SET UP AND  HANDLE N  AT HALF NTMILLION  TESTS A DAY.  THEY CAN  INCREASE TO 1  MILLION IF THEY  HAVE TO.  THE GOVERNMENT  SAYS 2.8 MILLION  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  TESTED IN JUST  OVER THONE WEEK.  THEY FOUND FEWER  THAN 250 CASES  AND THERE ARE  SITES  EVERYWHERE.  SOCCER FIELDS,  HOSPITALS AND A  SWAB IN THE  THROAT AND MAYBE  SOME GAGGING.  IT TAKES LESS  THAN ONE MINUTE  TO GET A TEST.  ANYONE CAN GET  TESTED.  MOST PEOPLE ARE  NEGATIVE.  WE HAVE SPECIAL  ACCESS TO THE  TESTING SITE.  IT WAS RUNNING  LIKE CLOCKWORK.  HERE'S HOW IT  WORKS.  THEY PUBLICIZED  THAT THIS  TESTING.  ANYONE CAN GET  IN TOUCH WITH  THEIR  NEIGHBORHOOD  COMMITTEE AND  THEN THEY GET  TOLD WHEN AND  WHERE TO SHOW UP  AND EVERYTHING  IS ORGANIZED.  >> THE VIRUS IS  LINKED TO A  WHOLESALE FOOD  MARKET.  IT PROVIDES 80%  OF THE CITY'S  FOOD.  PEOPLE WERE  FREAKING OUT  ABOUT THE FOOD S  SUPPLY AND  SALMON WAS  BLAMED.  OFFICIALS DEBUNK  THAT.  NEIGHBORHOODS  WERE LOCKED DOWN  AND THAT'S WHEN  BIG DATA KICKED  IN USING T O CONTAC  TRACING  INCLUDING  CASHLESS PAYMENT  TRANSACTIONS AND  GPS.  PATIENCE WERE  FOUND. CI  FROM HIM  OFFICIALS  RETRACED HIS  STEPS AND THAT  GREW INTO  250,000  CONTACTS.  >> BEIJING IS  GOING BIG ON  TESTING AT A  TIME WHEN THE  U.S. TESTING  STRATEGY IS  CONFUSED.  PRESIDENT TRUMP  CLAIMS A SURGE  IN CASES IS  BECAUSE THEY ARE  FINDING NEW  CASES.  PUBLIC HEALTH  OFFICIALS SAY  THAT IS TRUE BUT  THE DATA SHOWS  THE VIRUS IS  SPREADING MORE.  THERE IS NO  DEBATE HERE IN  CHINA.  TENS OF MILLIONS  OF DOLLARS ARE  BEING SPENT.  CERTAIN GROUPS  AND HEALTHCARE  WORKERS HAD TO  BE TESTED.  FOR EVERYONE  ELSE IT  IS  ENCOURAGED AND  PEOPLE SEEM OKAY  WITH IT.  >> I FEEL SAFER.  IT IS ALSO A  SECURITY  GUARANTEE FOR MY  FAMILY AND  FRIENDS.  >> IT TOOK JUST  OVER A WEEK FOR  OFFICIALS TO  DECLARE THE  OUTBREAK  CONTAINED.  ALL OF THIS, THE  TESTING, TRAVEL  RESTRICTIONS IN  AND OUT OF THE  CITY, MASS, T  PEOPLE WORKING  FROM HOME, IT IS  ALL PART OF A  CYCLE OF  PANDEMIC LIFE  THAT EXPERTS SAY  WE NEED TO GET  USED TO UNTIL  THERE IS A  VACCINE.  REOPENING  RESTRICTIONS,  REPEAT.  >> POLICE  DEPARTMENTS  NATIONWIDE ARE  UNDER A  MICROSCOPE THIS  SUMMER AND A  PIECE OF %W. TECHNOLOGY THAT  SOME DEPARTMENTS  USE IS UNDER  FIRE AND THAT IS  PUT FACIAL  RECOGNITION.  JACOB MOORE  JOINS ME.  YOU SPOKE TO A  MAN WHO WAS  WRONGLY ELECTED.  WHAT HAPPENED TO  HIM?  >> IT IS AN  INCREDIBLE  STORY.  THIS IS PERHAPS  THE FIRST KNOWN G   INSTANCE IN  WHICH SOMEONE  HAS BEEN  ARRESTED BECAUSE  OF FACIAL  RECOGNITION.  IN THIS CASE  SOMETHING THAT  -- FIRST KNOWN  TO BE WRONGLY  ARRESTED USING  FACIAL  RECOGNITION.  ROBERT WILLIAMS  BASICALLY CAME  HOME AND WAS PUT  UNDER ARREST ON  HIS FRONT STOOP  IN FRONT OF HIS  TWO YOUNG  DAUGHTERS AND  HIS WIFE BECAUSE  DETROIT POLICE  HAD USED FACIAL  RECOGNITION TO  PICK THEM OUT  FROM AN INSTANT  IN WHICH SOMEONE  HAD SHOPLIFTED  WATCHES.  HE DESCRIBED TO  US WHAT IT WAS  LIKE TO SEE HOW  WRONG THEY HAD  GOTTEN IT. HE  SPENT THE NIGHT  IN JAIL.  AN INNOCENT MAN.  HE WAS BEING  PRESENTED WITH  WHAT WAS BLURRY  PHOTOGRAPHS AND  A PICTURE OF HIS  DRIVERS LICENSE.  HE TELLS US WHAT  IT'S LIKE TO  LOOK AT SUCH  INACCURATE  EVIDENCE.  LIKE I LOOKED AT  THE PAPER AND IT  MADE ME CHUCKLE  I SAID, THAT'S  NOT ME.  >> I FIXED THAT  ONE. I PUT IT TO  MY FACE AND I  SAID I HOPE YOU  DON'T THINK ALL  BLACK PEOPLE  LOOK ALIKE.  I DROPPED IT  BACK ON THE  TABLE.  HE FLIPPED THE  THIRD PIECE OF  PAPER.  HE WAS  IRRITATED.  HE SAID SOUT I  GUESS THE  COMPUTER GOT IT  WRONG?  >> THIS IS  REALLY THE THING  THAT TIPPED OFF  HIS FAMILY AND  THENEY THEY  REACHED OUT TO  THE ACLU AND  RETAINED COUNSEL  AND FIGURED OUT AL THAT HE HAD IN  FACT BEEN  GRABBED BECAUSE  OF A MISSED  IDENTIFICATION  THROUGH FACIAL  RESIGNATION.  THE FIRST KNOWN  TIME THIS IS .  HAPPENED.  AN AREA OF  INCREDIBLE  CONCERN IS THIS  TECHNOLOGY TAKES  OFF.  >> YES.  WHAT DO POLICE  SAY ABOUT THIS % AND WHAT ACTION KN ARE THEY TAKING?  >> THE DETROIT  POLICE  DEPARTMENT WAS  WORKING WITH THE  DATA PAYS RUN BY  MICHIGAN STATE  POLICE.  IF YOU LOOK AT  THE  INVESTIGATION  REPORT, THE  SEARCH RESULTS  GIVEN TO THE  DETROIT PD IT  SAYS ACROSS THE  TOP THIS CANNOT  BE USED AS A  CAUSE FOR  ARREST.  YOU HAVE TO  DEVELOP OTHER  EVIDENCE YET  THAT IS EXACTLY  WHAT THE DETROIT  POLICE  DEPARTMENT DID.  THE CHIEF OF  POLICE SAID THIS  WAS AN  INVESTIGATIVE  MISTAKE AND THEY  DID NOT DO THIS  RIGHT.  THERE ARE NEW E  POLICIES IN  PLACE THAT THEY  WILL FROM NOW ON  ONLY USE FACIAL  RECOGNITION FOR  VIOLENT CRIMES  AND HOME  INVASIONS.  IT WILL NOW TAKE  TWO EXAMINERS TO  T  RATIFY.  HE DID NOT WANT  TO THROW OUT THE  TECHNOLOGY.  HE SAID IT CAN  BE A USEFUL  THING WE JUST  NEED NEW  POLICIES TO MAKE  IT HAPPEN.  THE ACLU DOESN'T  FEEL THAT WAY  AND OTHER  CRITICS HAVE  SAID THIS  TECHNOLOGY IS  FRAUGHT WITH  PROBLEMS.  >> HOW ABOUT THE  COMPANY THAT  CREATES FACIAL  RECOGNITION  TECHNOLOGY.  WHAT DO THEY SAY  ABOUT THE  ACCURACY AND HOW  IT IS BEING  USED?  >> THE THBIG  COMPANIES THAT  YOU AND I HAVE  HEARD OF LIKE  AMAZON WHICH  MAKES FACIAL  RECOGNITION  SYSTEMS AND HAVE  SOLD THEM TO  LAWN FOR CEMENT  ARE TAKING A  BREAK.  IBM, AMAZON,  MICROSOFT, THEY  HAVE A  MORATORIUM ON  SELLING IT IN  SOME CASES AT  ALL AND AMAZON  SAYS THEY WILL  PAUSE ON SELLING  IT FOR AT LEAST  A YEAR.  THIS IS TAKING  IT TURNED.  THE THING IS THE  COMPANY THAT 10  TO SERVE LAW  ENFORCEMENT OR  COMPANIES WE'VE  NEVER HEARD OF.  WE WERE IN  CONTACT WITH Y ONE  OF THE  COMPANIES, RANK  ONE.  THEIR TECHNOLOGY  HAS BEEN  MEANT  BENCHMARKED  USING FEDERAL  STANDARDS. THE  -- THIS WAS  MISUSE THEY  SAID.  YOU PUT TWO  BLURRY  PHOTOGRAPHS IN  AND THE COMPUTER  CANNOT READ IT. HI THE ACADEMICS WE  SPEAK TO SAY  THIS CANNOT BE  TRUSTED.  THERE'S A LONG  HISTORY OF THIS  MISS READING  BLACK PEOPLE SO  WE SHOULD NOT  PUT THIS TO USE  ON A CATEGORY OF  AMERICANS THAT  HAVE BEEN E,OVER  SURVEILLED BY  POLICE.  >> OKAY.  A BILL  ADDRESSING  FACIAL  RECOGNITION  TECHNOLOGY WAS  INTRODUCED  THURSDAY.  WHAT IS IN IT?  >>ATAL WELL, THIS I  AN INTERESTING  DEVELOPMENT.  TWO SENATORS PUT  FORTH A PROPOSAL  TO BAN THE  USE  OF FACIAL  RECOGNITION BY  LAW ENFORCEMENT  AND THEY WOULD  ALSO CUT FEDERAL  FUNDING FOR  STATE AND LOCAL  LAW ENFORCEMENT  IF THOSE  AGENCIES  CONTINUE TO USE  FACIAL  RECOGNITION.  SO A VERY ITREBIG  MOVE.  THIS IS THAT A  TIME WHEN SAN  FRANCISCO AND  OAKLAND HAVE  BANDED.  BOSTON SAID THEY  WILL BANDED AS  WELL.  IN ALL CASES  THERE IS AN  EFFICIENCY OF  LAW ENFORCEMENT  THAT WAS  PROMISED TO  PEOPLE AND AS  RESEARCHERS HAVE  POINTED OUT, T IT  DOESN'T PAN OUT  THAT WAY.  EVEN A PERFECT  VERSION OF THIS  IS RIGHT FOR  MISUSE.  EVERYONE SEEMS  TO BE STEPPING  BACK WANTING TO  PULL BACK OMIN REGULATED IN  SOME WAY.  IN THE MEANTIME  YOU'RE SEEING  THOUSANDS OF  POLICE  DEPARTMENT  MAKING THEIR OWN  RULES AND BUYING  FROM COMPANIES  WE HAVE NEVER  HEARD OF AND IN ALGQ THIS CASE  ARRESTING THE  WRONG MAN.  >> OKAY.  QUITE A STORY.  THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  >> I APPRECIATE  IT.  >> A SECURITY  CAMERA PICKS UP  THIS 23-YEAR- OLD, A LIAR. HE  WAS BUYING SOFT  DRINKS. 'S FAMILY LAWYER  TOLD US HE WAS  IN THE HABIT OF  WEARING THIS  MASK.  HIS FAMILY TOLD  US THIS WAS A  SIGNATURE MASS.  AT 1030 HE CALLS  911.  >> OKAY.  WHERE THERE ANY  THINGS  MENTIONED?  >> OKAY.  WHAT COLOR IS  THE MASK? WHAT  DOES IT LOOK  LIKE?  >> IT IS BLACK.  >> IS IT LIKE A  SKI MASK?  WHAT TYPE OF  MASK IS IT?  >> YES I.E.  SKI MASS.  >> HE IS WALKING  HOME FROM A  SHELL GAS STATION . HE IS HOLDING  A PLASTIC BAG  WITH HIS  PURCHASES.  AT 10:43 POLICE  OFFICERS SPOTTED  HIM.  STOP RIGHT THERE. I AM GOING TO  STOP YOU BECAUSE  YOU'RE BEING SO  SUSPICIOUS.  >> THEY MAKE  PHYSICAL  CONTACT.  AT 10:44 THIS  OFFICER IS ON  THE SCENE AS  WELL.  >> I AM  SPEAKING.  >> RELAX.  >> I'M GOING  HOME.  RELAXER I'M  GOING TO HAVE TO  CHANGE THE  SITUATION.  >> NO.  >> NO.  HE STARTED TO  ARREST ME.  I WAS LISTENING  TO MUSIC.  LET GO OF ME.  >> THE OFFICERS  TRY TO MOVE HIM  ONTO THE GRASS.  THE BODY CAMERA  WAS THROWN TO  THE GROUND.  >> THE OFFICERS  SAYS THIS.  >> IT IS UNCLEAR  FROM THE BODY  CAMERA WHETHER  OR NOT McLEAN  REACHED FOR AN  OFFICERS WEAPON.  ALL THREE  OFFICERS  WRESTLED HIM TO  THE GROUND.  WE NEED MORE  UNITS.  WE ARE FIGHTING  HIM.  >> AT THIS  MOMENT ONE  OFFICER USES A  CAROTID CONTROL.  IT RESTRICTS  BLOOD TO THE  BRAIN.  RESPONDING  OFFICERS TOLD  THE POLICE  INVESTIGATOR  THAT HE BRIEFLY  WENT UNCONSCIOUS  AND THE OFFICERS  RELEASED HIM.  AT 10:46, TWO  MINUTES AFTER  THE FIRST  OFFICER MADE  CONTACT WITH  HIM, McLEAN HAS  BEEN TO THE  GROUND.  >> I CAN'T  BREATHE.  >> I CAN'T  BREATHE.  >> I CAN'T  BREATHE.  >> HE WAS OUT.  >> HE'S COMING  THROUGH.  >> I CAN'T  BREATHE.  >> HELLO,  EVERYONE.  LAW IN ORDER ARE  THE BUILDING  BLOCKS TO THE  AMERICAN DREAM.  IT'S ANARCHY  THAT IS  PREVAILING AND IT DREAM COMES  TREMBLING DOWN.  ANARCHY IN OUR  STREET IS  UNACCEPTABLE AND  ANGER IS NOT  ENOUGH.  YOU HAVE A  PRESIDENT  COMMITTED TO  ACTION.  100 AND ARCUS  HAVE %BEEN  ARRESTED.  THE DOJ HAS ALSO  CHARGED FOR MEN  IN FEDERAL COURT  FOR INATTEMPTING  TO TEAR DOWN  A  STATUE OF  ANDREW  JACKSON.  THE FBI HAS 200  OPEN DOMESTIC  TERRORISM  INVESTIGATIONS  ONGOING.  THERE IS A TASK  FORCE ON THVIOLENT  EXTREMIST LED BY  THE U.S.  ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE IN NEW  JERSEY AND U.S. S. ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE IN  NORTHERN TEXAS.  WITH 200 TRUMP  REPORTED JUDGES  CONFIRMED THE  ROLE OF LAW WILL  BE UPHELD.  DEMOCRATS AT ALL  LEVELS HAVE DONE  NOTHING.  DEMOCRATS  BLOCKED  BIPARTISAN  POLICE REFORM.  THE KEDEMOCRATIC  GOVERNOR FAILED  TO DEPLOY THE  NATIONAL GUARD.  IT TOOK  PRESIDENT TRUMP  FOR THAT TO  EVENTUALLY  TOPPEN.'S  SUGGESTION AND  DISSENT WAS INTO  CHAOS.  THREE COUNCIL  MEMBERS VOTED TO  ABOLISH THE  POLICE WHY THEY  GOT A PRIVATE  SECURITY DETAIL. CU THE DEMOCRATIC  MAYOR CALLED  THIS THE  ECONOMIST ZONE  AND THE LLSUMMER  OF LOVE.  IT IS ANYTHING  BUT THAT.  THERE ARE  MULTIPLE  SHOOTING THAT  DESPERATE PLEAS  FOR HELP.  11 PEOPLE WERE  12 HOURS   THIS WEEKEND IN  NEW YORK CITY  AND 61 PEOPLE  WERE SHOT IN  CHICAGO AND 16  FATALLY KILLED  IN DEMOCRATIC  STATES AND  DEMOCRATIC  CITIES.  LET'S BE CLEAR,  THE RAPID  DESTRUCTION OF  STATUES IS NOT  A  PART OF ANY  APOLOGY.  IT'S ANARCHY IS S  FAILED BY  LEADERSHIP.  THESE STATUES  ARE GREAT WORKS  OF ART AND  REPRESENT OUR  HISTORY AND  HERITAGE, THE  GOOD AND THE  BAD.  WE MUST  UNDERSTAND AND  REMEMBER EVEN IN  TURBULENT TIMES  AND TO LEARN  FROM THEM.  LET US STAND FOR  LAW AND ORDER  AND PEACE IN OUR  STREETS AND  AGAINST ANARCHY.  THIS  IS  PRESIDENTS DRUMS  A VISION FOR THE  FUTURE.  >> THANK YOU.  >> I KNOW YOU  SAID PRESIDENT  TRUMP WAS NOT  BREEZED BRIEFED  ON THESE REPORTS  ABOUT THIS BUT  CAN YOU SAY HE  WAS N BRIEFED TODAY ?  >> THE U.S.  RECEIVES  THOUSANDS OF  REPORTS DAILY ON  INTELLIGENCE AND  THEY ARE SUBJECT  TO SCRUTINY.  THE WHITE %HOUSE  THNOT .% ROUTINELY  COMMENT ON THAT  BUT THE CSA  DIRECTOR AND  CHIEF OF STAFF  CAN CONFIRM THAT  THE PRESIDENT  AND VICE  PRESIDENT IT  WERE NOT BRIEFED  ON THIS.

THE VERACITY OF  THE ALLEGATIONS  CONTINUE TO BE  EVALUATED.  >> IS HE UPSET  THAT COTHIS WAS  SHARED WITH THE  BRITISH  GOVERNMENT BUT  NOT HIM?  >> I HAVE NO    FURTHER COMMENT  ON THAT.  >> THANK ENYOU.  >> HOW DOES THE  PRESIDENT WANT  THIS %TO CONTINUE? >> AS I NOTED,  THERE WAS NOT A  CONSENSUS AMONG  THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY.  IT WOULD NOT BE  ELEVATED TO THE  PRESIDENT UNTIL  IT WAS VERIFIED.  >> SO [  INAUDIBLE ] I  HAVE NO FURTHER  DETAILS ON THE  PRESIDENTS  PRIVATE  CORRESPONDENCE.  >> SO, WHAT I  CAN TELL YOU  ABOUT THAT IS  THAT LAST NIGHT, OU THE CHIEF OF  STAFF, MARK  MEADOWS, CALLED  SENATOR  McCONNELL AND  CONGRESSMAN  FEUER AND SAID  HE WOULD BE % BRIEFING EIGHT  MEMBERS FROM THE  COMMITTEES OF % JURISDICTION.  THERE WAS A  BIPARTISAN  INDICATION  EXTENDED BUT NO  FURTHER DETAILS.  >> IS THAT GOING  TO HAPPEN TODAY? AN >> IT WAS  ONGOING WHEN I  CAME OUT HERE.  IT STARTED ABOUT  30 MINUTES PRIOR  TO THE TIME I  CAME OUT HERE.  >> IS IT  CONCERNING THAT  THERE COULD BE  SOME CREDIBILITY ER TO THIS REPORT  AND THEY HAVE  RELEASED  MILITANTS TO  KILL %AMERICAN  TROOPS.  [ INAUDIBLE ]  >> INTELLIGENCE  IS VERIFIED  BEFORE IT  REACHES THE  PRESIDENT.  IN THIS CASE IT  WAS NOT  VERIFIED.  I WOULD NOTE  THAT WHEN THE  PRESIDENT MOVES  -- SHE NEVER  HESITATES TO ACT  WHEN THERE IS A  THREAT TO OUR  SERVICEMEN AND  WOMEN.  IN 2018 IN SYRIA % A WHEN MERCENARIES  WERE KILLED  IN A  STRIKE.  WHEN U.S.  COALITION  PARTNERS HAVE  BEEN DIRECTED TO  NOT AS  HESITATED TO  ACT.  >> NOT EVERYTHING IN THE DAILY  BRIEF IS  AIRTIGHT.  SO DOES THE  PRESIDENT KNOW  WHAT THEY %ARE  HEARING?  >> THE NATIONAL  SECURITY COUNCIL  EVALUATES  INTELLIGENT  REPORTS AND THEY  REACH THE  PRESIDENT AS  NECESSARY.  >> DOES THE  PRESIDENT PLAN  ON HOLDING % ANYONE  ACCOUNTABLE.  >> I WON'T  SPECULATE ON  WHETHER THIS IS  VERIFIED OR NOT,  I WON'T GET  AHEAD OF THE  PRESIDENT ON  FURTHER ACTION  BUT I WOULD % POINT OUT --  >> THERE ARE  DISSENTING  OPINIONS.  I CAN CONFIRM  WITH YOU THAT  THERE IS NO  CONSENSUS ON  THESE  ALLEGATIONS.  FURTHER I WOULD  POINT OUT, I  DON'T GET AHEAD  OF THE PRESIDENT  ON ACTIONS BUT  HE HAS BEEN [  INAUDIBLE ].  THERE ARE OTHER  ACTIONS.  >> I HAVE NO  FURTHER  NOTIFICATIONS  FOR YOU OTHER  THAN TO SAY  THERE IS NO  CONSENSUS AND  THERE ARE  DISSENTING  OPINIONS.  >> YOU DON'T  THINK THIS  REPORT E IS TRUE?  I'M TELLING YOU  THERE IS NO  CONSENSUS AND  NEED OPINIONS  FROM THE  INTELLIGENCE % COMMUNITY IS  DIFFERENT.  >> THIS MORNING  YOU SAID [  INAUDIBLE ] DOES  THE PRESIDENT  TWEEAND READ  TO READ OTHER  PEOPLE'S VIDEOS.  >> HE DID AND HE  DID NOT HEAR  THAT PARTICULAR  PHRASE.  >> DO YOU HAVE [  INAUDIBLE ] I  WOULD SAY THAT  IS THE D DECISION  FOR MISSISSIPPI ISFO TO MAKE.  IT IS  COMMENDABLE THAT  THEY  MTOOK THIS  ACTION IN A  LAWFUL MANNER.  >> [ INAUDIBLE ]  DOES THE  PRESIDENT HAVE A  SPECIFIC MESSAGE  FOR MOSCOW GIVEN  THESE REPORTS?  >> NO.  HE  %RTIS NOT  BRIEFED ON THE  MATTER.  THERE IS NO  CONSENSUS AMONG  THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY.  THERE ARE  DIFFERENT  OPINIONS.  >> OKAY.%  HAS THE  PRESIDENT STATUS  ON WEARING A  MASK CHANGED  AT  ALL? I TALKED TO  THE PRESIDENT  BEFORE COMING  OUT HERE.  IT IS HIS CHOICE  TO WEAR A S MASK.  IT IS A PERSONAL  CHOICE. HE  ENCOURAGES  PEOPLE TO MAKE  WHATEVER  DECISION IS BEST  FOR THEM.  HE SAID HE  HAS  NO PROBLEM WITH  MASK AND DO  WHATEVER YOUR  LOCAL  JURISDICTION  REQUEST OF L YOU.  >> WHAT  INFORMATION DO  YOU HAVE ON  WEARING MASKS?  >> THERE IS NO  CONSENSUS.  I WOULD ALSO  NOTE THAT FOR  THOSE OF YOU  THAT ARE TAKING  THE NEW ATYORK  THEIR AT  WORD, THEY  ERRONEOUSLY  REPORTED THE  PRESIDENT WAS  BRIEFED ON THIS.  HE NOR THE VICE  PRESIDENT WERE.  FALSELY DATED  SOMETHING ABOUT  THE PRESIDENT  AND WAITING FOR  THE FAX TO COME  OUT AND THERE IS  NO CONSENSUS T IN  THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY AND  THERE ARE  DISSENTING  OPINIONS.  >> OKAY.  [ INAUDIBLE . ] HE  WAS NOT  PERSONALLY  BRIEFED ON THE T  MATTER.  THAT IS ALL I  KNOW.  THE CIA DIRECTOR  AND NATIONAL  SECURITY OFFICER  CAN CONFIRM THAT  NEITHER THE  PRESIDENT OR  VICE PRESIDENT  WAS BRIEFED.  % >> OKAY.  THE WINDOW IS  CLOSING.  THIS IS CASE IS  ON THE RISE.  IT IS A VERY  SERIOUS TIME.  THERE WAS A  BRIEFING FRIDAY.  WHAT IS A  PRESIDENTS  MESSAGE TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE  AND WHY ARE WE  SEEING HIM TALK  TO THE PUBLIC  AND ENCOURAGE  THEM TO DO  THINGS TO  STAY  SAFE.  >> THERE IS A  TASK FORCE  BRIEFING ON  FRIDAY WHERE ALL  OF THESE  QUESTIONS THE  AMERICAN PUBLIC  AD WERE  ADDRESSED.  WE ARE  ENCOURAGED TO  SEE THAT  FATALITIES ARE  COMING DOWN.  THE SUNDAY I  BELIEVE WE HAD L E . FACO OUR LOWEST  FATALITY RATE  SINCE MARCH 22.  THAT SIGNALS TO  US THAT WE ARE  GETTING PEOPLE  IN THE  COMMUNITIES.  THOSE BEING  AFFECTED ARE  UNDER THE AGE OF  35.  WE ARE TESTING  PEOPLE IN  COMMUNITIES.  THERE ARE EMBERS  THAT NEED TO BE  PUT OUT. EE THESE SIGNS OF  DECREASING  FATALITY AND AN  INCREASE IN HAND  THE THERAPEUTICS  WE HAVE  IDENTIFIED THEY  ARE WORKING TO  REDUCE HOSPITAL  TIME.  THESE THINGS  MAKE US UNIQUELY  EQUIPPED TO  HANDLE THE  INCREASE IN  CASES WE HAVE  SEEN.  >> IS THERE A  NATIONAL  CONVERSATION  GOING ON %RIGHT  NOW OF  CONFEDERACY  STATUES,  MEMORIALS AND  NAMES.  THE PRESIDENT  HAS SAID [ ERAN INAUDIBLE ]. WHY  TOMORROW  MEMORIAL OUR  EYES THE % CONFEDERACY.  DOES PRESIDENT  TRUMP BELIEVE IT  IS A GOOD THING  THAT THE SOUTH  LOST THE CIVIL  WAR?  AND IT'S GOING  TO BAN THE  CONFEDERATE  FLAG?  >> THE FIRST  QUESTION IS  ABSURD.  WITH REGARD TO  STATUES, 60% OF  RESPONDENTS SAID  THE STATUE  SHOULD REMAIN  IN  71% SAID LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS  SHOULD BLOCK  GROUPS FROM  TEARING DOWN  THESE STATUES.  >> THAT IS A  QUESTION FOR THE  CAMPAIGN.  THE PRESIDENT  DOES FIX  PROBLEMS.  HE IS KEEPING  OUR STRAIGHT  STREETS SAFE AND  SECURE.  I THINK THOSE  WHO WORK TEARING  DOWN STATUES  HAVE NO IDEOLOGY  HANS CHRISTIAN  HAIG DIED  FIGHTING FOR THE  CIVIL WAR.  A MONUMENT TO  FALLEN POLICE  OFFICERS WAS  VANDALIZED %IN  SACRAMENTO. THIS  IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THAT IS WHY  THERE IS AN  EXECUTIVE ORDER  SAYING THOSE  TEARING DOWN  STATUES WILL BE  PROSECUTED HE  STANDS WITH 71%  OF AMERICANS  THAT SAYS THERE  IS NO PLACE FOR  TEARING DOWN  STATUES.  >> THANK YOU.  I HAVE A COUPLE  THINGS.  [ INAUDIBLE ]  CAN YOU GIVE US  SOME INFO CAON HOW  THE STATES [  INAUDIBLE ]  >> I DON'T HAVE  ANY UPDATES FOR  YOU ON PHASE 4.  THE PRESIDENT PR HAS MENTIONED  FOR THE LAST  THREE YEARS HE  IS KEEN ON  DEMOCRATS  WORKING WITH US  AND SEEING A  PAYROLL TAX  HOLIDAY TO HELP  LOW-WAGE WORKERS . THESE ARE REAL  AND EFFECTIVE  MEASURES THAT  COULD HELP THE   AMERICAN PEOPLE.  THE ONUS IS ON  DEMOCRATS TO TH COME TO THE  NEGOTIATING  TABLE.  >> I WON'T GET  AHEAD OF THE  PRESIDENT OR  THOSE  NEGOTIATIONS.  >> OKAY.  [ INAUDIBLE ]  , >> THAT WILL BE  A DECISION FOR  THE COURTS AND  JURIES TO MAKE.  THE PRESIDENT IS  KEEN ON SEEING  THESE ACTIONS  BROUGHT TO  JUSTICE BECAUSE  TEARING DOWN  MONUMENTS IS  DEFACING FEDERAL  PROPERTY.  THAT IS NOT  THINGS THE  AMERICAN PUBLIC  WANTS TO SEE.  >> PRESIDENT  TRUMP OVER THE  WEEKEND READ  TWEETED -- [  INAUDIBLE ]  , >> I WOULD SAY  THIS, THE  PRESIDENT WILL  POINT TO THE  DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN HIS  RECORD AND THAT  OF PRESIDENT  OBAMA.  IT WAS THE  WEAKEST ECONOMIC  RECOVERY SINCE  WORLD WAR II.  WITH PRESIDENT  TRUMP ISIS WAS  DEFEATED.  WITH O BIDEN THE  JV TEAM OF ISIS  BECAME THE  VARSITY TEAM AND  OVERRAN TWO  COUNTRIES.  THE PRESIDENT  WILL ALWAYS DRAW  CONTRAST.  >> ALL RIGHT.  WE FOUND OUT [  INAUDIBLE ] FOR  A FIVE DAY TRIAL  AND $2300 FOR A  FULL PROGRAM.  DOES THE WHITE  HOUSE APPROVE OF  THAT PRICING.  THERE HAS BEEN  CRITICISM AS TO  WHETHER THAT IS  TOO HIGH.  THAT IS A GOOD  QUESTION THAT I  THINK DESERVES A  GOOD ANSWER.  SO THE WHOLESALE  ACQUISITION COST  IS ABOUT 3200  FOUR OR COURSE.  RAN THIS AFFAIR  IS AN INPATIENT  DRUG DONE BY  INFUSION.  BECAUSE OF THAT  THE PATIENT  WOULD BE VERY  UNLIKELY TO SEE  THE COST OF THE  DRUG AND PAY THE  COST OF THE DRUG  BECAUSE THE WAY  HOSPITALS ARE  REIMBURSED FOR  INPATIENT DRUGS.  THEY ARE PLAYED  PAID A FLAT FEE  FOR ADMISSION.  THIS MEANS THAT  HOSPITALS HAVE  TO EAT THE COST  OF TREATMENT  USED BUT IF THEY  BUY IT FOR $3200  WHICH IS THE  WHOLESALE COST  AND THAT DRUG  SAVES THAT  PATIENT TIME IN  THE HOSPITAL.  THEY SPEND A  THIRD OF THE  TIME AND THE  POSSIBLE  HOSPITALIZATION.  THE HOSPITALS  ARE PROFITING  BECAUSE THEY ARE  GETTING THE  PATIENT OUT  EARLY.  THAT IS  BASICALLY COMING  DOWN TO SAYING  THE PATIENT WILL  NOT SEE THAT  COST.  >> OKAY.  AND THEN  SECONDLY, THE  PRESIDENT HAD NO  PROBLEM WITH  MASKS AND  INDIVIDUALS  SHOULD DO WHAT  THEIR LOCAL  JURISDICTION  REQUIRES.  YET THIS WEEKEND  WE SAID WE HAD  TO HAVE FACE  COVERINGS WHEN  WE CAN'T COVER  SOCIAL  DISTANCING.  SHOULD THEY  LISTEN TO LOCAL  JURISDICTIONS  WHERE THEY MAY  NOT BE MANDATED  OR DASHED  >> THE CENTERS  FOR DISEASE  CONTROL AND  PREVENTION  GUIDELINES ARE  RECOMMENDED BUT  NOT REQUIRED.  ALSO YOU HAVE THE LOCAL  JURISDICTION AND  CENTERS FOR  DISEASE CONTROL  AND PREVENTION  GUIDELINES.  >> I WANT TO BE  CLEAR, THERE ARE  LEADERS WHO ARE  BEING BRIEFED [  INAUDIBLE ]  >> THE PRESIDENT  IS BRIEFED ON  VERIFIED  INTELLIGENCE.  >> HOW DOES HE  KNOW AND HOW IS  HE CERTAIN?  >> HE IS BRIEFED  ON VERIFIED  INTELLIGENCE.  IT WAS AN  IRRESPONSIBLE  DECISION OF THE  NEW YORK TIMES  TO REPORT HE WAS  BRIEFED ON  SOMETHING THAT  HE WAS NOT  BRIEFED ON.  IT IS TIME FOR  THE NEW YORK  TIMES TO STEP  BACK AND ASK  THEMSELVES WHY  ARE THEY SO  WRONG SO OFTEN.  THEY ALSO SAID  POLLING DATA  COULD BE ASKED  FOR.  THEY FALSELY  WROTE THE  INTELLIGENCE  AGENCIES AND HAD  AGREED ON  RUSSIAN  INTELLIGENCE.  THEN THEY HAD TO  ISSUE A  CORRECTION.  THE NEW YORK  TIMES PUBLISHED  A COLUMN BY A  FORMER TIMES  EXECUTIVE EDITOR  THAT [ INAUDIBLE  ] AGAINST HILLIS  THREE FOR PRO- RUSSIAN POLICY.  THAT IS A  RUSSIAN HOAX.  IT WAS  INVESTIGATED FOR  THREE YEARS  BEFORE GETTING  AN EXONERATION  IN THE MUELLER  REPORT.  IT IS  INEXCUSABLE.  I THINK IT IS  TIME THE NEW  YORK TIMES AND  WASHINGTON POST  HAND BACK THERE  PULITZER.  >>  >>>  % AGAIN. % WE TALK ABOUT % HOW THE MEDIA % FALLS SHORT. % >>  SHORT. % >> WILL YOU % PROTECT THOSE % WHO ARE MOST % MARGINALIZED? % WE REFER TO % THOSE WHO AREN'T  AS MARGINALIZE ED. % WE END UP  PROTECTING % EVERYONE WHO'S % AFFECTED. . % >> THERE IS NO  REPORTING ON % FAMILIES. % THERE IS NO % REPORTING ON % JOBS IN WHICH  THEY RECEIVE  VALUABLE % RESOURCES.  . % >> ESPECIALLY % WHEN PEOPLE ARE  ADAMANT ABOUT  USING % THEIR ACTUAL  COME DOWNS THAN  THEIR ACTUAL % NAME. % WHEN WE HAD DENY % PEOPLE THAT, WE  ARE DENYING THEM  BASIC RESPECT. % . % >> WHAT WE NEED % TO HAVE A  CONVERSATION  ABOUT IS % DEATH.

I  THINK THAT WE [  INAUDIBLE ]. WE  WANT TO TRIED TO  FIGURE OUT HOW  WE CAN DO THAT  OUTSIDE OF THE  ESTABLISHED  INSTITUTION AND  [ INAUDIBLE ]  BUT THEY ALSO  HAVE [ INAUDIBLE  ]. THE STORY IS  STORIES OF  TRAGEDY THAT  MAKES IT LOOK  HARD.  IN REALITY, IT'S  OKAY TO BE  TRENDS.  SO THERE IS  SOMETHING THAT  TAKES PLACE.  IT IS NOTHING  MORE.  >>  THERE IS NOTHING  MORE POWERFUL  THAN AN IDEA  WHOSE TIME HAS  COME.  YOU CAN REALIZE  THE DREAM UPON  WHICH THIS GREAT  COUNTRY WAS  FOUNDED.

DO YOU AGREE?  WHAT NEEDS TO BE  DONE?  >> GOOD MORNING  AND THANK YOU  FOR HAVING ME.  I DO A GREAT.  THE WINDOW IS  VERY NARROW.  THIS IS  SOMETHING WE  HAVE KNOWN.  IF YOU FALL  BEHIND, AS WE  HAVE, YOU HAVE  TO HAVE QUICKLY.  ACROSS ALL THESE  STATES WE CAN  HAVE BARS OR  RESTAURANTS  WHERE PEOPLE ARE  SITTING INDOORS.  NIGHTCLUBS,  ANYTHING THAT  GATHERS PEOPLE  INDOORS AT THIS  POINT IS WAY TOO  RISKY AND HAS TO  BE DEALT BACK.  >> WHAT DO YOU  ATTRIBUTE THIS  TO.  MOST OF THESE  CASES, THEY  DIDN'T MEET THE  WHITE HOUSE AS  GUIDELINES FOR  OPENING.  THEN GATHERINGS  AT RESTAURANTS,  THOSE ARE RISKY.  NO STATES HAD  MANDATORY MASK  WALLS.

HOSPITALS ARE  GETTING  STRETCHED ACROSS  MANY PARTS OF  THE COUNTRY.  >> WE SAW THE'S  IMAGES OF LONG  LINES OF PEOPLE  WAITING FOR  TESTING AND SOME  OF THESE  HOTSPOTS.  VERY CLOSE  TOGETHER WAITING  FOR TESTING.  WHAT YOU MAKE OF  THAT?  >> IT IS  FRUSTRATING.  MANY OF US HAVE  BEEN TALKING  ABOUT TESTING  FOR MONTHS.  PEOPLE ARE BORED  OF TALKING ABOUT  IT.  YET WE HAVEN'T  FIGURED OUT  TESTING.  PEOPLE SHOULD  NOT HAVE TO WAIT  HOURS TO GET A  SIMPLE MEDICAL  TEST.  WE KNOW THAT WE  HAVE NEEDED THIS  FOR MANY MONTHS.  WHEN WE HEAR  FROM LEADERS  THAT WE HAVE TOO  MANY TESTS ARE  PLENTY OF TESTS,  ALL OF THOSE  LINES SHOW US  THAT WE DON'T.  IT WOULD BE MUCH  BETTER IF THEY  COULD BE SPACED  OUT.  >> ALL RIGHT.

NOBODY WANTS TO  STIFLE THE  MOMENTUM OF THE  ECONOMY.  OFFICIALS SEEM  TO BE TAKING A  RESTRAINED  APPROACH.  THE STRATEGY  HERE IS TESTING.

CHINESE SOCIAL  MEDIA DUBBED HIM  GRANDPA TANG AND  OFFICIALS  RETRACED HIS  STEPS AND THAT  GREW INTO A LIST  OF 250 POTENTIAL  CLOSE CONTACTS.  BEIJING'S  TESTING COMES AT  A TIME WHEN A  U.S. TESTING  STRATEGY IS  CONFUSED.  PRESIDENT TRUMP  CLAIMS THE SURGE  IN CASES IS  BECAUSE THE  BOOSTED TESTING  IS FINDING THE  CASES.  WHILE THAT'S  TRUE, THE DATA  SHOWS THE VIRUS  IS SPREADING  MORE TOO.  THERE'S NO SUCH  DEBATE IN CHINA.  HERE IT'S JUST  THE SCALE OF IT.  TENS OF MILLIONS  OF DOLLARS BEING  SPENT.

I PICKED THAT  ONE UP  SARCASTICALLY  AND PUT IT TO MY  FACE AND SAID I  HOPE YOU DON'T  THINK ALL BLACK  PEOPLE LOOK- ALIKE AND  DROOPED IT ON  THE TABLE.  AND HE SAID I  GUESS THE  COMPUTER GOT IT  WRONG.  >> THIS IS  REALLY THE THING  THAT TIPPED OFF  HIS FAMILY AND  THEN, YOU KNOW,  THEY IN TURN  REACHED OUT TO  THE ACLU AND A  MISIDENTIFICATION  THROUGH FACIAL  RECOGNITION.  THE FIRST KNOWN  TIME.  IT'S AN  INCREDIBLE AREA  OF CONCERN.  >> Reporter:  WHAT ARE POLICE  SAYING ABOUT  THIS?  AND WHAT ACTIONS  IF ANY ARE THEY  TAKING?  >> THE DETROIT  POLICE  DEPARTMENT WAS  WORKING WITH A  DATABASE RUN BY  THE MICHIGAN  STATE POLICE.  IF YOU LOOK AT  THE  INVESTIGATION  REPORT, THE  SEARCH RESULTS,  THIS CANNOT BE  USED AS A CAUSE  FOR ARREST.  YOU HAVE TO  DEVELOP OTHER  EVIDENCE.  AND YET, THAT IS  EXACTLY WHAT THE  DETROIT PD DID.  THE CHIEF OF  POLICE SAID THIS  WAS AN  INVESTIGATIVE  MISTAKE.  THEY DEFINITELY  DID NOT DO THIS  RIGHT.  THERE ARE NEW  POLICIES IN  PLACE.  THEY'LL ONLY USE  IT FOR VIOLENT  CRIMES AND HOME  INVASIONS.  IT'S GOING TO  REQUIRE TWO  EXPERIENCED  EXAMINERS.  IT CAN BE  USEFUL.  WE HEARD THIS  FROM MAYOR.  WE JUST NEED NEW  POLICIES.  AND OTHER  CRITICS HAVE  SAID THIS KIND  OF TECHNOLOGY IS  FRAUGHT WITH  PROBLEMS.  >> HOW ABOUT  COMPANIES THAT  CREATE FACIAL  RECOGNITION  TECHNOLOGY.  WHAT ARE THEY  SAYING ABOUT THE  ACCURACY AND HOW  IT'S BEING USED.  >> COMPANIES  LIKE AMAZON HAVE  SOLD THEM IN THE  PAST TO LAW  ENFORCEMENT AND  ARE TAKING A  BREAK.  ALL SAYING  THEY'RE HAVE A  MORE TOMORROW ON  SELLING IT AT  ALL AND IN THE  CASE OF IBM,  THEY WILL PAUSE  FOR THAT HE IS A  YEAR.  THE COMPANIES  THAT TEND TO  SERVE LAW  ENFORCEMENT ARE  COMPANIES WE  HAVE NEVER HEARD  OF.  RANK ONE IS A  COMPANY THAT  SAYS THEIR  TECHNOLOGY HAS  BEEN BENCHMARKED  AS BEING HIGHLY  ACCURATE ACROSS  RACES AND THAT  THIS WAS  MISUSED.  YOU PUT TOO  BLURRY A  PHOTOGRAPH IN  AND THE COMPUTER  IS NOT GOING TO  BE ABLE TO READ  IT.  BUT THE  ACADEMICS SAY  THIS STUFF  CANNOT BE  TRUSTED.  THERE'S A LONG  HISTORY OF THIS  TECHNOLOGY OF  MISIDENTIFYING.  WE SHOULDN'T BE  PUTTING THIS ON  A CARE OF  PEOPLE.  >> A BILL IN  CONGRESS  THURSDAY --  WHAT'S IN IT?  >> THIS IS A  REALLY  INTERESTING  DEVELOPMENT.  TWO DEMOCRATIC  SENATORS PUT  FORTH A PROPOSAL  TO BAN THE USE  OF FACIAL  RECOGNITION BY  FEDERAL LAW  ENFORCEMENT.  AND NOT ONLY  THAT, THEY WOULD  CUT FEDERAL  FUNDING FOR  STATE AND LOCAL  LAW ENFORCEMENT  IF THOSE LAW  ENFORCEMENT  AGENCIES  CONTINUE TO USE  FACIAL  RECOGNITION.  A VERY BIG MOVE.  OAKLAND HAVE  BANNED IT.  BOSTON WILL BAN  IT AS WELL.  >> THERE'S  OBVIOUSLY THE  SUFFICIENCY OF  LAW ENFORCEMENT  BUT AS RESEARCH  EVERIES HAVE  BEEN POINTING  OUT.  IT DOESN'T PLAY  OUT THAT WAY.  A  TECHNOLOGICALLY  PERFECT VERSION  IS RIFE FOR  MISUSE.  EVERYONE WANTS  TO REGULATE IT  IN SOME WAY.  IN THE MEANTIME,  YOU'VE SEEING  THOUSANDS OF  POLICE  DEPARTMENTS  ACROSS THE  COUNTRY MAKING  THEIR OWN RULES  AND BUYING THIS  FROM COMPANIES  WE'VE NEVER  HEARD OF AND IN  THIS CASE,  ARRESTING THE  WRONG MAN.  >> QUITE A  STORY.  THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  >> APPRECIATE  IT.  >>> IT'S AUGUST  24, 201, IN  AURORA,  COLORADO.  A SECURITY  CAMERA PICKS UP  ELIJAH McCLAIN  BUYING SOFT  DRINKS AND  WEARING A FACE  MASK.  HE WAS IN THE  HABIT OF WEARING  THE MASK.  AFTER PAYING FOR  THE ITEMS, HE  TURNS AROUND AND  BOWS TO THE  FAMILY BEHIND  HIM IN LINE.  THIS WAS HIS  SIGNATURE  GRATITUDE BOW.  A MAN CALLS 911.  >> A MAN WITH A  MASK ON.  >> OKAY.  WERE ANY WEAPONS  INVOLVED OR  MENTIONED?  >> NO.  >> WHAT COLOR IS  THE MASK OR WHAT  DID IT LOOK  LIKE?  >> BLACK.  >> BLACK MASK.  IS IT A SKI  MASK?  >> A SKI MASK.  >> ELIJAH   ELIJAH McCLAIN  HOLDING A  PLASTIC BAG WITH  HIS PURCHASES.  AURORA POLICE  OFFICERS SPOTS  HIM.  >> STOP RIGHT  THERE.  STOP RIGHT  THERE.  >> STOP.  STOP.  STOP.  STOP.  I HAVE A RIGHT  TO STOP YOU  BECAUSE YOU'RE  BEING  SUSPICIOUS.  >> THE OFFICER  INITIATES  PHYSICAL  CONTACT.  10:44P.M.  THE OFFICERS ARE  NOW ALSO ON THE  SCENE.  >> I AM AN  INTROVERT.  PLEASE RESPECT  MY BOUNDARIES.  I'M GOING HOME.  >> RELAX OR I'M  GOING TO HAVE TO  CHANGE THE  SITUATION.  >> LEAVE ME  ALONE.  >> LEAVE ME  ALONE.  >> YOU GUYS  STARTED TO  ARREST ME AND I  WAS STOPPING TO  LISTEN.  >> THE SITUATION  ESCALATES AS  THEY TRY TO MOVE  HIM ON TO THE  GRASS.  OFFICER  WOODYARD,  KNOCKED TO THE  GROUND.           >> THE OFFICER  SAYS THIS.  >> IT'S UNCLEAR  FROM THE BODY  CAMERAS WHETHER  OR NOT HE  REACHED FOR AN  OFFICER'S  WEAPON.  ALL THREE  OFFICERS WRESTLE  HIM TO THE  GROUND.  >> WE'RE  FIGHTING HIM.  >> AT THIS  MOMENT, ONE OF  THE OFFICERS  USES A CAROTID  CONTROL MOVE.  RESTRICTING  BLOOD TO THE  BRAIN.  THE RESPONDING  OFFICERS TOLD AN  INVESTIGATOR  THAT McLAIN  BRIEFLY WENT  UNCONSCIOUS AND  THE OFFICERS  RELEASED HIM.  AT 10:46 P.M,  JUST OVER TWO  MINUTES AFTER  THE FIRST  OFFICER MADE  CONTACT WITH  HIM.  HE SAYS THIS.  >> I WAS JUST  GOING HOME.  >> HE WASN'T  COMPLETELY.       I'M DIFFERENT.  I DON'T DO THAT  STUFF.  I DON'T DO --     I DON'T.          >> STARTED  WALKING AWAY.  >> RESPONDING  OFFICERS LATER  TELL AN  INVESTIGATOR  THAT HE WAS  RESISTING AND  FIGHTING THE  OFFICER'S  ATTEMPTS TO PUT  HIM IN  HANDCUFFS.  >> HE REACHED  FOR HIS GUN.  >> AT 10:49,  McCLAIN THROWS  UP FOR THE FIRST  TIME.          >> I WASN'T  TRYING TO DO  THAT.  I CAN'T BREATHE  CORRECTLY.  >> OVER THE NEXT  FOUR MINUTES, HE  GETS SICK A FEW  MORE TIMES.  OFFICERS ARE  HEARD ASKING HIM  TO STOP  FIGHTING.  [ BLEEP ]  >> THERE YOU GO.  GET UP.  >> IT'S NOT  GOING TO BE GOOD  FOR YOU.  IF YOU KEEP  MESSING AROUND,  I'LL BRING THE  DOG OUT.  >> AT 10:54 P.M,  HE IS STILL ON  THE GROUND AND  AN OFFICER SAYS  THIS.  >> WHEN THE  AMBULANCE GETS  HERE, WE'LL GO  AHEAD AND GIVE  HIM KETAMINE.  >> HE HAS  INCREDIBLE  STRENGTH.  >> CRAZY  STRENGTH.  >> 10:59 P.M.  A MEDIC  ADMINISTERS 500  MILLIGRAMS TO  McCLAIN IN AN  EFFORT TO SEDATE  HIM.  HE'S LOADED ONTO  AN AMBULANCE,  AND 20 MINUTES  AFTER THE FIRST  OFFICER MADE  CONTACT.  THE RESPONDING  OFFICERS ARE  TOLD THAT HE  DOES NOT HAVE A  PULSE.  >> ARE YOU  SERIOUS?  >> HE WAS TAKEN  TO THE HOSPITAL  WHERE HE WAS  DECLARED BRAIN  DEAD THREE DAYS  LATER.  THE CORONER  CONCLUDED THAT A  COMBINATION OF  PHYSICAL  EXERTION AND A  NARROW ARTERY  CONTRIBUTED TO  THE DEATH.  THEY COULD NOT  DETERMINE THE  CAUSE OF DEATH.  IT COULD HAVE  BEEN A NATURAL  DEATH OR A DEATH  LINKED TO THE  CAROTID CONTROL.  THE DISTRICT  ATTORNEY SAID  THE EVIDENCE  DOES NOT SUPPORT  A CONCLUSION  THAT McLAIN'S  DEATH WAS THE  DIRECT RESULT OF  ANY PARTICULAR  ACTION OR  INDIVIDUAL.  THE FAMILY TOLD  NBC NEWS THAT  THEY BELIEVE THE  INDEPENDENT  INVESTIGATION  SHOULD HAVE BEEN  CONDUCTED  INITIALLY.  NOW THE GOVERNOR  HAS APPOINTED A  SPECIAL  PROSECUTOR TO  REOPEN THE  INVESTIGATION.  WE'VE REACHED  OUT TO THE  POLICE UNION FOR  COMMENT AND HAVE  NOT HEARD BACK.  >> IF YOU DON'T,  YOU'RE NOT GOING  TO SEE TRANS- PEOPLE AS PEOPLE  IN LIFE.  % >> WHEN WE  PROTECT THOSE  WHO ARE MOST  MARGINALIZED.  WE AUTOMATICALLY  PROTECT THOSE  WHO ARE NOT AS  MUCH  MARGINALIZED.  WE END UP  PROTECTING  EVERYONE.         >> EVEN, THE  DEATHS ARE  REPORTED AS TO  WHAT HAPPENED TO  THE PERSON AND  THERE'S NO  REPORTING OF THE  PEOPLE THAT  LOVED THEM.  THERE'S NO  REPORTING ON  FAMILIES THAT  WILL MISS THEM.  THERE'S NO  REPORTING ON  JOBS IN WHICH  THEY WERE SEEN AS VALUABLE.  NEVER  CONTEXTUALIZED.  >> ESPECIALLY  WHEN PEOPLE ARE  ADAMANT ABOUT  USING THEIR  ACTUAL  PRONOUNCES, NOT  PREFERRED.  WHEN WE DENY  THAT, WE ARE  DENYING THEM  RESPECT.  WE DO NOT CARE  ABOUT YOU IN ANY  WAY, SHAPE, OR  FORM.  >> ABOUT DEATH  AND I'VE HAD  EDITORS  SPECIFICALLY SAY  TO ME, OH, WELL,  WE'RE NOT  INTERESTED.  >> THAT RELATES  TO HOW WE ARE  TREATED.  IF WE ARE  MARGINALIZED AND  NOT SEEN AS  PEOPLE.  THEN THAT ALLOWS  AND GIVES PEOPLE  PERMISSION TO  TREAT US AS  LESS.  >> PEOPLE I  ASSOCIATE WITH  ARE OFTEN  MARGINALIZED.  AND WE TEND TO  NAVIGATE TO  SOCIAL MEDIA TO  SHARE OUR JOY  AND WHAT'S  HAPPENING AND TO  SHARE TRAGEDIES  TO GALVANIZE AND  INFORM MOVEMENT.  >> RATHER THAN  OUR  MARGINALIZATION.  I THINK THAT WE  PRODUCE.  AND TO TRY TO  FIGURE OUT WAYS  THAT WE CAN DO  THAT OUTSIDE OF  THE ESTABLISHED  INSTITUTIONS.  AND THAT'S HARD  BECAUSE OF WHAT  THE STATUS IS.  BUT THEY ALSO  HAVE, WHEN IT  COMES TO TELLING  YOUR STORIES.  >> STORIES OF  TRAGEDY MAKE IT  LOOK REALLY HARD  AND DIFFICULT TO  BE TRANS-AND  NONBINARY.  BUT IT'S  ABSOLUTELY  BEAUTIFUL.  IT'S BEAUTIFUL  BEING BLACK.  AND THERE'S LIKE  THIS, YOU ARE  NOTHING MORE  THAN.  LOVE IS AN ACT  OF RESISTANCE  WHEN YOU'RE A  MARGINALIZED  PERSON.  COVER THAT.  SHOW THAT.  >>> THERE'S  NOTHING MORE  POWERFUL THAN AN  IDEA WHOSE TIME  HAS COME,  PERHAPS THE TIME  HAS COME TO  FULLY REALIZE  THE DREAM UPON  WHICH THIS GREAT  COUNTRY WAS  FOUNDED, EQUAL  JUSTICE UNDER  THE LAW.  >>> YOU'RE  WATCHING NBC  NEWS NOW.  >> WE'VE GOT  BREAKING NEWS.  >> WE ACTUALLY  SAW A LARGE  CONVOY OF THE  NATIONAL GUARD  COME THROUGH.  >> IT'S NEWS  MADE FOR YOUR  STREAMING WORLD.

AND I'M GETTING  READY TO FLUSH  MY FEEDING TUBE.  MY NUMBER ONE  DIAGNOSIS IS A  RARE CONNECTIVE  TISSUE DISEASE.  I JUST HAVE A  GENERAL LOW  IMMUNITY PROBLEM  IN MY BODY.  I HAVE STOPPED  RESPONDING TO  VACCINES.  I RELY ON THE  PEOPLE AROUND ME  TO BECOME IMMUNE  WHEN THEY'RE  ABLE.  OTHER SIDE, I  HAVE NO ABILITY  TO PREVENT  MYSELF FROM  CATCHING THE  DISEASE.  >> 26-YEAR-OLD  SUMMER LIVES IN  SALT LAKE CITY.  SHE'S DIAGNOSED  AT 25.  FOR HER, THE  THREAT OF THE  CORONAVIRUS  LOOMS MUCH  LARGER DUE TO  HER ILLNESS.  >> I MAKE SURE  TO HAVE  SCHEDULED  OUTINGS TO SEE  FRIENDS AT A  COFFEE SHOP OR  THE GROCERY  STORE OR THE  BOOKSTORE.  I DO GO OUT  OCCASIONALLY.  WHEN THINGS  PEAKED IN MY  STATE I WASN'T  GOING OUT AT  ALL.  >> DOCTORS ARE  HUNG UP FIGURING  OUT HOW TO TREAT  THESE EMERGENCY  CASES AND  MITIGATE THE  DAMAGE OF THE  PANDEMIC.  >> I DO NOT HAVE  THE ACCESS TO  THE STANDARD.

IT'S FOR ALL THE  PEOPLE YOU DON'T  SEE YOU'RE  PROTECTING.  >> I SAW PEOPLE  POSTING THINGS  LIKE, ALL OVER  SOCIAL MEDIA.  THEY COULDN'T  GET HAIRCUTS AND  THEY THOUGHT WE  WERE MAKING A  BIG DEAL.  THE VALUE OF MY  LIFE.  I SAW SO MUCH OF  THE COUNTRY IS  FIGHTING AGAINST  ME.  THAT WAS A DARK  TIME.  >> WHEN PEOPLE  HEAR A MEDICAL  TERM LIKE  IMMUNOCOMPROMISED.  WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT PEOPLE  LAYING AT HOME  AND IN HOSPITAL  BEDS.  THAT'S NOT THE  CASE.  WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT THRIVING  PEOPLE OF ALL  AGES WITH  CREATIVITY, A  DESIRE TO GET  OUT AND WORK AND  SOCIALIZE.  THESE ARE PEOPLE  WITH LIVES JUST  AS VIBRATE RANT  AND IMPORTANT.  >> TO THINK THAT  THEY WOULD BE  OKAY STAYING  TRAPPED IN THEIR  CAGE, THAT'S NOT  THE RIGHT WAY TO  THINK ABOUT  THIS.  >> IT'S 4 A.M.

BUT ELECTRIC  VEHICLES LIKE  THIS ONE ARE  BACK ON TRACK.  \u266a\u266a >>  >> BUT NOW  AFTER, I REALIZE  THAT IT  REPRESENTS THE  FUTURE.  >> MILAN CHANGED  IN A MATTER OF  WEEKS.  THE LOCKDOWN  SLOWED DOWN THE  CITY'S TRAFFIC.  MILAN AND THE  SURROUNDING  REGION BECAME  THE EPICENTER OF  THE CORONAVIRUS  IN ITALY AND  HOME TO HALF OF  THOSE WHO DIED  NATIONWIDE.  NOW BECAUSE OF  THE VIRUS, THE  CITY IS AT THE  CROSSROADS.  >> I PREFER  MILAN NOW, NOT  BEFORE THE  PANDEMIC, NOT  DURING THE  EMERGENCY, BUT  NOW.  PEOPLE ARE NICE  AND THEY RESPECT  MORE.  THEY PREFER --  BECAUSE WE CAN  LEARN FROM THIS  PANDEMIC.  BECAUSE I THINK  THAT OUR  AWARENESS OF A  GOOD QUALITY OF  LIFE IN ALL OF  US.          >> WHEN IT COMES  TO FAST  CHANGING, LIVELY, AND STYLISH  CITIES, MILAN  PULLS OUT ALL  THE STOPS.  IT'S BEEN  KNOWN  TO HIGH FASHION,  THE STOCK MARKET  AND THE WEIRD  SENSE OF HUMOR.  AND BEAUTIFUL  ARCHITECTURE.  BUT THERE IS  SOMETHING ELSE  THIS CITY HAS  LONG BEEN FAMOUS  FOR, POLLUTION.  >> MILAN IS  ALSO, IN SMOG.  IT'S DIFFICULT  TO SEE BUILDINGS  A FEW YARDS  AWAY.  THESE DAYS, THE  VIEW OF THE  SKYLINE IS  CRYSTAL CLEAR.  >> MILAN HAS  LONG BEEN ONE OF  THE MOST  POLLUTED CITIES  IN EUROPE.  AND THEN  CORONAVIRUS AND  THE LOCKDOWN  CLEARED THE AIR.  BUT IT ALSO  LIFTED THE FOG  ON A LONGER  STANDING AND  EVEN MORE LETHAL  PROBLEM.  [ SPEAKING  FOREIGN LANGUAGE  ]                 >> IN ITALY,  TWICE AS MANY  PEOPLE DIE EVERY  YEAR FROM HEALTH  PROBLEMS LINKED  TO POLLUTION  THAN CORONAVIRUS  KILLED SO FAR.  SO COULD  CORONAVIRUS TURN  TRAGEDY INTO AN  OPPORTUNITY FOR  MILAN, ITALY,  AND THE REST OF  THE WORLD TO  CLEAN UP THEIR  ACT.

THEY PLAN TO  TURN ALL PUBLIC  TRANSPORT  ELECTRIC.  AND PLANTS 6  MILLION TREES.  SOME SAY TO TURN  THE CITY GREEN,  IT'S LESS ABOUT  PLANTING TREES  AND MORE ABOUT  ERECTING  BUILDINGS THAT  LOOK LIKE THEM.  >> FOR THE  FUTURE OF MILAN,  WE HAVE TO  CHANGE THE  ENVIRONMENTAL  CONDITIONS.  STARTING WITH A  LARGE CAMPAIGN TO DEMAND.  WE NEED MORE --  [ INAUDIBLE ]  >> IN 2014,  DESIGN THE SO  CALLED VERTICAL  FOREST.  AN ICON OF  SUSTAINABLE  ARCHITECTURE.

AND WALKING, WE  HAVE TO IMAGINE  TO REALIZE MORE  AND MORE OFFICE  SPACES.  >> CORONAVIRUS  AND THE LOCKDOWN  HAVE UNMASKED  THE LONG  STANDING  PROBLEMS OF  POLLUTION AND  CONGESTION.

ALL THESE  STATES, WE CAN'T  HAVE BARS.  I'M NOT SURE WE  CAN RUN  RESTAURANTS.  NIGHTCLUBS,  ANYTHING THAT  GATHERS PEOPLE  INDOORS, I THINK  AT THIS MOMENT  IS WAY TOO  RISKY.  >> AND WHAT DO  YOU ATTRIBUTE  THE RISE TO?  SOME PEOPLE TALK  ABOUT THE  MEMORIAL DAY  CROWDS.  AND THE LACK OF  WEARING MASKS  UNIFORMLY.  WHAT DO YOU  THINK IS BEHIND  IT?  >> I THINK IT'S  A COMBINATION OF  ALL OF THE  THINGS.  IF WE THINK  ABOUT THE THINGS  THAT ARE RISKY.  MOST OF THE  STATES OPEN WHEN  THE UNDERLAYING  LEVEL OF CASES.  THEY DIDN'T MEET  THE WHITE  HOUSE'S OWN  GUIDELINES FOR  OPENING UP.  AND INDOOR  GATHERINGS,  BARS,  RESTAURANTS,  THESE ARE  PARTICULARLY  RISKY.  AND NO MASK  LAWS.  >> NOW WE'RE  CLOSING IN ON  ANOTHER BIG  HOLIDAY, THE 4th  OF JULY.

INDOOR  GATHERINGS ARE  RISKY.  OUTDOORS ARE  BETTER.  IF YOU WANT TO  HAVE A BACKYARD  BARBECUE AND CAN  KEEP SOCIALLY  DISTANT THAT'S  PROBABLY OKAY.  BUT PEOPLE  SHOULD BE  WEARING A MASK.  AND WE HAVE TO  REDUCE THE LEVEL  OF RISK.  OUR HOSPITALS  ARE GETTING  STRETCHED.  >> WE SAW THE  IMAGES, LONG  LINES, PEOPLE  WAITING FOR  TESTING IN SOME  OF THE HOT SPOT  STATES.  WHAT DO YOU MAKE  OF THAT?  >> IT'S SO  FRUSTRATING.  MANY OF US HAVE  BEEN TALKING  ABOUT TESTING  FOR MONTHS.  PEOPLE HAVE  GOTTEN BORED  WITH THE TALK OF  TESTING.  AND WE STILL  HAVEN'T FIGURED  OUT TESTING.  PEOPLE SHOULDN'T  HAVE TO WAIT  HOURS TO GET A  SIMPLE MEDICAL  TEST THAT WE AS  A COUNTRY KNOW  WE'VE NEEDED FOR  MANY, MANY  MONTHS.  WHEN WE HEAR  THAT WE HAVE TOO  MANY TESTS, ALL  OF THOSE LINES,  IT WOULD BE MUCH  BETTER IF THE  PEOPLE COULD BE  MORE SPACED OUT.  >> THANK YOU FOR  YOUR TIME.

AND AURORA  POLICE HAVE  BANNED THE USE  OF THE CHOKE  HOLD USED ON  McCLAIN.  .  >>> LET'S GO TO  ALEXA LIOTO.  HAPPY MONDAY,  ALEXA, TAKE IT  AWAY.  >> ALISON, HAPPY  MONDAY.  GREAT TO SEE  YOU.  LOT OF HEADLINES  IN THIS HOUR.  FIRST NEW  REACTIONS TO THE  SUPREME COURT  RULING  STRIKING DOWN A  LOUISIANA  ABORTION LAW.  THE WHITE HOUSE  CALLING IT AN  UNFORTUNATE  RULING,  WHILE PLANNED  PARENTHOOD SAID  THOSE SEEKING  ABORTIONS CAN  NOW, QUOTE,  \"BREATHE A SIGH  OF  RELIEF.\"  PETE WILLIAMS  WILL BE ON WITH  THE DETAILS IN  JUST A  MOMENT.  >> NOW, A  NUMBERS UPDATE  ON CORONAVIRUS.  THE NUMBER OF  CONFIRMED CASES  IN THE UNITED  STATES  HAS NOW  SURPASSED 2.5  MILLION,  ACCORDING TO NBC  NEWS.  STATES LIKE  TEXAS, ARIZONA,  AND FLORIDA ALL  SEEING  SPECK DESPITE  MIXED SIGNALS  OVER THE USE OF  FACE  MASKS, ALEX AZAR  HAS THIS TO SAY.  IT'S CONFUSING  TO PEOPLE.  THE DOESN'T WAR  A MASK, SO WHY  SHOULD I?  >> I AM HIS  SECRETARY OF  HEALTH.  I'M TELLING YOU,  WEAR FACIAL  COVERINGS WHEN  YOU  CAN'T SOCIAL  DISTANCING.  THE PRESIDENT'S  GUIDELINES SAY  WEAR FACIAL  COVERINGS  WHEN YOU CAN'T  SOCIAL-DISTANCE.  IT WILL BE VERY  CLEAR WITHOUT,  AND IT'S GOING  TO  REMAIN CLEAR.  >> THE WORLD  HEALTH  ORGANIZATION IS  WARNING THAT THE  CORONAVIRUS  PANDEMIC IS  ACCELERATING  AROUND THE  WORLD AS  COUNTRIES  CONTINUE THEIR  REOPENING PLANS.  TAKE A QUICK  LISTEN TO THE  DIRECTOR GENERAL  HERE.  .  >> ANDREW CUOMO  SAYING INDOOR  DINING MAY HAVE  TO  WAIT, BECAUSE  THE VIRUS  SPREADS IN  ENCLOSED AREAS.  HE SAID HE WOULD  BE TALKING TO  BUSINESS OWNERS  AND  GATHERING MORE  DATA.  >> IT'S INDOOR  DINING.  WE HAVE THE  CONGREGATION  PROBLEM, AND YOU  HAVE THE  VIRAL SPREAD  ACROSS THE  NATION, WHICH I  THINK IS  REALLY  PROBLEMATIC FOR  US.  .  >> PERFORMANCES  ARE CANCELED  UNTIL AT LEAST  JANUARY  BECAUSE OF  PUBLIC HEALTH  CONCERNS.  .  >> THE ROLLING  STONES ARE  THREATENING TO  SUE  PRESIDENT TRUMP.  IN A STATEMENT,  THE MUSIC RIGHTS  ORGANIZATION  TOLD  NBC NEWS THAT  PLAYING MUSIC  FROM THE ROLLING  STONES  CONSTITUTE AS  BREACH OF ITS  AGREEMENT.  THE ASSOCIATED  PRESS REPORTS  THEIR 1969 SONG  \"YOU  CAN'T ALWAYS GET  WHAT YOU WANT\"  WAS PLAYED AT  TRUMP'S RALLY  RECENTLY.  >>> THAT WRAPS  UP OUR HEADLINES  AT THIS HOUR.  WE'LL SEE YOU  BACK HERE LATER  WITH SOME MORE  HEADLINES.  ALISON?  >> .  >> PETE, TALK US  THROUGH THE  RULING.  >> THIS IS A LAW  THAT NEVER TOOK  EFFECT IN FULL  FORCE.  IT WAS PASSED BY  LOUISIANA, AND  SAID A DOCTOR  PERFORMING  ABORTION  SERVICES HAD TO  HAVE PRIVILEGES  TO ADMIT  PATIENTS AT A  NEARBY HOSPITAL.  THIS WOULD TO  HELP MAKE SURE  DOCTORS ARE  PROPERLY  CREDENTIALED.  >> IT WOULD BE  AN ADDITIONAL  OBSTACLE TO A  WOMAN'S  RIGHT TO ACCESS  TO ABORTION, AND  THEREFORE WAS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  INTERESTINGLY,  THIS LAW WAS  IDENTITY CALL TO  THE ONE  THAT TEXAS  PASSED AND THE  SUPREME COURT  STRUCK DOWN  FOUR YEARS AGO.  IN THAT RULING  FOUR YEARS AGO,  THE CHIEF  JUSTICE  JOHN ROBERTS WAS  ONE OF THE  DISSENTERS.  TODAY HE SAID,  THOUGH I  DISAGREED WITH  THAT  DECISION, THAT  IS NOW THE LAW,  AND I AM BOUND  BY  THAT PRECEDENT,  AND HE JOINED  THE OTHER  LIBERALS TO  FORM THE 5 VOTE.  A 5-4 VOTE TO  DECLARE THE LAW  UNCONSTITUTIONAL,  BECAUSE IT  FLUNKED THE SAME  TEST THE TEXAS  LAW DID  FOUR YEARS AGO.  >> SEE SEAL  RICHARDS SAID  THIS ABOUT THE  DECISION  TODAY.  >> TODAY JUSTICE  ROBERTS DID THE  RIGHT THING.  HE UPHELD  PRECEDENT, AND  HE STOOD WITH  WOMEN.  BUT MAKE NO  MISTAKE ABOUT  IT, THIS IS AN  ADMINISTRATION  COMPLETELY  COMMITTED TO  TAKING AWAY  THE RIGHT OF  PEOPLE TO MAKE  THEIR OWN  DECISIONS  ABOUT PREGNANCY.  >> WHAT SHOULD  PEOPLE TAKE AWAY  FROM THIS  DECISION  TODAY, NOT ONLY  HOW IT WILL AND  WON'T IMPACT THE  FUTURE OF  ABORTION RIGHTS.  .  >> THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION  WANTS TO CHANGE  THE LAW  HERE, BUT MOST  OF THE  RESTRICTIONS  THAT THE SUPREME  COURT HAS BEEN  REVIEWING ARE  STATE LAWS.  >> THIS IS NOT  -- THIS RULING  IS NOT A  RESOUNDING  VICTORY FOR  ABORTION RIGHTS,  BECAUSE  BASICALLY  JUSTICE ROBERTS  SORT OF  GRUDGINGLY  JOINED THE  MAJORITY TODAY,  SAYING, \"BECAUSE  WE'VE ALREADY  DECIDED THIS,  THE SAME ANSWER  APPLIES,\" BUT IF  A NEW  RESTRICTION CAME  ALONG, IT  DOESN'T  NECESSARILY MEAN  HE WOULD BE WITH  THE LIBERALS ON  THAT ONE.  THAT'S WHY  YOU'RE HEARING  KIND OF A MUTED  SENSE OF  VICTORY FROM  ADVOCATES FOR  ABORTION RIGHTS,  BUT  THERE'S ONE  OTHER POINT  ABOUT THIS  DECISION.  THERE WAS FIVE  DEFINITE VOTES  TODAY TO PUT AN  END TO  THE CLAIM THAT  LOUISIANA HAD  MADE AND THAT  OTHERS  HAD MADE.  . DOCTORS CANNOT  CHALLENGE THESE  RESTRICTIONS.  THEIR THEORY IS  THAT BECAUSE OF  THE RIGHT OF  ACCESS  TO ABORTION  BELONGS TO  WOMEN, THEY'RE  THE ONLY ONES.  ONLY PREGNANT  WOMEN CAN BRING  CHALLENGES TO  THESE  LAWS.  THE SUPREME  COURT SAID TODAY  THAT'S NOT THE  CASE.  IF THE COURT HAD  AGREED WITH THAT  IDEA, THAT WOULD  MAKE IT MUCH  HARDER TO  CHALLENGE  RESTRICTIONS.  >> PETE  WILLIAMS, WE'VE  HAD SOME BIG  DECISIONS FOR  THE SUPREME  COURT LATELY.  THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR JOINING  US  ONCE AGAIN.  >> RIGHT.  >> BEACHES  ACROSS FLORIDA  ARE SHUTTING  DOWN FOR THE  4th OF JULY.  THE STATE SET A  RECORD THIS  WEEKEND, WITH  MORE THAN  18,000 NEW  CORONAVIRUS  CASES.  NBC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT  TIM BROKE HAS  MORE FROM MIAMI  BEACH.  >> ALISON, GOOD  AFTERNOON.  GOOD TO BE WITH  YOU.  I'M ON MIAMI  BEACH, WHICH  JUST REOPENED A  FEW WEEKS  AGO.  AND NOW IT'S  GOING TO BE  CLOSING FOR THE  NEXT  HOLIDAY WEEKEND,  JULY 3rd TO JULY  7th.  ALL OF THE  BEACHES IN MIAMI  DADE COUNTY  SHUTTING  DOWN TO TRY TO  PREVENT A START  OF WHAT WE SAW  ACROSS  THE COUNTRY,  WITH THE  MEMORIAL  HOLIDAY.  LOT OF FOLKS  COMING OUT TO  BEACHES AND BARS  ALL OVER  THE PLACE, AND  THERE WAS A  SPIKE IN CASES A  COUPLE  WEEKS  AFTERWARDS.  NOW, THIS  DECISION FROM  CARLOS JIMENEZ  WITH THE  MAYOR OF MIAMI  DADE, REPLICATED  IN OTHER PARTS  AS  WELL.  BROWARD COUNTY,  WE FOUND OUT  WILL BE CLOSING  ALL OF  ITS BEACHES.  THREE MAYORS  CAME OUT OVER  THE WEEKEND AND  WERE  INFORMING PEOPLE  YOU CAN'T COME  OUT HERE FOR THE  HOLIDAY.  WE'RE DOING IT  FOR YOUR OWN  SAFETY.  THEY WERE  SHOUTED DOWN AND  HECKLED THINGS  LIKE  FREEDOM AND  SOCIAL  DISTANCING.  YOU'LL SEE THERE  IS PLENTY OF  SPACE AT THE  MOMENT,  BUT WE'RE ON A  MONDAY AFTERNOON  NOW.  THE CONCERN IS  WHAT IS THIS  GOING TO LOOK  LIKE ON  JULY 4th.  OFFICIALS DO NOT  WANT TO TAKE ANY  CHANCES.  THE POSITIVITY  RATES ARE GOING  IN THE WRONG  DIRECTION.  ALMOST 10,000 ON  SATURDAY, 8,500  ON SUNDAY.  . ALMOST 16%  ACROSS THE STATE  OF FLORIDA.  THE TWO-WEEK  AVERAGE IS  CLOSER TO 17%.  THAT IS FAR  HIGHER THAN ANY  OFFICIAL IS  COMFORTABLE  WITH NOW.  IT IS THE REASON  WE'RE SEEING THE  EXTREME  MEASURES,  OR AT LEAST  SAFETY MEASURES  BEING TAKEN.  SOME FEEL  THEY'RE EXTREME.  OTHERS THINK  IT'S TIME WE DO  SOMETHING AS WE  SEE  CASES SURGING.  BARS CLOSING  ACROSS THE STATE  OF FLORIDA AS  WELL.  WE'LL SEE IF  THERE'S ANY MORE  ROLL BACKS.  BACK TO YOU.  >>> ARIZONA IS  STRUGGLING TO  EXPAND ITS COVID- 19  TESTING, AS ICU  BESIDE THERE ARE  FILLING UP.  NBC NEWS  REPORTER VAUGHN  HILLIARD JOINING  US FROM A  TESTING LAB IN  PHOENIX.  RON, WE KNOW THE  HOSPITALLYIZATION  RATE IS REALLY  BAD RIGHT NOW IN  ARIZONA.  WHAT IS GOING ON  THERE TODAY?  >> WELL, IT JUST  GETS WORSE EVERY  SINGLE DAY WE DO  THIS, ALISON.  HOW MANY TIMES  DO WE HAVE TO  TELL YOU WE'RE  BREAKING  RECORDS.  BREAKING RECORDS  FOR  HOSPITALIZATIONS,  BREAKING  RECORDS FOR  VENTILATORS,  NUMBER OF ICU  BESIDE IN  USE.  THIS WEEKEND  AGAIN BROKE THE  RECORD FOR MOST  NUMBER  OF NEW CASES.  NEARLY 4,000 IN  A SUNG THE DAY.  I DON'T KNOW HOW  MANY TIMES --  , A GREAT NUMBER  OF SCHOOLS, THEY  HAVE YEAR-ROUND  SCHOOL, WHERE  THEY'RE SET TO  START IN  LITERALLY TWO,  THREE WEEKS FROM  NOW.  SO YOU  ESSENTIALLY HAVE  A POPULATION  HERE IN MARE  KEY PA COUNTY  TWO WEEKS FROM  NOW THAT ARE SET  TO  RECONGREGATE.  THERE ARE  QUESTIONS ABOUT  USE OF FORCE  THAT ARE  ACTUALLY  ONGOING.  THERE ARE  QUESTIONS AS TO  WHAT IS GOING TO  BE DONE,  BECAUSE THE  GOVERNOR IS  URGING PEOPLE TO  STAY HOME,  SAYING IT'S A  FLASHING YELLOW,  BUT NOT ENOUGH  IS  CHANGING,  FRANKLY, FROM MY  OWN EYES ACROSS  THE  GREATER ARIZONA.  >> I KNOW YOU  WERE FRUSTRATED,  BUT I KNOW THAT  WILL  NEVER STOP YOU  FROM ASKING THE  TOUGH QUESTIONS,  BUT  I KNOW YOU'LL  KEEP PRESSING  FOR ANSWERS.  THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR YOUR  WORK.  >> I APPRECIATE  YOU, MY FRIEND.  >>> BARS IN  SEVERAL COUNTIES  FORCED TO CLOSE  AGAIN  BECAUSE OF A  SPIKE IN CASES  THERE.  AARON WATSON  JOINS ME NOW  FROM LOS  ANGELES.  AARON, L.A.  IS ONE OF THOSE  COUNTIES CLOSING  ITS  BARS.  DO YOU KNOW OF  ANY CONNECTIONS  TO THE NIGHT  LIFE  THERE?  >> HEY, ALISON,  WHEN GOVERNOR  NEWSOME MADE THE  ANNOUNCEMENT, HE  DIDN'T HAVE ANY  SPECIFIC CASES  TO  SIGN OTHER THAN  THE GENERAL  THREAT OF THE  VIRUS  THROUGHOUT  CALIFORNIA.  REALLY, THIS  ORDER SHUTTING  DOWN BARS ACROSS  SEVEN  COUNTIES,  RECOMMENDING THE  SHUT DOWN OF  BARS.  IT FOLLOWS IN  THE FOOTSTEPS OF  OTHER STATES,  NOTABLY  FLORIDA AS WELL  AS TEXAS.  THE TEXAS  GOVERNOR SAYING  HE REGRETS EVER  ALLOWING  BARS TO REOPEN  IN THE FIRST  PLACE, SAYING  THEY COULD  BE INCUBATORS  FOR THE VIRUS.  THE SPECIFIC  CASE, LANSING,  MICHIGAN, SEEING  85  CASES.  EXPERTS SAY BARS  POTENTIAL  INCUBATORS. .  >> WHAT ARE BAR  OWNERS SAYING  ABOUT THE  CLOSURES?  I KNOW THIS HAS  TO BE SUCH A  FRUSTRATING TIME  FOR  THEM.  >> WE SPOKE TO  SOME BAR OWNERS  EARLIER TODAY IN  LOS  ANGELES, AND  THEY ARE  EXTREMELY  FRUSTRATED.  THEY'RE WORRIED  ABOUT THEIR  BUSINESSES.  THEY LOST A LOT  OF MONEY IN THE  SHUT DOWN,  INVESTING  EVEN MORE MONEY  IN TRYING TO  ADJUST TO THIS  NEW  REALITY IN  REOPENING, TO  SHUT DOWN AGAIN.  A LOT OF THESE  BAR OWNERS  SAYING, \"WE  DON'T KNOW IF  WE CAN GO ON.  THEY DID NOT  WANT TO REOPEN.  THEY DID NOT  WANT TO RISK THE  EXTRA  INVESTMENT.  VERY WORRIED  ABOUT THEIR  BOTTOM LINE.  >> AND  CALIFORNIA HAS  HAD A MASS  MANDATE FOR  ALMOST  TWO WEEKS.  FROM WHAT YOU'VE  SEEN, ARE MOST  PEOPLE FOLLOWING  THE  GUIDELINES AND  TAKING THIS  SERIOUSLY?  >> RIGHT NOW,  WE'RE SEEING A  SURGE OF CASES  IN  CALIFORNIA.  OVER THE PAST  TWO WEEKS, AN UP  TICK OF 50%, 30%  UP  TICK IN  HOSPITALIZATIONS,  AND EXPERTS I'VE  BEEN  TALKING TO SAY  IT'S DOWN TO  PEOPLE'S  BEHAVIOR, AS  THE STATE HAS  SLOWLY BEEN  REOPENING.  THE STATE HAS  BEEN URGING  GUIDELINES.  PEOPLE HAVE NOT  BEEN FOLLOWING  THEM.  THEY HAVE NOT  BEEN WEARING  THEIR MASKS.  THEY HAVE IN THE  BEEN SOCIAL- DISTANCING.  I SPOKE TO BOB  WASSER.  HE SAID THIS IS  A WARNING SHOT  TO THE REST OF  THE  STATE.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> WELL, AT THE  VERY LEAST, IT  IS A VERY CLEAR  MESSAGE TO  PEOPLE THEY NEED  TO FOLLOW, THAT  THE  VIRUS IS EVERY  BIT AS REAL AS  IT WAS BEFORE,  AND  THERE'S REALLY  NO GOOD REASON  WE COULDN'T BE  NEW  YORK IN MARCH IF  WE'RE NOT  CAREFUL.  SO THE HOPE IS  PEOPLE WILL SEE  THE SURGE IN  CASES  AND SAY, \"IT IS  TIME NOW TO TAKE  THIS SERIOUSLY.\"  IF WE DON'T DO  THAT, I DON'T  SEE ANY REASON  WE'RE  NOT GOING TO BE  BACK INTO  LOCKDOWN OVER  THE NEXT FEW  WEEKS, AND THE  REASON WE ARE  OPENING UP IS TO  TRY TO  ALLOW THE  ECONOMY TO  RECOVER.  THAT WILL CAUSE  THE ECONOMY TO  IMPLODE ONCE  AGAIN.  >> Reporter:   THE STATE BEGAN  TO SEE THE SURGE  OF  CASES IN THE  SOUTHERN PART OF  THE STATE.  NOW WE'RE SEEING  IT AT BOTH ENDS,  IN STANISLAS  COUNTY.  TO THE SOUTH,  HOSPITALS SO  FULL IN IMPERIAL  COUNTY  ARE ACTUALLY  TRANSFERRING  PATIENTS TO SAN  DIEGO, AS  FAR NORTH AS SAN  FRANCISCO.  >> WOW.  ARE OFFICIALS  PLANNING TO DO  ANYTHING ELSE TO  STOP  THE SPREAD  BESIDES TRYING  TO SHUT DOWN THE  NIGHT  LIFE A LITTLE  BIT?  >> WELL, I MEAN,  AT THIS POINT,  THERE IS NOT  MUCH  THE STATE CAN  DO.  THERE'S NOT MUCH  THEY CAN DO TO  STOP THIS VIRUS.  REMEMBER, THERE  ARE NO  TREATMENTS.  THE ONLY THING  THEY CAN  RECOMMEND IS  PEOPLE  SOCIAL-DISTANCE,  WEAR MASKS, AND  PUT IN  RESTRICTIONS  TO POTENTIALLY  SHUT DOWN MORE  BUSINESSES, AND  THAT  IS EXACTLY WHAT  STATE OFFICIALS  DO NOT WANT TO  HAVE  TO DO.  AS WE'RE HEARING  FROM BAR OWNERS,  THAT SECOND SHUT  DOWN IS  EXTREMELY  DEVASTATING.  >> .  >> THANKS SO  MUCH.  .  >>> DR. SHASHANA  UNDERLIGHTER  JOINS ME NOW.  SHE IS A  PHYSICIAN AT THE  MEDICAL CENTER  IN SAN  FRANCISCO.  DOCTOR, THANK  YOU SO MUCH FOR  BEING WITH US.  WE ARE HEARING  ABOUT MORE AND  MORE COVID-19  CASES  INVOLVING  YOUNGER PEOPLE.  ARE YOU SEEING  THAT IN YOUR  HOSPITAL?  >> ALISON, WHAT  WE'RE SEEING ON  THE GROUND IS  THAT  THE CASES OF  COVID IN YOUNG  PEOPLE ARE  CLIMBING  QUICKLY, AS THE  MAJORITY OF  PEOPLE  EXPERIENCE SOME  DEGREE OF FEVER  OR CHILLS, COUGH  OR SHORTNESS OF  BREATH, FATIGUE  OR BODY ACHES.  AND THEY DO OKAY  AT HOME.  BUT, YOU KNOW,  PEOPLE SHOULD  SEEK MEDICAL  ATTENTION  IF THEY HAVE  TROUBLE  BREATHING,  PERSISTENT PAIN  OR  PRESSURE IN  THEIR CHEST, OR  NEW CONFUSION.  WHAT WE ARE  SEEING ACROSS  THE STATE AND OF  COURSE  ACROSS THE  COUNTRY IS THAT,  YOU KNOW, IT'S  REALLY  IMPORTANT FOR  PEOPLE TO  REALIZE THAT  THOUGH THEY  ARELESS LIKELY  TO EXPERIENCE  ILLNESS OR  HOSPITALIZATION  FROM COVID,  THERE ARE SOME  LONGER-TERM  EFFECTS THAT ARE  EMERGING, YOU  KNOW,  AMONG PEOPLE  THAT ONLY HAVE  INITIAL  LIFESTYLES,  THESE OTHER  SYMPTOMS CAN  LINGER ON.  IT IMPACTS OTHER  SYMPTOMS, LIKE  THE BRAIN, THE  LUNGS, THE  IMMUNE SYSTEM,  EVERYONE THE  KIDNEYS AND  THE BLOOD.  , YOUNG ADULTS  NEED TO BE  PAYING  ATTENTION,  MODIFYING  THEIR BEHAVIORS  AS CASES ARE  CONTINUING TO  RISE.  >> THE TREATMENT  GILEAD DONATED  IS SET TO RUN  OUT IN  ABOUT A WEEK OR  SO.  HOW IMPORTANT IS  THIS TREATMENT,  AND ARE YOU  CONCERNED ABOUT  THOSE KINDS OF  PAUSES?  >> THE ANTIVIRAL  MEDICATION  RENDECEVIER  SHORTENS THE  TIME FOR  RECOVERY FOR  COVID PEOPLE.  IT HAS NOT  IMPROVED  SURVIVAL FOR  PATIENTS WITH  COVID.  MOST EXPERTS  AGREE THIS IS A  REALLY HIGH  PRICE TAG  FOR A DRUG THAT  HAS NOT BEEN  SHOWN TO REDUCE  MORTALITY.  WE HAVE SEEN  SOME PROMISE  COME OUT OF  REPORTS FROM A  STUDY IN THE UK,  WHERE THEY FOUND  THAT METHOZOL,  AN  INEXPENSIVE  MEDICINE AROUND  FOR YEARS, FOUND  TO  REDUCE THE RISK  OF DEATH BY  ABOUT 1/3.  IN TERMS OF  TREATMENT  OPTIONS GOING  FORWARD, NEW  DATA, OF COURSE,  IS EMERGING,  EVER DAY, EVERY  WEEK.  AND IT'S  CRITICAL WE  CONTINUE TO LOOK  AT THE  EVIDENCE WHEN  MAKING DECISIONS  ABOUT HOW TO  TREAT  PATIENTS.  >> DR. FAUCCI  SAYS THAT THE  U.S. WILL NOT BE  ABLE TO  REACH HERD  IMMUNITY IF A  LARGE PORTION OF  THE  POPULATION  REFUSES TO GET  VACCINATED.  WE KNOW WE STILL  HAVE A LONG WAY  TO GO UNTIL WE  HAVE  AN ACTUAL  VACCINE.  WHAT DO WE SAY  TO PEOPLE WHO  DON'T THINK  THEY'LL GET  IT WHEN IT IS  AVAILABLE.  HOW IMPORTANT IS  THE VACCINE FOR  US TO RETURN TO  A  LESS RESTRICTIVE  LIFE?  >> YEAH.  WELL, ONE THING  TO POINT OUT,  ALISON, IS THERE  IS  THIS PHENOMENON  CALLED HERD  IMMUNITY.  THAT HAPPENS  WHEN ENOUGH  PEOPLE BECOME  IMMUNE TO A  DISEASE THAT  MAKES ITS SPREAD  UNLIKELY.  WHEN A LARGE  AMOUNT OF THE  COMMUNITY  BECOMES IMMUNE,  IT PROVIDES A  MEASURE OF  PROTECTION, OF  COURSE, FOR  PEOPLE WHO ARE  NOT IMMUNE.  WITH HERD  IMMUNITY, THESE  CHAINS GET  INTERRUPTED,  WHICH STOPS THE  FLOW OF DISEASE.  FOR THIS TO  HAPPEN IN THE  CASE OF COVID IN  THE U.S.,  WE NEED MOST OF  THE POPULATION  WILLING TO BE  VACCINATED.  IF A THIRD OF  AMERICANS REFUSE  THE VACCINE,  THIS IS  A HUGE PROBLEM,  AND WE'RE  UNLIKELY TO  REACH HERD  IMMUNITY, AND I  THINK WE'RE  UNLIKELY TO  RETURN TO  LIFE AS USUAL.  SIMPLY PUT,  ALISON, VACCINES  SAVE LIVES.  DISEASES THAT  USED TO BE  COMMON IN THIS  COUNTRY AND  AROUND THE  WORLD, LIKE  POLIO AND MUMPS  AND MEASLES  CAN BE PREVENTED  BY VACCINATION  BECAUSE OF A  VACCINE, ONE OF  THE MOST DEADLY  VIRUSES.  SMALLPOX NO  LONGER EXISTS.  SO OVER THE  YEARS, YOU KNOW,  VACCINES HAVE  PREVENTED  COUNTLESS CASES  OF DISEASE,  SAVED MILLIONS  OF LIVES.  PEOPLE SHOULD  KNOW THAT ALL  VACCINES GO  THROUGH MANY  DIFFERENT PHASES  AND TRIALS TO  MAKE SURE  THEY'RE  SAFE AND  EFFECTIVE.  .  >>> THERE WILL A  HEARING ON THE  RESPONSE THE  CORONAVIRUS.  YOU CAN WATCH IT  RIGHT HERE ON  \"NBC NEWS NOW,\"  STARTING AT  10:00 A.M.  EASTERN.  .  >> YOU'RE  WATCHING \"NBC  NEWS NOW.\"  >> KEN DELANEY  JOINS ME NOW.  JUST SUCH AN  INCREDIBLE  STORY.  WHAT ELSE DO YOU  KNOW?  >> I THINK THE  BOTTOM LINE IS  ONCE AGAIN, THE  TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION  IS HANDLING THE  JOHNS UNDER  QUESTION.  YOU HAVE THE  PRESIDENT SAYING  HE WASN'T  BREATHING,  SAYING HE WASN'T  BRIEFED, BECAUSE  HIS INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY TOLD  HIM THE  INFORMATION  WASN'T CREDIBLE.  BUT TODAY AT THE  WHITE HOUSE, A  SPOKESWOMAN  CONTRADICTED  THAT.  SHE SAID THE  INFORMATION  WASN'T VERIFIED,  AND THAT  THERE IS  CONSENSUS IN THE  COMMUNITY, AND  THAT THERE  IS DISSENT.  BUT THAT'S  CONSISTENT WITH  WHAT WE WERE  HEARING,  WHICH IS THAT  THERE IS THIS  INFORMATION.  THERE IS  EVIDENCE THAT  THE RUSSIAN  MILITARY UNIT  PAID A BOUNTY  THROUGH THE  TALIBAN.  . SOME SERVICE  MEMBERS DIED AS  A RESULT.  THE IDEA THE  PRESIDENT WASN'T  BRIEFED ON THAT,  JUST  BOGGLES THE MIND  OF A LOT OF  SOURCES I'M  TALKING TO,  SUGGESTING THIS  FUNCTION WAS IN  THE NATIONAL  SECURITY  COMMUNITY AND  THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION  IS  JUST INCREDIBLE.  THIS IS THE KIND  OF THING THAT  MERIT AS  RESPONSE.  IT'S SOMETHING  THAT YOU HAVE TO  PUSH BACK ON,  ALISON.  >> .  >> SEEMS LIKE  EXACTLY THE KIND  OF THING THE  PRESIDENT SHOULD  AND WOULD WANT  TO KNOW.  WHAT ARE YOU  TRYING TO FIGURE  OUT HERE?  WHAT'S THE  BIGGEST QUESTION  YOU'D STILL LIKE  ANSWERS  TO.  IS IT THE PIECE  ABOUT WHAT THE  PRESIDENT KNEW?  >> THERE'S THAT.  WHAT DID THE  PRESIDENT KNOW,  BECAUSE THERE IS  SOME  EVIDENCE --  EVERYONE SAID  THIS WOULD HAVE  BEEN  WRITTEN UP AND  SENT TO THE  HOUSE IN THE  FORM OF A  REPORT.  WHETHER THAT GOT  TO THE PRESIDENT  IS ANOTHER  QUESTION.  ANOTHER QUESTION  IS WHAT IS THE  STRENGTH OF THE  EVIDENCE THAT  THE BOUNTIES  WERE PAID AND  AMERICANS  DIED AS A RESULT  OF THIS.  A LOT OF PEOPLE  HAVE BEEN DOWN- PLAYING THIS,  SAYING,  \"THIS IS WHAT WE  EXPECT THE  RUSSIANS TO DO.\"  THE IRANIANS  HAVE BEEN DOING  THIS FOR YEARS,  AND WE  CUT A DEAL WITH  THEM.  WE'D LIKE TO  UNDERSTAND HOW  SIGNIFICANT THIS  IS IN  TERMS OF THE  RUSSIAN-AMERICAN  RELATIONSHIP,  AND WHAT  KIND OF RESPONSE  IS CONTEMPLATED  BY THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION.  .  >> WHAT KIND OF  RESPONSE ARE YOU  GETTING FROM  INTELLIGENCE AND  MILITARY  OFFICIALS TO  THIS?  >> SOME AGENCIES  ARE NOT  COMMENTING.  OTHER OFFICIALS  ARE TELLING US,  LOOK, THEY'VE  KNOWN  ABOUT THIS, BUT  THIS ISN'T A BIG  DEAL.  ONE SOURCE  FAMILIAR WITH  THIS MATTER, AS  WE SAID IN  THE INTRO, SAY  ABSOLUTELY.  AMERICANS DIED  BECAUSE OF THIS,  AND AFGHAN  CIVILIANS  DIED.  . IT IS  CONSISTENT WITH  THE WHITE HOUSE  SAYING THERE  ISN'T A  CONSENSUS.  BUT DOESN'T  EXPLAIN WHY THEY  WOULDN'T BRIEF  THE  PRESIDENT AND  THE UNITED  STATES ABOUT IT.  PRESIDENTS TELL  ALL THE TIME  THINGS THAT  THEIR  ADVISERS THINK  THEY NEED TO  KNOW.  >> ANY RESPONSE  FROM RUSSIA OR  THE TALIBAN  HERE?  YES.  BOTH GROUPS HAVE  VOCIFEROUSLY  DENIED IT.  >> IT IS A STORY  EVERYONE IS  TALKING ABOUT.  THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR YOUR  REPORTING.  >> THANKS,  ALISON.  .  >>> THE BIG  QUESTION, WHAT  DID THE  PRESIDENT KNOW  ABOUT THIS PLOT,  AND WHEN DID HE  FIND OUT?  LAWMAKERS ON  BOTH SIDES OF  THE AISLE  DEMANDING  ANSWERS.  .  >> THE PRESIDENT  WILL NOT  CONFRONT THE  RUSSIANS ON  THIS.  WE'LL FIND OUT  IF HE WAS  BRIEFED.  . IF WE DO NOT,  WHAT DOES THAT  SAY?  >> ONE OF THE  PRESIDENT'S  BIGGEST  DEFENDERS,  SENATOR  LINDSAY GRAHAM,  ALSO TWEETING  THAT IT IS  IMPERATIVE  FOR CONGRESS TO  GET TO THE  BOTTOM OF THESE  REPORTS.  SELECT MEMBERS  OF CONGRESS WERE  BRIEFED TODAY.  SENIOR WHITE  HOUSE REPORTER  SHANNON PETTY  JOINS ME  NOW.  DO WE KNOW WHO  WAS AT THAT  BRIEFING, AND  WHAT CAME  OUT OF IT?  >> WE DON'T KNOW  SPECIFICALLY WHO  WAS IN THE  BRIEFING.  THE PRESS  SECRETARY SAID A  BIPARTISAN GROUP  OF  MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS WERE  REACHED OUT TO  AND INVITED  TO HAVE A  BRIEFING.  SHE MENTIONED IT  WAS A SO-CALLED  GANG OF EIGHT,  THE  TYPICAL EIGHT  DEFENDERS AND  LEADERSHIP IN  CONGRESS,  WHO ARE BREACHED  ON THE TOP  INTELLIGENCE,  WHICH WE  BELIEVE THAT WAS  EXPLAINED IN THE  BRIEFING.  WE DON'T KNOW  YET IF ALL OF  THOSE MEMBERS  WERE AT  THE BRIEFING  THAT JUST TOOK  PLACE AT THE  WHITE  HOUSE.  . ALL EIGHT  MEMBERS OF THIS  GROUP OF EIGHT  ARE GOING  TO BE GETTING A  BRIEFING AT SOME  POINT TODAY.  >> SHANNON, THE  PRESIDENT SAID  NO ONE BRIEFED  HIM ON  THE RUSSIAN  INTELLIGENCE,  BECAUSE INTEL  OFFICIALS  DIDN'T FIND IT  CREDIBLE.  ARE YOU  SUGGESTING THAT  IT COULD BE FAKE  NEWS.  WHAT ELSE IS THE  PRESIDENT SAYING  HERE?  >> HE HASN'T  SAID MUCH BEYOND  HIS TWEET.  >> THERE WAS NOT  A CONSENSUS IN  THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY ABOUT  THE ACCURACY OF  THIS  INFORMATION,  AND IT HAD NOT  BEEN VERIFIED,  AND THE  PRESIDENT WAS  BRIEFED ON  VERIFIABLE  INFORMATION.  OUR PARTY  INDICATES THAT  OTHER PRESIDENTS  HAVE BEEN  BRIEFED ON  INFORMATION THAT  MIGHT NOT BE AIR- TIGHT  AND ROCK-SOLID  AND READY TO GO.  BUT THAT THE --.  SHE APPEARED TO  INDICATE SHE  STILL HAS NOT  BEEN  BRIEFED ON IT.  AS WE WERE  TALKING ABOUT A  MOMENT AGO,  MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS ARE NOW  BEING BRIEFED ON  IT.  SO THE QUESTION  NOW, WHICH ONE  OF MY COLLEAGUES  WAS  TRYING TO GIVE  CLARITY ON, HAS  THE PRESIDENT  BEEN  BRIEFED ON IT,  AND WILL  CONGRESS BE  BRIEFED ON  INTELLIGENCE  THAT THE  PRESIDENT HASN'T  BEEN BRIEFED  ON.  .  >> AGAIN,  FALLING BACK ON  THE IDEA THAT  THERE IS  STILL DISSENT  AMONG SOME IN  THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY ABOUT  THE ACCURACY OF  THIS  INFORMATION.  >> SHANNON, VICE  PRESIDENT PENCE  IS NOW  ENCOURAGING  PEOPLE TO WEAR A  MASK WHEREVER  INDICATED.  HE HAS BEEN  WEARING ONE ON  OCCASIONS IN  PUBLIC.  DO WE KNOW IF  THE PRESIDENT  HAS CHANGED HIS  MIND ON  THAT AS WELL?  >> THE  PRESIDENT'S  POSITION ON  MASKS CONTINUES  TO BE  THAT IT IS A  PERSONAL CHOICE,  AND THAT THE CDC  RECOMMENDS ARE  JUST THAT,  RECOMMENDATIONS,  NOT  REQUIREMENTS.  THE WHITE HOUSE  HAS ECHOED WHAT  THE VICE  PRESIDENT  HAS BEEN SAYING  THAT PEOPLE  SHOULD FOLLOW,  WHAT THE  LOCAL  AUTHORITIES ARE  RECOMMENDING.  BUT I THINK IT  WILL BE A  QUESTION TO SEE  WHAT THE  PRESIDENT WILL  DO AT HIS NEXT  EVENT, WHICH HE  DOESN'T HAVE  ANYTHING ON HIS  SCHEDULE,  WHETHER  THEY'RE GOING  FORWARD.  . THEY'RE GOING  TO HAVE A  CONVENTION IN  AUGUST, ISSUE  A REQUIREMENT  PEOPLE WEAR A  MASK IN PUBLIC  PLACES.  S  AWAY WHERE WE  ARE AT TWO  MONTHS FROM NOW.  YOU KNOW, A LOT  COULD CHANGE.  .  >> ALL RIGHT.  SHANNON WITH THE  LATEST OUT OF  THE WHITE HOUSE,  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH.  % MUCH , .  >>> THE RUSSIAN  GOVERNMENT IS  RESPONDING TO  REPORTS  OUT OF  AFGHANISTAN.  SENIOR  INTERNATIONAL  CORRESPONDENT  KIRSTEN SPOKE TO  DEMETRI TESTOV  IN A REMARKABLY  CANDID AND  EXCLUSIVE  INTERVIEW.  >> Reporter:   DEMETRI TESTOV,  THE SPOKESPERSON  FOR  THE KREMLIN,  SPOKE DIRECTLY  ABOUT THESE  ALLEGATIONS  THAT THE  RUSSIANS WERE  OFFERING BOUNTY  TO THE  TALIBAN FOR  KILLING U.S.  SERVICEMEN AND  WOMEN IN  AFGHANISTAN.  I ASKED HIM  WHETHER RUSSIAN  MILITARY  INTELLIGENCE  WAS INVOLVED IN  THIS ALLEGED  OPERATION.  HE DENIES IT, AS  YOU ARE ABOUT TO  HEAR.  THIS PART OF OUR  EXCHANGE BEGINS  WITH ME ASKING  THE  QUESTION.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> IF RUSSIA WAS  PAYING MONEY TO  REWARD MEMBERS  OF  THE TALIBAN FOR  KILLING AMERICAN  SOLDIERS, WOULD  YOU  CONSIDER THAT TO  BE AND ACT OF  AGGRESSION?  WOULD YOU SEE  THAT AS A  SERIOUS FACT?  >> I DON'T THINK  THE SITUATION IS  POSSIBLE EVER.  SO THIS IS  REALLY  RIDICULOUS.  THIS IS REALLY  RIDICULOUS TO  SPREAD THIS KIND  OF  INFORMATION.  >> YOU DON'T  THINK --.  >> THIS IS 100%  [ BEEP ] IT'S [  BEEP ]  >> THAT'S  STRONG.  >> Reporter:  UNDIPLOMATIC  LANGUAGE.  A COUPLE OTHER  POINTS.  THE SPOKESPERSON  FOR THE KREMLIN  REFERS TO  PRESIDENT  TRUMP EAT TWEET,  WHERE HE  QUESTIONS THE  VALIDITY OF  THIS REPORTING,  QUESTIONS THE  ALLEGED  INTELLIGENCE.  HE SAYS THOSE  COMMENTS JUST  UNDERSCORE THAT  RUSSIA  IS RIGHT TO  QUESTION THIS  STORY.  AND I ASKED  TESTOV, WHERE  THE RUSSIAN  GOVERNMENT AT  ANY LEVEL, THE  MILITARY LEVEL,  THE INTELLIGENCE  LEVEL, THEY HAVE  HAD ANY  COMPLAINT.  DEMETRI TESTOV  SAYS THEY HAVE  NOT HEARD FROM  THE  AMERICANS AT ANY  STAGE.  ALISON?  >>> THE FOUR  FORMER POLICE  OFFICERS  INVOLVED IN THE  DEATH OF GEORGE  FLOYD APPEARED  IN COURT IN  MINNEAPOLIS  TODAY.  THE OTHER TWO  OFFICERS CHARGED  WITH AIDING AND  ABETTING MURDER.  NBC NEWS  REPORTER SHACK  BOOSTER IS  JOINING US FROM  MINNEAPOLIS.  SHAQ, WHAT  HAPPENED IN  COURT TODAY, AND  WHAT'S NEXT  UP?  .  >> WE NOW HAVE A  TRIAL DATE.  THE TRIAL DATE  HAS BEEN SET FOR  MARCH 8th.  THERE WILL BE  ANOTHER HEARING  ON SEPTEMBER  11th,  WHERE WE WILL  SEE THE FORMER  OFFICERS  APPEARING  BEFORE THE  JUDGE.  AT TODAY'S  HEARING, IT WAS  ONE THAT WAS NO  CAMERAS  ALLOWED.  SO WE DIDN'T GET  TO SEE THE  PROCEEDINGS  EXCEPT IF  YOU WERE IN THE  COURT OR THE  OVERFLOW ROOM.  THAT WAS OVER  THE OBJECTIONS  OF THE FOUR  FORMER  MINNEAPOLIS  POLICE  DEPARTMENT  OFFICERS.  WE HEARD FROM  OFFICER DEREK  CHAUVIN, WHO HAD  HIS  KNEE ON THE NECK  FOR ABOUT 8  MINUTES.  THAT VIDEO  COMING OUT ON  MEMORIAL DAY,  AND WE SAW  HIM IN AN ORANGE  JUMP SUIT.  HE WAS WEARING A  MASK.  HE APPEARS VIA  VIDEO  CONFERENCING.  HE WAS  TRANSFERRED TO A  STATE PRISON,  AND HE CHOSE  TO APPEAR VIA  VIDEO  CONFERENCE.  INSTEAD, YOU'VE  HEARD LITTLE  PIECES OF WHAT  COULD  BECOME NOT ONLY  THE UPCOMING  COURT DATE, BUT  ALSO  HEARD A SENSE OF  THE EVIDENCE  THAT THE STATE  HAS  READY.  THERE ARE ABOUT  8,000 INDIVIDUAL  CASES OF  EVIDENCE,  OF DISCOVERY TO  GO THROUGH.  . WE WON'T HAVE  THAT TRIAL UNTIL  NEXT MARCH.  THE JUDGE  COMPLAINED ABOUT  SOME OF THE  TALKS WE'VE  BEEN HEARING.  SOME OF THE  ATTENTION THIS  CASE HAS BEEN  RECEIVING.  PROSECUTORS AND  LAWYERS, DEFENSE  ATTORNEYS AND  THE  JUDGE.  THAT WAS  SOMETHING HE  ASKED THE  PROSECUTORS TO  PULL  BACK ON, TO TALK  ABOUT THE  DETAILS OF THIS  CASE AND  A POSSIBLE  VERDICT ON THIS  CASE.  INSTEAD, LET THE  PROCESS PLAY  OUT.  THAT'S WHAT WE  KNOW NOW.  WE KNOW A TRIAL  DATE ON MARCH  8th OF NEXT  YEAR.  ALISON?  >> THE  MINNEAPOLIS  POLICE  FEDERATION NO  LONGER  SUPPORTING DEREK  CHAUVIN.  WHY NOT, AND  WHAT ARE THEY  SAYING ABOUT THE  OTHER  OFFICERS  INVOLVED?  >> Reporter:   THEY'RE FRANKLY  NOT EXPLAINING  OR  DEFENDING THE  ACTS OFFICER  CHAUVIN TOOK.  THEY SAID THAT  WASN'T BASED ON  TRAINING.  THEY SAY THAT'S  NOT INDICATIVE  OF WHAT AN  OFFICER  SHOULD DO,  HAVING HIS KNEE  ON A SUSPECT'S  NECK FOR  THAT LONG A  PERIOD OF TIME,  NOT RENDERING   AID.  AS FAR AS THE  OTHER THREE  OFFICERS,  THEY'RE STILL  MAKING A  DETERMINATION  OVER WHAT  THEY'RE GOING TO  DO.  THEY WILL APPEAL . WE KNOW THERE  ARE BODY-CAMERA  IMAGES THAT HAVE  NOT  BEEN MADE  PUBLIC.  WE HEARD  DESCRIPTIONS OF  THAT VIDEO IN  CHARGING  DOCUMENTS, BUT  WE HAVE NOT SEEN  -- AND THEY HAVE  NOT  SEEN WHAT THAT  BODY CAMERA  IMAGE OR VIDEO  SHOWS, AND  THEY SAY THAT  COULD BE -- IT  COULD GIVE A  SENSE OF  WHAT HAPPENED IN  THE MINUTES IN  BETWEEN WE KNOW  HE  GOT OUT OF THE  CAR WITH MR.  FLOYD UNTIL  OFFICER  FLOYD PUT THAT  KNEE ON THE NECK  OF HIM.  THERE'S MORE  EVIDENCE THEY  WANT TO SEE  BEFORE MAKING  THAT DECISION.  THEY ARE NOT  DEFENDING HIM,  ASKING FOR AN  APPEAL.  ALISON? >> GEORGE  FLOYD'S FAMILY  SPOKE.  WHAT DID THEY  SAY?  >> WE DID HEAR  FROM THE FAMILY.  THEY WERE IN  COURT.  BEFORE I PLAY  THAT, I DO WANT  TO MAKE NOTE  THERE WAS  ONE POINT WHERE  THE JUMP,  ACCORDING TO THE  NOTES  FROM THE  REPORTERS IN THE  ROOM, THE JUDGE  ADMONISHED  THE UNCLE OF MR.  GEORGE FLOYD FOR  MAKING A FACIAL  EXPRESSION,  APPARENTLY AS  THOSE  PROCEEDINGS WERE  ONGOING.  THE UNCLE ALSO  TALKED ABOUT  WHAT IT WAS LIKE  TO BE  INSIDE THE  COURTROOM AS IT  WAS GOING ON.  LISTEN TO WHAT  THEY TOLD  REPORTERS AFTER  THE  HEARING.  .  >> IT'S  AFFECTING,  EVERYBODY.  >> .  >> KILLED MY  NEPHEW A MONTH  AND THREE DAYS  AGO.  I'M NOT LETTING  ANYBODY.  I'M MAD AT THE  SYSTEM.  .  >> OBVIOUSLY, A  VERY EMOTIONAL  REACTION.  THAT WAS  SOMETHING THAT  CAME UP IN THE  HEARING, THAT  THE FAMILY HAS  BEEN TALKING TO  MEDIA AND HOW  THAT  COULD AFFECT A  POTENTIAL JURY.  THE JUDGE IS  WARNING EVERYONE  STOP TALKING  ABOUT  THIS CASE.  THERE IS NOT A  GAG ORDER  OFFICIALLY IN  PLACE.  . IT IS  SOMETHING THEY  WILL ENFORCE AND  CONTINUE TO  APPLY IF PEOPLE  CONTINUE TO TALK  -- IF THERE  CONTINUES TO BE  THAT TALK AROUND  THE DETAILS IN  THIS  CASE.  ALISON?  >> ALL RIGHT.  CHUCK N  MINNEAPOLIS,  THANKS SO MUCH.  .  >> YOU GOT IT.  >> BOSHEL BURNS  JOINING US.  IT WAS AN EASY  WIN BACK IN  2016.  YOU'VE BEEN  TALKING TO  VOTERS THERE.  WHAT ARE THEY  TELLING YOU?  >> HEY, ALISON,  TRUMP WON BEAVER  BY MORE THAN 19  POINTS BACK IN  2016.  THERE'S BEEN A  LOT OF  SPECULATION  ABOUT WHETHER  VOTERS WOULD  CHANGE THEIR  MIND ABOUT THE  PRESIDENT  BECAUSE OF HIS  HANDLING OF THE  PANDEMIC.  I WAS HAVING  THOSE  CONVERSATIONS,  AND MOST PEOPLE  I  TALKED TO WERE  ACTUALLY PRETTY  HAPPY WITH THE  PRESIDENT.  THEY WERE MORE  FRUSTRATED WITH  THEIR DEMOCRATIC  GOVERNOR KEEPING  BUSINESSES SHUT  DOWN TOO LONG.  NOW THE  CONVERSATION HAS  SHIFTED.  IT'S NOT BECAUSE  OF COVID.  IT'S BECAUSE OF  RACE.  THIS WAS A  COMMUNITY THAT'S  MORE THAN 90%  WHITE,  ONLY 6% BLACK.  BUT THIS  CONVERSATION AND  THE MOVEMENT  AROUND RACIAL  EQUALITY THAT  WE'VE BEEN  COVERING IN  PLACES LIKE NEW  YORK, LOUISIANA,  CHICAGO, THAT'S  ALSO HAPPENING  HERE.  THOSE  CONVERSATIONS  ARE BEING HAD  YOU CAN THEY'RE  IMPACTING PEOPLE  POLITICALLY.  I WANT TO  INTRODUCE YOU TO  A MARRIED  COUPLE.  AND THEY  IDENTIFY AS  CONSERVATIVE  REPUBLICANS.  A COUPLE OF  YEARS AGO, THEIR  DAUGHTER ADOPTED  TWO  AFRICAN AMERICAN  CHILDREN.  WHEN THEY SAW  THE GEORGE FLOYD  VIDEO, THEY WERE  HIT  HARD.  THEY LISTENED TO  DONALD TRUMP'S  RHETORIC IN A  DIFFERENT LIGHT.  WHAT IS YOUR  PERSPECTIVE ON  HOW THE  PRESIDENT HAS  HANDLED THESE  PROTESTS AND  THIS UPRISING IN  AMERICA  NOW?  .  >> I THINK I  WOULD LIKE TO  SEE HIM BE MORE  COMPASSIONATE,  MORE  UNDERSTANDING,  MORE WILLING TO  HAVE A  DISCUSSION.  >> DO YOU THINK  HE'S HURTING HIS  CAMPAIGN WITH  HIS  TONE ON RACE  RIGHT NOW?  >> I DO, YEAH.  I THINK THAT  COULD CHANGE IF  HE WOULD BE A  LITTLE  BIT MORE VOCAL  OR AT LEAST TRY  TO SHOW SOME  UNDERSTANDING.  >> DO YOU KNOW  WHAT YOU'RE  GOING TO DO IN  NOVEMBER  YET?  >> NO.  I WAS SURE THAT  I WAS GOING TO  VOTE FOR HIM  AGAIN,  BUT NOW I'M  RETHINKING IT.  >> THE PEOPLE  I'VE BEEN  TALKING TO, IT'S  NOT LIKE  THEY WOKE UP  WITH BLUE FEVER,  AND ARE NOW BIG  JOE  BIDEN FANS.  BUT THEY ARE  ASKING  THEMSELVES SOME  NEW QUESTIONS  AND NEGOTIATEING  THE PRIORITIES  THAT ARE TAKING  THEM  INTO DIFFERENT  DIRECTIONS.  JOHN SAID HE'S  MORE OPEN-MINDED  TO A POTENTIAL  VOTE  FOR JOE BIDEN  THAN MAYBE HE  WOULD HAVE BEEN  IN THE  PAST.  . HE SAYS RIGHT  NOW, THE BIGGEST  CONCERN IS  CHARACTER,  NOT SO MUCH THE  PARTY LINE,  ALISON.  >> THERE IS  UNITY IN THE  WEEKEND AS WELL.  WHAT WAS THAT  LIKE?  >> Reporter:   THIS MOVEMENT IS  HAPPENING.  INTERESTINGLY,  IT WAS NOT  CALLED A BLACK  LIVES  MATTER MARCH.  IT WAS A UNITY  MARCH.  THEY'RE TRYING  TO BRING MORE  PEOPLE TO THE  TABLE.  BECAUSE FRANKLY,  FOR A LOT OF  PEOPLE IN THIS  COMMUNITY, THIS  IS A NEW  CONVERSATION.  THIS ANALYSIS OF  RACIAL  RELATIONS.  THEY WERE THERE  FOR RACIAL  EQUALITY.  THEY SIGNED A  PLEDGE, THINGS  LIKE, \"I WILL BE  AN  ALLY,  ANTIRACIST.\" .  >>> JOE BIDEN  SAID HE'S  OUTRAGED OF  REPORTS OF  RUSSIAN BOUNTIES  ON TROOPS.  THE PRESUMPTIVE  PRESIDENTIAL  NOMINEE ACCUSING  PRESIDENT TRUMP  OF HIS DUTY AS  COMMANDER IN  CHIEF.  >> THE TRAIL OF  EVERY SINGLE  AMERICAN FAMILY,  THE  LOVED ONES  SERVING  AFGHANISTAN AND  OVERSEAS.  I'M QUITE  FRANKLY OUTRAGED  BY THE REPORT.  IF I'M ELECTED  PRESIDENT, MAKE  NO MISTAKE ABOUT  IT,  VLADIMIR PUTIN  WILL BE  CONFRONTED AND  IMPOSE A  SERIOUS COST ON  RUSSIA.  I DON'T JUST  THINK ABOUT THIS  AS A CANDIDATE  FOR  PRESIDENT, I  THINK ABOUT THIS  AS A DAD, A  FATHER WHO  SENT HIS SON TO  SERVE IN HARM'S  WAY FOR YEARS.  .  >> MIKE NEMELEE  JOINING ME NOW.  WHAT ELSE IS THE  CAMPAIGN SAYING  ABOUT THIS  TODAY?  >> WE TALK ABOUT  IT ALL THE TIME,  THE FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT NOT  JUST ON THE  CAMPAIGN TRAIL,  BUT MAKING  THE NEWS  VIRTUALLY POP  INTO AN ASIAN  PACIFIC  ISLANDER GROUP.  THIS WAS AN  OPPORTUNITY FOR  THE BIDEN  CAMPAIGN.  THEY WANTED TO  GO AFTER  PRESIDENT TRUMP  ON HIS  HANDLING OF THE  CORONAVIRUS.  WE SEE THEM TAKE  ON THE ADVANTAGE  THE PRESIDENT  STILL HAS ON THE  ECONOMY.  ONE ADVANTAGE I  THINK EVERYONE  ASSUMES THE VICE  PRESIDENT STARTS  OUT WITH, THE  CAMPAIGN ON  FOREIGN  POLICIES.  THESE ARE  FORCING \"THE NEW  YORK TIMES,\"  \"THE  WASHINGTON POST\"  ABOUT THE  BOUNTIES RUSSIA  IS PAYING  TO TALIBAN FOR  TAKING LIVES  THERE, AN  OPPORTUNITY  FOR THE FORMER  VICE PRESIDENT.  I'VE HEARD HIM  TALK ABOUT HIS  RELATIONSHIP  WITH  VLADIMIR PUTIN  QUITE OFTEN.  BIDEN IS NOT  ONLY THE VICE  PRESIDENT.  HE TALKS OFTEN  ABOUT THE TIME  HE SPENT MEETING  WITH  WORLD LEADERS,  AND WE ALL  REMEMBER THE  FAMOUS LINE  FROM GEORGE W.  BUSH WHEN HE  SAID, \"I LOOKED  INTO  PUTIN'S EYES AND  SAW HIS SOUL.\"  BIDEN TALKED  ABOUT HOW HE MET  WITH PUTIN AND  SAID,  \"I SEE INTO YOUR  EYES, AND YOU  HAVE NO SOUL.\"  BIDEN AT THIS  EVENT SAYING  THIS DOES NOT  ONLY SHOW  WHAT PRESIDENT  TRUMP HAS DONE  WRONG, BUT THERE  IS NO  BOTTOM TO THE  DEPTH OF PUTIN'S  DEPRAVITY, THAT  WE  SHOULD CONTINUE  TO HEAR THE  PRESIDENT  TALKING ABOUT  THIS STORY IN  THE DAYS AND  WEEKS AHEAD  BECAUSE OF  THAT FOREIGN  POLICY  ADVANTAGE.  >> ALL RIGHT.  MIKE, HERE IT  IS.  I'M NOT GOING TO  LEAVE IT TO THE  END.  WE'RE GOING TO  HIT MY FAVORITE  TOPIC.  BIDEN UNDER A  LOT OF PRESSURE  TO PICK A BLACK  WOMAN,  OF COURSE.  BUT WHAT ARE THE  POLLS SAYING  ABOUT THE TYPE  OF VICE  PRESIDENT VOTERS  THINK SHOULD BE  ON THE TICKET.  >> YEAH.  IT'S  INTERESTING.  >> MY COLLEAGUE  WROTE ABOUT THIS  THIS WEEKEND  THIS  WEEKEND.  WE'VE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT  THIS PRESSURE TO  CHOOSE A  RUNNING MATE, A  WOMAN OF COLOR.  DOES THAT BEAR  OUT IN THE  POLLS?  I'VE HEARD THIS  FROM SOME  LEADERS OF  PROMINENT  MINORITY GROUPS,  SAYING THAT  THERE'S NO  GUARANTEE  THAT A WOMAN OF  COLOR BIDEN  MIGHT CHOOSE IS  ACTUALLY  BETTER ON THE  ISSUES THAN  PERHAPS  ELIZABETH WARREN  IS THE NAME  MENTIONED MOST  OFTEN THROUGHOUT  HER  CAMPAIGN.  THE  MASSACHUSETTS  SENATOR DID A  VERY GOOD JOB OF  BUILDING  RELATIONSHIPS  WITH COMMUNITIES  OF COLOR,  BRINGING THEM  INTO THEIR  CAMPAIGN.  WHAT THE POLLS  SHOW IS  SOMETHING THAT  IS COMPLETELY  DIFFERENT FROM  THE WAY WE TALK  ABOUT THIS.  ''THE NEW YORK  TIMES\" POLL THAT  WAS RELEASED  LAST  WEEK ACTUALLY  FOUND FOUR OUT  OF FIVE  REGISTERED  VOTERS SAY RACE  SHOULD NOT BE A  FACTOR.  IT SHOULD BE --  AND EVEN AMONG  VERY LIBERAL  VOTERS,  THIS IS PROBABLY  THE GRAPHIC WE  THINK WOULD BE  PERHAPS MOST  INTERESTED IN  SEEING THAT.  FIFTY-TWO  PERCENT OF  LIBERAL VOTERS  SAY IT SHOULD  NOT BE A FACTOR.  SO WHAT WE OFTEN  SEE IN SOME OF  THESE SURVEYS IS  THAT ELIZABETH  WARREN TENDS TO  BE THE BEST  AMONG  DEMOCRATS AS A  PRESIDENTIAL  RUNNING MATE  CHOICE.  THAT HAS A LOT  TO DO -- SHE'S  PROBABLY THE  BEST  KNOWN, BUT  KAMALA HARRIS WE  SHOULD CONSIDER  AS WELL.  HIGH UP, HER  RECORD AS -- THE  DISTRICT  ATTORNEY HAS  SAID IT WILL BE  A CONCERN FOR  SOME MINORITIES,  ESPECIALLY AS WE  TALK ABOUT  POLICING AND  ISSUES OF  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE, BASED  ON HER TIME IN  THOSE TWO  ROLES.  >> MIKE, WE KNOW  THE BIDENS HAVE  SOME CAMPAIGN  EVENTS.  I KNOW WE JOKED,  YOU HAVE BEEN  GOING TO  PENNSYLVANIA  ABOUT ONCE A  WEEK.  BUT HE HASN'T  HAD ANY FORMAL  PRESS  CONFERENCES  SINCE  AROUND APRIL.  HAS HIS CAMPAIGN  SAID WHY?  IS THIS SOME  KIND OF  STRATEGIC MOVE  HERE.  ? THIS IS  SOMETHING THE  VICE PRESIDENT  HAS TALKED  ABOUT OVER THE  WEEKEND, AS HE  WAS SPEAKING TO  DONORS.  THE QUESTION WAS  ASKED OF HIM,  WHY ISN'T HE  CAMPAIGNING  MORE?  HE JOKED ABOUT  THE FACT THAT  THE PRESIDENT IS  SEEING  ALL SORTS OF  EVENTS, AND HIS  NUMBERS CONTINUE  TO  DROP THROUGH THE  FLOOR.  THE RIGHT THING  MEDICALLY HAS TO  BE THE RIGHT  THING  POLITICALLY.  HE HAS BEEN  DOING EVENTS  JUST ABOUT EVERY  DAY, MAYBE  NOT HITTING THE  CAMPAIGN TRAIL,  BUT HE IS  GETTING  HIS VOICE OUT  THERE ON THE KEY  ISSUES.  BUT I WOULD LOVE  TO GET TO ASK  HIM A QUESTION.  IT'S BEEN THREE  MONTHS SINCE SEE  IF SEEN HIM IN  PERSON, OTHER  THAN AFAR, THE  LAST COUPLE  WEEKS, GET  AWAY FROM HIM IF  HE DRIVES PAST  HIS SUV.  BUT I SHOULD  MENTION THE  CAMPAIGN.  I'VE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT  THIS WITH THEM A  LOT.  WE MAY BEGIN TO  SEE THAT CHANGE  THIS WEEK,  BECAUSE  WE KNOW THE  TRUMP CAMPAIGN  HAS BEEN REALLY  PUSHING  THIS MESSAGE.  PROGRAMS JOE  BIDEN IS HIDING  FROM VOTERS, AND  THAT'S  SOMETHING THAT  THE BIDEN  CAMPAIGN IS  EAGER TO PUSH  BACK ON, AND  MAYBE WE'LL SEE  HIM THERE IS  THAT THIS  WEEK.  DOING SO IN AN  APPROPRIATELY  SOCIALLY DISTANT  WAY.  >> MIKE, I KNOW  YOU'LL CONTINUE  TO CHASE HIM  DOWN  THE STREET.  I KNOW YOU'LL  GET TO ASK HIM  IN A LITTLE BIT  LESS  STRESSFUL  FASHION.  THANKS SO MUCH.  >> THANKS,  ALISON.  >>> STARBUCKS  JOINING THE LONG  LIST OF  COMPANIES,  PAUSING THEIR  ADVERTISING ON  SOCIAL MEDIA  PLATFORMS  BECAUSE OF THE  SPREAD OF HATE  SPEECH ONLINE.  THIS BOYCOTT  STARTED ON  FACEBOOK.  THESE COMPANIES  ARE NOW PULLING  THEIR  ADVERTISEMENT  FROM INSTAGRAM  AND TWITTER,  TOO.  ''NBC NEWS\"  BUSINESS AND  TECHNOLOGY  CORRESPONDENT  JOLENE KENT  JOINS ME NOW.  FACEBOOK HAS  BROUGHT IN  NEARLY $70  MILLION IN  GLOBAL  AD REVENUE LAST  YEAR.  HOW MUCH OF AN  IMPACT WILL A  BOYCOTT LIKE  THIS HAVE  ON MAJOR  SOUTHBOUND  PLATFORMS.  >> Reporter:   YEAH.  NINETY-NINE  PERCENT OF THE  MONEY FACEBOOK  BRINGS IN  IS BASED ON  SELLING ADS.  NOT A LOT OF  PEOPLE  UNDERSTAND THAT.  THAT IS A FACTOR  HERE.  BASICALLY, IF  YOU TAKE A LOOK  AT ONE ESTIMATE.  I'LL MAKE SURE I  HAVE THIS RIGHT  FOR YO  . THE HIGHEST  BRANDS SPEND  ABOUT $4  BILLION, AND  THAT'S ABOUT 6%,  5, 6% OF THAT  TOTAL AMOUNT WE  WERE  TALKING ABOUT  HERE.  SO  SO YOU HAVE  OTHER COMPANIES  BARING THE BRUNT  OF WHAT  WAS PREVIOUSLY  TARGETED AT  FACEBOOK HERE.  THIS  ORGANIZATION  STARTED THIS  CAMPAIGN IS THE  ADL  AND IT IS A  BUNCH OF OTHER  ORGANIZATIONS,  COLOR OF  CHANGE, NAACP.  THEY'RE SAYING  THIS IS STARTING  TO WORK.  IT'S CLEAR THE  COMPANY WHO ARE  PARTICIPATING IN  ANY  SORT OF BAN IN  GENERAL ARE  DECIDING IT'S  NOT ENOUGH.  WHAT MARK  ZUCKERBERG IS  DOING IS NOT  EFFICIENT.  >> IT SEEMS LIKE  DEMANDS HAVEN'T  BEEN MET.  JOLINE, THANK  YOU SO MUCH.  >> SURE.  YOU'RE WATCHING  NBC NEWS NOW.  HAPPY MONDAY.  TAKE IT AWAY.  GREAT TO SEE  YOU.  LOTS OF  HEADLINES IN  THIS HOUR.  FIRST NEW  REACTION FROM  THE SUPREME  COURT RULING  STRIKING DOWN A  LOUISIANA  ABORTION RULE F.  PLANNED  PARENTHOOD SAID  THOSE SEEKING  ABORTIONS IN  LOUISIANA  CAN NOW BREATHE  A SIGH OF  RELIEF.  PETE WILLIAMS  WILL BE ON THE  WITH THE DETAILS  IN A  MOMENT.  NOW A NUMBER OF  UPDATES ON  CORONAVIRUS.  THE NUMBER OF  CONFIRMED  CORONAVIRUS  CASES IN THE  UNITED STATES  HAS NOW SURPASSED % IC IS % ACCELERATING  AROUND THE % WORLD AS % COUNTRIES  CONTINUE THEIR  REOPENING PLANS. % TAKE A QUICK % LISTEN TO THE  DIRECTOR GENERAL % HERE.  BACK TO REOPEN  ECONOMIES AND  SOCIETY.  >> NEW YORK IS  SUPPOSED TO  ENTER PHASE  THREE OF THE  REOPENING THIS  WEEK.  GOVERNOR CUOMO  SAYS INDOOR  DINING MAY HAVE  TO WAIT  BECAUSE THE  VIRUS SPREAD IN  ENCLOSED  AREAINGS.  HE SAID HE WOULD  BE TALKING TO  BUSINESS OWNERS  AND  GATHERING MORE  DATA.  >> IT'S INDOOR  DINING THE AND  YOU HAVE THE  CONGREGATION  PROBLEM AND  VIRAL SPREAD  ACROSS THE  NATION WHICH I  THINK IS REALLY  PROBLEMATIC FOR  US.  THAT'S WHY I  IMPLORE THE  PRESIDENT TO GET  INTO THE  GAME.  PERFORMANCES ARE  CANCELED UNTIL  AT LEAST JANUARY  BECAUSE OF  CONCERNS.  >>> IN A  STATEMENT, THE  MUSIC  ORGANIZATION BMI  TOLD  NBC NEWS THAT  PLAYING MUSIC  FROM THE ARING  STONES  CONSTITUTES THE  BREACH OF THE  LICENSING  AGREEMENT.  THE ASSOCIATED  PRESS REPORTS  THEIR 1969 SONG  \"YOU  CAN'T ALWAYS GET  WHAT YOU WANT\"  WAS PLAYED IN  TRUMP'S RALLY IN  TULSA, OKLAHOMA  RECENTLY.  THAT WRAPS UP  HEADLINES FOR  THIS HOUR.  WE'LL SEE YOU  BACK HERE LATER  WITH MORE  HEADLINES.  ALLISON?  ALL RIGHT,  ALEXA.  WE'LL SEE YOU IN  A LITTLE BIT.  >>> THE SUPREME  COURT IS  STRIKING DOWN A  LOUISIANA  LAW THAT  RESTRICTS ACCESS  TO ABORTIONS IN  A 5-4  DECISION TODAY.  PETE WILLIAMS IS  JOINING ME FROM  WASHINGTON DC.  TALK US THROUGH  THE RULING.  SURE.  THIS IS A LAW.  IT REALLY NEVER  TOOK EFFECT IN  FULL FORCE.  IT WAS PASSED BY  LOUISIANA AND  SAID THAT A  DOCTOR  PERFORMING  ABORTION  SERVICES HAD TO  HAVE PRIVILEGES  TO ADMIT  PATIENTS AT A  NEARBY HOSPITAL.  THE STATE SAID  THIS WOULD HELP  MAKE SURE  DOCTORS  WERE PROPERLY  CREDENTIALS.  THE SUPREME  COURT SAID IT  WOULD PROVIDE NO  HEALTH  BENEFITS AND  WOULD BE AN  ADDITIONAL  OPTION TO WOMEN.  THIS LAW WAS A  DENT KAL TO THE  ONE TEXAS PASSED  AND  THE SUPREME  COURT STRUCK  DOWN FOUR YEARS  AGO.  IN THAT RULING  FOUR YEARS AGO,  THE CHIEF  JUSTICE  JOHN ROBERTS WAS  ONE OF THE  CENTERS.  HE WOULD NOT  HAVE STRUCK DOWN  THE TEXAS LAW.  TODAY HE SAID  EVEN THOUGH I  DISAGREED WITH  THAT  DECISION, THAT'S  NOW THE LAW.  I'M BOUND BY  THAT PRECEDENCE.  HE JOINED IN THE  OTHER LIBERALS  TO FORM THE  VOTE.  THE 5-4 VOTE  DECLARES THE LAW  UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  IT FLAUNTS THE  SAME TAX TEXAS  LAW DID YEARS  AGO.  >> RICHARDS SAID  THIS ABOUT THE  DECISION TODAY.  >> TODAY JUSTICE  ROBERTS DID THE  RIGHT THING,  UPHELD  THE PRESIDENT  AND STOOD WITH  WOMEN.  MAKE NO MISTAKE,  THE  ADMINISTRATION  IS COMPLETELY  COMMITTED TO  TAKING AWAY THE  RIGHT OF PEOPLE  TO MAKE  THEIR OWN  DECISIONS ABOUT  PREGNANCY.  >> WHAT SHOULD  PEOPLE TAKE AWAY  FROM THIS  DECISION?  NOT ONLY  ABORTION RIGHTS  BUT ALSO THE  SUPREME COURT  AND LEANING.  >> IT'S  UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE  PRESIDENT TRUMP  WANTS TO  CHANGE THE LAW.  MOST ARE STATE  LAWS.  THIS IS JUST  SUCH AN EXAMPLE.  >> SECONDLY I  WOULD SAY THIS  IS NOT  --  THIS  RULING  IS NOT A  RESOUNDING  VICTORY FOR  ABORTION RIGHTS.  BASICALLY  JUSTICE  ROBERTINGS JOINS  THE MAJORITY  SAYING BECAUSE  WE'VE ALREADY  DECIDED THIS  QUESTION,  THE SAME ANSWER  APPLIES.  IF A NEW  RESTRICTION CAME  ALONG, IT  DOESN'T  NECESSARILY  MEANS HE WOULD  BE WITH THE  LIBERALS ON  THAT ONE.  I THINK YOU'RE  HEARING A MUTED  SENSE OF VICTORY  FOR  ADVOCATES FOR  ABORTION RIGHTS.  THERE'S ONE  OTHER POINT  ABOUT THIS  DECISION.  THERE WERE FIVE  DEFINITE VOTES  TODAY TO PUT AN  END  TO THE CLAIM  LOUISIANA HAD  MADE AND OTHERS  MAKE THAT  ABORTION CLINICS  AND ABORTION  DOCTORS CANNOT  CHALLENGE  RESTRICTIONS.  THEIR THEORY IS  BECAUSE OF THE  RIGHTS OF ACCESS  TO  ABORTION BELONGS  TO WOMEN,  THEY'RE THE ONLY  ONES.  ONLY PREGNANT  WOMEN CAN BRING  CHALLENGES.  IF THE COURT HAD  AGREED WITH THAT  IDEA, IT THAT  WOULD MAKE IT  HARDER TO  CHALLENGE FUTURE  ABORTION  RESTRICTIONS.  >> PETE  WILLIAMS, WE'VE  HAD BIG  DECISIONS FROM  THE  SUPREME COURT  LATELY.  THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US ONCE  AGAIN.  >>> BEACHES  ACROSS FLORIDA  ARE SHUTTING THE  DOWN FOR  THE FOURTH OF  JULY.  THE STATE SET A  RECORD THIS  WEEKEND WITH  MORE THAN  18,000 NEW  CORONAVIRUS  CASES.  NBC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT  SAM BROCK HAS  MORE FROM MIAMI  BEACH.  >> ALLISON, GOOD  AFTERNOON.  GOOD TO BE WITH  YOU.  I'M ON MIAMI  BEACH WHICH JUST  REOPENED A FEW  WEEKS  AGO.  IT'S CLOSING FOR  THE NEXT HOLIDAY  WEEKEND JULY 3- 7. ALL THE  BEACHES ARE  SHUTTING DOWN TO  TRY TO PREVENT  A REPEAT OF  MEMORIAL DAY  HOLIDAY.  THERE WAS A  SPIKE IN CASES A  COUPLE WEEKS  A  AFTERWARDS.  THE MAYOR OF  MIAMI DADE AND  ALSO BROWARD  COUNTY CAME  OUT TO SAY YOU  CAN'T COME HERE  FOR THE HOLIDAY.  IT'S FOR YOUR  OWN SAFETY.  THEY WERE  SHOUTED AT AND  HECKLED.  IF YOU LOOK OVER  MY SHOULDER,  THERE'S PLENTY  OF  SPACE AT THE  MOMENT.  WE'RE ON MONDAY  AFTERNOON.  THE CONCERN IS  WHAT IS THIS  GOING GOING TO  LOOK LIKE  COME JULY 4th.  ESPECIALLY AL  SON, GIVEN THE   PACT THE  POSITIVE  RATES ARE GOING  IN THE WRONG  DIRECTION.  THE LATEST  NUMBERS FROM  FLORIDA, 5 NOW  200 CASES  CONFIRMED TODAY.  NOT NEARLY AS  MUCH AS OVER THE  WEEKEND, ALMOST  10,000 SATURDAY,  8500 SUNDAY.  HERE'S THE  PROBLEM.  THEY DID MORE  TESTS ON THOSE  DAYS.  ALMOST 16%  ACROSS THE STATE  OF FLORIDA.  IN MIAMI DATE  COUNTY, WHERE  I'M AT NOW, THE  THE TWO  WEEK AVERAGE IS  CLOSER TO 17%.  THAT'S HIGHER  THAN ANY  OFFICIAL IS  COMFORTABLE WITH  NOW.  IT'S THE REASON  WE'RE SEEING  SAFETY MEASURES  BEING  TAKEN.  SOME THINK  THEY'RE EXTREME.  SOME THINK IT'S  ABOUT TIME WE DO  SOMETHING AS  CASES  SURGE.  BARS CLOSING  ACROSS FLORIDA  AS WELL.  WE'LL SEE IF  THERE'S ROLL  BACKS AS WE  CONTINUE.  NBC NEWS.  BACK TO YOU.  >> ARIZONA IS  STRUGGLING TO  EXPAND THE COVID- 19  TESTING AS ICU  BEDS ARE FILLING  UP.  NBC NEWS  REPORTER VON  HILLIER IS  JOINING US FROM  A  TEST SITE IN  PHOENIX.  WHAT IS GOING ON  THERE TODAY?  WELL, IT GETS  WORSE EVERY DAY  WE DO THIS  ALLISON.  HOW MANY TIMES  DO I HAVE TO  TELL YOU WE'RE  BREAKING  RECORDS.  BREAKING RECORDS  FOR A NUMBER OF  VENTILATORS,  NUMBER  OF ICU BEDS.  THIS WEEKEND,  BROKE THE RECORD  FOR MOST NEW  CASES.  4000 IN A SINGLE  DAY.  THE I DON'T KNOW  HOW MANY TIMES  WE HAVE TO DO  THIS  FRANKLY.  I'M A LITTLE  EXACERBATED  BECAUSE THERE'S  NO POLICY  CHANGE OR  RESOURCES.  THE STATE OR  GOVERNOR HERE  HAS NOT  REIMPLEMENTED  ANY  SHUTDOWN OR STAY  AT HOME ORDERS.  POOLS, WATER  PARKS, CASINOS  ARE OPEN.  GOING AROUND  TOWN, IT'S JUNE  28, 2018.  SOME FOLKS ARE  STAYING HOME,  BUT BY IN LARGE,  THESE  STREETINGS THIS  WEEKEND, THERE'S  TRAFFIC ON THEM.  IN THE LAST TWO  WEEKS, WE NEED  TO PUT THIS INTO  THE  CONTEXT.  THE LAST TWO  WEEKS, 14 DAYS,  THE NUMBER OF  HOSPITALIZATIONS  HAS INCREASED  NEARLY DOUBLE  THE  LAST IF TWO  WEEKS.  THE GOVERNOR  URGED FOLKS TO  STAY AT HOME.  BY IN LARGE,  YOU'RE NOT  SEEING THAT  HAPPEN ON A  LARGE SCALE.  THERE'S SERIOUS  QUESTIONS IN THE  STATE OF  ARIZONA.  THERE'S LITTLE  REASON WHEN IT  COMES TO CONTACT  TRACING AND THE  TRAJECTORY IN  THE UPCOMING  WEEKS.  >> VON, I KNOW  YOU SAY YOU'RE  EXACERBATED,  THAT'S  NOT YOUR NATURE.  WE HAVE TALKED  TO YOU DAY AFTER  DAY.  THE ONLY THING  THAT HAS REALLY  CHANGED IS THAT  THINGS HAVE  GOTTEN WORSE.  TELL US MORE  ABOUT THE  TESTING LAB  WHERE YOU ARE  AND  WHAT PEOPLE ARE  TELLING YOU.  I IMAGINE FOLKS  ARE EXACERBATED  THERE AS WELL.  THAT'S PART OF  IT.  WE DON'T HAVE  ANSWERS.  >> Reporter:  THIS WEEKEND I  TALKED TO A  WAITER THAT  SAID SHE'S  EXPOSED 2000  EVERYDAY.  SHE SAYS SHE  WORRIES OF  GIVING IT TO  SOMEONE.  I SPOKE TO  SOMEONE THAT  WORKS IN RETAIL  FOR THE SAME  REASON.  SHE WANTS TO GET  TESTED.  SHE'LL TELL YOU  A LITTLE ABOUT  THAT EXPERIENCE.  >> YOU STOOD UP  HERE LOOKING FOR  A TEST?  YES, I DID.  >> WHAT DID YOU  FIND?  SO NOTHING IS  OPEN.  THERE'S NO NEW  INFORMATION  ONLINE SAYING IT  WAS  CLOSED AT ALL.  >> IS IT  FRUSTRATING TO  SHOW UP AND  THERE BE NO  TESTING HERE?  JUST A LITTLE  BIT.  IT'S KIND OF A  TREASURE HUNT  NOW.  >> Reporter:  YES, WE ARE  BREAKING RECORDS  IN THE  STATE FOR NUMBER  OF POSITIVE  CASES.  IT'S ALSO  TELLING HOW HARD  IT IS TO GET A  TEST, HOW  MUCH OF A  TREASURE HUNT IT  I FOR PEOPLE  LIKE HER.  THE TESTS ARE  COMING BACK IN A  DELAYED ORDER.  THE DEMAND FAR  EXCEEDS THE  CAPACITY.  IT'S ONE OF THE  IMPORTANT  NUMBERS I WANT  TO POINT  OUT.  THAT'S 25%.  ALLISON, 25% OF  THE TESTS THAT  ARE TAKEN COME  BACK  POSITIVE.  THAT IS  EXTRAORDINARY.  FAR AHEAD OF  FLORIDA, TEXAS,  WHERE THE UNITED  STATES  IS.  TO UNDERSTAND  THE VASTNESS OF  THE SPREAD, WE  UNDERSTAND  SO  LITTLE.  THAT'S WHAT  BRINGS US HERE.  THE LABORATORIES  PROCESS 80% OF  THE COVID TESTS  IN  THIS STATE.  RIGHT NOW  THEY'RE NOT ABLE  TO PROCESS  ENOUGH TESTS.  ALL THESE ARE  COMING IN.  THEY CAN ONLY  PROCESS 7000  TESTS A DAY  WHICH IS  RESULTING IN  THAT BACKLOG.  MY FOLKS AREN'T  GETTING RESULTS  MORE THAN A WEEK  IN  MOST CASES.  >> I HAD THE  CHANCE TO TALK.  I APPRECIATE HER  TALKING.  I JUST TALKED  WITH THE CHIEF  OPERATING  OFFICER.  I WAS ABLE TO  ASK SONIA WHY  ARE WE IN THIS  POSITION?  HOW IS THE STATE  GOING TO PROCESS  TESTS?  WE'RE IN  UNPRECEDENTED  TIMES.  WE ALL RAMPED UP  AS QUICKLY AS WE  PROBABLY COULD.  WHERE WE ARE  TODAY REPRESENTS  A VERY CONCERTED  EFFORT TO BRING  IN ADDITIONAL  INSTRUMENTS,  STAFF,  THE CONSUMABLES  TO MEET THE  DEMAND.  REPORT REPORT  SONIA IS >> Reporter:  SONIA IS  ANSWERING MY  QUESTION.  THE ARIZONA HAD  A THREE MONTH  LEEWAY.  WE AREN'T NEW  YORK OR NEW  JERSEY.  THE TRAJECTORY  WAS SEEN IN  MODELING.  EVEN A WORSE  CASE SCENARIO  THAN.  THEY'RE NOW  TRYING TO GET  MACHINERY.  WHEN I ASKED AND  PRESSED WHERE DO  MACHINES COME IN  AND WHERE CAN  ARIZONANS TRULY  GET A TEST?  I CAN'T GET THAT  ANSWER.  THE GOVERNOR IS  EXPECTED THE  PRESS CONFERENCE  HERE  THIS AFTERNOON.  FRANKLY I THINK  THAT'S WHERE A  LOT OF  EXASPERATION  COMES FROM.  THE FACT THIS  CONTINUES TO GO  IN THE WRONG  DIRECTION.  THIS COMES OUT  OF THE STATE AND  HEALTH CARE  SYSTEM.  >> IS THERE ANY  EXPECTATION THAT  THE GOVERNOR  WILL  BE ANNOUNCING  NEW RESTRICTIONS  OR REGULATIONS?  ANY SORT OF MOVE  TO TRY TO SLOW  DOWN THE SPREAD,  CUT  BACK  HOSPITALIZATIONS?  THERE'S SERIOUS  QUESTIONS.  THE ONLY POLICY  THAT HE  IMPLEMENTED SO  FAR THIS  SUMMER IS THE  OPPORTUNITY TO  IMPLEMENT MASK  REQUIREMENTS.  IT DIDN'T GIVE  LOCALITIES THE  OPPORTUNITY TO  CLOSE  RESTAURANTS OR  BARS THEMSELVES.  THERE'S ALSO  QUESTIONS ABOUT  SCHOOLING.  HERE IN THE  STATE OF  ARIZONA, A THE  GREAT NUMBER OF  SCHOOLS IS YEAR  AROUND SCHOOL.  THEY'RE SET TO  START IN  LITERALLY TWO TO  THREE WEEKS  FROM NOW.  THE THE WHOLE  YOUNG POPULATION  HERE IN THE  HEART OF  MARICOPA COUNTY  ARE SET TO  RECONGREGATE.  THERE'S  QUESTIONS ABOUT  YOUTH SPORTS  CONTINUALLY  ONGOING.  THERE ARE  QUESTIONS IN THE  STATE AS TO  WHAT'S GOING  ON.  THE GOVERNOR IS  URGING PEOPLE TO  STAY HOME SAYING  IT'S A FLASHING  THE YELLOW.  NOT ENOUGH IS  CHANGING QUITE  FRANKLY FROM MY  OWN  EYES ACROSS THE  GREATER ARIZONA.  >> I KNOW YOU'RE  FRUSTRATED BUT  THAT WILL NOT  STOP  YOU FROM ASKING  THE TOUGH  QUESTIONS AND  REPORT BACK  TO US.  THANK YOU FOR  ALL OF YOUR  WORK.  >> I APPRECIATE  IT, MY FRIEND.  >>> BARS IN  SEVERAL  CALIFORNIA  COUNTIES FORCED  TO  CLOSE AGAIN  BECAUSE OF A  SPIKE IN  CORONAVIRUS  CASES  THERE.  NBC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT  ERIN McLAUGHLIN  IS FROM LOS  ANGELES.  THIS IS ONE OF  THE AREAS  CLOSING BARS.  DO YOU KNOW OF  OUTBREAKS OR  SPECIFIC  CONNECTIONS TO  THE OUTLIFE  THERE?  HEY ALLISON.  WHEN THE  GOVERNOR MADE  THIS  ANNOUNCEMENT  OVER THE  WEEKEND.  THE HE DIDN'T  HAVE SPECIFIC  CASES TO SITE  OTHER  THAN THE GENERAL  SPREAD OF THE  VIRUS THROUGHOUT  THE  STATE OF  CALIFORNIA.  REALLY THIS  ORDER THOUGH  SHUTTING THE  DOWN BAR  ACROSS SEVEN  COUNTIES.  RECOMMENDING THE  SHUTDOWN OF BARS  ACROSS EIGHT  MORE  SORT OF FOLLOWS  IN THE FOOTSTEPS  OF OTHER STATES,  FLORIDA AS WELL  AS TEXAS.  THE TEXAS  GOVERNOR IS  SAYING HE  REGRETS EVER  ALLOWING BARS TO  REOPEN IN THE  FIRST PLACE  SAYING  THEY COULD BE  INCUBATORS FOR  THE VIRUS.  WE KNOW THE  SPECIFIC CASE  OUT OF EAST  LANCING,  MICHIGAN SEEN  RESPONSIBLE FOR  SOME 85  CORONAVIRUS  CASES.  EXPERTS SAY THAT  BARS ARE  POTENTIAL  INCUBATORS.  THEY'RE CLOSE  QUARTERS, POORLY  VENTILATED.  IT'S REQUIRING  SOCIAL  DISTANCING AND  MASK WEARING TO  STOP THE SPREAD  OF THIS VIRUS.  >>> WHAT ARE BAR  OWNERS SAYING  ABOUT THE  CLOSURES,  HOW THEY'LL  IMPACT BUSINESS.  THIS HAS TO BE A  FRUSTRATING  TIME.  >> WE SPOKE TO  BAR OWNERS  EARLIER TODAY IN  LOS  ANGELES.  THEY ARE  EXTREMELY  FRUSTRATED.  THEY'RE WORRIED  ABOUT THEIR  BUSINESSES.  THEY LOST A LOT  OF MONEY IN THE  INITIAL SHUTDOWN  INVESTING MORE  MONEY AND TRYING  TO ADJUST TO  THIS  REALITY IN  OPENING TO SHUT  DOWN AGAIN.  A LOT OF BAR  OWNERS SAYING WE  DON'T KNOW IF WE  CAN  GO ON.  OTHER BAR OWNERS  SAYING THEY  NEVER REOPENED  IN 2  FIRST PLACE.  THEY SAW THIS AS  A REALITY.  VERY WORRIED  ABOUT THEIR  BOTTOM LINE.  >> ERIN,  CALIFORNIA HAD A  MASK MANDATE  ALMOST TWO  WEEKS NOW.  FROM WHAT YOU'VE  SEEN, ARE MOST  FOLLOWING THE  GUIDELINES AND  TAKING THIS  SERIOUSLY?  RIGHT NOW WE'RE  SEEING A SURGE  OF CASES IN  CALIFORNIA.  OVER THE PAST  TWO WEEKS, AN  UPTICK OF 50%,  30%  UPTICK IN  HOSPITALIZATIONS.  EXPERTS I'VE  BEEN TALKING TO  SAY IT'S DOWN TO  PEOPLE'S  BEHAVIOR AS THE  STATE HAS SLOWLY  BEEN  REOPENING.  THE STATE HAS  BEEN URGING  GUIDELINES.  PEOPLE HAVE NOT  BEEN FOLLOWING  THEM.  THEY'VE NOT BEEN  WEARING THEIR  MASKS.  THEY'VE NOT BEEN  SOCIAL  DISTANCING.  I WAS TALKING TO  BOB FROM UCF  MEDICAL.  HE TOLD ME THIS  WAS A WARNING  SHOT TO THE REST  OF  THE STATE.  TAKE A LISTEN.  WELL, AT THE  VERY LEAST, IT  IS A CLEAR  MESSAGE TO  PEOPLE THEY NEED  TO FOLLOW THAT  THE VIRUS IS  EVERY  BIT AS REAL AS  IT WAS BEFORE.  THERE'S NO GOOD  REASON WE  COULDN'T BE NEW  YORK IN  MARCH IF WE'RE  NOT CAREFUL.  THE HOPE IS  PEOPLE WILL SEE  THE SURGE IN  CASES AND  SAY IT IS TIME  NOW TO TAKE THIS  SERIOUSLY.  IF WE DON'T DO  THAT, I DON'T  SEE ANY REASON  WE'RE  NOT GOING TO BE  BACK INTO LOCK  DOWN OVER THE  NEXT  FEW WEEKS.  GIVEN THE REASON  WE WERE OPENING  UP WAS TO TRY TO  ALLOW THE  ECONOMY TO  RECOVER, THAT  WILL CAUSE THE  ECONOMY TO  IMPLODE ONCE  AGAIN.  THE STATE BEGAN  TO SEE THE SURGE  OF CASES IN THE  SOUTHERN PART OF  THE STATE.  NOW WE'RE SEEING  BOTH ENDS.  THE NORTH IS  SEEN AS A HOT  SPOT.  IMPERIAL COUNTY  SAID THE SOUTH  HOSPITALS ARE SO  FULL  IN IMPERIAL  COUNTY, THEY'RE  TRANSFERRING  PATIENTS TO  SAN DIEGO AND  SAN FRANCISCO.  >> WOW.  ERIN, ARE  OFFICIALS  PLANNING TO DO  ANYTHING ELSE TO  STOP THE SPREAD  BESIDES TRYING  TO SHUT DOWN THE  NIGHT LIFE A  LITTLE BIT?  WELL AT THIS  POINT, THERE'S  NOT MUCH THE  STATE CAN  DO.  THERE'S NOT MUCH  THEY CAN DO TO  STOP THIS VIRUS.  THERE ARE NO  TREATMENTS.  THE ONLY THING  THEY CAN  RECOMMEND IS  PEOPLE SOCIAL  DISTANCE S WEAR  A MASK AND  POTENTIALLY SHUT  DOWN  MORE BUSINESSES.  THAT'S WHAT  OFFICIALS DO NOT  WANT TO HAVE TO  DO.  AS WE HEAR FROM  BAR OWNERS, THE  SECOND SHUTDOWN  IS  EXTREMELY  DEVASTATING.  >> ERIN IN LOS  ANGELES COUNTY,  THANKS SO MUCH.  >>> WE HAVE A  DOCTOR JOINING  ME NOW.  SHE'S INTERNAL  MEDICINE  PHYSICIAN AT THE  CALIFORNIA  MEDICAL CENTER  IN SAN  FRANCISCO.  DOCTOR, THANK  YOU FOR BEING  WITH US.  WE'RE HEARING  ABOUT MORE AND  MORE COVID-19  CASES  INVOLVING  YOUNGER PEOPLE.  ARE YOU SEEING  THAT IN YOUR  HOSPITAL?  ALLISON, WHAT  WE'RE SEEING ON  THE GROUND IS  CASES OF  COVID-19 IN  YOUNG PEOPLE ARE  CLIMBING  QUICKLY.  THE MAJORITY OF  PEOPLE  EXPERIENCE SOME  DEGREE OF  FEVER OR CHILLS,  COUGH, SHORTNESS  OF BREATH,  FATIGUE, BODY  ACHES.  THEY DO OKAY AT  HOME.  OF COURSE PEOPLE  SHOULD SEEK  EMERGENCY  MEDICAL  ATTENTION IF  THEY HAVE  TROUBLE  BREATHING,  PERSISTENT  PAIN OR PRESSURE  IN THEIR CHEST  OR NEW  CONFUSION.  WHAT WE ARE  SEEING ACROSS  THE STATE AND  COUNTRY IS  THAT IT'S REALLY  IMPORTANT FOR  PEOPLE TO  RECOGNIZE,  ESPECIALLY YOUNG  ADULTS THAT EVEN  THOUGH THEY ARE  LESS LIKELY TO  EXPERIENCE A  SEVERE ILLNESS  AND  REQUIRE  HOSPITALIZATIONS  FROM COVID,  THERE ARE  LONGER TERM  EFFECTS THAT ARE  EMERGING.  AMONG PEOPLE  THAT HAVE  INITIAL LIGHT  SYMPTOMS, THESE  OTHERS CAN  LINGER ON AND  YOU PASS OTHER  ORGAN  SYSTEMS LIKE THE  BRAIN, LUNG,  IMMUNE SYSTEM,  KIDNEY  AND BLOOD.  THERE'S PARTS OF  THE DISEASE NOT  YET UNDERSTOOD.  THE TAKE AWAY IS  THAT RISING  COVID-19 DOESN'T  TAKE  AWAY A HEALTHY  LIFE.  THEY CAN  TRANSMIT THE  VIRUS TO SOMEONE  THAT HAS A  MUCH MORE SEVERE  CASE.  YOUNG PEOPLE  NEED TO MODIFY  THEIR BEHAVIORS  AS  SITUATIONS  ARISE.  >> I WANT TO ASK  YOU ABOUT  REMDESIVIR USED  TO TREAT  CORONAVIRUS  PATIENTS. JULEAD SPEAK  ABOUT WHAT THEY  WOULD CHARGE.  $3100 FOR THOSE  THAT HAVE  PRIVATE  INSURANCE.  GROUPS ARE  CRITICIZING THAT  PRICING.  THE COURT THEY  DONATED IS SET  TO RUN OUT IN  OUR  COUNTRY IN A  WEEK OR SO.  HOW IMPORTANT IS  THIS TREATMENT?  ARE YOU  CONCERNED ABOUT  THOSE KINDS OF  COSTS?  SO FAR WE KNOW  THE ANTI VIRAL  MEDICATION  SHORTENS  THE TIME TO  RECOVERY BY 40s  ON AVERAGE FOR  HOSPITALIZED  COVID PATIENTS.  IT HAS NOT  IMPROVED  SURVIVAL FOR  PATIENTS WITH  YOU  COVID-19.  THE MOST EXPERTS  AGREE THIS IS A  HIGH PRICE TAG  FOR  A DRUG THAT'S  NOT SHOWN TO  REDUCE  MORTALITY.  WE HAVE SEEN  SOME PROMISE  COME OUT OF THE  COURSE ON  A STUDY IN THE  UK.  THEY FOUND THE  LOW DOSE STEROID  MEDICINE THAT'S  BEEN  AROUND MANY  YEARS REDUCES  THE RISK OF  DEATH BY A  THIRD FOR  SEVERELY ILL  PATIENTS ON  VENTILATORS FOR  COVID-19.  IN TERMS OF  TREATMENT  OPTIONS GOING  FORWARD, NEW  DATA IS EMERGING  EVERY DAY AND  WEEK.  IT'S CRITICAL WE  CONTINUE TO LOOK  TO THE REVIEW  EVIDENCE WHEN  MAKING DECISIONS  ON HOW TO TREAT  PATIENTS.  >> DR. FAUCI  SAYS THE U.S.  WILL NOT REACH  HERD  IMMUNITY IF A  LARGE PORTION  REFUSES TO GET  VACCINATED.  WHAT DO YOU SAY  TO PEOPLE THAT  DON'T THINK  THEY'RE  THE GOING TO GET  IT WHEN IT'S  AVAILABLE?  HOW IMPORTANT IS  A VACCINE TO FOR  US TO RETURN TO  A  LESS RESTRICTIVE  LIFE?  ONE THING TO  POINT OUT IS  THERE'S THIS  PHENOMENON  CALLED HERD  IMMUNITY.  ENOUGH PEOPLE  BECOME IMMUNE TO  A DISEASE AND IT  SPREADS  UNLIKELY.  WHEN A LARGE  POPULATION IS  IMMUNE TO  INFECTION  WHETHER THROUGH  GETTING IT OR  VACCINATION, IT  PROVIDES A  MEASURE OF  PROTECTION FOR  PEOPLE WHO ARE  NOT IMMUNE.  WITH HERD  IMMUNITY, THESE  CHAINS OF  INFECTIONS GET  DISRUPTED.  IT STOPS OR  SLOWS THE SPREAD  OF DISEASE.  FOR THIS TO  HAPPEN, WE'D  NEED MOST THE  POPULATION  WILLING TO BE  VACCINATED IF A  THIRD OF THE  AMERICANS  REFUSE THE  VACCINE.  WE'RE UNLIKELY  TO REACH HERD  IMMUNITY AND  UNLIKELY  TO RETURN TO  LIFE AS USUAL.  SIMPLY PUT,  ALLISON,  VACCINES SAVE  LIVES.  DISEASES THAT  USE TO BE COMMON  LIKE POLIO,  MUMPS,   MEASLES ARE  PREVENTED  BECAUSE OF  VACCINATIONS.  ONE OF THE  DEADLY VIRUSES  IN HISTORY,  SMALLPOX, NO  LONGER EXISTS.  OVER THE YEAR,  VACCINES  PREVENTED  COUNTLESS CASES  OF  DISEASE AND  SAVED MILLIONS  OF LIVES.  PEOPLE SHOULD  KNOW ALL  VACCINES GO  THROUGH MANY  PHASES AND  TRIALS TO MAKE  SURE THEY'RE  SAFE AND  EFFECTIVE.  THE COVID  VACCINE IS NO  EXPTION TO.  THANK YOU FOR  YOUR EXPERTISE.  I HOPE YOU JOIN  US AGAIN.  >> THANK YOU FOR  HAVING ME .  >>> ONTO CHAOS,  A FATHER TRYING  TO TEACH HIS SON  ABOUT PEACE. NONE OF US IS  UNAFFECTED BY THE IMPACT.  WE'RE GOING TO  TRY EVERYTHING  WE CAN TO KEEP  LIFE AS  NORMAL AS  POSSIBLE FOR  EVERYBODY.  >> IF IT GETS  INTO AN  ENVIRONMENT LIKE  THIS, IT'S IF  GOING TO SPREAD  LIKE RAPID FIRE.  WE'RE GOING TO  BUILD THIS  ECONOMY BACK  STRONGER THAN  EVER BEFORE.  >> THERE'S  THINGS I'D BE  DOING THAT  CANNOT BE DONE  RIGHT NOW.  >> COMING IN  NOVEMBER, PEOPLE  ARE GOING TO BE  VOTING  NOT FOR A PERSON  BUT FOR  STABILITY.  >> I HAVE TO  PLAN.  HOW IS THIS  GOING TO WORK?  THE IMPORTANCE  OF MUSIC IS KEEP  OUR SPIRITS UP.  >> JOIN ME AS WE  GO INTO AMERICA  TO HEAR FROM  EVERYDAY PEOPLE  GRAPPLING WITH  THE MOST  PRESSING  ISSUES OF OUR  TIME.  >>> WE'D LIKE TO  THINK WE LIVE IN  SOME SORT OF  POST  RACIAL AMERICA.  WE'RE REMINDED  TIME AND TIME  AGAIN WE DO NOT.  >> EVERY STEP  YOU HAVE TO ACT  AS MOM TRYING TO  RAISE  HER SON.  I THINK ABOUT  YOU AND YOUR  KIDS.  >> I REMEMBER  HER COMING HOME  SAYING WHY DON'T  HAVE  A PONY TAIL LIKE  THE WHITE GIRL?  IT'S OKAY TO  FEEL DIFFERENT.  DON'T FEEL LESS  THAN.  I CHERISH THE  FACT WE HAVE  THESE  DISCUSSIONS.  I FEEL SAFE  TALKING ABOUT  THIS WITH YOU  GUYS.  >>> YOU'RE  WATCHING NBC  NEWS NOW.  >> WE SAW A  LARGE CONVOY OF  THE NATIONAL  GUARD COME  THROUGH HERE.  IT'S NEWS MADE  FOR YOUR  STREAMING WORLD  LIVE  WEEKDAYS  STARTING AT 6:00  EASTERN.  >>> A VIRUS THAT  KNOWS NO  BORDERS.  A CATASTROPHE  HAPPENING BEFORE  OUR VERY EYES.  >> THE PEOPLE I  SPOKE TO SAID  THEY DON'T WORK,  THEY'RE NOT  GOING TO FEED  THEIR FAMILY.  OUR ABC NEWS AND  SKY TEAMS ARE ON  THE GROUND  LEARNING FROM  WHERE IT'S BEEN.  >> THE SOUTH  KOREANING  GOVERNMENT IS  BRINGING  STUDENTS BACK IN  STAGES.  >> YOU CAN  BETTER  UNDERSTAND HOW  IT WILL IMPACT  US  HERE.  >> LIFE ACROSS  ITALY IS BACK TO  NORMAL.  IT DOESN'T LOOK  LIKE THE SAME  NORMAL AS  BEFORE.  >> THE ONLY  THING WE HAVE TO  FEAR IS FEAR  ITSELF.  THESE ARE THE  UNITED STATES.  THE UNITED  PEOPLE WITH A  UNITED THE  PURPOSE.  >> OUR FUTURE  DOESN'T BELONG  THINK TO IT.  >> ALL OF US CAN  EXTEND THE HAND  TO THOSE IN  NEED.  >>> WE'RE  LEARNING DETAILS  ABOUT THE  RUSSIAN PLOT TO  PAY TALIBAN  MILITANTS TO  KILL U.S. TROOPS  IN  AFGHANISTAN.  NBC LEARNED  RUSSIA OFFERED  TO PAY BOUNTIES.  AN OFFICIAL  TELLS US SERVICE  MEMBERS AND  AFGHANS  HAVE DIED.  NBC NATIONAL  CORRESPONDENT  KEN DELANEY  JOINS ME NOW.  THIS IS AN  INCREDIBLE  STORY.  WHAT ELSE DO YOU  KNOW?  THE BOTTOM LINE  IS WITH ONCE  AGAIN THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION  IS HANDLING A  RUSSIA RELATED  INTELLIGENCE IS  UNDER YES.  THE PRESIDENT  SAYING HE WASN'T  BRIEF BECAUSE  THE  INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE TOLD  HIM THE  INFORMATION WAS  INCREDIBLE.  TODAY AT THE  WHITE HOUSE, HIS  SPOKESWOMAN  CONTRADICTED  THAT.  SHE THE DIDN'T  SAY IT WASN'T  CREDIBLE.  SHE SAID IT  WASN'T VERIFIED.  DIFFERENT  AGENCIES HAD  DIFFERENT  INFORMATION BUT  THERE'S IF  EVIDENCE TO SHOW  THESE SERVICE  MEMBERS  AND AFGHAN  MEMBERS DIED  RESULT.  EVEN IF THE  INTEL WASN'T SO,  THIS JUST  BAFFLES ME.  THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION  IS JUST  INCREDIBLE.  THIS IS THE KIND  OF THING THAT  MERITS RESPONSE.  IT MAY BE A CODE  WORD SECRET  RESPONSE, BUT  MOST SAY  YOU HAVE TO PUSH  BACK ON.  >> IT SEEMS LIKE  EXACTLY THE KIND  OF THING THAT  THE  PRESIDENT WOULD  AND SHOULD WANT  TO KNOW ABOUT.  WHAT ARE YOU  STILL TRYING TO  FIGURE OUT HERE?  I KNOW YOU HAVE  SOME PIECES PUT  TOGETHER.  WHAT'S THE  BIGGEST QUESTION  YOU LIKE ANSWERS  TO.  IS IT THE PIECE  ABOUT WHAT THE  PRESIDENT KNEW?  THERE'S THAT OF  COURSE.  THERE'S EVIDENCE  THAT EVERYONE WE  TALKED TO SAID  THAT THIS WOULD  HAVE BEEN  WRITTEN UP AND  SENT TO THE  WHITE HOUSE IN  THE FORM OF  INTELLIGENCE  REPORTS.  WHETHER THAT GOT  TO THE PRESIDENT  IS ONE OF THE  QUESTIONS.  THE OTHER IS  WHAT IS THE  STRENGTH OF THE  EVIDENCE  BOUNTIES PAY AND  AMERICANS DIE AS  A RESULT.  THE OTHER IS  DOWN PLAYING.  THE IRANIANS  HAVE DONE THIS  FOR YEARS.  WE STILL IT A  NUCLEAR DEAL  WITH THEM.  WE NEED TO  UNDERSTAND HOW  SIGNIFICANT THIS  IS IN  TERMS OF THE  RUSSIA AMERICA  RELATIONSHIP AND  WHAT  KIND OF RESPONSE  IS CONTEMPLATED  BY THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION.  >> KEN, WHAT  KIND OF RESPONSE  IF ANY ARE YOU  GETTING  FROM  INTELLIGENCE AND  MILITARY  OFFICIALS?  SO, SOME  AGENCIES ARE  FLATLY NOT  COMMENTING.  OTHER OFFICIALS  ARE TELLING US  PRIVATELY  THEY'VE  KNOWN ABOUT THIS  BUT THIS ISN'T A  BIG DEAL.  ONE SOURCE  FAMILIAR WITH  THIS MATTER AS  YOU SAID IN  THE INTRO TOLD  ME ABSOLUTELY,  AMERICANS DIE  BECAUSE  OF THIS, AFGHAN  OFFICIALS DIED.  IT'S MURKY ALL  OVER THE MAP.  IT DOESN'T  EXPLAIN THEY  WOULDN'T BRIEF  THE PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED  STATES.  PRESIDENTS ARE  BRIEFED ALL THE  TIME ON THINGS  THAT  THEIR ADVISE  TORES THINK THEY  NEED TO KNOW.  >> ANY RESPONSE  FROM RUSSIA OR  TALIBAN HERE?  YEAH.  BOTH GROUPS HAVE  DENIED THAT THIS  HAPPENED IN VERY  PROFOUND TERMS.  THE RUSSIAN  SIDE, THEY'RE  SAYING THAT'S  WHAT YOU'D  EXPECT.  >> KEN, IT'S A  STORY EVERYBODY  IS TALKING  ABOUT.  THANK YOU FOR  YOUR REPORTING.  >> THANKS  ALLISON.  >>> THE RUSSIAN  GOVERNMENT IS  RESPONDING TO  REPORTS  ABOUT THE  BOUNTIES ON U.S.  TROOPS IN  AFGHANISTAN.  SENIOR  CORRESPONDENT  KIER SIMMONS  SPOKE IN THE  CANDID  INTERVIEW.  >> DEMETRIUS IS  ONE OF PUTIN'S  RIGHT HAND MEN.  I ASKED ABOUT  THESE  ALLEGATIONS THAT  THE RUSSIANS  WERE OFFERING  BOUNTIES TO THE  TALIBAN FOR  KILLING  U.S. SERVICEMEN  AND WOMEN IN  AFGHANISTAN.  I ASKED HIM  SPECIFICALLY  ABOUT WHETHER  RUSSIAN  MILITARY  INTELLIGENCE AND  GIU WAS INVOLVED  IN THIS  ALLEGED  OPERATION.  HE DENIED IT  AGAIN AND AGAIN  AND FORCEFULLY  AS  YOU'RE ABOUT TO  HEAR.  PART OF OUR  EXCHANGE BEGINS  WITH ME ASKING A  QUESTION.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> IF RUSSIA WAS  PAYING MONEY TO  REWARD THE  TALIBAN  FOR KILLING OF  AMERICAN  SOLDIERS.  WOULD YOU  CONSIDER AN ACT  OF AGGRESSION BY  RUSSIA.  COULD YOU SEE  THAT AS HOW  SERIOUS IS THAT?  I DON'T THINK  THIS SITUATION  IS POSSIBLE  EVER.  THIS IS  RIDICULOUS TO  SPREAD THIS KIND  OF  INFORMATION.  >> IT HAPPENED  TO YOU.  >> THIS IS 100%  BULL [ BLEEP ].  IT'S BULL [  BLEEP ].  >> THAT'S  STRONG.  >> IT'S AS  SIMPLE AS THAT.  A COUPLE POINTS  TO KNOW FROM OUR  INTERVIEW, THE  SPOKESPERSON FOR  THE KREMLINS  REFERS TO   PRESIDENT  TRUMP'S TWEET  WHERE HE  QUESTIONS THE  VALIDITY OF  THIS REPORTING,  QUESTIONS THE  ALLEGED  INTELLIGENCE.  HE SAYS THAT  THOSE COMMENTS  ON THE  PRESIDENT'S LIFE  UNDERSCORES  RUSSIA IS RIGHT  TO QUESTION THIS  STORY.  I ASKED WHETHER  THE RUSSIAN  GOVERNMENT AT  ANY LEVEL,  AMBASSADOR,  MILITARY,  INTELLIGENCE  LEVEL, THEY HAVE  HAD ANY  COMPLAINTS FROM  THE AMERICAN  GOVERNMENTS  ABOUT THESE  ALLEGATIONS. DEPLEA TREE SAYS  HEDEMY >>> THE MAN  CHARGED WITH  GEORGE FLOYD'S  MURDER WILL  FACE A JUDGE  TODAY.  THE OTHERS WILL  ALSO BE IN  COURT.  WHAT HAPPENED IN  COURT TODAY?  WHAT'S NEXT UP?  THE KEY THING IS  WE NOW HAVE A  TRIAL DATE.  THE DATE IS SET  FOR MARCH 8.  THERE'S ANOTHER  HEARING ON  SEPTEMBER 11th.  WE'LL SEE THE  FORMER OFFICERS  APPEARING BEFORE  THE  JUDGE.  AS FAR AS  TODAY'S HEARING,  IT WAS ONE THAT  WAS NO  CAMERAS ALLOWED.  WE DIDN'T GET TO  SEE MUCH OF THE  PROCEEDINGS  EXCEPT  IF YOU WERE IN  THE COURT OR  OVERFLOW ROOM,  OVER THE  OBJECTIONS OF  THE FEW  MINNEAPOLIS  POLICE OFFICERS.  THEY WERE SHORT  HEARINGS, 10  MINUTES LONG  EACH.  WE HEARD FROM  OFFICER DEREK  CHAUVIN, THE  OFFICER WHO  HAD THE KNEE IN  THE NECK OF MR.  EMPLOYED FOR  EIGHT FLOYD.  WE SAW HIM IN  THE ORANGE JUMP  SUIT WEARING  A MASK. HE CHOSE  TO APPEAR VIA  VIDEO  CONFERENCE.  WE DIDN'T HEAR  THEM LAY OUT  EVIDENCE.  WE DIDN'T HEAR  PLEAS FROM THE  OFFICERS.  WE HEARD HINTS  OF WHAT'S TO  COME.  YOU ALSO HEARD A  SENSE OF  EVIDENCE THAT  THE STATE  HAS READY.  THEY SAY THERE'S  ABOUT 8000  INDIVIDUAL PAGES  OF  EVIDENCE OF  DISCOVERY FOR  THE LAWYERS TO  GO THROUGH.  THAT WAS A  REASON AND  EXPLANATION FOR  WHY WE WON'T  HAVE THAT TRIAL  UNTIL NEXT  MARCH.  ONE OTHER NOTE  I'LL MAKE IS THE  JUDGE COMPLAINED  ABOUT THE TALKS  WE'VE BEEN  HEARING.  SOME OF THE  ATTENTION THIS  CASE HAS BEEN  RECEIVING  BECAUSE IT COULD  POTENTIALLY.  THEY BELIEVE IT  MAY SEEK THE  JURY POOL.  PROSECUTORS MAY  STOP TALKING  ABOUT THE CASE  IN THE  DETAILS OF THIS  CASE AND HAVE A  POSSIBLE  VERDICT.  ET INSTEAD LET  THE PROCESS PLAY  OUT.  WE KNOW A TRIAL  DATE MARCH 8th  OF NEXT YEAR IS  SET.  UNTIL THEN,  THERE'S ANOTHER  HEARING IN  SEPTEMBER.  ALLISON?  THE SHACK, THE  MINNEAPOLIS  POLICE  FEDERATION IS NO  LONGER  SUPPORTING DEREK  CHAUVIN.  WHY NOT, AND  WHAT ARE THEY  SAYING ACT THE  OTHER  THREE OFFICERS  INVOLVED?  THEY'RE AFRAID  WE DO NOT DEFEND  THE ACTION THAT  OFFICER CHAUVIN  TOOK.  THEY SAY THAT  WASN'T BASED ON  TRAINING.  THAT'S NOT  INDICATIVE OF  WHAT AN OFFICER  SHOULD DO,  HAVING HIS KNEE  ON THEN A  SUSPECT'S NECK  FOR THAT  LONG A PERIOD OF  TIME.  THEY'RE MAKING A  DECISION WHAT  THEY'RE GOING TO  DO.  THE POLICE UNION  WILL APPEAL THE  FIRING OF AN  OFFICER.  THEY'RE NOT  GOING TO DO THAT  FOR OFFICER  CHAUVIN.  HE WANT TO SEE  MORE EVIDENCE  BEFORE MAKING  RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR THE OTHER  THREE OFFICERS.  WE KNOW THERE'S  BODY CAMERA AND  FOOTAGE  AVAILABLE  THAT HAS NOT  BEEN MADE  PUBLIC.  WE'VE HEARD  DESCRIPTIONS OF  THAT VIDEO IN  CHARGING  THE DOCUMENTS,  BUT WE HAVE NOT  SEEN WHAT THAT  BODY  CAMERA VIDEO  SHOWS.  THEY SAY THAT  COULD BE  --  IT  COULD GIVE A  SENSE OF  WHAT HAPPENED IN  THE MINUTES IN  BETWEEN WHEN WE  KNOW  HE GOT OUT OF  THE THE CAR, MR.  FLOYD, UNTIL THE  OFFICER PUT THE  KNEE ON THE NECK  OF HIM.  THERE'S MORE  EVIDENCE THEY  WANT TO SEE  BEFORE MAKING  THAT ULTIMATE  DECISION.  AS FAR AS  OFFICER CHAUVIN,  THEY'RE NOT  DEFENDING HIM  AND WILL NOT ASK  FOR AN APPEAL TO  GET HIS JOB  BACK.  ALLISON?  THE FAMILY SPOKE  ABOUT THE  HEARING TODAY.  WHAT DID THEY  SAY?  WE DID HEAR FROM  THE FAMILY.  THEY WERE IN  COURT.  WE HAVE SOUND  FROM THEM.  BEFORE I PLAY  THAT, I WANT TO  MAKE NOT THERE  WAS ONE  POINT THE JUDGE,  ACCORDING TO THE  NOTES FROM THE  REPORTERS IN THE  ROOM, THE JUDGE  ADMONISHED THE  UNCLE OF GEORGE  FLOYD MORE  MAKING A FACIAL  EXPRESSION AS  THE PROCEEDINGS  WERE ONGOING.  THE UNCLE AND  AUNT TALKED  ABOUT WHAT IT  WAS LIKE TO  BE INSIDE THE  COURTROOM AS  THIS WAS GOING  ON.  LISTEN TO WHAT  THEY TOLD  REPORTERS AFTER  THE  HEARING.  >> I DON'T KNOW  HOW YOU EXPECT  US TO RESPOND.  WE'RE THE ONLY  TWO BLACK PEOPLE  SITTING IN  THERE.  THIS IS GOING TO  BE A HEAVY  FIGHT.  >> THE JUDGE OR  WHATEVER HIS  NAME IS.  HE ACTED A  LITTLE TOWARDS  ME.  I'M SITTING SIX  FEET FROM AT THE  DUDE THAT KILLED  MY  NEPHEW A MONTH  AND THREE DAYS  AGO.  I'M NOT GOING TO  TALK TO HIM.  I'M NOT MAD AT  ANYBODY.  I'M MAD AT THE  SYSTEM.  >> Reporter:  OBVIOUS A VERY  EMOTIONAL  REACTION.  THAT WAS  SOMETHING THAT  CAME UP IN THE  HEARING THAT  THE FAMILY OF  MR. FLOYD HAS  BEEN TALKING TO  MEDIA  AND HOW THAT  COULD PERSUADE  THE JURY.  THE JUDGE SAYS  HE'S WARNING  EVERYONE  ESSENTIALLY.  PROSECUTORS AND  GOVERNMENT  LEADERS, STOP  TALKING  ABOUT THIS CASE.  THERE'S NOT A  GAG ORDER IN  PLACE.  HE SIGNALED THIS  IS SOMETHING  HE'S WILLING TO  ENFORCE AND  APPLY IF PEOPLE  CONTINUE TO  TALK.  NOT NECESSARILY  A FAMILY MORE  TARGETED FOR  OFFICIALS  BUT IF THERE  CONTINUES TO  BEEN TALK AROUND  THE  DETAILS AND  CIRCUMSTANCES  AROUND THIS  CASE.  ALLISON?  ALL RIGHT,  THANKS SO MUCH.  >> YOU GOT IT.  >>> YOU'RE  WATCHING NBC  NEWS NOW.  >> WE'VE GOT  BREAKING NEWS.  >> IF THEY GO  BACK TO THEIR  JOBS, THEY'VE  GOT TO  MAKE SURE  THEY'RE  PROTECTED.  >> IT'S NEWS  MADE FOR YOUR  STREAMING WORLD.

VOTERS ARE NOT  HAPPY WITH HIS  RESPONSE TO THE  BLACK  LIVES MATTER  MOVEMENT.  NOW BURNS IS  JOINING US.  BEAVER WAS AN  EASY WIN FOR  TRUMP IN 2016.  YOU'VE BEEN  TALKING TO  VOTERS THERE.  WHAT ARE THEY  TELLING YOU?  HEY ALLISON.  TRUMP WON BEAVER  BY 19 POINTS IN  2016.  THERE'S  INFORMATION  WHETHER VOTERS  WILL CHANGE  THEIR  MIND ABOUT THE  PRESIDENCY  BECAUSE OF HIS  HANDLING OF  THE PANDEMIC.  I WAS HAVING THE  CONVERSATIONS  SIX WEEKS AGO.  THEY WERE  ACTUALLY HAPPEN  WE THE  PRESIDENT.  THEY WERE MORE  FRUSTRATED WITH  THEIR DEMOCRATIC  GOVERNOR KEEPING  BUSINESSES SHUT  DOWN TOO LONG.  THE CONVERSATION  HAS SHIFTED.  IT'S NOT BECAUSE  OF COVID-19.  IT'S BECAUSE OF  RACE.  THAT'S THE  SURPRISING PLACE  LIKE BEAVER.  THIS IS A  COMMUNITY THAT  IS MORE THAN 90%  WHITE,  ONLY 6% BLACK.  THE CONVERSATION  IN THE MOVEMENT  AROUND RACIAL  EQUALITY WE'VE  BEEN COVERING IN  NEW YORK, LA,  CHICAGO, THAT'S  ALSO HAPPENING  HERE.  WE'LL LOOK AND  SOUND DIFFERENT,  BUT THE  CONVERSATIONS  ARE BEING HAD.  THEY'RE  IMPACTING PEOPLE  POLITICALLY AND  PERSONALLY.  I WANT TO  INTRODUCE YOU TO  A MARRIED COUPLE  JOHN  AND SUSAN.  THEY IDENTIFY AS  CONSERVATIVE  REPUBLICANS.  A COUPLE YEARS  AGO, THEIR  DAUGHTER ADOPTED  TWO  AFRICAN-AMERICAN  CHILDREN.  SINCE, THEN  THEY'VE BEEN  EDUCATING  THEMSELVES ON  RACE.  WHEN THEY SAW  THE GEORGE FLOYD  VIDEO, THEY WERE  HIT  HARD.  IT IGNITED A  FIRE.  THEY'VE BEEN  LOOKED AT SOME  OF PRESIDENT  TRUMP'S  RHETORIC IN  DIFFERENT LIFE.  TAKE A LISTEN TO  WHAT THEY TOLD  ME.  >> WHAT'S YOUR  PERSPECTIVE ON  HOW THE  PRESIDENT  HANDLED THESE  PROTESTS AND  THIS UPRISING IN  AMERICA  RIGHT NOW?  I THINK I WOULD  LIKE TO SEE HIM  BE MORE  COMPASSIONATE,  MORE  UNDERSTANDING,  MORE WILLING TO  HAVE A  DISCUSSION.  >> DO YOU THINK  HE'S HURTING HIS  CAMPAIGN WITH  HIS  TONE ON RACE  RIGHT NOW?  I DO.  YEAH.  >> I THINK THAT  COULD CHANGE IF  HE WOULD BE A  LITTLE  MORE VOCAL OR AT  LEAST TRY TO  SHOW  UNDERSTANDING.  >> DO YOU KNOW  WHAT YOU'RE  GOING TO DO IN  NOVEMBER  YET?  NO.  >> I DON'T  EITHER.  I WAS SURE I WAS  GOING TO VOTE  FOR HIM AGAIN,  BUT  NOW I'M  RETHINKING IT.  >> ALLISON, THE  PEOPLE I'VE BEEN  TALKING TO, IT'S  NOT LIKE THEY  WOKE UP WITH  BLUE FEVER OR  BIG JOE  BIDEN FANS.  THAT'S NOT THE  CASE.  THEY'RE ASKING  THEMSELVES NEW  QUESTIONS AND  NEGOTIATING  THESE  PRIORITIES,  TAKING THEM IN  DIFFERENT  DIRECTIONS.  HE SAYS HE'S  MORE OPEN MINDED  TO A POTENTIAL  VOTE  FOR JOE BIDEN  THAN HE MAYBE  WOULD HAVE BEEN  IN THE  PAST.  HE IS STILL  WORKING THAT  OUT.  HE SAYS RIGHT  NOW THE BIGGEST  CONCERN IS ISSUE  AND  CHARACTER, NOT  SO MUCH PARTY  LINES, ALLISON.  >> I KNOW YOU  WENT TO A UNITY  MARCH OVER THE  WEEKEND.  WHAT WAS THAT  LIKE IF YOU CAN  TELL US ABOUT  IT?  YEAH.  I MENTIONED THIS  MOVEMENT IS  HAPPENING HERE.  IT WAS NOT  CALLED A BREAK  LIVES MATTER  MARCH.  THE ORGANIZER  TELLS ME HE PUTS  THAT UMBRELLA ON  IT  TO BRING MORE TO  THE TABLE.  FOR A LOT OF  PEOPLE IN THIS  COMMUNITY, THIS  IS A NEW  CONVERSATION.  THIS DEPTH OF  ANALYSIS OF  RACIAL  RELATIONS.  PEOPLE ARE  HAVING THESE  CONSIDERATIONS  WITH THEIR  NEIGHBORS AND  PARTNERS FOR THE  FIRST TIME.  A GROUP OF  HUNDRED WHITE  PEOPLE MARCHED  BEHIND THE  BLACK COMMUNITY.  THE COMMUNITY  WALKED BEHIND  THEM.  THEY WERE THERE  TO STAND UP FOR  RACIAL EQUALITY.  PEOPLE CAME OUT  BEHIND THE  MESSAGES HERE  ALLISON.  >> DR. BURNS IN  BEAVER COUNTY,  PA, THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  JOE BIDEN IS  OUTRAGED BY  SUPPORTS OF  RUSSIAN  BOUNTIES ON U.S.  TROOPS FROM THE  PRESSURE SUMP  PRESUMPTIVE.  >> IF I'M  ELECTED  PRESIDENT, MAKE  NO MISTAKE.  VLADIMIR PUTIN  WILL BE  CONFRONTED.  WE'LL IMPOSE  COSTS ON RUSSIA.  >> JUST THINK AS  A CANDIDATE FOR  PRESIDENT.  THIS IS A BAD,  CAR THAT SERVED  HIS WYE TO SERVE  IN  MIDDLE EAST AND  IRAQ.  I'M DISGUSTED ON  BEHALF OF THOSE  FAMILIES WHO'S  LOVED ONES ARE  SERVING TODAY.  >> NBC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT IS  JOINING ME NOW.  WHAT ELSE IS  BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN  SAYING ABOUT IN  TODAY?  WE TALKED ABOUT  IT ALL THE TIME.  THE FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT NOT ON  THE CAMPAIGN  TRAIL  BUT MAKING NEWS  OVER THE WEEKEND  VIRTUALLY.  TALKING TO AN  AGENT SPECIFIC  ISLANDER GROUP.  THIS WAS AN  OPPORTUNITY FOR  THE BIDEN  CAMPAIGN.  HE WAS MEEK TO  GO AFTER  PRESIDENT TRUMP.  WE SEE THEM  TRYING TO TAKE  THE ADVANTAGE  THE  PRESIDENT HAS ON  THE ECONOMY.  ONCE THE VICE  PRESIDENT STARTS  OUT WITH IS  FOREIGN  POLICY.  THE WASHINGTON  POST IS ASKED  ABOUT  BOUNTIES  THAT  RUSSIA IS  PAYING.  I'VE HEARD HIM  TALK ABOUT HIS  RELATIONSHIP  WITH  VLADIMIR PUTIN  QUITE OFTEN.  HE TALKS OFTEN  ABOUT THE TIME  HE SPENT MEETING  WORLD  LEADERS.  YOU HEARD WHAT  PRESIDENT BUSH  SAID.  HE SAID I LOOK  INTO HIS EYES  AND SAW HIS  SOUL.  BIDE OPINION  SAYS THIS SHOWS  WHAT PRESIDENT  TRUMP IS  DOING WRONG AND  THERE'S NO  BOTTOM TOFT  DEATH OF  VLADIMIR PUTIN.  WE COULD  CONTINUE TO HEAR  THE PRESIDENT  AND VICE  PRESIDENT TALK  ABOUT THIS IN  THE WEEKS AHEAD  BECAUSE  OF THAT FOREIGN  POLICY HE HAS  NOW.  >>> WE'RE GOING  TO HIT MY  FAVORITE TOPIC.  BIND VOWED TO  PICK A BLACK  COME AS HIS  RUNNING MATE.  WHAT ARE THE  POLLS SAYING  ABOUT THE VICE  PRESIDENT  AND WHO HE  SHOULD HAVE ON  THE TICKET?  MY COLLEAGUE  WROTE ABOUT THIS  THIS WEEK.  WE TALK ABOUT  THE PRESSURE ON  BIDEN TO CHOOSE  A  RUNNING MADE, A  WOMAN OF COLOR.  DOES THAT BEAR  OUT IN THE  POLLS?  AYE HEARD THIS  FROM LEADERS  OFFER OF PROOF  OF  PROMINENT  MINORITY GROUPS  SAYING THERE'S  NO  QUARANTINE  THERE'S A WOMAN  WIDEN MAY CHOOSE  BIDEN PICKED BUT  PERHAPS  SHE ISN'T AS  GOOD WHAT THE  POLLS SHOW IS  SOMETHING  THAT IS  COMPLETELY  DIFFERENT THAN  THE WAY WE OFTEN  TALK ABOUT.  THE SIENNA POLL  FOUND 4 OUT OF 5  REGISTERED  VOTERS  SAY RACE SHOULD  NOT BE A FACTOR.  I DON'T THINK  VERY LIB WALL  VOTERS.  YOU'D THINK  THEY'D BE MOST  INTERESTING IN  52% OF  LIBERAL VOTERS.  QUESTION OFTEN  SEE IN SOME OF  THESE SURVEYS,  ELIZABETH WARREN  TENDS TO DO THE  BEST OF RUNNING  MATES.  THAT MAY HAVE A  LOT TO DO STILL  WITH NAME I.D.  SHE'S  THE BEST KNOWN.  THE KAMALA  HARRIS IS AS  WELL HIGH UP  THERE.  HER RECORD AS  THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL,  DISTRICT  ATTORNEY IN SAN  FRANCISCO HAS  BEEN A CONCERN  FOR  SOME MINORITY  GROUPS  ESPECIALLY AS WE  FAULK ABOUT  POLICING AND  ISSUES OF  CRIMINAL.  >>> MIKE, WE  KNOW THE BIDENS  HAD CAMPAIGN  EVENT  VISITS.  HE'S BEEN  TRAVELING A BIT.  YOU'VE BEEN  GOING TO  PENNSYLVANIA  ABOUT ONCE A  WEEK.  HAS THIS  CAMPAIGN SAID  WHY?  IS THERE SOME  KIND OF A MOVE  HERE?  THIS IS  SOMETHING THE  VICE PRESIDENT  HIMSELF TALKED  ABOUT OVER THE  WEEKEND.  HE WAS SPEAKING  TO DONORS ABOUT  FUNDRAISING HE'S  DOING.  THE CAMPAIGN  ASKED WHY HE  CAN'T CAMPAIGN  ANYMORE.  WHAT WE WERE  SEEING WITH  BIDEN IS THE  RIGHT THING  MEDICALLY  HAPPENS TO BE  PERHAPS THE  RIGHT THING  POLITICALLY.  HE HAS BEEN  DOING EVENTS  JUST ABOUT  EVERYDAY.  MAYBE NOT  HITTING THE  CAMPAIGN TRAIL,  BUT HE'S  GETTING HIS  VOICE OUT ON THE  KEY ISSUES.  I WOULD LOVE TO  GET TOO ASK HIM  A QUESTION.  IT'S THROW  MONTHING SINCE I  SAW HIM THE  PERSON.  MAYBE GET AWAY  AS HE DRIVES  PAST IN HIS SUV.  I SHOULD MENTION  THE CAMPAIGN.  I'VE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT IT  A LOT.  WE MAY SEE THAT  CHANGE, PERHAPS  A STUDENT THIS  WEEK.  THE TRUMP  CAMPAIGN HAS  BEEN REALLY  PUSHING THIS  MESSAGE, THE  IDEA JOE BIDEN  IS HIDING FROM  VOTERS.  THAT'S SOMETHING  THE CAMPAIGN IS  EAGER TO PUSH  BACK  ON.  MAYBE WE'LL SEE  HIM DO THAT THIS  WEEK BUT IN AAN  APPROPRIATE AND  SOCIAL  DISTANCING WAY.  >> I KNOW YOU'LL  GET TO ASK  QUESTIONS FROM  HIM IN A  LITTLE BIT.  THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  STRETCH THOSE  LEGS.  >>> STARBUCKS IS  CLOSING BECAUSE  OF HATE SPEECH  ONLINE.  THIS STARTED ON  FACEBOOK.  THESES ARE  PULLING FROM  INSTAGRAM AND  TWITTER TOO.  JOELIINE IS HERE  NOW.  HOW MUCH OF AN  IMPACT WITH A  BOYCOTT CAN LIKE  THIS,  EVEN A SHORT  TERM ONE, HAVE  ON SOCIAL MEDIA  PLATFORMS?  YEAH, 99% OF ALL  MONEY BROUGHT IN  IS BASED ON  SELLING ADS.  NOT A LOT OF  PEOPLE  UNDERSTAND THAT.  THAT'S A KEY  FACTOR HERE.  BASICALLY IF YOU  TAKE A LOOK AT  ONE ESTIMATE  FORECAST, THE  HIGHEST SPENDING  100 PLUS BRANDS  SPEND  $4 BILLION.  THAT'S 6 PUSH  PERCENT OF THAT  TOTAL AMOUNT WE  WERE  JUST TALKING  ABOUT HERE.  THE ISSUE REALLY  IS THE SORT OF  PUBLIC  PERCEPTION.  ALONG WITH ALL  OF THESE BRANDS  THAT SAY WE'RE  GOING  TO YANK OUR ADDS  FROM FACEBOOK  AND INSTAGRAM.  THIS COMES WITH  CUSTOMERS THAT  MAY MAKE THEM  THINK  TWICE.  THE THEY'RE SEEN  ON THE PLATFORM,  THE HATE SPEECH,  DISINFORMATION  AND THINGS LIKE  THAT.  >> JOE, OUR  COLLEAGUE OVER  AT NSNBC  INTERVIEWED A  FACEBOOK VP THIS  MORNING.  SHE ASKED IF  FACEBOOK AGREED  WITH THE CHANCE  THESE  COMPANIES ARE  TAKING.  HERE'S WHAT HE  SAID.  >> WE DON'T  HATE.  OUR VIEWERS DO  NOT HATE ON OUR  FLAT FORM.  >> WE HAVE  BENEFITS FROM  POLITICIAN  CONNECTIONS.  THAT'S WHY WE  HAVE TAKEN THE  EFFORTS TO DEAL  WUF.  JOE, BASE TOOK  UPDATED RULE  FACEBOOK UPDATE  POLICIES FRIDAY  WHAT DID THEY  CHANGE?  THEY UPDATED THE  FINAL WHAT'S  GOING ON IN  TERMS OF  MEASURES THEY'RE  TAKING.  HE'S NOW GOING  TO BAN POSTS  THAT INCITE  VIOLENCE OR  ATTEMPT TO  SUPPRESS VOTING.  HE ALSO SAYS  THEY'RE GOING TO  FLAG SOME  POSTINGS  THAT ARE  RELATIVE AND  QUESTIONABLE  THAT NEED TO BE  THROUGHOUT FOR  WHAT HE CALLS  THE PUBLIC  DISCOURT.  THE OTHER THING  IS THEY BLAME  ADS OF A SPECIAL  RACE,  SEXUALITY,  GENDER.  HE'S TARGETED  IMMIGRANTS IF.  I HEAR IN THE  UNITED STATES,  THAT WOULD BE  TAKEN  DOWN.  THERE'S MEASURES  TAKEN.  ALLISON, IT'S  CLEAR THIS IT'S  NOT ENOUGH FOR  TASERS.  HE MADE THE  STATEMENT ON  FRIDAY.  STARBUCKS,  CLOROX SAID IT'S  NOT ENOUGH.  WE'RE STILL  GOING TO STEP  AWAY.  THE BROADER  IMPACTS ARE NOT  JUST IMPACT AND  INSTAGRAM.  A LOT OF  COMPANIES ARE  SAYING WE'RE  GOING TO PUT OUR  PAWS ON ALL.  THIS CAMPAIGN  HAS BEEN  SEPARATELY  ORGANIZED AND  MAYBE DO IT  THROUGH THE REST  OF 2020 OR UNTIL  WE'RE  READY R. IT'S  ALSO OF 2020.\" THE NAACP,  THEY'RE ALL  SAYING THAT THIS  IS STARTING  TO WORK, AND  IT'S CLEAR THAT  THE COMPANIES  THAT ARE  PARTICIPATING  ARE DECIDING  THAT IT'S NOT  ENOUGH.  WHAT MARK  ZUCKERBERG IS  DOING IS NOT  SUFFICIENT.  >> YEAH.  IT JUST SEEMS  LIKE THEIR  DEMANDS HAVEN'T  QUITE BEEN  MET.  JOLENE KENT,  THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  .  >>> YOU'RE  WATCHING \"NBC  NEWS NOW.\"  LET'S GO TO  CORRESPONDENT  ALEXA LIOTA.  ALEXA, WHAT HAVE  YOU GOT THIS  HOUR?  >> HEY, ALISON,  WE'RE STARTING  OFF OUR  HEADLINES OUT  OF NEW JERSEY.  GOVERNOR PHIL  MURPHY SAYS HE  WILL POSTPONE  THE  REOPENING AS  VIRUS CASES  SPIKE IN OTHER  CASES.  THERE ARE SOME  ESTABLISHMENTS  AND RESIDENTS  WHO  HAVEN'T BEEN  ADHERING TO THE  GUIDELINES.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> WE HAVE ALL  SEEN THE SCENES,  OVERCROWDING, A  COMPLETE  DISREGARD FOR  SOCIAL  DISTANCING, VERY  FEW  IF ANY FACE  COVERINGS.  UNFORTUNATELY,  THE NATIONAL  SITUATION  COMPOUNDED BY  INSTANCES OF  KNUCKLEHEAD  BEHAVIOR AT HOME  ARE  REQUIRING US TO  HIT PAUSE ON THE  RESTART OF  INDOOR  DINING FOR THE  FORESEEABLE  FUTURE.  >> NOW, GILEAD  IS THE MAKER OF  A DRUG SHOWN TO  SHORTEN RECOVERY  TIMES WITH  PATIENTS.  THE PRICE WILL  BE A LITTLE  OVER$3,100 FOR  PATIENTS  WITH PRIVATE  INSURANCE, AND  AROUND $2,00 FOR  HEALTH  PROGRAMS.  THE CEO SAID  HE'S BEEN ABLE  TO SPEED UP THE  PROCESS.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> AS WE GO INTO  THE SECOND HALF  OF THE YEAR, WE  HAVE AN  EXPONENTIAL  INCREASE IN  SUPPLY, STARTING  IN  OF, NOVEMBER,  DECEMBER, WHERE  OF THE TWO  MILLION  TREATMENT  COURSES,  CUMULATIVELY  EXPECTED TO BE  HAD  BY THE END OF  THE YEAR, MORE  THAN HALF OF  THOSE WILL  BE AVAILABLE  STARTING FROM  SEPTEMBER ON.  >>> MEANWHILE,  REDDIT HAS  BANNED ABOUT  2,000 SUB  REDDITS IN AN  EFFORT TO LIMIT  HATEFUL CONTENT.  THAT'S FROM  DAVID INGRAHAM  AND BEN COLLINS.  REDD,T'S CEO  SAID, \"ALL  COMMUNITIES MUST  ABIDE BY  OUR CONTENT  POLICY IN GOOD  FAITH.  WE BAN THE  DONALD SUB  REDDIT BECAUSE  IT HAS NOT DONE  SO.\"  TWITCH  TEMPORARILY  SUSPENDED TRUMP  FOR, QUOTE,  \"HATEFUL CONDUCT  WEDNESDAY THE  PRESIDENT'S  COMMUNICATIONS  DIRECTOR URGED  USERS TO  DOWNLOAD THE  TRUMP CAMPAIGN  APP.  >>> AMC MOVIE  THEATERS WILL BE  ABLE TO PUSH  BACK ITS  REOPENING DAY AS  THE NUMBER OF  CASES CONTINUES  TO  RISE.  THE DECISION  FOLLOWS WARNER  BROTHERS LATE  LAST WEEK  DECIDING TO  POSTPONE THE  RELEASE DATE BY  AUGUST.  AMC SAYS IT WILL  BE AT LIMITED  CAPACITY, AND  MOVIE  THEATERS WILL BE  REQUIRED TO WEAR  MASKS.  >>> AND LASTLY,  THE SUSPECT  ACCUSED OF BEING  THE  GOLDEN STATE  KILLER HAS  AGREED TO PLEAD  GUILTY TO 13  COUNTS OF FIRST  DEGREE MURDER.  THAT'S FROM  JANELLE GRIFFIN.  . TODAY HE  APPEARED IN A  MAKESHIFT  COURTROOM,  WEARING  AN ORANGE JUMP  SUIT AND A FACE  SHIELD.  HE APPEARED AT A  LATER DATE  WITHOUT THE  POSSIBILITY  OF LIFE WITHOUT  PAROLE.  LOT OF NEWS  THERE, ALISON.  BACK OVER TO  YOU.  >>> PLENTY OF  IT, ALEXA.  THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  >> CALIFORNIA'S  GOVERNOR IS  TELLING MORE  COUNTIES TO  PAUSE THE  REOPENING AND  SHUT DOWN BARS,  THE STATE  REPORTING MORE  THAN 5,000 NEW  CORONAVIRUS  CASES IN  THE LAST 24  HOURS.  NBC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT  ERIN MCLAUGHLIN  JOINS ME FROM  LOS ANGELES,  AND, ERIN, BARS  HAVE BEEN TOLD  TO  CLOSE.  HOW ARE BAR  OWNERS REACTING,  AND DO YOU  EXPECT OTHER  BUSINESSES COULD  BE TOLD TO CLOSE  AS WELL?  >> BAR OWNERS  WE'VE BEEN  SPEAKING TO HERE  IN LOS  ANGELES, ALISON,  ARE FRUSTRATED.  THIS REALLY IS A  WORST-CASE  SCENARIO.  THEY SAID THEY  WERE ALREADY  HURTING WITH  THAT NICHE  SHUT DOWN, SPENT  MONEY TO  REINVEST IN  THEIR  BUSINESSES TO  TRY AND MAKE THE  NECESSARY  ACCOMMODATIONS  TO TRY AND  REOPEN.  NOW, ALL OF THE  SUDDEN, TO LOSE  THAT INVESTMENT,  HAVE TO SHUT  DOWN ALL OVER  AGAIN IS  EXTREMELY  FRUSTRATING.  SOME BUSINESS  OWNERS TELLING  US THEY DENT  THINK  THEY'RE GOING TO  MAKE IT, AND IT  IS A CAUTIONARY  TALE FOR THE  BUSINESSES  ACROSS THE  STATE.  AS CASES HERE IN  CALIFORNIA  CONTINUE TO  SOAR.  L.A.  COUNTY  ANNOUNCING 2,900  NEW CASES.  THAT IS A RECORD  FOR THE COUNTY  OF LOS ANGELES.  TOTAL NUMBER OF  CASES IN THIS  COUNTY, 100,000,  OVER  A HUNDRED  THOUSAND CASES  IN THE PAST TWO  WEEKS.  HOSPITALIZATIONS  ACROSS THE STATE  HAVE GONE UP  SOME  0%, CASES GONE  UP SOME 50%.  AUTHORITIES HERE  ARE STRUGGLING  TO GET THIS  SITUATION UNDER  CONTROL, WARNING  THE PUBLIC THEY  NEED TO CONTINUE  SOCIAL  DISTANCING, THAT  THEY NEED  TO BE OUT  WEARING MASKS,  THAT THE  REOPENING OF  CALIFORNIA IS IN  JEOPARDY.  >> ERIN, WHAT IS  TESTING LIKE IN  CALIFORNIA NOW?  CAN ANYONE WHO  WANT OR NEEDS A  CORONAVIRUS TEST  GET  ONE?  >> THIS IS A  POINT OF PRIDE  FOR THE CITY OF  LOS  ANGELES, ERIC  GARCETTI MAKING  THE ANNOUNCEMENT  THAT  ANYBODY WHO  WANTED TO GET A  TEST, WHETHER  THEY WERE  SYMPTOMATIC OR  ASYMPTOMATIC  COULD GET ONE.  HOWEVER, WE WERE  JUST ON THE WEB  SITE, AND  APPOINTMENTS ARE  CLOSED TO THOSE  WHO ARE  ASYMPTOMATIC.  YOU'RE NOT  SHOWING  SYMPTOMS.  YOU CAN'T, AT  THIS POINT  TODAY, GET AN  APPOINTMENT  FROM THE COUNTY  OF LOS ANGELES,  AND THAT IS A  CONCERN FOR  MANY, BECAUSE  TESTING HAS  REALLY BEEN  SEEN AS A HANDLE  ON THIS  SITUATION.  NEVERTHELESS, I  HAVE BEEN  SPEAKING TO  EXPERTS, AND  THEY SAY  CALIFORNIA AS A  WHOLE HAS DONE A  VERY GOOD  JOB AT RAMPING  AT TESTING,  WHICH IS WHY THE  SURGE IN  NUMBERS, THE  SURGE IN  INCREASE IN  CASES THAT THE  STATE IS SEEING  NOW IS A REAL  WARNING SHOT TO  THE  REST OF THE  STATE, TO PEOPLE  ACROSS  CALIFORNIA.  TAKE A LISTEN TO  WHAT BOB UHOV  HAD TO SAY.  >> AT THE VERY  LEAST, IT IS A  VERY CLEAR  MESSAGE TO  PEOPLE THAT THEY  NEED TO FOLLOW,  THAT THE VIRUS  IS  EVERY BIT AS  REAL AS IT WAS  BEFORE, AND  THERE'S  REALLY NO GOOD  REASON THAT WE  COULDN'T BE NEW  YORK  IN MARCH IF  WE'RE NOT  CAREFUL.  SO THE HOPE IS  PEOPLE WILL SEE  THE SURGE IN  CASES,  AND SAY IT IS  TIME NOW TO TAKE  THIS SERIOUSLY.  I THINK, IF WE  DON'T DO THAT, I  DON'T SEE ANY  REASON  WE WON'T BE BACK  INTO LOCKDOWN  OVER THE NEXT  FEW  WEEKS.  WEEKS. , , HOSPITALS SO  FULL, THEY'RE  TRANSFERRING  PATIENTS TO  OTHER HOSPITALS,  SAN DIEGO, AS  FAR NORTH AS SAN  DIEGO.  WHAT HAPPENS IN  ONE COUNTY HAS A  SITUATION ON  ANOTHER COUNTY,  AND THAT IS TRUE  ACROSS THE  COUNTRY,  ALISON.  >> ALL RIGHT.  ERIN MACK LAUGH  LAN, THANK YOU  SO MUCH.  .  >>> TEXAS  REPORTED MORE  THAN 5,000  CORONAVIRUS  CASES  A DAY FOR A WEEK  STRAIGHT,  FORCING THE  STATE TO  DELAY ITS  REOPENING PLANS.  DR. NEIL GHANDI  JOINS ME NOW.  HE IS AN  EMERGENCY  MEDICINE  PHYSICIAN IN  HOUSTON.  DR. GHANDI,  THERE ARE  REPORTS THAT  SOME ICUS IN  TEXAS ARE AT  CAPACITY.  WHAT IS THE  SITUATION LIKE  AT YOUR HOSPITAL  NOW?  >> THANK YOU SO  MUCH, AND FIRST  AND FOREMOST  THANKS  TO OUR  PHYSICIANS AND  EVERYONE WORKING  ON THE FRONT  LINES.  I'M LEADING A  SHIFT.  THINGS HAVE  CRESCENDOED OVER  THE PAST WEEK.  WE HAVE SEEN AN  INCREASE IN THE  AMOUNT OF  PATIENTS  TESTING POSITIVE  FOR COVID-19,  ALSO AND  INCREASE IN  OUR HOSPITALS AS  WELL.  THE GOOD THING  IS WE ARE NOT AT  CAPACITY.  WE STILL HAVE  BEDS.  WE STILL HAVE  SPACES, BUT  THINGS  UNFORTUNATELY  ARE  TRENDING IN THE  WRONG DIRECTION.  .  >> AS THINGS  CONTINUE TO MOVE  IN THAT WRONG  DIRECTION, WHAT  KIND OF PLANS  ARE THERE TO  EXPAND  CAPACITY IN THE  STATE, AND DO  YOU HAVE PLANS  AT YOUR  HOSPITAL TO  EXPAND CAPACITY  IF THAT IS  NECESSARY?  >> ABSOLUTELY.  AND THOSE ARE  CONVERSATIONS  WE'VE BEEN  HAVING FOR  THE LAST 7 TO 10  DAYS, LOOKING TO  EXPAND UCU  CAPACITY,  REGULAR  CAPACITY.  WE'VE ALREADY  TAKEN MAJOR  STRIDES IN  INCREASING THE  AMOUNT OF  TESTING CAPACITY  THAT WE HAVE.  SO IF YOU THINK  OF ALL THESE  THINGS, THEY'RE  KIND OF  LIKE AND  ACCORDION.  WE CAN'T STRETCH  IT OUT.  AN IMPORTANT  MESSAGE WE WANT  TO GET ACROSS IS  THAT  WE'RE OPEN FOR  BUSINESS, WE'RE  SAFE.  WE'RE THE PLACE  FOR YOU TO COME  AND GET YOUR  CARE  NOW.  >> OVER THE  WEEKEND, DR.  BURKE WAS IN  TEXAS, WHERE  SHE TALKED ABOUT  A PATTERN THAT  SHE'S SEEING IN  THE  CASES THERE.  HERE'S WHAT SHE  SAID.  >> BUT WHAT WE  ARE SEEING HERE  IS AN INCREASED  RATE  OF  HOSPITALIZATION  TO 20 TO 40-YEAR- OLDS.  THAT REALLY  TELLS US THERE  IS A LOT OF  INFECTION IN  THE 20 TO 40- YEAR-OLDS.  WE KNOW THAT THE  PRIMARY  ASYMPTOMATIC  GROUP.  WHAT IT TELLS US  IS IN THAT  ASYMPTOMATIC  SPREAD,  IT'S HITTING  THOSE 20 TO 40- YEAR-OLDS THAT  HAVE  ISSUES WITH  COMORBIDITIES,  MAYBE A LITTLE  OBESITY, A  LITTLE TYPE I,  DEBATE.  >> WHAT CAN YOU  TELL US ABOUT  THE WAY THE  CORONAVIRUS IS  AFFECTING  YOUNGER PEOPLE  RECENTLY?  >> NO,  ABSOLUTELY.  I THINK WE  REALLY REFER TO  THIS AS PHASE  TWO.  IN THIS SECOND  PHASE OF COVID- 19, WE'RE SEEING  A  REAL SLANT FOR  YOUNGER  PATIENTS.  A LOT OF  PATIENTS UNDER  THE AGE OF 50,  EVEN UNDER  THE AGE OF 40.  WE'RE SEEING A  TREMENDOUS  AMOUNT OF  ASYMPTOMATIC  SPREAD.  WE'RE CONCERNED  ABOUT THE SUPER  SPREADERS, THOSE  WHO  HAVE BEEN OUT  AND ABOUT, THOSE  WHO HAVE NOT  BEEN  SOCIAL- DISTANCING,  THOSE NOT  WEARING MASKS.  WE THINK A LOT  OF THEM ARE  INFECTING A LOT  OF OTHER  INDIVIDUALS.  WE'RE SEEING A  LITTLE LOWER  SEWS OH ECONOMIC  GROUP,  WHICH IS  UNFORTUNATELY  GETTING HIT WITH  THE SECOND  WAVE, SOME MORE  POPULATIONS AS  WELL.  >> THERE ARE  REPORTS OF LONG  LINES AND WAIT  TIMES  FOR TEST RESULTS  IN TEXAS.  WHAT CORNS DO  YOU HAVE ABOUT  COLLEAGUES  TESTING IN  YOUR STATE?  >> I THINK WE  HAVE ALL THE  RIGHT TOOLS IN  PLACE FOR  ACCESS TO  TESTING.  I THINK ONE  CHALLENGE THAT  WE RUN ACROSS  RECENTLY  HAS BEEN THE  AMOUNT OF PEOPLE  THAT WERE  TESTING  POSITIVE.  WE THINK BACK AS  FAR AS FOUR,  SIX, EIGHT WEEKS  AGO,  WE HAD  SIGNIFICANTLY  LESS FOLKS  TESTING  POSITIVE.  EASIER FOR US TO  CIRCLE BACK, LET  THEM KNOW IF  THEY  DID HAVE COVID- 19, AND GIVE  THEM PROPER  GUIDANCE.  RIGHT NOW ON A  DAILY BASIS, SO  MANY PATIENTS  ARE  TESTING.  IT'S JUST BECOME  A CHAN TO GIVE  THEM ALL THAT  INFORMATION  INFORMATION OVER  A SHORT PERIOD  OF TIME.  >> DR. GHANDI, I  KNOW YOU SAID  YOU JUST GOT OFF  OF A  SHIFT, THANK YOU  SO MUCH FOR  TAKING THE TIME  TO BE  WITH US, AND  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH TO YOU AND  YOUR  COLLEAGUES FOR  ALL OF YOUR HARD  WORK.  >> ABSOLUTELY,  THANK YOU.  >>> TOMORROW,  DR. FA,CCI AND  OTHER OFFICIALS  WILL  TESTIFY AT A  HEARING ON THE  ADMINISTRATION'S  RESPONSE TO THE  CORONAVIRUS.  YOU CAN WATCH IT  ON \"NBC NEWS  NOW.\"  IT STARTS AT  10:00 A.M.  EASTERN.  >>> THE SUPREME  COURT STRUCK  DOWN LOUISIANA'S  RESTRICTIVE  ABORTION LAW  TODAY.  THAT LAW  REQUIRED THAT  ANY DOCTOR  PERFORMING AN  ABORTION HAVE  ADMITTING  PRIVILEGES AT A  NEARBY  HOSPITAL.  ''NBC NEWS\"  JUSTICE  CORRESPONDENT  PETE WILLIAMS  JOINS ME NOW  FROM WASHINGTON,  D.C., AND PETE  TE US  MORE ABOUT  TODAY'S  DECISION.  >> WELL, IN ONE  WAY, THE  DECISION WAS  QUITE SIMPLE.  THE LOUISIANA  LAW FLUNKS A  TEST THE SUPREME  COURT  ADMINISTERED  FOUR YEARS AGO  TO AN IDENTICAL  LAW.  THE LAW DID THE  SAME THING  PROVIDED NO  HEALTH  BENEFITS, BUT  WOULD HAVE BEEN  AN ADDITIONAL  OBSTACLE, AND  THEREFORE, WAS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  FOR THE SAME  REASON, THE  COURT SAID THIS  LOUISIANA  LAW THAT WAS  ALMOST IDENTICAL  FAILED FOR THE  SAME  REASON.  THAT WAS THE  LOGIC OF FOUR OF  THE JUSTICES.  THE FIFTH  JUSTICE, JOHN  ROBERTS, WHO  MADE THE  MAJORITY TODAY  SAID, \"I VOTED  THE OTHER WAY IN  THE  TEXAS CASE.\"  NOW IT'S THE LAW  OF THE LAND THAT  YOU CAN'T DO  THAT.  SO I JOINED THE  COURT'S RULING  TODAY AS VALID  PRECEDENCE.  THAT'S WHY THE  COURT DECISION  TURNED OUT THE  WAY IT  DID TODAY.  >> PETE, THE  TRUMP CAMPAIGN  REACTED TO THE  RULING  WITH A  STATEMENT.  IT READS IN  PART, QUOTE,  \"FIVE SUPREME  COURT  JUSTICES DECIDED  TO ASSERT THEIR  POLITICAL AGENDA  IN  PLACE OF  DEMOCRATICALLY  DETERMINED  POLICIES.\"  PETE, WE KNOW  THIS IS A  CONSERVATIVE --  CHIEF  JUSTICE JOHN  ROBERTS JOINING  THE LIBERAL  MAJORITY ON  THIS DECISION.  WHAT IS THE  DECISION OF HIS  VOTE?  >> WELL, FIRST  OF ALL, ANYTIME  THE COURT IS  DOING  PART OF ITS JOB,  WHICH IS  STATUTORY  INTERPRETATION  AND IT DECIDES  TO STRIKE DOWN A  LAW, YES, IT'S  UNELECTED  JUSTICES  STRIKING DOWN A  LAW THAT WAS  PASSED.  SO THAT'S ALWAYS  THEY DO IN THE  INTERPRETATION  MODE.  THE SIGNIFICANCE  OF ROBERTS IS  THAT HE DID NOT  JOIN  THE COURSE FOR  CONSERVATIVES  WHO FEEL MUCH  MORE  STRONGLY ABOUT  ABORTION THAN HE  DOES.  AMONG THE  CONSERVATIVES,  THOMAS SAID HE  THINKS ALL  THE RULINGS ON  ABORTION ARE  WRONG.  JUSTICE  CAVANAUGH WASN'T  QUITE AS STRONG.  . THERE COULD  HAVE BEEN MORE  THAN ONE DOCTOR  WHO COULD  HAVE GOTTEN  ADMITTING  PRIVILEGES.  THE SIGNIFICANCE  HERE IS THAT  ROBERTS IS  SIGNALING  HE'S NOT GOING  TO GO FAR ON THE  RESTRICTIONS.  IT DOES NOT MEAN  THERE MIGHT BE  OTHER  RESTRICTIONS  HE WOULD AGREE  TO UPHOLD.  BUT FOR NOW,  HE'S NOT WILLING  TO GO ALL THE  WAY   AND --  >> SO WHAT DOES  THIS MEAN,  EXTENDING --  HOPE BEING  COURT MIGHT  EVENTUALLY  OVERTURN ROW V  WADE.  >> I'VE HEARD  PEOPLE SAY TODAY  THIS INDICATES  ROBERTS IS NEVER  GOING TO GO  THERE, THAT HE'S  SORT  OF THE HOLDING  ACTION THAT  WOULD PREVENT  THE COURT  FROM GETTING A  FIFTH VOTE TO  OVERTURN PROJECT  V  WADE.  THAT CAN BE  TRUE.  I DON'T KNOW.  HE DID SORT OF  SPEAK  APPROVINGLY ON  THE COURT'S  POSITION ON  ABORTION ON THE  UNDUE STANDARDS.  IT MAY WELL BE  THAT WHAT HIS  MESSAGE IS  TODAY, HE'S  NOT GOING TO  TAKE THE COURT  DOWN THE ROAD TO  OVERTURNING ROW.  THAT MAY BE A  FAIR CONCLUSION.  >> THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  >> YOU BET.  >> THE WHITE  HOUSE ON THE  DEFENSE TODAY AS  MORE  QUESTIONS EMERGE  ABOUT THE PLOT  TO OFFER  BOUNTIES ON  TROOPS IN  AFGHANISTAN.  THE U.S. DID  GATHER EVIDENCE  THAT RUSSIA PAID  THE  TALIBAN TO  TARGET SERVICE  MEMBERS.  . SAY VAILIANS  DIED BECAUSE OF  THOSE BOUNTIES.  SHANNON  PETTYPETE ALONG  WITH GARRETT  HAGUE.  SHANNON, I'LL  START WITH YOU.  WHAT IS THE  LATEST ON THIS  INTELLIGENCE,  AND ARE WE  CLEAR ON WHEN  THE PRESIDENT  WAS TOLD ABOUT  IT?  >> THE WHITE  HOUSE IS TRYING  TO DOWNPLAY THE  VALIDITY OF THIS  INTELLIGENCE.  THEY HAVE  DESCRIBED IT TO  NBC NEWS AS RAW  INTELLIGENCE,  THAT IT WAS NOT  CORROBORATED  BROADLY  WITHIN THE  INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY.  GARY McINNI  REPEATEDLY SAID  THIS WAS NOT  INITIALLY  BROUGHT TO THE  PRESIDENT,  BECAUSE IT WAS  NOT  VALIDATED, AND  BECAUSE THERE  WERE DISSENTING  OPINIONS IN THE  INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY ABOUT  THE  VALIDITY OF IT.  THE WHITE HOUSE  HAS ALSO BEEN  TELLING NBC THAT  IT  WOULD REMAIN AT  THE STAFF LEVEL.  SO RELATIVELY  LOW LEVEL OF  OFFICIALS IN THE  INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY AND  THE WHITE HOUSE  WERE  AWARE OF THIS.  IT WAS NOT  ELEVATED TO A  HIGHER LEVEL,  SPECIFICALLY  BECAUSE THE  WHITE HOUSE WAS  TELLING US.  THERE WERE  QUESTIONS ABOUT  HOW ACCURATE  THIS WAS.  AS FAR AS WHAT  THE PRESIDENT  KNEW AND WHEN,  WE HAVE  BEEN TOLD THAT  HE WAS -- HE  FIRST LEARNED  ABOUT THIS  IN THE NEWS  REPORT, \"THE NEW  YORK TIMES\"  REPORTING.  AFTER THAT,  STAFF, WE WERE  TOLD, BROUGHT  HIM UP TO  SPEED, AND THERE  IS A QUESTION  ABOUT HOW MUCH  HE HAS  LEARNED SINCE,  IF HE HAS GOTTEN  A FORMAL  BRIEFING,  BECAUSE WE KNOW  MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS ARE  GETTING A  FULL BRIEFING  FROM OFFICIALS.  McININI'S  BRIEFING  EARLIER, WHAT IS  DESCRIBED OR  CONCERNED, WHAT  LEVEL OF  BRIEFING THE  PRESIDENT HAD  RECEIVED ON THE  INTELLIGENCE  THAT IS OUT  THERE.  >> LAWMAKERS  WERE BRIEFED ON  THIS TODAY AT  THE WHITE  HOUSE.  >> ONLY A  HANDFUL OF  REPUBLICAN  LAWMAKERS WERE  BRIEFED.  WOULDN'T YOU  KNOW IT, THEY  CAME OUT,  ECHOING THE  LINE WE HAVE  HEARD FROM THE  WHITE HOUSE,  WHITE HOUSE.  . RUINED THAT  REVIEW.  TOMORROW SOME  DEMOCRATIC  LAWMAKERS ARE  EXPECTED TO  GO THROUGH THE  WHITE HOUSE IN  THE MORNING TO  GET  THEIR BRIEFING  ON THIS.  . I CAN TELL  YOU, ACROSS  CAPITOL HILL,  LAWMAKERS WHO  HAVE NOT BEEN  INVOLVED IN THIS  AT ALL, AND THAT  IF  POSSIBLE,  SOMEBODY,  SOMEWHERE NEEDS  TO OPEN UP A  CONGRESSIONAL  INVESTIGATION  INTO THIS.  ACTUAL DATA AND  KNOWLEDGE ON  CAPITOL ABOUT  WHAT WAS  CONTAINED IN  THESE  INTELLIGENCE  REPORTS IS  PRETTY  MINIMAL.  AND CONGRESS  DOES NOT LIKE TO  BE IN THAT  POSITION,  AND THEY'RE  TRYING TO PUT  PRESSURE ON THE  WHITE  HOUSE TO FIX IT.  >> SHANNON, THIS  IS RENEWING  QUESTIONS ABOUT  THE  PRESIDENT'S  INACTIONS  AGAINST RUSSIA.  WHAT POSITION  DOES THAT PUT  HIM IN NOW?  >> THIS  INTELLIGENCE  GOING PUBLIC  DOES RAISE SOME  QUESTION THAT  WE'VE BEEN  ASKING THE WHITE  HOUSE  REPEATEDLY ABOUT  HOW THE  ADMINISTRATION  IS GOING TO  RESPOND TO.  IF IT'S GETTING  VALIDATED, WHAT  CONSEQUENCES  WOULD  THERE BE FOR  THAT, BECAUSE  HAVING A FOREIGN  ADVERSARY  PUTTING A BOUNTY  ON THE HEADS OF  U.S.  SOLDIERS IS NOT  SOMETHING YOU  CAN NECESSARILY  RESPOND TO BY  SANCTIONING A  FEW INDIVIDUALS.  IT COULD BE AND  HAS BEEN  DESCRIBED BY  SOME AS  STATE-SPONSORED  TERRORISM.  IT ALSO RAISES  THE QUESTION OF  WHAT RUSSIA'S  MOTIVES  WERE BEHIND IT  BESIDES JUST  PUTTING TROOPS  IN HARM'S  WAY, AND WHAT  IMPLICATIONS  COULD THAT HAVE  FOR THE  LONGER TERM.  WAS THIS AN  EFFORT BY RUSSIA  TO TRY AND  METTLE AND  BAR THE U.S.'S  EFFORT IN  AFGHANISTAN.  THOSE ARE ALL  THE PIECES IN  PLAY THAT ARE  PROBABLY  GOING TO FALL IN  PLAY NOW.  >> GARRETT, WHAT  KIND OF TALK ARE  YOU HEARING ON  CAPITOL HILL  ABOUT WHAT  CONSEQUENCES  RUSSIA COULD  FACE?  >> THE REALITY  IS, IN FOREIGN  AFFAIRS,  PARTICULARLY  IN INTELLIGENCE  MATTERS, THE  EXECUTIVE BRANCH  HAS A  LOT MORE LEVERS  TO PULL THAN  JUST THE  LEGISLATIVE.  THERE'S BEEN  SOME DISCUSSION  ABOUT GETTING  THE  SANCTIONS, WHICH  SHANNON JUST  MENTIONED.  THAT'S A TOUGH  THING TO PUT IN  PLACE,  PARTICULARLY  IF THE PRESIDENT  DOESN'T WANT TO  DO IT.  THERE'S ALSO A  CONVERSATION  FROM TOM TILLIS  ABOUT  THE IDEA OF  PUTTING RUSSIA  ON THE STATE- SPONSORED  TERROR LIST.  THAT WOULD MAKE  DOING BUSINESS  WITH AMERICAN  ALLIES  AROUND THE GLOBE  MORE DIFFICULT.  BECAUSE I'VE  ONLY HEARD THAT  SERIOUSLY FROM  -- I  WONDER IF THAT  HAS MORE TO DO  WITH HIS  REELECTION  POLITICS.  HE IS IN A TIGHT  REELECTION FACE  IN NORTH  CAROLINA  THAN HE DOES  WITH THE TOOL  KIT AVAILABLE TO  LAWMAKERS AT THE  MOMENT.  >> ALL RIGHT.  SHANNON PETTYHI.  THANKS SO MUCH  FOR BEING WITH  US.  >> YOU BET.  , >> THOUSANDS OF  PROTESTERS TOOK  TO THE STREETS  OF  AURORA TO DEMAND  SYSTEMIC CHANGE.  . BLAINE  ALEXANDER  REPORTS.  >> Reporter:  EARN ATTORNEY  SAYS THEY ARE  PREPARING  TO FILE A CIVIL  LAWSUIT IN THIS  CASE.  ALL EYES ARE ON  THE STATE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL, WAITING  TO DETERMINE IF  HE WILL FIND  WHETHER CHARGES  SHOULD  BE FILED IN THIS  CASE.  HE HAS NOW  LAUNCHED AND  INVESTIGATION,  SO ORDERED BY  THE STATE'S  GOVERNOR,  CONDUCTING AN  INDEPENDENT  INVESTIGATION  INTO.  THAT HAPPENED  SOME 10 MONTHS  OR SO AGO.  . IT WAS THE  RESURGENCE AFTER  THE DEATH OF  GEORGE  FLOYD AROUND THE  COUNTRY.  THAT DREW MORE  ATTENTION TO  THIS CASE.  YOU HAVE A STATE  INVESTIGATION,  AND THE LOCAL  MAYOR  SAYING THEY PLAN  TO LAUNCH AN  INVESTIGATION OF  THEIR  OWN.  I SPOKE TO AN  ATTORNEY.  AND THEY SAY NOT  ONLY ARE THEY  CONCERNED ABOUT  THE  WAY HE WAS  RESTRAINED, BUT  THE DRUG THAT  WAS  ADMINISTERED,  POLICE SAY TO  CALM HIM DOWN AS  HUNDREDS OF  PEOPLE CAME  TOGETHER IN  PROTESTS OVER  THE WEEKEND TO  HONOR McLAIN'S  LIFE.  >>> POLICE IN  SEATTLE  INVESTIGATING A  DEADLY  SHOOTING IN THE  CITY'S ZONE.  STEVE PATTERSON  JOINING ME FROM  SEATTLE.  THIS IS AN AREA  PROTESTERS HAVE  OCCUPIED FOR  WEEKS  NOW.  WHAT HAPPENS  WHAT HAPPENS?  >> IT'S BEEN  ALMOST A MONTH  OF OCCUPATION,  ALISON.  THIS MORNING,  VERY EARLY IN  THE MORNING,  BELIEVED TO  BE ABOUT 3:00.  THERE WAS A  SHOOTING.  WE BELIEVE IT  WAS A DRIVE-BY  SHOOTING.  THE CAR WAS  INVOLVED.  YOU CAN TAKE A  LOOK AND SEE  SOME OF THE  TURQUOISE  COLORS.  THAT WAS WHERE  GLASS WAS  BROKEN.  THE WHITE  VEHICLE THAT WAS  INVOLVED IN THAT  SHOOTING.  . THAT SHOOTING  INVOLVED TWO  VICTIMS.  WE KNOW THAT ONE  OF THOSE VICTIMS  DIED IN THE  HOSPITAL.  THE SHOOTING WAS  EARLY THIS  MORNING.  POLICE CAME,  TOOK THE  VEHICLE, SPOKE  TO PROTESTERS.  THEY HAD TSI WHO  COLLECTED  EVIDENCE AS  WELL.  ALL OF THEM HAVE  LEFT.  THAT ALL TOOK  20, 30, MAYBE 40  MINUTES AT MOST.  IT WAS THE MOST,  I THINK, I'VE  SEEN INSIDE OF  CHOPPED ITSELF.  A LOT OF TIMES,  WE'VE SPAN TO  BUSINESSES --  THEY  CALLED 911, AND  THERE'S ALMOST  NO PRESENCE  THAT'S  ABLE TO COME  INSIDE THE ZONE.  SO THAT WAS A  FIRST.  WE GOT A SECOND  WHEN THE POLICE  CHIEF FOLLOWED  SHORTLY BEHIND.  AND OF COURSE,  WE'VE BEEN  TELLING YOU  ABOUT SORT OF  THE CITY WANTING  TO SHUT ALL OF  THIS DOWN.  I HAVE TO SAY,  WE HAVE THE EAST  PRECINCT JUST  BEYOND  THIS LINE OF  BUCKETS.  AND THEN THERE'S  MORE PROTESTS, I  THINK, I'VE SEEN  TODAY THEN IN  THE LAST TWO,  THREE, FOUR,  FIVE DAYS,  MORE PEOPLE  WEARING VESTS  THAT HAVE PUT  MASKS ON,  MORE PEOPLE THAT  HAVE WEAPONRY  THAN I CAN SEE  IN THE  LAST FEW DAYS AS  WELL.  THE SENSE IS  THINGS ARE  TENSE, AND  PEOPLE ARE  UPSET,  AND THERE MAY BE  AN EFFORT TO  FIGHT BACK IF  THERE'S  AN EFFORT FROM  THE CITY TO COME  IN HERE.  SO THAT'S SORT  OF THE MOOD ON  THE GROUND.  IT IS MORE TENSE  THAN IT'S BEEN  IN QUITE SOME  TIME,  ALISON.  >> I KNOW YOU  SAID POLICE CAME  IN, THEY  GATHERED  EVIDENCE FOR  AWHILE, AND THEN  LEFT.  WHAT DO YOU KNOW  ABOUT THE  INVESTIGATION  ITSELF SO  FAR?  ?  >> YEAH.  SO WE KNOW THE  VICTIMS ARE VERY  YOUNG.  THE VICTIM WHO'S  IN CRITICAL  CONDITION, 14  YEARS  OLD.  THE VICTIM WHO  WAS KILLED IS 16  YEARS OLD.  WE DON'T KNOW  WHAT THE  RELATION THEY  HAVE TO CHOP.  WE DON'T KNOW IF  THEY WERE CHOP  PROTESTERS.  THIS HAS  ALMOSTING IN TO  DO WITH THE  PROTESTERS THAT  ARE HERE.  A LOT OF THE  VIOLENCE THAT WE  HEARD ABOUT, A  LOT OF  THE SHOOTING  SPECIFICALLY  FROM LAST WEEK,  MOST OF  THEM WERE ON THE  FRINGES.  MOST WERE  TANGENTIALLY  RELATED.  ALMOST LIKE  CRIME SPROUTS UP  BECAUSE THERE IS  THIS  ZONE THAT PEOPLE  THINK  LAWLESSNESS CAN  HAPPEN.  NOT NECESSARILY  DIRECTED OR  ENACTED AT THE  PROTESTERS  THEMSELVES.  WHAT WAS  DIFFERENT IS  THAT IT WAS SO  MUCH CLOSER  INSIDE THIS  ZONE, AND YOU  CAN SEE THE  EVIDENCE OF  IT --  >> YEAH.  >> -- RIGHT HERE  IN THE HEART,  ALMOST THE  CENTER OF  CHOP ITSELF.  SO THAT WAS  SOMETHING THAT  WAS VERY  DISCONCERTING.  JUST HEARING OF  THE AGES OF THE  VICTIMS INVOLVED  --  >> HARD.  >> DEMORALIZING  FOR A LOT OF THE  PEOPLE THAT ARE  HERE.  ALISON?  >> YES.  SO YOUNG.  YOU MENTIONED  THE INCREASE IN  VIOLENCE.  THIS IS AT LEAST  THE FOURTH  SHOOTING NEAR  THE CHOP  IN THE LAST NINE  DAYS.  I KNOW YOU SPOKE  WITH SEATTLE'S  POLICE CHIEF  ABOUT  THE ZONE.  WHAT DID SHE  TELL YOU?  >> WELL, THE  CHIEF CAME IN  FOR THE FIRST  TIME THAT  WE KNOW OF,  RIGHT INTO THE  HEART OF  CHOPPED.  AND REMEMBER,  YOU'LL SEE THE  DEMAND LISTED  RIGHT ON  ONE OF HER  BRIEFINGS.  THIS WAS THE  EAST PRECINCT.  IT WAS 50%.  IT IS THE ENTIRE  TIME PROTESTERS  HAVE BEEN HERE.  SHE CAME IN AND  BASICALLY SAID  THAT THIS HAS TO  STOP.  SHE THINKS THE  VIOLENCE IS THE  RESULT OF THIS  ZONE.  SHE THINKS IT IS  PROBLEMATIC FOR  RESIDENTS,  PROBLEMATIC FOR  BUSINESSES.  IT'S BEEN GOING  ON FOR TOO LONG.  SHE CITED A  NUMBER OF CRIMES  THAT HAPPENED  INSIDE OR  NEAR THE ZONE.  >> YOU SEE SOME  OF THE ELEMENTS  HERE.  WE KNOW THESE  GUYS.  THEY'RE NOT  GOING TO DO  ANYTHING.  I WANT TO PLAY A  BITE FROM THE  CHIEF ABOUT  EXACTLY  WHAT HER  STATEMENT IS IN  RESULT ABOUT  WHAT THE  PROTESTERS ARE  DEMANDING.  >> THEY ARE THE  ONES THAT ARE  THE VOICE HERE.  THEY ARE PEOPLE  THAT LIVE HERE.  THERE ARE  MULTIPLE PEOPLE  WHO ARE BEING  INJURED AND  HURT, AND WE  NEED TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT  IT.  IT IS ABSOLUTELY  IRRESPONSIBLE.  >> IT IS ABOUT  THE STRONGEST  RHETORIC FROM  ANY CITY  AGENCY WE HEARD  COMING FROM  CHIEF BETS.  SHE IS SERIOUS  ABOUT THIS.  WE'RE NOT GOING  TO KNOW WHAT SHE  WANTS TO USE AS  FAR  AS GETTING IT  OVER WITH.  BACK TO YOU,  ALISON.  >> ALL RIGHT.  STEVE PATTERSON,  IN SEATTLE,  THANK YOU.  >> YOU BET.  >>> FORTY-FOUR  PERCENT OF  REGISTERED  VOTERS HAVE A  FAVORABLE VIEW  OF THE BLACK  LIVES MATTER  MOVEMENT,  ACCORDING TO A  RECENT \"NEW YORK  TIMES\" POLL.  NBC NEWS MET  WITH A GROUP OF  YOUNG PROTESTERS  IN NEW  YORK, LOOKING TO  KEEP THE  MOMENTUM GOING.  HERE'S THEIR  STORY.  >> IT'S BETTER  TO BE A WARRIOR  IN THE GARDEN  THAN A  FOUNDER AT WAR.  .  >> WARRIORS IN  THE GARDEN IS A  COLLECTIVE.  .  >> ONE, TWO,  THREE, FOUR.  >> I'M JUST  LOOKING DOWN  FIFTH AVENUE  KNEW, TO DO  SOME WORK, AND I  SEE A THOUSAND  PEOPLE WALKING  DOWN  THE STREET,  PROTESTING.  I'M LIKE, \"WOW,  THIS IS  SOMETHING.  GET TO THE FRONT  OF THE LINE,  MEET ONE OF OUR  LEADERS.\"  LIKE, \"WOW,  YOU'RE IT.\"  IT'S, LIKE,  CRAZY.  >> I WAS GOING  TO A PROTEST,  AND I JUST -- I  NOTICED  NO BLACK WOMAN  WAS SPEAKING.  >>  SPEAKING.  >> WE NEED THIS  GIRL, SO HERE I  AM.  IT'S EVERY NEW  PROBLEM WE BRING  UP, WE MUST  BRING UP  A SOLUTION AS  WELL.  >> I THINK WE  UNDERSTAND THAT.  WE UNDERSTAND  THAT DESPITE --  IT IS MULTI- FACETED.  I MEAN, WE NEED  TO BE  PROTESTING.  WE NEED TO BE  VOTING.  WE ALSO NEED TO  BE RUNNING FOR  THE POSITIONS OF  POWER.  >> I'M 22 YEARS  OLD.  I'M BLACK.  I'M YEAR.  I'M RUNNING FOR  CITY COUNCIL  DISTRICT 36,  WHICH IS  KRUM HEIGHTS.  S.  >> MY POLITICAL  AMBITIONS ARE  DEFUNDING THE  NYPD,  REALLOCATING THE  FUNDS BACK INTO  REEDUCATION, THE  NEIGHBORHOODS.  >> I ALSO WANT  TO TACKLE THE  HOUSING CRISIS.  >> CHANGING LAW  ENFORCEMENT IS  HOW THE LAW IS  ENFORCED WITH  THIS COMMUNITY.  .  >> ANONYMOUS  ACCOUNTS HAVE  BEEN RECEIVING  DEATH  THREATS.  IT'S JUST REALLY  SCARY, TO REACH  OUR GOAL.  IT'S  INTIMIDATING.  >> MY RUNNING  FOR CITY COUNCIL  IS A WIN-WIN  SITUATION.  EVEN IF I DON'T  WIN THE  ELECTION, I  THINK I'M  STARTING A  CONVERSATION.  NOT ONLY WILL  THE CITY HEAR,  BUT THE COUNTRY  WILL  HEAR WHAT I HAVE  TO SAY.  AND I THINK I AM  VOCALIZING WHAT  NEEDS TO BE  VOCALIZED.  >>> MISSISSIPPI  WILL REMOVE THE  CONFEDERATE  EMBLEM  FROM ITS STATE  FLAG.  NBC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT  KATIE BECK HAS  MORE ON THIS  HISTORIC MOMENT.  >> WELL, ALISON,  YESTERDAY, THE  MISSISSIPPI  HOUSE  AND SENATE  VOTING  OVERWHELMINGLY  THAT THE STATE  NEEDS A NEW  FLAG.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN  NOW IS A NINE- PERSON  COMMISSION  WILL BE TASKED  WITH DESIGNING  WHAT THE NEW  FLAG OF  MISSISSIPPI WILL  LOOK LIKE.  THE REQUIREMENTS  ARE THAT IT  CAN'T HAVE ANY  EMBLEMS  OF THE  CONFEDERACY AND  MUST HAVE THE  WORDS \"IN GOD  WE TRUST.\"  THERE WILL BE A  FEW MONTHS TO  WORK ON THAT.  BY NOVEMBER,  THAT DESIGN WILL  BE ON THE BALLOT  FOR  VOTERS TO DECIDE  WHETHER OR NOT  TO ADOPT.  VOTERS WILL BE  ABLE TO SELECT  YES OR NO TO THE  DESIGN THEY PUT  FORWARD.  IF THEY SELECT  NO, THAT NINE- MEMBER  COMMISSION WILL  GO BACK TO THE  DRAWING TABLE  AND DESIGN  ANOTHER  FLAG.  NOW, THERE WAS  VERY LITTLE  DISSENSION  YESTERDAY,  JUST A GAGGLE  THE OF  PROTESTERS  SAYING THE  DECISION  SHOULD BE IN THE  VOTERS' HANDS IN  MISSISSIPPI.  MOST PEOPLE HERE  BELIEVE THIS WAS  A DECISION LONG  OVERDUE.  THIS FLAG HAS  BEEN UP FOR 124  YEARS IN THE  STATE OF  MISSISSIPPI, AND  IS THE ONLY  REMAINING FLAG  IN THE  COUNTRY THAT HAS  ANY EMBLEM OF  THE CONFEDERACY  ON  IT.  THE GOVERNOR HAS  INDICATED HE  DOES INTEND TO  SIGN  IT.  HE DOES INTEND  TO SIGN IT WHEN  IT GETS TO HIS  DESK.  FROM THE POINT  HE DOES SIGN IT,  HE HAS 15 DAYS  FROM  THAT POINT TO  TAKE THE FLAG  DOWN.  SO A VERY, VERY  HISTORIC ACTION.  TODAY A VERY  CALM DAY AT THE  CAPITOL.  ALISON?  >>> COLORADO  REOPENED AT THE  END OF APRIL,  ONE OF  THE FIRST STATES  TO DO SO.  NOW IT IS SEEING  AN UP TICK IN  CORONAVIRUS  CASES.  NBC NEWS  REPORTER MOIRA  BARRETT JOINS ME  FROM THE  PEPSI CENTER.  IT IS NOW A  DRIVE-THROUGH  TESTING SITE.  WHAT IS GOING ON  THERE?  ARE THERE LONG  LINES, PEOPLE  HAVING  DIFFICULTY  GETTING TESTED?  WHAT IT'S LIKE?  >> ALISON,  THEY'VE SEEN AN  UP TICK IN  PEOPLE LOOKING  TO GET TESTED  HERE TODAY.  I JUST SPOKE  WITH THE MANAGER  HERE, AND HE  SAID  THEY'RE ON TRACK  WITH MORE THAN  2,000 PEOPLE.  TYPICALLY, THEY  SEE ABOUT 1,500  TO 1,600 PEOPLE  LOOKING TO GET  TESTED.  PROBABLY TAKES  ABOUT 10  MINUTES, A  STEADY FLOW OF  TRAFFIC, AS YOU  CAN SEE BEHIND  ME.  THERE ARE  STATIONS PEOPLE  CAN GO THROUGH  AND GET  THEIR DRIVE- THROUGH TESTS.  THIS IS FOR  PEOPLE WHO ARE  SYMPTOMATIC OR  ASYMPTOMATIC.  THE CITY TRYING  TO EXPAND  TESTING AS THAT  FEAR OF AN  UP TICK IN CASES  AROUND THE STATE  IS RESONATING  HERE.  WHAT ARE HEALTH  EXPERTS SAYING  ABOUT THESE NEW  CASES  IN COLORADO?  WHAT DO THEY  KNOW ABOUT  WHAT'S GOING ON?  >> Reporter:   COLORADO ISN'T  SEEING THAT  SURGE IN  CASES, BUT THERE  HAS BEEN AN UP  TICK ACTUALLY IN  THE  PAST 10 DAYS.  THE CASES HAVE  DOUBLED TO WHAT  THEY WERE  BEFORE, AND  AFTER THEY SAW  SOME HIGHS THAT  THEY HASN'T SOON  BACK  IN MAY.  SO THERE IS  DEFINITELY AN UP  TICK.  AND SO HEALTH  EXPERTS TELL ME  THEY'RE ON THAT  RAZOR'S EDGE TO  FIGURE OUT IF  THEY'RE GOING TO  SEE A  SURGE OR ABLE TO  CONTAIN IT.  THE KEY TO THAT  IS WEARING A  FACE MASK,  MAINTAINING  SOCIAL  DISTANCING, AND  STAYING HOME IF  YOU FEEL  SICK.  ONE OF THE  INTERESTING  THINGS WE'VE  SEEN IN UP TICK  CASES, OVER THE  LAST MONTH, 40%  OF THE CASES  HAVE  BEEN COMING FROM  YOUNG PEOPLE,  PEOPLE WHO ARE  YOUNGER THAN 30  YEARS OLD.  THAT SEEMS LIKE  IT MIGHT BE A  GOOD THING,  BECAUSE  YOUNG PEOPLE ARE  LESS LIKELY TO  GO TO THE  HOSPITAL.  ONE HEALTH  EXPERT TOLD ME  IT'S ACTUALLY  VERY  CONCERNING,  BECAUSE YOUNG  PEOPLE ARE OFTEN  ASYMPTOMATIC.  SO IF THEY'RE  STILL GOING OUT,  SOCIALIZING, OR  LIVING WITH  SOMEBODY IN THE  OLDER  POPULATION, MORE  VULNERABLE, THAT  CAN PROVIDE MORE  OPPORTUNITY FOR  FURTHER SPREAD  TO OLDER, MORE  VULNERABLE  PEOPLE WHO  MAYBE SKIPPED  GETTING INFECTED  BEFORE.  SO THE YOUNG  PEOPLE NEED TO  MAKE SURE, IF  THEY'RE  ASYMPTOMATIC,  THEY CAN STILL  BE CAREFUL AND  MAINTAIN  THAT SOCIAL  DISTANCING.  >> YOU MENTIONED  WHAT'S GOING ON  IN THE  NEIGHBORING  STATE, ARIZONA  AND UTAH.  THEY ARE SEEING  A SPIKE IN CASES  NOW.  HOW WORRIED ARE  FOLKS IN  COLORADO.  COULD THIS  AFFECT COLORADO?  >> DEFINITELY A  MAJOR CONCERN,  BECAUSE THINGS  LIKE  COLORADO THIS  TIME OF YEAR IS  ABSOLUTELY  BEAUTIFUL  TO GO LIKING.  IT IS A BIG  TOURISM STATE.  PEOPLE OFF COME  TO COLORADO FOR  VACATION.  ONE OF THE  HEALTH OFFICIALS  I TALKED TO  MENTIONED  THAT OBVIOUSLY  OUR BORDERS ARE  EXTENSIVE.  EVERYONE CAN GO  BACK AND FORTH  EASILY.  THAT IS ONE  THING THEY'RE  CONCERNED ABOUT.  AND THOSE  STATES, COLORADO  REOPENED EARLY  FOR THE  MOST PART.  THEY'RE SEEING  THE SLIGHT UP  TICK KIND OF  DURING  EACH PHASE OF  REOPENING.  SO THE REOPENING  COMBINED WITH  THE MEMORIAL DAY  HOLIDAY WAS  SOMETHING THAT A  LOT OF EXPERTS  ARE  POINTING TO,  THESE UP TICKS.  SO ONE THING  THAT EXPERTS ARE  LOOKING AT IS  THIS  UPCOMING JULY 4th HOLIDAY.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> WE FEEL LIKE  WE ARE ON THE  RAZOR'S EDGE,  AND 4th  OF JULY IS  COMING.  SO WE NEED  EVERYBODY TO  TAKE THIS  SERIOUSLY AND  FIND  A WAY TO  CELEBRATE THE  HOLIDAY THAT  KEEPS THEM AND  THEIR LOVED ONES  SAFE, STAYING 6  FEET FROM  OTHERS,  WEARING A MASK  WHEN YOU'RE OUT  IN PUBLIC, STAY  HOME  IF YOU'RE SICK.  >> EXACTLY.  YOU KNOW, WE  HAVE TOOLS, AND  THERE ARE TOOL  KITS  THAT CAN HELP  SLOW THE SPREAD.  >> ALISON, WE  KIND OF SOUND  LIKE A BROKEN  RECORD.  . A LOT OF  GOVERNORS ACROSS  THE COUNTRY ARE  IMPLEMENTING  THOSE FACE MASK  ORDERS.  THE SAME THING  THEY'VE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT  FOR THREE  MONTHS.  EXPERTS ARE  TELLING ME YOU  REALLY HAVE TO  HONE ON ON  THAT PREVENTION.  OR THEY'RE GOING  TO SEE A  RESURGENCE OF  WHAT WE SAW  THREE MONTHS  AGO.  >> EVERY TIME I  TALK TO DR. JOHN  TORES, IT'S THE  SAME THING.  IT'S THE MASK,  THE SOCIAL  DISTANCING, THE  HAND  WASHING.  WE'RE REPEATING  THEM, BECAUSE IT  WORKS.  SOME PEOPLE NOT  LONG TO THAT.  WHAT'S THE STATE  DOING TO KEEP  VOTERS THERE  SAFE.  >> Reporter:   FROM A COVID  PERSPECTIVE,  COLORADO HAS  A LEG UP WHEN IT  COMES TO THE  ELECTIONS.  IT BEEN A  PRIMARILY MAIL- IN STATE FOR THE  LAST SIX  YEARS.  ONLY 2 1/2% OF  VOTERS WENT TO  VOTE IN PERSON.  COLORADO HAS SET  UP THE MAIL-IN  BALLOTS.  YOU CAN GO AND  DROP OFF YOUR  BALLOT IN PERSON  TOMORROW, OR YOU  HAVE THE OPTION  OF VOTING IN  PERSON  IF YOU WANT TO.  .  >>> FROM AN  ELECTION  SECURITY  STANDPOINT OR  ELECTION  HEALTH  STANDPOINT, THE  VOTING PROTECTS  AGAINST VOTER  FRAUD.  . THE PRESIDENT  HAS SOME DOUBT  IN WHETHER IT IS  SECURE.  I ACTUALLY JUST  SPOKE WITH AN  ELECTION EXPERT.  SHE SAID THE  SYSTEM THEY PUT  INTO PLACE IN  COLORADO,  THE PAPER TRAIL  PROTECTS AGAINST  BEING IN  SECURITY.  WE'LL BE  MONITORING THAT  AS THE STATE  VOTES FOR ITS  NOMINEE.  ALISON?  ALL RIGHT.  STAY SAFE OUT  THERE, AND THANK  YOU SO MUCH.  >>> AS NEW  CORONAVIRUS HOT  SPOTS POP UP  ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, HEALTH  CARE WORKERS ARE  FEARFUL ABOUT  WHAT'S TO COME,  AND ANGRY ABOUT  PEOPLE NOT DOING  ENOUGH TO  PREVENT THE  SPREAD.  HERE'S SOME OF  THEIR VOICES.  >> IT HAS  RECENTLY BEEN  IDENTIFIED AS A  HOT SPOT IN  THE UNITED  STATES.  WHEN I FIRST  HEARD GREENVILLE  AND \"HOT SPOT,\"  I GOT  CHILLS.  ''HOT SPOT\" TO  ME IS NEW YORK  CITY.  AND I QUICKLY  WENT TO THROUGH  DENIAL.  GREEN CAN'T BE A  HOT SPOT.  WE CAN'T HANDLE  THAT.  AND THEN LOOKED  AT MY BOARD AT  WORK, THE TRACK  BOARD  AT WORK, AND SAW  HOW MANY  PATIENTS WERE  THERE WITH  COVID  COMPLAINTS.  .  >> A LITTLE OVER  TWO WEEKS AGO.  IT IS A  CONCERNING  UPDATE.  NOW WE BEGIN TO  OPEN UP.  WE'VE SEEN MORE  SPREAD, MORE  CASES.  >> I'M WILLING  TO TAKE CARE OF  ONE PATIENT IN  PARTICULAR.  HEALTHY AND  WATCHING THIS  PATIENT STRUGGLE  TO  BREATHE, GASPING  FOR AIR BECAUSE  OF COVID.  >> ONE PERSON  HAD HAD IT, AND  THEN EVERYONE  COMES  DOWN WITH IT,  WHILE I'VE SEEN  WHERE WE HAVE  FOUND IT  WHERE ONE PERSON  HAS HAD IT, AND  IT ALL DEPENDS  ON  YOUR TECHNIQUE.  IT ALL DEPENDS  ON ISOLATING  YOURSELF,  WEARING YOUR  MASK, HAND  WASHING,  STICKING TO THE  RULES THAT CAN  HELP YOU GET THE  IT PREVENTED.  SO VERY  IMPORTANT THAT  YOU STICK TO THE  RULES, OR  YOU CAN HAVE  SOCIAL  DISTANCING.  >> IT IS VERY  FRUSTRATING,  BECAUSE WE'RE  SEEING A  LOT OF PATIENT  WHO IS ARE SICK  AND DON'T NEED  TO BE  SICK.  THIS IS THE KIND  OF ILLNESS THAT  IF YOU TAKE SOME  SIMPLE MEASURES,  YOU DO A FEW  EASY THINGS,  LIKE WEAR  A MASK, HAVE  SOME SOCIAL  DISTANCING, WASH  YOUR  HANDS.  YOU CAN STOP THE  SPREAD OF IT.  THE FACT THAT A  LOT OF PEOPLE  AREN'T DOING  RELATIVELY MINOR  THINGS TO HELP  PROTECT THEIR  NEIGHBORS, HELP  PROTECT THEIR  FRIENDS AND  FAMILY WHO  HAVE CANCER, WHO  HAVE BONE-MARROW  CELLS, CYST I  CAN  FIBROSIS,  DIABETES.  . WE'RE ALL  TRYING HARD TO  BE GOOD  NEIGHBORS.  >> THE  CORONAVIRUS IS  UNPRECEDENTED IN  SO MANY WAYS.  IT IS NOT THE  FIRST TIME THE  U.S. HAS  EXPERIENCED A  PANDEMIC.  DURING THE \u00fa80S,  HIV AIDS SPREAD  ACROSS THE  COUNTRY,  CAUSING FEAR,  UNCERTAINTY, AND  GRIEF.

PATIENTS OFTEN  DIED ALONE  WITHOUT THEIR  FAMILIES,  BUT THEY ALSO  FACED A STIGMA  AGAINST THE  DISEASE  ALONGSIDE THE  FEAR OF THE  SPREAD,  SOMETHING  DR. FAUCCI  POINTED OUT  EARLY IN THE  CRISIS.  >> THE FEAR OF  INDIVIDUALS WHO  HAVE AIDS OR AT  RISK  GROUP FOR AIDS  TRANSMITTING  AIDS IS AN  UNDERSTANDABLE  FEAR, BUT REALLY  MIGHT TRANSLATE  INTO  UNCALLED-FOR  DISCRIMINATION,  WHICH  UNFORTUNATELY  HAS  BEEN THE CASE.  >> Reporter:  HE  BECAME THE  DIRECTOR OF  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE UNIT.  A VACCINE NEVER  CAME, SO THE  U.S. MOVED TO  MITIGATION  TACTICS.  TODAY THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION,  WHICH HAS BEEN  ACCUSED OF  ACTING SLOWLY,  WAIVERS ON  TAKING MEASURES  TO COMBAT THE  SPREAD OF THE  VIRUS, LIKE  WEARING  MASKS.  THE CDC ADVISES  PEOPLE TO WEAR  FACE COVERINGS.  PRESIDENT TRUMP  HASN'T WORN A  MASK EXCEPT ON  ONE  OCCASION WHILE  AT A FORD PLANT,  ALTHOUGH HE  REFUSED  TO WAR IT ON THE  PUBLIC PART OF  HIS TOUR.  PRESIDENT RONALD  REAGAN MENTIONED  HIV AIDS THE  FIRST  TIME IN 1985,  AND DELIVERED  HIS FIRST MAJOR  POLICY  SPEECH ON THE  CRISIS IN 1987.  >> THE BATTLE  AGAINST AIDS HAS  BEEN LIKE AN  EMERGENCY ROOM  OPERATION.

IN 2016,  RESEARCHERS WERE  STUDYING TWO  EARLIER  CORONAVIRUSES IN  A LLAMA NAMED  WINTER IN  BELGIUM.  NOW HER  ANTIBODIES FOR A  BLOOD DRAW ARE  BEING  STUDIED BY A  TEAM OF  RESEARCHERS WHO  WERE FUNDED IN  PART BY THE NIH  TO FIND A  TREATMENT FOR  COVID-19.  >> IT'S ONE SIDE  OF A BELT.  A BUNCH OF THEM  STICK OUT.  THERE IS A  COUNTER PART TO  IT.  IT TRIES TO  STICK AND ATTACH  ITSELF TO  OURSELVES  LIKE VELCRO.  WHAT WE'RE  TRYING TO DO IS  COME UP WITH AN  ANTIBODY  THAT CAN BIND  AND COVER ONE  SIDE OF THE  VELCRO SO IT  CAN NOT NO  LONGER STICK TO  OUR CELL.  >> AND IF YOU DO  THAT, THE  CORONAVIRUS NO  LONGER  BECOMES A THREAT  TO  >> .  >> THAT'S RIGHT.  >> IF  CORONAVIRUS IS  LIKE AN INVADING  ARMY IN OUR  BODY, THEN WHAT  ARE THE  ANTIBODIES?  >> THEY ARE THE  SOLDIERS WE  TRAIN TO  SPECIFICALLY  RECOGNIZE --  >> AND DESTROY  IT?  >> AND DESTROY  IT.  >> SCIENTISTS  WILL TAKE THE  ANTIBODY AND  CREATE A  COPY OF THE  ANTIBODY AS A  TREATMENT FOR  COVID-19.  >> WOULD YOU  INJECT THIS TO  SOMEBODY WHO  DOESN'T  HAVE  CORONAVIRUS?  >> THE ANTIBODY  WILL BE USED IN  TWO DIFFERENT  WAYS.  THEY CAN BE USED  PRO LACKICALLY  BEFORE SOMEBODY  IS  INFECTED, AND IT  CAN BE  ADVANTAGEOUS OR  HIGH-RISK  PEOPLE THAT ARE  NOWHERE LIKELY  TO BE EXPOSED TO  THE  VIRUS, HEALTH  CARE WORKERS,  NURSES AND  HOSPITALS.  YOU CAN INJECT  THEM.  THEY WOULD  PROBABLY BE  PROTECTED FOR  ONE TO TWO  MONTHS.  THE ANTIBODIES  WILL GO OVER  TIME SO THEY  WOULD NEED  ANOTHER  INJECTION EVERY  MONTH OR TWO.  THIS WILL  PROTECT THEM  FROM HOPEFULLY  GETTING  INFECTED.  >> WHAT ABOUT  PEOPLE WHO ARE  ALREADY INFECTED  AND  ARE TRYING TO  FIGHT COVID-19.  >> THAT'S THE  OTHER WAY, USING  THE ANTIBODY FOR  TREATMENT.  MAYBE A FEW DAYS  AFTER INFECTION,  WHERE YOU COULD  ADMINISTER THE  ANTIBODY, AND IT  WILL HELP THEIR  BODIES FIGHT OFF  THE VIRUS, AND  MAYBE THAT WILL  DECREASE THE  SEVERITY OF THE  DISEASE OR  SHORTEN THE  NUMBER OF DAYS  IN THE HOSPITAL.  >> RESEARCHERS  ARE NOW  PREPARING TO  CONDUCT  PRECLINICAL  STUDIES IN  ANIMALS, THEN  TESTING IN  HUMANS IN THE  HOPES OF FINDING  AN ANTIBODY  TREATMENT  FOR THE COVID-19  PANDEMIC.  >> IS WINTER OUR  HERO?  >> I HOPE SO.

I AM HIS  SECRETARY OF  HEALTH.  I AM TELLING  YOU.  WEAR FACIAL  COVERINGS WHEN  YOU CAN'T SOCIAL  DISTANCE.

ALLISON.  >> ALL RIGHT  THANKS SO MUCH.  WE WILL SEE YOU  IN A LITTLE BIT.  >>> THE PEOPLE  ARE COURT  STRIKING DOWN A  LOUISIANA LAW  RESTRICTING  ACCESS TO  ABORTION IN A 5- 4 DECISION  TODAY.  NBC NEWS PETE  WILSONIAMS JOINS  ME FROM  WASHINGTON, D.C.  AND PETE, TALK  US THROUGH THE  RULINGS.  >> Reporter:  THIS IS A LAW  THAT NEVER TOOK  EFFECT IN FULL  FORCE.  IT WAS PASSED BY  LOUISIANA.  AND IT SAID THAT  A DOCTOR  PERFORMING  ABORTIONS  SERVICES HAD TO  HAVE PRIVILEGES  TO ADMIT  PATIENTS AT  NEARBY HOSPITAL.  THE STATE SAID  THIS WOULD HELP  MAKE SURE THE  DOCTORS WERE  PROPERLY  CREDENTIALED,  BUT TODAY, THE  SUPREME COURT  SAID IT WOULD  PROVIDE  ABSOLUTELY NO  HEALTH BENEFITS  AND WOULD BE AN  ADDITIONAL  OBSTACLE TO A  WOMAN'S RIGHT OF  ACCESS TO  ABORTION, AND  THEREFORE WAS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  NOW  INTERESTINGLY,  THIS LAW WAS  IDENTICAL TO ONE  THAT TEXAS  PASSED AND THE  SUPREME COURT  STRUCK DOWN FOUR  YEARS AGO.  IN THAT RULING,  FOUR YEARS AGO,  THE CHIEF  JUSTICE JOHN  ROBERTS WAS ONE  OF THE DECENTERS  AND WOULDN'T  HAVE STRUCK DOWN  THE TEXAS LAW.  BUT TODAY, HE  SAID EVEN THOUGH  I DISAGREED WITH  THE EARLIER  DECISION, THAT  IS NOW THE LAW.  AND I AM BOUND  BY THAT  PRECEDENT AND  THERE EVER HE  JOINED THE OTHER  LIBERALS TO FORM  THE 5 VOTES.  SO A 5-4 VOTE TO  CHEE TEE CLARE  THE LAW  UNCONSTITUTIONAL  BECAUSE IT  FLUNKED THE SAME  TEXT THE TEXAS  LAW DID FOUR  YEARS AGO.  >> PETE, PLANNED  PARENTHOOD  PRESIDENT SAID  THIS ABOUT THE  DECISION TODAY--  >> TODAY JUSTICE  ROBERTS DID THE  RIGHT THING.  HE UPHELD  PRECEDENT AND  STOOD WITH WOMEN  BUT MAKE NO  MISTAKES THIS IS  AN  ADMINISTRATION  THAT'S  COMPLETELY  COMMITTED TO  TAKING AWAY THE  RIGHT OF PEOPLE  TO MAKE THEIR  OWN DECISIONS  ABOUT PREGNANCY.  >> SO PETE, WHAT  SHOULD PEOPLE  TAKE AWAY FROM  THE DECISION NOT  ONLY HOW IT WILL  AND WON'T AFFECT  ABORTION RIGHTS  BUT THE SUPREME  COURT AND LEAKS.  >> NUMBER ONE,  IT'S UNDOUBTEDLY  TRUTH TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION  WANTS TO CHANGE  THE LAW HERE.  BUT MOST OF THE  RESTRICTIONS  THAT THE SUPREME  COURT HAS BEEN  REVIEWING ARE  STATE LAWS.  AND THIS IS JUST  SUCH AN EXAMPLE.  SECONDLY, I  WOULD SAY THAT  THIS IS NOT --  THIS RULING IS  NOT A RESOUNDING  VICTORY FOR  ABORTION RIGHTS.  BECAUSE  BASICALLY,  JUSTICE ROBERTS  SORT OF  GRUDGINGLY JOINS  THE MAJORITY  TODAY SAYING  WELL, BECAUSE WE  HAVE DECIDE THIS  QUESTION, THE  SAME ANSWER  APPLIES.  BUT IF A NEW  RESTRICTION CAME  ALONG, IT  DOESN'T  NECESSARILY MEAN  HE WOULD BE WITH  THE LIBERALS ON  THAT ONE.  THAT'S WHY I  THINK YOU ARE  HEARING A MUTED  SENSE OF VICTORY  FROM ADVOCATES  FOR ABORTION  RIGHTS.  >> YEAH.  >> THERE'S ONE  OTHER POINT  ABOUT THE  DECISION THERE.  WERE FIVE  DEFINITE VOTES  TODAY.  TO PUT AN END TO  THE CLAIM THAT  LOUISIANA MADE  AND OTHERS MAKE,  THAT ABORTION  CLINICS AND  ABORTION DOCTORS  CANNOT CHALLENGE  THE  RESTRICTIONS.  THEIR THEORY IS  BECAUSE THE  RIGHT OF ACCESS  TO ABORTION  BELONGS TO  WOMEN, THEY ARE  THE ONLY ONES.  ONLY PREGNANT  WOMEN CAN BRING  CHALLENGE TO THE  LAWS AND THE  SUPREME COURT  SAID TODAY NO  THAT'S NOT THE  CASE.  IF THE COURT HAD  AGREED WITH THAT  IDEA, THAT WOULD  MAKE IT MUCH  HARDER TO  CHALLENGE FUTURE  ABORTION  RESTRICTIONS.  >> PETE  WILSONIAMS.  WE HAVE HAD BIG  DECISIONS  LATELY.  THANKS FOR  JOINING US  AGAIN.  >> RIGHT.  >> YEAH.  >>> BEACHES  ACROSS FLORIDA  ARE SHUTTING  DOWN FOR THE 4th  OF JULY.  THE STATE SEAT  RECORD THIS  WEEKEND WITH  MORE THAN 18,000  NEW CORONAVIRUS  CASES.  AND NBC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT  SAM BROCK HAS  MORE FROM MIAMI  BEACH.  >> Reporter:  ALLISON, GOOD  AFTERNOON.  GOOD TO BE WITH  YOU.  I AM ON MIAMI  BEACH WHICH  REOPENED A FEW  WEEKS AGO AND  NOW WILL CLOSE  FOR THE NEXT  HOLIDAY WEEKEND,  JULY 3rd TO JULY  7th.  ALL OF THE  BEACHES IN MIAMI  DADE COUNTY  SHUTTING DOWN TO  TRY TO PREVENT A  REPEAT WHAT HAVE  WE SAW WITH THE  MEMORIAL DAY  HOLIDAY.  LOTS OF FOLKS  COMING TO  BEACHES AND  RESTAURANTS AND  BARS ALL OVER  THE PLACE.  AND THERE WAS A  SPIKE IN CASE AS  COUPLE WEEKS  AFTER.  NOW THIS  DECISION FROM  CARLOS JIMENEZ,  THE MAYOR OF  MIAMI DADE,  REPLICATED IN  OTHER PARTS OF  FLORIDA AS WELL.  BROWARD COUNTY,  WE FOUND OUT  THEY WILL CLOSE  THEIR BEACHES.  THREE MAYORS IN  BROWARD COUNTY  CAME OUT OVER  THE WEEKEND AND  WERE INFORMING  PEOPLE YOU CAN'T  COME OUT HERE  FOR THE HOLIDAY.  WE ARE DOING IT  FOR YOUR SAFETY  AND THEY WERE  SHOUTED DOWN AND  HECKLED.  THINGS LIKE  FREEDOM AND  SOCIAL  DISTANCING ON  THE BEACH.  AND IF YOU LOOK  OFFER MY  SHOULDER, YOU  WILL SEE THERE'S  PLENTY OF SPACE  AT THE MOMENT.  BUT MONDAY  AFTERNOON RIGHT  NOW.  THE CONCERN IS  WHAT IT LOOKS  LIKE COME JULY  4th.  OFFICIALS HERE  DOESN'T WANT TO  TAKE CHANCES  ESPECIALLY GIVEN  THE FACT THE  POSITIVITY RATES  ARE GOING IN THE  WRONG DIRECTION.  THE LATEST  NUMBERS FROM  FLORIDA, 5200  NEW CASES  CONFIRMED TODAY.  NOT NEARLY AS  MUCH AS OVER THE  WEEKEND, ALMOST  10,000 ON  SATURDAY, AND  8500 ON SUNDAY.  BUT HERE'S THE  PROBLEM.  THEY DID MORE  TESTS ON THOSE  DAYS AS WELL.  FEWER TESTS  TODAY BUT A  HIGHER  PERCENTAGE OF  PEOPLE TESTING  POSITIVE.  ALMOST 16%  ACROSS THE STATE  OF FLORIDA.  IN MIAMI DADE  COUNTY WHERE I  AM, TWO WEEK  AVERAGE IS  CLOSER TO 17%.  THAT'S FAR  HIGHER THAN ANY  OFFICIAL IS  COMFORTABLE  WITH.  IT'S THE REASON  WE ARE SEEING  THE EXTREME  MEASURES.  OR I SHOULD SAY  SAFETY MEASURES  BEING TAKEN.  SOME FEEL THEY  ARE EXTREME.  OTHER THINKS  IT'S ABOUT TIME  WE DO SOMETHING  AS WE SEE CASES  SURGING HERE.  BARS CLOSING  ACROSS THE STATE  OF FLORIDA AS  WELL.  AND WE WILL SEE  IF THERE'S MORE  ROLLBACKS AS THE  TRENDS CONTINUE.  REPORTING FROM  MIAMI BEACH, SAM  BROCK, NOW BACK  TO YOU.  >>> ARIZONA  STRUGGLE TO  EXPAND THE COVID- 19 TESTING.  AS ICU BEDS ARE  FILLING UP.  AND NBC NEWS  REPORTER VON  HILL YARD JOINS  US FROM TESTING  LAB IN  CONVENIENTICS  AND WE KNOW THE  HOSPITALIZATION  RATE IS BAD IN  ARIZONA.  WHAT'S GOING ON  THIS TODAY?  >> Reporter:  WELL, IT GETS  WORSE.  EVERY DAY WE DO  THIS, HOW MANY  TIMES DO I HAVE  TO TELL YOU WE  ARE BREAKING  RECORDS.  TODAY, BREAKING  RECORDS  THROUGHOUT THE  VENTILATORS AND  BREAK RECORDS  FOR NUMBER OF  ICU BEDS IN USE.  THIS WEEKEND,  AGAIN BROKE THE  RECORD FOR THE  MOST NUMBER OF  NEW CASES.  NEARLY 4,000 OF  THEM IN A SINGLE  DAY.  I DON'T KNOW HOW  MANY TIMES WE  HAVE TO DO THIS  ALLISON.  FRANKLY, I AM A   EXASPERATEED  BECAUSE THERE'S  NO POLICY CHANGE  TAKING PLACE.  THERE'S NO  RESOURCES.  THIS STATE THE  GOVERNOR HERE  HAS NOT  REIMPLEMENTED  ANY SHUT DOWN  ORDERS NO STAY  AT HOME ORDERS.  THE BARS ARE  OPENED.  RESTAURANTS ARE  OPENED.  POOLS ARE  OPENED.  THE WATER PARKS,  CASINOS ARE  OPENED.  YOU KNOW, GO  AROUND TOWN AND  IT IS  ESSENTIALLY JUNE  2019 AROUND  HERE.  YES, SOME FOLKS  ARE STAYING  HOME.  BUT BY IN LARGE,  THE STREETS THIS  WEEKEND THERE'S  TRAFFIC ON THEM.  IN THE LAST TWO  WEEKS, WE NEED  TO PUT THIS IN  CONTEXT.  IN THE LAST TWO  WEEKS THE LAST  14 DAYS, THE  NUMBER OF  HOSPITALIZATIONS  HAS INCREASED BY  84%.  NEARLY DOUBLE IN  THE LAST TWO  WEEKS.  THE GOVERNOR HAS  URGED FOLKS TO  STAY AT HOME,  BUT BY IN LARGE,  YOU ARE NOT  SEEING THAT  HAPPEN ON A  LARGE-SCALE.  THERE'S SERIOUS  QUESTIONS HERE  IN THE STATE OF  ARIZONA.  AND THERE'S  LITTLE REASON  WHEN IT COMES TO  CONTACT TASTES  AND HOW WILL THE  TRAJECTORY  CHANGE IN THE  UPCOMING WEEKS.  >> I KNOW YOU  SAY YOU ARE  EXPERHAPS RATED  AND I CAN HEAR  IT IN YOUR VOICE  AND THAT'S NOT  YOUR NATURE BUT  YOU ARE RIGHT.  WE TALKED TO YOU  DAY AFTER DAY  AFTER DAY, AND I  THINK THE ONLY  THING THAT HAS  REALLY CHANGED  IS THAT THINGS  HAVE GOTTEN  WORSE.  TELL US MORE  ABOUT THE  TESTING LAB  WHERE YOU ARE  AND WHAT PEOPLE  ARE TELLING YOU  THERE.  I IMAGINE FOLKS  ARE EXASPERATEED  THERE AS WELL.  >> Reporter: WE  DON'T  HAVEANSWERS I  TALKED TO WAITER  WHO IS SCARED  SHE HAS IT AND  IS GIVING IT TO  SOMEBODY I  TALKED WITH A  WOMAN MARTIKA  FLORES WHO SAYS  FOR THE SAME  REASON SHE WANTS  TO GET TESTED.  LISTEN TO HER  AND SHE WILL  TELL YOU ABOUT  THAT EXPERIENCE.  ROW ARE LOOK FOR  A TEST?  >> YES, I DID.  >> Reporter: AND  WHAT DID YOU  FIND?  >> NOTHING IS  OPENED, AND  THERE'S NO NEW  INFORMATION  ONLINE SAYING  THAT IT WAS  CLOSED AT ALL.  SO.  >> Reporter: IS  IT A LITTLE  FRUSTRATING TO  SHOW UP AND  THERE BE NO  TESTING HERE?  >> JUST A LITTLE  BIT.  IT'S KIND OF A  TREASURE HUNT  RIGHT NOW.  SO.  >> Reporter:  YES, WE ARE  BREAKING RECORDS  IN THE STATE.  THE NUMBER OF  POSITIVE CASES  BUT IT'S TELLING  HOW HARD IT IS  TO GET A TEST.  HOW MUCH OF A  TREASURE HUNT IT  IS FOR PEOPLE  LIKE MARCH TIK- A. THERE'S FOLKS  WAITING IN LINE.  THE RESULTS ARE  COMING BACK AND  IN A DELAYED  ORDER.  THE CAPACITY FAR  -- OR THE DEMAND  FAR EXCEEDS THE  CAPACITY.  THERE'S ONE  OTHER IMPORTANT  NUMBER THAT I  WANT TO POINT  OUT.  THAT'S NUMBER  25%.  ALLISON, 25% OF  THE TEST TAKEN  COME BACK  POSITIVE.  THAT'S  EXTRAORDINARY.  FAR AHEAD WHERE  FLORIDA IS AND  TEXAS IS.  FAR AHEAD OF  WHERE THE UNITED  STATES IS.  AND SO TO  UNDERSTAND THE  VASTNESS OF THE  SPREAD WE  UNDERSTAND SO  LITTLE.  AND THAT'S WHAT  BRINGS US HERE.  RIGHT HERE RIGHT  HERE BEHIND ME.  THIS IS THE MAIN  LABORATORY HERE  IN THE STATE OF  ARIZONA.  THEY PROCESS 80%  OF THE COVID  TEST IN THE  STATE.  RIGHT NOW THEY  ARE NOT ABLE TO  PROCESS ENOUGH  TEST.  ALL THE TESTS  ARE COME IN BUT  THEY CAN ONLY  PROCESS 7,000  TEST A DAY.  WHICH IS  RESULTING IN  THAT BACKLOG.  AND WHY FOLKS  ARE NOT GETTING  RESULTS FOR MORE  THAN A WEEK IN  MOST CASES.  APPRECIATE HER  TALKING BUT I  TALKED WITH THE  CHIEF OPERATING  OFFICER HERE AT  SONORA QUEST.  SONYA ANGLE AND  WAS ABLE TO ASK  THE VERY  QUESTIONS AS TO  WHY ARE WE HERE  IN THE POSITION  NOW AND HOW IS  THE STATE GOING  TO BE ABLE TO  PROCESS THE  TESTS HERE IN  THE WEEKS AHEAD.  TAKE A LISTEN TO  PART OF THE  CONVERSATION.  >> WE IN  UNPRECEDENTED  TIMES AND WE ALL  RAMPED UP AS  QUICKLY AS WE  POSSIBLY COULD.  AND, WHERE WE  ARE TODAY  REPRESENTS A  VERY CONCERTED  EFFORT TO BRING  IN ADDITIONAL  INSTRUMENTS,  STAFF, FREE  AGENTS AND  CONSUMERS TO  MEET THE DEMAND.  >> Reporter: SHE  IS ANSWERING MY  QUESTION AS TO  WHY ARE WE IN  THIS POSITION  RIGHT NOW.  THERE'S NOT THE  NECESSARY  MACHINERY TO  PROCESS THE  TEST.  ARIZONA HAD 3  MONTH LEEWAY.  WE ARE NOT NEW  YORK.  THIS IS NOT NEW  JERSEY.  THE TRAJECTORY  WAS SEEN AND A  WORST CASE  SCENARIO THAN  THIS BUT NOW  THEY ARE TRYING  TO GET IN  MACHINERY.  WHEN I ASKED AND  PRESSED, WHERE  ARE THE MACHINES  COMING IN, AND  WHEN CAN  ARIZONANS TRULY  IF THEY WANT TO  GET A TEST, BE  ABLE TO GET A  TESTISH CAN'T   TEST, I CAN'T  GET AN ANSWER.  THE GOVERNOR  WILL BE HERE AND  THAT'S WHERE THE  EXPERHAPS RATION  COMES FROM IT  GOES IN THE  WRONG DIRECTION  AND THERE'S LACK  OF ANSWERS OUT  OF THE STATE AND  HEALTH CARE  SYSTEM.  >> IS THERE ANY  EXPECTATION THE  GOVERNOR WILL BE  ANNOUNCING NEW  RESTRICTIONS OR  NEW REGULATION  OR MOVE TO SLOW  DOWN THE SPREAD  OR CUT BACK THE  HOSPITALIZATIONS.  >> Reporter: S  THE ONLY THING  IS IMPLEMENTING  MASS  REQUIREMENTS.  BUT IT DIDN'T  GIVE THEM THE  OPPORTUNITY TO  CLOSE  RESTAURANTS OR  BARS THEMSELVES.  THERE'S ALSO  QUESTIONS ABOUT  SCHOOLING.  YOU KNOW, HERE  IN THE STATE OF  ARIZONA A. GREAT  NUMBER OF  SCHOOLS THEY  HAVE WHAT THEY  CALL YEAR-ROUND  SCHOOL WHERE  THEY ARE SET TO  START IN 2 OR 3  WEEKS FROM NOW.  SO ESSENTIALLY A  YOUNG POPULATION  HERE IN THE  HEART OF  MARICOPA COUNTY  TWO WEEKS FROM  NOW SET TO  RECONGREGATE.  THERE'S  QUESTIONS ABOUT  YOUTH SPORTS  ONGOING.  AND THERE ARE  QUESTIONS HERE  IN THE STATE AS  WHAT IS GOING TO  BE DONE BECAUSE  THE GOVERNOR  URNING PEOPLE TO  STAY HOME BUT  NOT ENOUGH IS  CHANGING FROM MY  EYES ACROSS  GREATER ARIZONA.  >> I KNOW YOU  ARE FRUSTRATED  AND I  YOU WILL  KEEP ASKING  QUESTIONS.  I APPRECIATE  YOUR WORK.  >> APPRECIATE  IT.  >>> BARS IN  CALIFORNIA  COUNTIES FORCED  TO CLOSE AGAIN  BECAUSE OF A  SPIKE IN  CORONAVIRUS  CASES THERE.  NBC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT  ERIN McLAUGHLIN  JOINS ME FROM  LOS ANGELES AND  AARON, IT'S ONE  OF THE COUNTIES  CLOSING THE  BARS.  DO YOU KNOW OF  OUTBREAKS WITH  SPECIFIC  CONNECTIONS TO  THE NIGHT LIFE?  >> Reporter:  HEY, WELL, WHEN  GOVERNOR NEWSOM  MADE THE  ANNOUNCEMENT HE  DIDN'T HAVE  SPECIFIC CASES  TO SITE OTHER  THAN THE GENERAL  SPREAD OF THE  VIRUS THROUGHOUT  THE STATE OF  CALIFORNIA.  REALLY, THIS  ORDER, THOUGH,  SHUTTING DOWN  BARS ACROSS 7  COUNTIES,  RECOMMENDING THE  SHUT DOWN OF  BARS A I CROSS 8  MORE FOLLOWS IN  THE FOOTSTEPS OF  OTHER STATES  FLORIDA AND  TEXAS.  TEXAS GOVERNOR  SAYING REGRETS  EVER ALLOWING  BARS TO REOPEN  IN THE FIRST  PLACE SAYING  THEY COULD BE  INCUBATORS FOR  THE VIRUS.  WE KNOW THE  SPECIFIC CASE  OUT OF EAST  LANSING,  MICHIGAN,  RESPONSIBLE FOR  805 CORONAVIRUS  CASES.  EXPERTS SAY THAT  BARS ARE  POTENTIAL  INCUBATORS AND  THEY ARE CLOSE  QUARTERS AND  POORLY  VENTILATED AND  IF PEOPLE DRINK  THEY LET DOWN  THEIR GUARD.  IT IS REQUIRING  SOCIAL  DISTANCING AND  MASK WEARING TO  STOP THE SPREAD  OF THE VIRUS.  >>  >> WHAT ARE BAR  OWNERS SAYING  ABOUT THE  CLOSURES AND HOW  IT WILL IMPACT  THEIR BUSINESS.  I KNOW IT'S A  FRUSTRATING  TIME.  >> Reporter: WE  SPOKE TO SOME  BAR OWNERS  EARLIER TODAY IN  LOS ANGELES, AND  THEY ARE  EXTREMELY  FRUSTRATED AND  THEY ARE WORRIED  ABOUT THEIR  BUSINESSES AND  THEY LOST A LOT  MONEY IN THE  INITIAL SHUT  DOWN INVESTING  MORE MONEY AND  ADJUSTING TO THE  NEW REALITY IN  REOPENING TO A  SHUT DOWN A LOT  OF THE BAR  OWNERS SAYING WE  DON'T KNOW IF WE  CAN GO ON.  OTHER SAYS THEY  NEVER REOPENED  BECAUSE THEY SAW  THIS AS A  POSSIBILITY.  THEY DID NOT  WANT TO REOPEN  AND THEY DIDN'T  WANT TO RISK THE  EXTRA  INVESTMENT.  VERY WORRIED  ABOUT THEIR  BOTTOM LINE.  >> CALIFORNIA  HAS A MASK  MANDATE FOR TWO  WEEKS.  FROM WITH A  YOU'VE SEEN ARE  MOST FOLLOWING  THE GUIDELINES  AND TAKING THIS  SERIOUSLY?  >> Reporter:  WELL RIGHT NOW  WE ARE SEEING A  SURGE OF CASES  IN CALIFORNIA.  OVER THE PAST  TWO WEEKS, AN  UPTICK OF 50%.  30% UPTICK IN  HOSPITALIZATIONS,  AND EXPERTS I'VE  BEEN TALKING TO  SAY IT'S REALLY  DOWN TO PEOPLE'S  BEHAVIOR AS THE  STATE HAS SLOWLY  BEEN REOPENING.  THE STATE HAS  BEEN URGING  GUIDELINES.  PEOPLE HAVE NOT  BEEN FOLLOWING  THEM.  THEY HAVE NOT  BEEN WEARING THE  MASK AND HAVE  NOT BEEN SOCIAL  DISTANCING.  I AM SPEAKING TO  BALK AT UCF  MEDICAL AND HE  SAYS IT'S A  WARNING SHOT TO  THE REST OF THE  STATE.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >>  >> WELL HE, AT  THE VERY LEAST,  IT'S A VERY  CLEAR MESSAGE TO  PEOPLE THEY NEED  TO FOLLOW.  THE VIRUS IS  EVER BIT AS REAL  AS IT WAS BEFORE  AND THERE'S NO  REASON WE  COULDN'T BE NEW  YORK IN MARCH IF  WE ARE  NOTICERFUL.  SO THE HOPE IS  PEOPLE WILL SEE  THE SURGE IN  CASES AND SAY  IT'S TIME TO  TAKE IT  SERIOUSLY.  IF WE DON'T, I  DON'T SEE ANY  REASON WE WON'T  BE BACK INTO  LOCK DOWN OVER  THE NEXT FEW  WEEKS AND YOU  KNOW, GIVEN THE  REASON WE WERE  OPENING UP WAS  TO TRY TO ALLOW  THE ECONOMY TO  RECOVER.  THAT WILL CAUSE  THE ECONOMY TO  IMPLODE ONCE  AGAIN.  >> Reporter: THE  STATE BEGAN TO  SEE THE SURGE OF  CASES IN THE  SOUTHERN PART OF  THE STATE.  NOW WE ARE  SEEING AT BOTH  ENDS AND  STANISLAUS  COUNTY TO THE  NORTH IS SEEN AS  A HOT SPOT.

WP DS laptop I was finally able to connect with a doctor speaking with the doctor he just went over my chart he saw you know all the conditions that I had and you know why was choosing to use cannabis they always make sure that you don't have any pre-existing heart conditions you know they really want to make sure that you're not consuming a vasoconstrictive substance and also maybe suffering from heart attacks but it was very simple you know a lot of the the video call was kind of just waiting for them to just wrap things up on there and put in something into the computer I don't know it was a little bit of chitchat for about half the call there and then I was able to just print out my recommendation they flash you a screen we can download a PDF copy of the recommendation and you can just print it out and then about a couple weeks later we received the medical marijuana recommendation in the mail with a more official seal on it and that's basically it man it's super [ __ ] simple these days to get your medical marijuana card there's no reason you should be going down to the doctor's office unless you don't have like internet or something and then I don't know how you're watching these videos but for just 40 bucks that ended up being 10 dollars more than I expected you can get yourself a medical marijuana recommendation same [ __ ] day to walk into that dispensary get your weed thank us later this video is not sponsored by ease we literally we just needed to renew our recs and this was the most convenient way possible and I'm really happy that things worked out um
