{"GYbQtkxx6RI": "Oh [Music] [Music] water hash hacks so our first tank today is going to be how to create a shield this is a picture of a shield just cut the bottom off a bucket then use the shield on the inside of your work bag as seen here this helps keep your bag from drifting to the middle and will help protect it from your drill or your paddle or whatever you're using the mixer batch our next hack for today is going to be using a siphon we have just pulled out our work bag and here we see our hash water in the bucket one of the easiest ways the siphon this water out is to use a 25 micron screen like this it's easier to push the bag down into the water than it is to dump the whole bucket through the bag get a pan or a small bucket to place the hose in you just need something to stop the screen from getting sucked into the hose another way to do this is to let your hash water settle for about 20 minutes and very gently place your pan on the bottom of your hash water bucket then siphon out of your pan to a bucket with your 25 micron screen bag catching all the water if you do that just in case anything good does sneak out on [Music] now that took me about five minutes and you can see all the hash is left in just a small amount of water that's a lot less to deal with and it saves your back and your time another little trick is when you're dealing with multiple runs is you can just mix them together you can do this easily if you're using the siphon method I'll mix my first runs together and my second runs together that's what you see here the mixing of two different runs now let them settle and pour it off later which brings us to our last hack of the day rinsing your hash this trick works especially well when dealing with low quality trim so now just fill the buckets with fresh water and let them sell for 20 minutes before pouring them off if you're in a hurry you can use the bag and the siphon and then you won't have to wait for them to settle [Music] [Music] now I've let those buckets settle for 20 minutes and I'm going to just pour them off slowly you can see this stuff's pretty clean already you'll still see some small debris that gets out once in a while there's still a little bits of stuff in there now with the clearness of the water you can start to see the hash down there at the bottom and now you can see a little hash trail trying to make its way to the rim so we'll stop it about there and now that's all of our hash and just that little bit of water I'm pouring these into a 25 micron Bay to catch anything good that gets out if it looks good enough I will add to my second runs or I will just use it for cooking I like to repeat this process until I can see the hash sitting on the bottom of a bucket full of clear water [Music] I have been dumping buckets in that bag all day most of the time it'll pull straight out with a little or no resistance so it is holding a little more water than usual but still easy to pull and it's draining pretty quick [Music] when i zoom in here you can see there is some stuff stuck to that bag it is a little dirty well happy hashing age [Music] [Music]", "0peKkiKvhH4": "[Music] [Music]

to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios

for watching", "kfmzOQLahqg": "[Music] and watch it [Music] what's up DD see Scott it real and gum a friend Levi from low temp plates on the line what's up brother man I'm doing good but you know me man first off Levi always supports a DGC was that the 7-10 concentration celebration appreciate your brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having us out we we really love being there yeah yeah okay so Levi is gonna be my source I've talked it to naazy I've talked to a few people and you're gonna be my source for a freeze dryer or at least you're gonna be my information source right now because I'm a little bit confused what I'm thinking about is I got this greenhouse coming down count aloud 1015 pounds whatever the hell we get from it different strains and I want to make some something good out of them something a little bit better than just shatter I was thinking about the laws man I can't have 15 pounds right but I can take 15 pounds and wash it down to I don't know a few ounces or a half a pound or something like that that would be legally okay no yeah yeah correct yeah I mean as long as you're lifting your your your legal jurisdictions whatever local jurisdictions that you have yeah that can definitely help cut down your total weight now if I'm thinking about it because I am a little bit of a public figure if the cops were watching me and listening to what I said if I was blasting this all with butane is that technically illegal or am I able to do that yeah yeah by far technically illegal yeah okay okay so that's where the rosin press comes in so if I wanted to play by the rules I could press you press this match pressing twelve or fifteen pounds of flour seems a little ridiculous and I'm kind of setting you up for the softball because we don't press flour correct well so you can for a simplicity sake right it's you know for commercial operations is a very easy skewer to throw on on the shelves for home users who just shop at dispensaries it's really nice just because you can go grab some flour I'm from a hair straightener stepping on a hair straightener all the way up mm presses so oh yeah you can but it is quite a bit of work if you're talking 15 pounds or whatever it is then yes yeah yeah you would much prefer pressing the hash equivalent of that it's not alive too big big key to sink your pressing flour you're pressing dried cured flour not like fresh frozen flour so that's what I wanted to get into so the difference remaking shatter and making live or live rosin is that everything has to stay cold right everything has to be frozen so we're gonna harvest it wet we're gonna instantly freeze it and then we're going to wash it in and then once we freeze it we can take our time take out some you know half pound at a time wash it in bubble bags or a bubble machine and that's where I'm a little bit confused so I've got my sifted water hash that comes out of the bubble machine how do I keep that life yeah so the best thing that you can do is as soon as you've washed it is to you've got two options the old-school way would be to freeze it and then microplane it and what you're trying to achieve there is a long-term slow dry so that can range from four to about seven days within a humidity and temperature control room okay so you've got a microplane what you explained micro planning yeah so micro micro planning it would just be freezing the bubble hash that you take out of your bags right and then at when it's frozen you're taking essentially like a grater a sifter and you're sifting it up on to a lot of people use cardboard but what you're doing is that you're trying to break it up into small pieces so it can air dry over a slow period of time on within this time you know you do experience a little bit of oxidization right they start to see things get a little bit darker versus using a free char and that gets me into the second option which would be just slapping it in a freeze dryer and that process pretty much she you pull a deep freeze on the product ranging from you can adjust your times anywhere from about seven to ten hours and that matters seven to ten hours I mean I can't freeze it for a month so you you can't actually freeze it for however long you really wish okay but the the freezer ours they are a little and they're a little bit on the pricier side yeah so it's not something that I would want to run over a long term unless you have to you know so a more conventional freezer would be a little bit more suited if you want to freeze for freeze that hash specifically for you know 24 hours or a week or whatever it is before you can actually do your full freeze drying process all right then yeah that makes sense all right so we got to the where I've got the bubble and I'm putting it in the freeze dryer now so now I just I leave it for what a day a week yeah so you've got essentially two times that on the freeze dryer that are important to you there's there's a free cycle and a dry cycle so the first part of the freeze dryer is to deep freeze the entire product right so seven hours for most product is is plenty depending on what you want to do guy so let's say seven hours there and then there is a dry cycle at the end which there is a vacuum pump and it pulls vacuum on the chamber and then there are trays within the freeze dryer that warm up slightly to allow for the tip furnace for the moisture to evaporate out of the product out of your wet hash and then it pulls a vacuum and it cycles through that so and we're not talking about we're not talking about evaporation here this is sublimation we're going directly from liquid solid to a gas and going away and what evaporation is solid to the liquid gonna do it yes mmm-hmm interesting and it'll take chemistry yeah then so you're just opening up that drain valve and whatever moisture you collected that has been sucked into the they'll just drains out so that is the water from your from your hash all right so then the last step after and how long how long does it take to do that how long do I collect into the drive yeah the dry cycle is usually around 10 to 12 hours okay longer if you've got a large freeze dryer and you're burning it up with a ton of hash if you've got full trains yeah you can easily turn that into 24 hours or so okay okay so then I want to get to the last step because you've given me the whole process I really appreciate you taking the time to do this but the last step is we gotta press it in a rosin press and this is to make you know super high-quality live or awesome am I wrong is that the last step and we just immediately take it out of the freeze dryer and do that or how's that work correct so you know depending on what kind of micron bags you're using ranging from 70 to 90 maybe up to a hundred micron okay first it could actually be full milk so if that's what you prefer you can pull those those microns out for full no and those will typically it's only your first wash that they'll be that they'll be full milk but everything else it can be squished into inter hash frozen just like you mentioned and how many washes do you do out of a bubble teas and bubble bags and the bubble later mmm machine yeah it depends on how much agitation you're getting with with washing machines are getting quite a bit more agitation right 10 or 15 minutes and you can run up to about five washes if you want but at the end at those fourth and fifth maybe even six washes if you're just trying to get everything out they're gonna be the lower quality more contaminated product and you're gonna receive less yield per wash what I'm what type of yield like on a total throughout the six washes you do on like a half pound what type of yields would be looking at so pretty much what most people like to refer to is just to rosin percentage yield so let's say and this is all fresh frozen so good yields would be considered like three to five percent range to rosin off with fresh frozen weight so you just have to run the numbers off that so if it's no 1/2 sorry what was the numbers again just let's do two pounds max is that's 900 grams what can what do we get off that yeah so you do have to remember that's not that's fresh frozen right that's only obvious that's what all the water weight still in the cannabis cheese that's not it dried at all yet so we're gonna have to give all that away and because we'd be correct so yeah if you have two pounds of fresh frozen that would be 900 grams right and let's say you got back a really good yield it's the genetics are good certain really grown you did a good extraction on it let's say to rosin you get three percent yield on that okay so that would be 90 grams yeah it would actually be 27 see why I don't do math with mana right that's why you hold on to the money all right sure all right so 27 grams out of out of okay that's not a 2 pounds of fresh frozen I mean but 2 pounds of fresh frozen Jesus that's gotta be like a half pound to a third of a pound of dried flower yeah yeah approximately they say if I'm not mistaken it's somewhere around you lose about 80% of the weight if I didn't say it I was gonna yes somewhere around eighty percent of the total way around all right all right so I'm thinking this alright so here the reason we were bullshitting is because I'm like alright so if I do this what's my investment you know what's the ROI I just went and bought a gram at the dispensary for $55 for a gram of live resin or like yeah is even live resin not life awesome I do find the rosin have a little bit more flavor I dig them a little bit more I like the consistency too it's easier to dab but um so I'm just thinking if I'm buying $50.00 grams a gram really doesn't last all that long might be cool to have a year's worth of worth of a live rosin hey you got a separate fridge I did some quick math of that 80% water weight chair go away when you dry it right if you if you dried it to that dry weight that's 15 percent of the driveway well which is 15 percent return to live hash rosin that doesn't make sense 15 percent active ingredient on some really Bank bud and and the 85 percent is no material plant material yeah definitely makes sense yeah and I mean you'd be lucky to on a large scale to get that kind of return off of dry pressing flowers and it's not going to be nearly the same quality bubble hash rosin as a rule of thumb is significantly better and quality than flower roses agree with you more Sarah tried both and there's a huge difference yeah yeah exactly all right so come on help me out what's my investment here so I need a freeze dryer first off bubble bags and the bubble later you guys sell them so we actually just started carrying bulk bags okay yeah so we really like those just for the the Frenchy full mil full mesh bags okay I really like those and they've got washing machines as well yeah so what do I got a couple hundred maybe three hundred bucks and a washing machine or some bubble bags yeah yeah you could always depending on the size so you can get down to five gallon right right to about 42 gallon bags [ __ ] as bit larger it's more material so it gets quite a bit more expensive but all in all on bags you don't even need a machine if you don't want to right let me just go with a bucket I with a spoon man my buddy used to make the a locking gank with a wooden spoon brother yeah yeah so you can you can really kick it very primitively and it doesn't take a lot of money to get started it just as you start to scale and trying to do larger and larger amounts to become more efficient that's when it starts costing a little bit extra money sure so we got so we could just end it right there if you want to buy a bubble later bubble machine and some bags or even just some bags and use a five-gallon bucket and some ice you can make really good water hash that way I will tell you the more you beat it the lesser quality is so if you're really gentle with it you can make some dank dabba bull I don't know if it's full milk but it's close whatever is not full melt you can just throw in a hair straightener thrown or press right over you impress that so you could press press that now what if we just want to go there and say hey I'm going to invest a little bit of money for quality and buy a good rosin press help me out I see him for 400 bucks tell me what the difference is between that I don't you see you don't sell no $400 presses do um so so actually how we started our business was that that smaller range I go for three to five hundred dollars just with the cage kids the plate kids at the time everybody was stepping on hair straighteners and everybody was trying to figure out how to scale so they were using the t-shirt presses in there right and then you know just growing up in Kansas and and seeing a lot of these shop presses around I figured why not adapt one of these to a rosin press so that's essentially how we started and the more recently Lucius made the more commercial setups and and higher processing and higher quality systems which are which are the V twos as of currently and so yeah you've got pressure gauges external palms you can operate them through electric means air hand you know they're open source so you choose exactly how you want to apply your force nice yep all right so so if we got a rising press what's it gonna cost us man for a good one yeah for for kind of a beginners home user setup that you wanna you know something that's portable all american-made lifetime warranty I mean the thing is bulletproof it's you know it's gonna last you a lifetime sure how many times is that so up to 20 tons which is 40,000 pounds of force so more force than you ever need but it's nice to have in your back pocket if you ever you know stacking multiple chips and doing a final extraction right what do we press that what's what's the force we press it yeah for the the force for flowers you're looking anywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500 plate and PS I got and platon psi is something that that it takes a small equation to get there but the formulas on our website if you just want to check that out but yeah that's how it breaks down and then for hash awesome you're looking anywhere from 800 to up to 2500 plate psi again got it so it's overkill what you what you're giving them yeah for sure alright and so what's that running come on what's that run my friend prices yeah brother come on DBC price yeah so if you're just if you want to start off with our intro systems those start at 397 that just sticks on any press in your choice this is a really good home user setup but for the more you say press you can go to harbor you're saying like a harbor freight pump or whatever I don't understand what do you mean yes yes that's the actual Harbor Freight brain okay guys so the downside of those is that they're a little bit larger so you may want to set it up and in the garage if you set it up in your living room if you have a girlfriend or wife they're not gonna like it good all right next the exercise bike man you'll be fine I'm sad that's all right so all right so right wow so this is pretty cool so I got a few hundred bucks in the bowl bags for 400 bucks I can get a press so so you telling me a home press yep yep and then if you want to go with something that's a lot more portable you're about ten inches tall you can just throw a bottle jack in those and they're really portable so if you're if you're hopping around from buddies houses to sessions or whatever on it you know you can tote that around with you those start around $1,000 that's shipping and taxes include all right so I'm thinking abut for under a G if I wanted to be a starter for under a G I could start making my own rosin correct yeah yeah you can even make bubble hash rosin for the air thousand bucks yeah and then so here's the big jump man you know me man I always want to go high-end I said I don't always want to go high-end but in my cannabis I do so if I want to go live with then I've got to go with a freeze dryer right mm-hmm yeah yeah so the main advantages of the freeze dryer is to quickly dry your material right so it doesn't leave loose terpenes is that when you lose the terpenes absolutely so if you're just air drying within a room you're also beating the heads up whenever you're doing that aggressive sifting you know that the micro cleaning that I mentioned earlier right so yeah it's a it's just a much better process you're keeping it cold so hence the live rosin aspect your because all you're doing is freezing it and then and then just getting that moisture out pulling a vacuum so while it's cold never really exposed to heat and it's much quicker as well yeah all right but that's a big [ __ ] step up man we're talking another couple grand if I want to get in get into the live business right yeah I'm minimum minimum so the only company that that makes free strives for our industry is gonna be harvest right and they make products ranging from 2,000 up to about 8,000 to like that still is very very very cheap compared to all other freeze drivers on the market because they're like full-on lab great equipment is that what the deal is medical grade stuff it's yeah it's pharmaceutical grade stuffs at it you know most of those machines will start around $30,000 so harvest rights really fulfilled a nice niche in the market for people like us oh very cool very cool although starting a - jeez man damn yeah I get that I get that yeah by the way so what you we were talking about if you don't if you're just drying bubble hash or freeze drying bubble hash guru doesn't let me say drying he gets my own estate but if you just freeze trying to bubble hash you don't need a huge freeze dryer right Yeah right right and so pretty much you've got you've got three different sizes you've got the small the medium and a large been on for most people for most small grows you get away with a smaller a medium I how small is it small so the small is the actual sizes on this guy so it's around a hundred and ten pounds and you can fit approximately two to three wet pounds of bubble hash inside of it no sweat that's a [ __ ] shitload man yeah yeah I mean that dries down to two to a portion of that sure but still yeah I mean that'll fit quite a bit you know that's full trays right yeah you can never make it work all right that soon what seems legit man it seems like okay I'm gonna figure for a solution for a home solution two grand three grants I've got about 3,500 bucks if I want to be in the live business no correct yeah I mean of course you can always hair dry right but yeah you're going to lose the live aspect of the of the rosin but don't make me get my calculator out but if fifty dollars a gram a bit guru could do this one is hit but at fifty dollars a gram how long has it taken it what do you got sixty sixty grams in order to recover that ROI if you're paying fifty dollars a gram at a dispensary you make 60 grams of live live rosin a it's great it be I've got five or six different strains in there and and B I cover my three grant you know I guess a three grand investment you could cover with three grand you don't have to spend in the dispensary anymore what sort of bet you I would spend it you know a couple hundred bucks go to that dispenser every couple weeks man yeah yeah yeah and it makes sense for for home growers for quite a few home growers if you are a heavy smoker or if you're supplying your friends and family that kind of definitely helps yeah definitely if you steal your buddies live rosin and tell them that you'll pay him back yeah yeah I guess still gurus live rosin for the air you know it becomes a prop at that point I love it I love it it cool man all right so I figured some [ __ ] out I appreciate it yeah I just wanted to share with the DG see you and I were texting back and forth yesterday and I was like man let's just do this for the DGC there's some really good information there you pumped it out by the way I really appreciate it Levi right on yeah absolutely and and you know as always we're just trying to put out a lot of information just to help everybody out because I understand it is really overwhelming at first trying to get into solve those expressions so you know we're putting out educational videos on on YouTube and are on our website so you guys are always welcome to try those out they're all free right and your so shout outs oh man where's everybody find it with your YouTube but your website come on yeah so our Instagram is just low temp period plates if you just youtube us it's it's low temp industries or low template so you can find a set either and the websites just low temp - plates com nice nice I appreciate you taking the time brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having me I really like go chat with you guys all right you're right down in Denver you might see me soon he goes out just lonely at a freeze dryer in the lobby and and you might see me soon brother yeah yeah hope to see you sure well man take it easy brother yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] we're the pill to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh he hates the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "W363BWND1Jc": "just a whole bunch of seeds and they grow those so still Pro to a tree or a hope of belief our goal that's achieved just a whole bunch of seeds it's just a whole bunch of seeds and they grow those so still grow to a tree or a hope of a leaf over gold that's achieved just a whole bunch of seeds it's just a whole bunch of seeds give him water and care the sanatory got me walking on there performing actions with intent but an honesty do not really care I'm just a product of an infant it's fair it's getting twisted in here it's getting vivid how the image appears there I hope you're having a wonderful day I hope you got something to smoke along with edibles how do you like to enjoy this plan it's all wonderful my name's Terrence McKenna I'm here with highly active farms and today we have got ourselves packed here a beautiful bowl of some cold water hash or some ice hash as somebody we call it in this video today we're actually gonna be teaching you how to make this exact ice hash that we're smoking here we've gone ahead and filmed the process and made a little tutorial out of it so you can learn how you can make your own cold water hash at home using either sugar trim or buds themselves in this video as you'll see we went ahead and used some sugar trim along with some popcorn ducks but you could use any combination of the two or either or good nugs or whatever you'd like to use and also in this video for this exact - we've gone ahead and used some homegrown organic products it's some Sun ground trainer that we went ahead and use for this so without further ado we're gonna go ahead and a try out this hash here for the first time and then show you how we made it so you can do it yourself at home anyways go ahead and grab your bones you blend your bowls whatever you got your dad rigs because we're gonna go ahead and get medicated right now so uh cheers everybody before I start this video I'm gonna smoke this whole bowl finish it later what is up everyone we are now in the hash making station just made it up off the top my head anyway here's all the materials that you're gonna need for making your own water hash or ice hash you're gonna need the bubble bags I've got a good number of them here I think I've got a 73 micron 25 micron 160 micron 120 micron and a 220 on the top but you could use you don't need to have that many bags just a few bags you need a top bag you can get at least probably three bags to make it work and you want to put basically gonna do is you're gonna put the smallest micron bag on the very bottom the the biggest micron bag in the very top and everything matching in between aside from the bags and the bucket 5 gallon bags 5 gallon bucket you're gonna need about 10 pounds of ice so we try to get 10 pounds of ice here this is the material we're gonna be using this is a mixture of some bud and some trim you could use either bud trim or be sure both make sure it's got a lot of trichomes on it the trichomes we're gonna be breaking up this is what we be using to drag if it be this dry station here this is a 25 micron screen that we use to dry a driveway after and then finishes on the carpet I think you could use parchment paper as well here's the water I'm about the water in a bowl that we're gonna put the bubble bags into I'll show you that later and something to agitate or mix the ice with the campus so either a wooden spoon works about an eggbeater or both people give this is just a simple way doing it anyone can do this [Music] yeah now that we got the materials down like I say they don't need the bags the bucket the product the ice the water the screens to dry the cardboard the parchment paper to dry on and something to mix it with all right so now we are gonna officially go ahead and get started with this also one last thing that I used to be bad ahead and uh you've gotten beat this ice with a hammer basically to make the ice cube smaller this longer that is keeps the better just a little a tip for me anyway so we're gonna go ahead and do now is a we're gonna do layers so it would be layers of ice or ice plant matter I explained it I explained all the reason I'm actually gonna go ahead and put a layer of cannabis first and then ice and ice and then I'll show you what to do from there so this is the productivity this is roughly three ounces have a shame and but yeah so go ahead and start putting a layer down here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the plant matter we're using is a some homegrown Sun grown under percent organic living soil cannabis against the button mature yet some some outdoor homegrown pretty tasty stuff we're told it was a train wreck not too sure about the strain but it's delicious it's Turkey it's good now that we've got the ice in there the next step we're gonna go ahead and do is we're gonna add water on top of this and it's for the water we're not gonna add as much one more ice than water basically so we're gonna add a good amount of water make sure that everything's the plant matters covered but we want more ice and water so you're not gonna fill it up all the way use cold water the reason we use ice and the cold water is to break off the trichomes from the plant matter they're not water soluble but when you freeze them they become brittle and you can break them off trichomes or something like seventy three microns big they're very small that's why we use the bags that are around that size seventy three microns 260 m excellent yeah by freezing them you're able to break them off click the resin heads and those will fall through the screen without the rest of the Titan matter falling through so that's kind of the science - anyway here we go 3 right inside the water and then get to mixing or agitating [Music] mixing this up but first we aren't gonna go ahead and take a hit of that schmuck over there so go ahead and grab your pieces if you got one we dad brings your songs your join six months whatever you got so first I'm gonna go ahead and use the wooden spoon and then I'll come back harder with this eggbeater set to low because you want to agitate it a good amount but you don't want to get break it up too much to start getting plant matter in your butter so we're gonna have to eat it a good amount but again we're trying to pick up the resin heads not really your plan batter through there anyway you go ahead and start with the wooden spoon you want to beat it for about roughly ten minutes maybe preference but five to 15 I think would be a good rule of thumb so what time is it now it's about at 4:30 where we are right now so we're gonna be pissed until that see it'll be until about 4:45 and also the ice will melt obviously over time anyway it's corrected everything all right and then to this on the lowest setting to make sure that we don't uh I can't get too much time at her on her final product anyway here's another zoo if you got your pieces whatever you're using to smoke you're killing to your problems whatever you got go ahead and no shoe booboo with me cuz I'm gonna get boom so without any further ado that's kazoo I guess at this point we're getting more as you did alright now that we've been and got ourselves a little bit more zu do a little bit more medicated we're gonna do again this is responsible we're going to take the eggbeater now to the ice water and plant matter actually we've got next up here a little bit more with the spoon and because I'm using this water over here for a Schmidt anyway and again this is pure water if you want to as best you can use pure water because you don't want all the chlorine or wherever the particulates that are in tap water to get into your final product so you think you a lot is a good idea this is just RO water reverse osmosis whatever you can do to get your water as pure as possible anyway we got this ready now we're going to put this on the lowest setting and start agitating this a little bit more I'm gonna move it a little closer to the outfit and let's go ahead and get started [Music] so let's see it's been in here a little more roughly 18 minutes now which is a good amount of time for the amputation process all right now I'm gonna go ahead and begin the next part of the process so we've got ahead mix everything together so I'll agitated the track thumb should be broken off we're going to go ahead and take out this first bag good shade and let it drain part of it basically you want to let that whole mixture that you just made fall right on through there this first bag is 220 microns it'll just collect a really big once this is done all right so we have gone ahead and hung that first bag that contains all the plant matter and everything that we mixed we've taken that out we've let it drain as much as we can over the rest of the bags it takes a while to do that you just kind of have patience and just let it drift as long as you can it'll slowly keep dripping because there's ice but once it's once it's really just slowly dripping go ahead and put it over and this is a great idea that the camera lady just had but we went ahead and hung it over hey sorry about that we ran out of space on the camera but yeah you're gonna go ahead and hang the first bag over the same water that you were using to pour into the hash bags and then after that go ahead and grab yourself a spoon and get ready to make some beautiful hash alright back to the video sorry the granite is facing the camera there we went ahead and made more so yeah you're gonna go ahead and just take the spoon and scrape it off into this 25 micron drying screen fold it over give it a nice little pitcher so again this is the most green product the lowest grade you could say even put it on the air you know this one doesn't have ice and stuff even though she's not a dripping wet this is the 120 micron bag you can see right there these guys are from the bubble bag bag I put it here again on the giant screen so we've gone ahead and uh taking our next grade of hash this is the 120 mi kry - Dan folded it over I give you a little quick dry before we scrape that up like a cardboard so it's easy to kick we're going to go ahead and put this here so this is a different grade of hashim divide and separate it if you want to if you really like to uh keep him separate some people like to thank all the hash in the end and put it together here's somebody who would rather keep it separate all so he could come back at the spoon off my bad if you're somebody who likes to separate your grades of hash go ahead and write the microns here this is the 160 micron and this is the 120 those two are pretty similar so usually you'll have wine or not the other I could maybe even take out the 160 anyway we're to go ahead and move on to the next grade of hash now make sure [Music] [Music] there's not usually something now when you go ahead and go to a next grade of hash this is my personal favorite creative hash actually this one here as you can see is these 73 microns so if I'm not mistaken this one is kind of the one that's supposed to catch a lot of the resonance and it looks like you've got a lot in here to you maybe I just prepare the others you can see you down there you could see it we already see with lighting right now but I'm going to slowly bring her up so this is the 73 micron bag it'll catch anything bigger than 73 microns but because you've got the 120 this attaches between 120 73 microns anything's falling 70 microns later through the next bag but as you can see there's a good amount here and this is a better coloring from the other stuff very good looking all that you might think scrape this just like we did the rest and you're good do the same thing I'm gonna take this again look at the color on that it's nicely color - put it on to the put it onto the 25 micron screen and we're gonna fold it over give it a quick track quick tiny little bit of a price as well usually especially with moisture the cardboard really helps collect the moisture is that why we put it on there too I'm just fine fine - smells wonderful - so as you can see here this is our 73 micron ash this is the 120 this is the 160 so it has 73 micron not only is it the highest quality but it tends to have the highest yield to really go ahead and collect the smallest one this one is the 25 micron screen same size as the screen opening I'm a little shaky on the exact science of this but it's my understanding that 25 microns in some places could even be too small for the air some of the trichome heads so I don't know if this will be the highest grade or up to 73 microns real but uh as this is starting to the finish filtering it looks like it's got a good amount in here and it doesn't look bad the quality does not look bad here but again I'm not sure if this is actually higher quality than the 70 micron but I'm happy to see that there's a good amount in here if you can get that in the light Wow look at that a good amount of hash and it's powered up nicely it should be easy to scoop so I'm a little fuzzy as to whether this is actually better quality but the the cover looks nice it's definitely better quality than 120 micron then there's 60 micron and this is collecting between 25 and 73 microns so it should be pretty good quality this might be the highest quality it looks to be later loud-ass be being done with a hater now it's time for me I'm coming better know we're just down to the street with this part in the whip laying down that B then we started the spin and it sounded me we was all getting late getting lost in the are on their feet never turns out that's me coming up with the Crouch does slow slow growth to a tree over hope the belief over gold that's achieved as the whole but you see it's just a hole that you see it's just a hole but you see just see", "kBu2G1-upTU": "okay so if they were making hash bricks have two bowls 47 grams of Bruce Banner keep two bowls of 45 grams gold and ice aluminum brick and a couple of these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it guys and won't you tell the folks who you are I'm Josh I'm the processor here tops off campus for a little while longer this is my keys my process hey guys I'm Mike thanks for watching if you like to see please like share and subscribe we love you Josh", "2oAAoRWXYDA": "[Music] hi friends it's sasha welcome back to my channel i have my friend adriana here again today actually since you last saw her she created her own youtube channel so we're gonna link that down below and i'll say at the beginning of the video there will be a part two to this so we're doing i mean i guess it's kind of diy dabs since we're doing the part two it is because we're making hash today we're gonna make bubble hash we got the bubble bags freeze pipe is actually sponsoring this video we have one of their little bubblers right here and they were kind enough to send over the bubble bags and adriana brought her just like a little setup yeah i'm glad i have your support for this because it would be a show without it yeah we'll make it work um but yeah we're gonna do a part two on her channel and we are going to take our bubble hash and then we are going to press it and make rosin with it so that will be really fun we're going to take a hit to start off this video and then we're probably going to be outside because it's best to work in the colder times a little bit cooler yeah yeah but it's like really warm 53 i think it said yeah something like that it was like 30 yesterday so ideally it should be anywhere from like 35 to 40. yeah it's okay we'll deal with it honestly the sun is setting so it's only gonna get colder i know it's perfect fine all right well cheers cheers oh i just realized i'm christening this piece it's a new one this one too i haven't tried this one oh you didn't try that one last time i tried the um rainbow yeah i didn't leave it in the freezer for that long but it's still like cool nice and cold mm-hmm there's one one more i love that our videos end up being like either nature or crafty that's what it's been so far i love making stuff mm-hmm really i appreciate that it's fun besides my other big passion is pottery i love crafting oh that's right i can't draw fur yeah but i just can't do two-dimensional stuff but when i can sculpt something yeah i love it i have so much fun that's really this is kind of creating something yeah definitely all right i guess this video might be kind of vloggish styled we're just going to like roll with it and see what happens but i guess we shall bring everything outside get set up yes all right we are setting up i just like the bags and the little stirrers in there but we have this five gallon bucket there's ice in the cooler we lucked out her uncle has an ice machine so we didn't have to go out and buy any saved our butts and then adriana actually brought over so it's a five gallon and a seven gallon bucket but the bottom of the five gallon bucket is cut off and i was telling her how i helped a friend make bubble hash and we literally like were sitting there holding the bags waiting for them to drain they were so heavy it was crazy whereas this method the bags aren't like sitting in the water at the bottom of the bucket they're just kind of suspended above it so that just kind of does that whole process for you and so what we're going to do is we're going to start with the lowest number micron bag and we're gonna start layering them um lowest to highest perfect here look at this setup so i can help you so we're gonna do all of them right yeah we'll do all of them just to try it out do you um have water outside i wonder how the i can do it inside i can go fill it up inside and then just bring it outside yeah inside might be better just because i don't know if the pipes are frozen still from like uh yeah i wouldn't trust him you know [Applause] so i got those all on they're nice they're there yeah so what i'm doing is just making some thin layers of ice ice and then i love that word [Music] [Applause] all right oh also adriana brought a sprayer yeah she's official that's gonna come in handy when we're trying to spray the hash off the sides oh yep i feel bad i'm just like standing here watching her freeze her little hands off no honestly honestly it's gonna be funny because one of us are gonna be standing here again stoned and the other one of us going to be standing here stirring yeah we're just going to swap yeah yeah okay just expensive have some bubble hash all right we're getting towards the top all right now we've got all the weeds in there and then we've got layers of ice in between them as we kind of explained do you have any estimate of how much blood is probably in here it is like trim larva like they're really small buds but probably like a quarter pound if that like four ounces yeah okay nice um we're gonna go put water in it and let it sit for like a couple of minutes cool now it would be just as easy to do this on a smaller scale what do you think is like the minimum quantity someone should people first it's different because if you want like a personal head stash this is what i would suggest like a five gallon but um to test out like how well different strains react to being washed yeah people do it in a mason jar whoa so that's cool something as small as like a liter yeah mason jar you can shake it up and do a mini version of this all right cool just want to give people some things to do yeah sometimes like sometimes when you're washing certain strains will be oilier than others and it just won't the trichome hood won't break off as nicely as other strands yeah so it makes sense it depends hi we're back indoors so what i'm looking for right now is a certain motion and you'll see it when it happens see oh yeah okay we're like everything almost stays in place when you move the bucket in a sense it's like genuinely a workout there's no idea that's why i said we're gonna be switching at one point i'm gonna be like sasha no i wanna help all right i think beautiful cool how long do we let the weeds sit in the water we can let it sit for another like two or three minutes okay and then you start stirring for would you say ten minutes yep we're going to put an alarm on for 10 minutes and then that'll be the first wash i want to go like this there you go hi baby [Music] yeah you look much better i love this jacket because the pockets instead of being like the same material as the outside it's like fuzzy on the inside i don't know what else is in there oh yeah it's like sweetie yeah mine's like straight up fleece oh yeah that keeps your hands so much warmer though it's like wearing gloves all right the alarm went off so oh it's time to start let me know when to tap in oh guys a lot of help [Applause] so weird being out here when there's no roof on the thing oh yeah i know so i kind of like to create a vortex motion kind of like a wash or wood yeah some people say washing it in different ways like this almost like switching it up yeah i'm someone who like just has my experiences to go off of you know yeah exactly and what i've learned from other people along the way you want me to feed you a giant now do you want to try and like almost get low or just kind of keep pushing i believe if you get the vortex motion going it's all going i have to like adjust how i'm holding it because my nails are so long that they're like digging into my skin i have really long nails right now i'm going to be like why is my forearm so sore you ever do that just like yep to kind of get the corners and yeah and like the stuff that's been sitting on top for a while mixed in there yep that's why those flatter ones are good to like get the pictures yeah you really don't want to fill up a bucket any more than that though yeah [Applause] like the nice i'm not not calling you strong but i'm not strong but people who can like do the vortex for like 10 straight minutes sometimes it like builds all the way up to the top like if you try to go really fast see how it feels yeah and as the ice melts too it'll get a little yeah easier now if you have a mason jar you just like literally just shake it yep oh cool and then you'll see i've never done it that way i've seen it people do it that way um like on videos and stuff i do believe you have to put a culture on top of sorts okay actual glass container but um i know you can find videos and do that but yeah it just shows like real quick the separation we missed 420. we said we weren't going to and we did there you go here i'll go here i'll take [Applause] over you're gonna watch some footage here of me struggling with a lighter burp actually oh you're going faster than i was oops you can start see the bubble yeah you can start like agitating it a little bit more afterwards oh okay oh it's probably especially now the ice is melted too yeah and you can actually like do another wash with this too okay and aggravate it even more one minute you can try to finish it out do you want to come on yeah sure okay good yeah all right we do need a spoon that's the last thing i forgot okay um [Music] put the spoons in there this is where we use that thing our sprayer oh the sprayer i was like what thing you know that thing over there the only other thing that's really out here does it help to have a second person like squeeze the bag or is that really second person really comes in handy when you're stirring like yeah get tired this can be used for a second wash too so you can like oh cool empty this right back in the excess water that's left after this two you can use oh wow yeah that's cool all right so let's put that in for now the 160 oh yeah that's right it goes backwards this part's fun oh okay spraying the edges yep perfect nice that seems like a success so far do you want me to hold the bag i'm sure if you want to hold it open so the class is probably helping you too actually just thinking that i was like wow this looks so much better on camera and i was like wait it probably looks so much better in person too orange bag okay let's do it real quick so this is gonna be probably our highlight highest cool okay marshmallow jacket all right ready i'm gonna hold it from this corner yeah do you prefer me to just that's okay you can record it i got it the color looks all like wonky because of the yellow this looks cool that's a decent color [Music] a little bit darker and taller than easily desired but beautiful oh it's actually we should collect that we should go like that it's like muddy water i might actually be able to microplane that tonight oh yeah yeah that's real nice consistency all right um i'm tapping out yeah good this is awesome look at that all right we are already replacing the paper towels that were underneath this little mesh thing so if you don't have one of these you just use parchment paper for this or you like need one of these i suggest you grab one of these okay comes like in a five pack on amazon for okay for wicked cheap and it's just a 25 micron little sheet cloth whatever yeah um we can use parchment paper after we microplane it okay um that i personally haven't used it but maybe you can i just don't know personally yeah this volume oh yeah that's nice i'm impressed look at us yeah it's gonna be even more exciting when you take the dab yeah i'm excited i'll probably put some on a bowl do you think i could put some on of course we can oh yeah how soon hell yeah dude we can do whatever we want we can do it right now i mean it's there's definitely going to be more yeah yeah yeah if you want to just say like yolo like let's do it all right expect a little snap crackle pop yeah we'll use the first one that we don't seem to be the driest right okay that one is right there he's back in there if you guys hear voices in the background brendan's playing games with his friends and talking about microphones i think okay so we're gonna try and smoke some of it normally you wouldn't do it this fast we want to try a little bit before she leaves but yeah the fun of it we'll get together like within the next week and a half i would say and make that hash and it'll be really really fun to dab that um and we'll probably do that like i said over on adriana's channel so let me finish this and then oh hi cat so i don't think i'm sure a lot of you have seen my videos the freeze pipe before but i didn't kind of mention that this top part uh detaches and you can put it in your freezer because there's glycerin in there and then it makes your hits extra cool it's still pretty cold because we had it outside for so long yeah like it's still really cold well the smoke looks so cool yeah oh my god it does do you follow hippie hey hippie hi his name's cassidy um she does these really cool story posts of standing behind her ring light and like sticking her bong through it so you're not like looney tunes how the thing pops through the circle at the end like that's almost like how she's hitting her bong and the smoke looks so freaking cool like it's insane ed tell me it's not better okay so we've gotten like a bunch of inside jokes on my streaming from him like randomly yelling things and like we can hear it like one time he was playing a game with his friends and he yelled what a goal and like yeah this was like almost a year ago i want to say and people in my chat still say it they'll just normally go whoa don't stare i think it's more of like the looking up kind of like it's supposed to be good for some reason i feel like i heard that about hiccups like if you put your head all the way back you know what works for me for hiccups every time every time all right i'll have to try that next time please do document it i i will i will um because i get hiccups bad sometimes where i get like pain yeah i get like my collar bones because they last yes so long i get mad what the here we go i'm paying you back for that time that maybe that all right there you go so if you just like one corner i don't know he's good all right let's see how this goes all right we have a bunch of just okay i don't want to say wet but pretty wet bubbles [Music] look at that we all just figured out each other's spices dude i'm not kidding i think we all were just too loud you could see it bubbling in the beginning because yeah that's so cool oh i can definitely taste it it's like i should put flour in it but i got like a vaporized yeah there's a little bit more flour in here i think oh it's too late you're gonna have to clean that i'm sorry i'm not using it oh my god it's great it kind of melts it all in there a little bit try this one and the reason it is sparking which is probably obvious for most of you um is because of the moisture that's still in there it gives you a little sizzle oh god it's honestly like that my throat is more successful hey you're like i'm done sounds good are you good i'm great thank you for having me good morning thanks again for just being in another video we're gonna i don't know maybe do more diy-ish sort of things a little more i feel like i have to talk extra lab because brendan's playing games with his friends but um yeah i'll have adriana's channel linked down below i'll have freeze pipes instagram links down below and i will definitely see oh wait no i won't see you guys soon actually that's right so this video is going up in the third what did i say wednesday yeah wednesday the 30th before the end of yep and then i'm

juiced i'm [ __ ] like i'm geeked i'm ready because first time ever tier one water hash from 710 tier [ __ ] one first i just gotta say that i've only ever seen tier one on their photos and it just looks like hashi grains of sand and it just looks so nice and tasty bro and it is absolutely beautiful and smells just like the strength and we have let me just show you we got the unquestionably og crossed with the wedding cake and if you guys have ever tried the 710 wedding cake it is some gas i've actually tried the percy rosin of it and it is [ __ ] amazing now let me tell you guys this is something else like i swear this is something else i am so i'm pumped because i've never had as you guys can see right there tier one we've only ever had like one or two tier one items ever which was full spectrum hash i mean of course percy also counts because i believe percy's are tier one and two only but that i know of this is the second or third tier one item we have and i'm just ready for this [ __ ] i hope you guys are ready to pizza [ __ ] if you guys ever see some tier one water hash get that [ __ ] especially from this company surprised it came in in a white container because normally you know black box black container but i prefer the white ones now are y'all ready questionable yogi tier one and there it is oh my god see what i mean by it looks like hashy grains of sand but just look at how beautiful it looks like sand crystals bro look at this you see that look at that where do you see waterhouse of this quality are level nowhere but 7 10. [ __ ] i [ __ ] love 710 and quite frankly i've had water hatch from other companies but none do it like this like none can satisfy you like when you take a dab of something like this like first of all i smell nothing but og i do smell a slight like other scent you know that being the wedding cake but this is unquestionably some emoji just like the [ __ ] name of the of the [ __ ] strain says i kid you not i kid you not that this [ __ ] is smelly like look at it bro this is some gas all right y'all that's what i'm taking cheers wow i gotta say wow definitely the og overpower this one unbelievable wow i'm so high that was such a beautiful i love hash that was that [ __ ] was unbelievable oh my god i'm not going to tell you that i'm i'm spacing out i'm [ __ ] loaded hey this is nice like okay so if you guys have been sticking in lately and you saw the last video that i did which was i believe the last one i did oh not not the last video but the one prior i did a video of a tree review and it was called humanity og and i was saying how i haven't had some straight og flavor like that in a long time well i have been blessed because this hash taste first of all the hash itself tastes earthy like if you guys ever have hash do you guys ever taste how it tastes like a little more earthy um pioneer like you know a little more like you know like dirt like i don't know how to explain it but hash has like a earthy delicious taste that you it has more of a plant-like taste and also the smell of when you're burning it it smells more like the plant have you got noticed that and that's why i think hatch is so much better because it has i feel like more of a plant like taste from it anyway back to the point of that hash flavor with this insane unquestionably ogn wedding cake like i said the it was unquestionably the og that took the flavor in this straight in this hash combo and i must say i am so happy and i'm so high i feel relieved what it's supposed to do because real kush real og is a hybrid indica dominant but it's a hybrid and right now i feel great all right we're back i had to change the fit real quick you feel me the other day we're about to take you see how big it is that's what she said that's what i told to be cheers and i welcome my dad i must i'm gonna say wow i kind of do know how it tastes like and then this one i did taste it but i still think that the og dominates or maybe it's a good blend because the wedding cake itself is pretty you know pretty potent pretty strong so maybe it's just it enhanced the og i don't know but it is gas and i am hella high all right y'all i'm about i gotta get going though shout out to everybody in the world court that is now part of the royal family i appreciate you all and i'll see you again in the next video", "9DJ3hRZBgTQ": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome back to another live stream it is time to do it do what dab [ __ ] so get your dab rigs out get your rosin ready if you're not smoking rosin i don't know what you're smoking but uh as long as it's not bh no that's okay let's take some dabs we get some music going here i downloaded the [ __ ] tj [ __ ] but i guess i did it oh oh

no i was [ __ ] i just got a shower and i was like brushing it i put in some stain conditioner and [ __ ] and my [ __ ] my wife was like she said it like three times she was like if you want me to do that just let me know and i'm like you just want to play with my hair huh and she's like no no no i just you know i don't want you to be in pain you know brushing through it if you want me to do it i

put in a little bun showering and streaming totally different uh all right let's get uh let's get this [ __ ] going um let's check on the amount of ice that we've got in the reservoir we'll see if we need to top it off i'm pretty sure we're going to go ahead and top it off with some more ice probably two more 20 gallon reservoirs full of ice which is i don't know i haven't waited i'm guessing when i fill up that trash can it's approximately 60 to 80 pounds of ice based on like when i have 20 pound bags of ice i'm just guessing you know probably about 60 to 80 pounds so i'm gonna add another 150 or so pounds of ice and then yeah we'll go ahead and get the bud and the bags and finish prepping the rest of that [ __ ] san bueno [Music] what's up cv [Music] [Music] ready to wake yeah [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i fill this thing up almost all the way right and i do this i put about four to five of these in there just when i start the water then it gets to where you see it right now where a lot of the ice is melted the water is really cold but it's not full and i add a couple more and we're cranking the ac at 62. ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] looking at the movies [Music] [Music] we pray to god [Applause] got that all the way open we got the booster pump on i think yeah the booster pump is plugged in out there [Music] we don't have any other pumps or anything on so that should fill up the rest of the way pretty quick and be nice and frosty [Music] [Applause] do i have enough to start a wash sure i'm sure [Music] now you're gonna have to excuse my mess i've been trimming in here so i don't want to hear no [ __ ] but you know me i'm transferring i show it make sure this valve is closed back here we're gonna go ahead and fire up the freeze dryer and pull the trays we're gonna clean the trays and then um [Music] me [Music] alcohol [Music] and then i'm gonna go ahead and [Music] hit my seal with a little bit of iso sometimes when you collect the uh the higher micron stuff that's fluffier and you go up the uh the freeze dryer you'll get a little bit of um almost like backdraft sort of it's basically just a lighter fluffier ash and it wants to go towards the uh the vacuum the vacuum cloth and so it'll cause a little bit of the hash to stir up and so every once in a while if that happens you gotta wipe out the hatch from wherever it flies onto most of the time it just goes to the seal so you just wipe it off the inner part of the seal a little bit of alcohol every once in a while you'll get some that builds up in the shelves you can take the whole seal off the door wipe it down you can pull the shelving unit out of the whole pretty much freeze dryer chamber if you want and you can vacuum it out you can wipe it out [Music] i'll be doing a uh a little bit of a maintenance video on the freeze dryer um here in about a month [Music] during that time i'll show you guys how to disassemble the freeze dryer and inspect it in certain areas for certain things and then how to clean it and put it back together [Music] so i'm just hitting my seal that the door forms a really good seal and you make sure that you get into one vacuum [Music] and there we go [Music] take my cover off we'll put the cover back on a little bit [Music] come on [ __ ] get on there right thank you okay [Music] lagging huh [Music] close out some of this [ __ ] i got open on my phone holy moly i had a lot of [ __ ] open [Music] better all right so now i'm gonna just flip the freeze dryer on it turns on and it says updating log files and blah blah during that time if you have a thumb stick in the um side of the freeze dryer or whatever it will go ahead and update the log files that you have on the thumbstick [Music] sit sit we're going to have that [ __ ] unplugged i'm going to put it back in real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i just noticed there is no slaps unacceptable i'm tired of seeing everybody else's slapped up [ __ ] freeze dryers sorry my man puffin i love you bro but i'm not putting your sticker on my freeze dryer it's too [ __ ] big send me another small one and i'll put it on there but i am not sticking that big ass

puffin ones too big sorry buddy boy i thought i had a smaller puffin sticker somewhere i guess not first and foremost the first one that has to go on has to be this one now where do we put this one [Music] hmm right there you feeling that [Music] my yield just went up five percent [Music] hmm and this one up here down here do we want them close to each other yeah we do yeah we do [Music] my yield just went up another two and a half percent and my freeze dryer got about 10 extra [Music] horsepower [Music] and my terps just went up 50 percent yield yield terps slap some [ __ ] slaps on your freeze dryer step your yields up step your terps up no cap [Music] let go i know i have another puffin sticker somewhere around here that was it i think it's in the house i think my daughter has

ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]", "XxGG8gjlOb8": "this is watch number two as you see larry ain't never been near a lab she doesn't know writing down sops but this is a very interesting uh first second one second run second run on the first try more [Music] accurately we might as well just have that hose now you know why you did that hose to nowhere so what do you think one more again do you think jim's stuff is heavy in keith i don't know what jim stuff is about to find out we're fitting to find out all right well here here we go again [Music] the second time around you want to watch that rank it's over there you got it soaking wet", "PtKmqC4Fpjk": "[Music] hello everybody this is Dutchman 420 as you see I am getting ready to on a run of bubble hash if you wonder what these divided or bucket things are this is called the Frenchie cannoli style of making water hash or ice water hash each divider has a separate bag this is the longest divider takes the 25 which is the bottom bag I like to use a 45 bag if you're doing Frenchie can always stop this is a catch bag for the hash that he usually uses and I like to put a 90 on and then on top of that a 73 and then I put my 220 bag the one that everyone sticks in the machine with the weed I put that on top so when I pour my mixture through that catches all my nugs because I put my notes directly in the machine one other thing I notice where mister Conoco is making hash they give you the shitty accordion hose that comes with the machine you get rid ditch that [ __ ] [ __ ] man and get yourself a real hose with an elbow and a plug and then you don't have that water shooting up a hoods every time it's spinning around Plus trichomes got caught in that accordion too that they give you so you end up losing material in there so first thing I did was modify my washing machine and you don't need to buy one from bubble bag dudes like he did you just buy a cost wave washer or one of those cheap $50 washers on Amazon or Ebay and modify it you don't need a little bubble bag dude thing on here I can put dutchman for 20 washers and sell them I'll sew him for 75 and blow bubble bag dude away because all he did was buy Chinese washing machine and stick bubble bag dude on there so anyway let's get busy and make some fine grade French you can always style bubble hash yup we got our buckets all lined up we are ready to start all right here's some of my starting material it's some of that okay blower nugs and [ __ ] like that and it's not the greatest quality it's not a giant [ __ ] pound bag if we eat like mr. Kuhn okay one thing else I don't do is I do not put my material in the freezer what is the use of putting your material in the freezer if you just stick it in ice water bath because all that's gonna do is just thaw the material out and when you're doing your third we'll wash it's just gonna turn to mush this material will hold up much better in the in the water and the ice for more washes than if you freeze it freezing it serves no purpose unless maybe you're gonna dry sieve it or something I don't know but freezing it is not a smart idea so don't freeze it and don't not catch everything in one bucket use a catch vessel underneath let the water flow through the buckets with each divider on and that'll eat in the civic process what it does it swirls around through each divider bucket and settles down much better than if it's just one pool of water and all the bags are stacked on top of each other and then you just pull up out of the pool this runs through and all the waste water goes to the bottom and then I just don't piss out and by the way I do save well I don't even use a one ninety bag I the tallest bag or the highest number of bag I use is the ninety and then of course the t20 so really that's nineties got to go here in the seventy three goes here sorry about that I just woke up but uh so cuz ninety seventy three forty five twenty five and then the buckets stack on top of it themselves accordingly and then of course 220 that I've just put on top to catch all the nuts coming out of the machine because I put my raw material in width of ice and water I do not use one of those bags that bounce around in the machine you lose product in those and you cannot properly caress the trichomes off of the nugs if they're trapped in a enclosed area the water cannot circulate properly basically all your notes are doing or bouncing around in the bag and you don't want that so let's get started now what I do is I just slip this over the bucket and I'll make it so that it's not sagging down to the bottom so that I can this is not touching the table then what you do is put your you don't want to do it too tight if you get this like so it feels like it's gonna rip you want to pull and loosen some of the material but as you see this is a much better sitting area it's flat the water can pass through and catch the trichomes and go to the next screen then what I do is I put my bag on here there we go and repeat the process and then when you put this divider bucket in same thing creates a nice area to sieve at your trichomes this is the Frenchy cannoli method and yes it is very time consuming it's helpful to have two sets of bags I like these full mesh bubble bags from bubble bag dude they're pretty cheap and it comes with a 45 bag which is the most important part to me because this is my money bag right here this is the [ __ ] that gets the best hash the 4525 has a bunch of contaminants and [ __ ] in it even though you'll get a lot in it Frenchy cannoli gives that a way to concentrate makers and [ __ ] like that make tabs or he probably trades them for nugs or something I don't know if he just gives it away in any way that is the divider buckets all right I just looked at that look at birds man that is a nice run there man this is the gold bag this is my money bag my 45 and this [ __ ] wasn't even cold [Music] that is a nice pull for a [ __ ] second there second runs always way bigger than the first but I mean generally when I do runs I'll do about five to six I watched I don't see anything else coming out but uh here's the 73 but this is a sick [ __ ] 45 pull here man - all right so here's what we got from the 73 it's a little wax here looking a little lighter and the 90 now just a little note if you have a grinder and it has a chief collection thing in the bottom basically what's in the bottom of this grinder is the same thing that I'm collecting up from this machine more or less I'm not sure what Mike on screen this is on the bottom but this is what they called dry seven when you do this because what you're doing is agitating the material and letting the smaller trichomes fall to that screen that's in the bottom of this behind er so the screen acts as a sieve and then the kief goes into the bottom so depending on what micron screen this is in the bottom of this grinder this is the grade of resin head that I have collected here and yes you can take this stuff and press it into a shish I've done it before works very well I'll show you or you can check out my video pressing resin heads into hashish I think I made one about a month ago or so but uh anyway just an interesting fact let's keep on trucking all right so I've run out I so I'm gonna go run to the store and get a 20 pound bag or so maybe two and [ __ ] come back and run batch three or run three through here cuz I gotta at least wash it three or four times you know so there's oh we got on a second run I did label it looks like the 45 is really what I'm getting the most 90 and 45 or the two biggest yielders in the 45 I am very happy about getting the most out of that because that is the best [ __ ] if you ever watch any Frenchie cannoli videos whenever he's pulling that [ __ ] out and scraping that giant pile up you noticed the bag it's white so 45 bag people anyway let me go get my ice and I will be right back well here's what I got out of six seven runs I did I press the 45 273 the 25 and the 90 and separate chunks I think this is a 90 that's the 25 it might have some mixture some other [ __ ] as you can see and it's exactly good uniform but the 90 and the [Applause] 4573 don't look too bad either I think as I watched I try to get more and more contaminants in the 25 and that's why it looks like it does but it'll smoke they don't show up that's it I got six grains 6.01 six I'm like that seems to be disappearing right in front of me", "UwwitbTOJGE": "a Florida medical marijuana patients what's happenin this is Florida medical marijuana reviews coming at you with the review for the subra melt from fluent subra is there strain of Sour Diesel it is super delicious it almost had like a lemony sour taste towards the end of it this last week about having it and I say that because it's changed but this was it in the beginning it had a very grainy sandy texture not many of the glands had come to like a clear coat covering you know where they've connected and become one okay but then later on after having it out for so long and having smoked it the thing the melt has is oxidized I believe is what the man told me would have happened and that's where the glands have come together it's changing in its flavor it's changed in consistency a little bit it's always actually been pasty and tough to work with you definitely want a sharper tool to use this stuff I had to definitely go out and pick something else up because my little pinpoint dab tools were not going to give me what I wanted to medicate with this is a super delicious product but for a hundred dollars I cannot guarantee you that you're going to feel more medicated from this or better medicated from this than other things such as flour or cheaper concentrates that other dispensaries have it's delicious it's great I mean I've thoroughly enjoyed it but again at a hundred dollars a gram that is for the connoisseur I do not want to say that every first time that we should go out and get this stuff because it's better and because you're paying the higher price it's going to medicate you better it's not now this is a good looking to show you how the consistency of this product really is it is a hard magic sand paste consistency and you almost need that sharp edge to almost cut this pasty dab off it's super delicious but it is going to leave a lot more residue in your dab products and on your tools and in your bowls just FYI so with this product what I'm suggesting is you definitely need to keep alcohol at hand isopropyl alcohol 91% or above so you can keep your dab tools clean so you're not bringing this ashy gunk back into your gram and keeping that up here see how much it can create I did that at a high temp to show you how much burns off its actual plant material and you're going to need a higher micron bag from fluent for them to get less plant material in their product to create an even better ice water hash essentially thanks again for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews", "b4SgvzWTHmA": "yo sup guys we out here chillin pressing some cold water hash it's not the prettiest color but it's cool

start off by thanking space jam for giving me an opportunity to try out their cannabis infused edibles this is my first time reviewing an edible on my channel so this is pretty dope this ain't your usual edible this one is made with single source ice water hash super innovative i know there's only a few companies doing that single source meaning there's no distillate no no crazy additives so everything's pretty much vegan on this ingredients on here is sugar tapioca fruit pectin coconut oil um single source ice water hash citric acid real fruit plant and herb extracts and sunflower oil 2 grams of sugar and like i said yeah that ice water hatch looking forward to that this one comes with 10 pieces i hear for beginners you'll be good with like half or like a full one 100 milligrams per uh package meaning there's 10 milligrams per piece so right now i'll go ahead and pop like two we'll try out two so comes in this very dope case they range from 20 to 25 but check this out this is that new stuff comes with their little uh package here if you're looking for the end of the rainbow stop you just found it pretty cool there you go the gummies 10 pieces um i'll go ahead and put their website on the description so you can check them out very tasty mmm that tastes good i didn't taste no herb no no wheat flavor in there sometimes you know how it gets overpowering this was just straight sour gummy very tasty very tasty and it's vegan so that's pretty dope all the ingredients are in the bag so i just ate 10 milligrams each one has one milligram of cbd so i'll go ahead and take the second one here keep in mind i haven't smoked or dabbed had nothing thc related in my body this whole morning i am on the empty stomach so i want to see the effect and feel it so we bought two of them and um looking forward to see how i feel super dope packaging save some for later i guess i'll be back in a couple hours and let you guys know all right y'all so i'm back a couple hours in i ended up eating three gummies of the space jam out of both with that uh infused hash you know um feeling pretty good i didn't smoke no flour didn't take no dabs wanna just see how it feels i don't eat that many edibles because i'm always iffy to see if it's gonna hit just as good or i'm just like more conscious about what what they're using in the product you know so this company was pretty transparent on the ingredients and again the fact that it uses single source ice water hash is just a big pointer so yeah i feel good very mellow very chill you're not gonna feel blazed you know i mean you're not smoking trees but i feel very good very relaxed my body is on chill mode my mind feels just at ease my anxiety levels are low so it's doing its effects it's doing what it does you know with the cbd in there too so i'm chilling you know even my wife she doesn't smoke or medicate that much no more but she ended up trying one and uh she straight told me she felt good like she felt very relaxed you know so i got her feedback on it and she gave me a thumbs up and um yeah as far as that goes i just think space gym company is up to sun very dope flavor was good um i'll definitely get some more you know just to be on the go if i'm not smoking or dabbing so yeah pretty good edibles feeling very chill very smooth very smooth it's a whole different feel took like not even an hour to feel like oh okay i feel the effects in my stomach you know because i got to chill pick myself up real quick and cleaned up and then i was like yo i'm i'm chilling so yeah for sure good stuff i recommend them check them out you won't be disappointed i'm chilling so uh yeah if you want to feel real good on some edibles give them a try all right thank you guys for watching until then peace", "lDkq0m3eUiQ": "today I'm going to be making some ice water hash trying to make a video I don't have any attempts I've made it making this video but something always happens the phone rings and the camera stops working or I push the wrong button or whatever but hopefully today it's gonna happen even if I have to make this thing in three parts a time I get done so anyway maybe using bubble bags or ice water extraction bags they have a mesh screen on the bottom and some pretty tough fabric on the side they're numbered listen to number 160 the higher the number the bigger the hole the bigger the opening here so anyway we start off with a high number and we work our way down hmmm this is a little panty washers one actually came from bubble man from the same company that makes the bubble bags so you have a legit ATAR in the bottom and a strainer here in the back and then your discharge tube is over here on the side it's clipped on there's no valve down there you know when when the waters above the end of that hose it comes out the end so then we've got some paper towels here you don't need this paper plate and that's gonna be to dab the bottom of our bag on with the hash inside to get some water out of it you know I've got a bucket of ice got a ten pound block of ice in there chilling that's what I'm gonna use to put the water that's what I'm going to use to put in with my ice and cannabis that's just a couple extra bags I'm not using and by the way I'm not using a bag inside here it's just going to be loose cannabis so there's two ways of doing it you have somewhere you have put your cannabis inside of a bag that's made out of material like this and the micron size is usually like around 220 which is your work bag size which I don't have my banging down here right now but I prefer to just put it in there and I think that it it does works better though that I usually just do it by hand mix it with different types of paddles I've got a golf club putter I use anyway if you get through water outdoors run your faucet for a little while case there's any bugs or debris inside of it and we're so runs clean before you put it make sure all your buckets are clean and you look down inside your bag to make sure they're all clean as you're working with them and putting them in here and so what I've got here on the bottom is just a regular five-gallon bucket all member like this says their food grade heavy-duty bpa-free so on the bottom has got a the bottom bucket actually has a bottom in it this does not I've cut the bottom inch and a half off and I have them stacked up here with separating my different size bags so down the bottom is a 45 and 73 90 120 I'm gonna put this one in here and this 160 is going to go on the top and this is gonna be my pretty much my trash bag so I'm gonna go ahead and put some ice in here I usually fill it up to about the top of this it's a little bit over the top for the ice in the bottom cannabis on ice on top of that so that's what I'm going to do and I'm going to put this on hold and pause and go get the cannabis yeah got the ice down here in an ice chest and that's the ice I'll be using I also have to spray bottles here both with cold distilled water I recommend using that as the minimum you know if you have access to better quality water you know the better the quality of the water the better hash will make so this is the material Oh see in there but it's been chopped up a little bit with scissors the open bag so that's what it looks like well alright I'm at least gonna put the dosey doe in the slurry cane in there slurry cane is dosey doe cross purple punch so these are gonna be pretty closely related we'll see what that looks like other I might add the mochi to it otherwise I'm gonna blend this separately I don't know yet I'm gonna put this on pause so it looks like with the ice in it and you can see the little top of the agitator oh yeah just put it all in there gonna ice it down about that much cannabis in there so I'm gonna go ahead and put some more ice in here and some water and then we'll give it a try okay so I've had the ice to it I like to leave a little bit of room so I can add some more ice if I get too much water you know I can always add more ice - it's kind of hard taking it out so here's the ice water I'm going to add to it and it'll give it a try okay the ice in there I'm going to turn it on and see how it does so that needs a little more water [Music] so I looks and sounds about right yeah redness for three minutes turns out we're probably pretty close to this what they call the hi mark so this is when we pulled the screens and scrape the hash out of the screen this is where we're gonna bring it over these are our drying screens I just wrote numbers on mine and felt pen these are the different size bags that I have so you know you can do ones like your first ride in your second run or sometimes I'm gonna do three or four runs I'll start with this and then I'll stack them toward the middle for each separate run kind of late I haven't had lunch yet it's like four o'clock I haven't even eaten today actually it's my lunch tea and a leftover burrito with some people big guy [Music] this bag with water in it that's to put these bags once the hash has been removed put them in there so the remaining hash that's on the screen doesn't clog the back up cuz otherwise that dries in there don't have to use alcohol clean it out and then this buckets a little different than the rest I cut these sides off of it it's the same bag as you the same composition but this is all been removed and the reason I did that is because when you put these 5-gallon bubble baggies in there in any five-gallon bucket it's hard to pull it down tight and have that screen come up off the bottom because when you do that it creates a vacuum it sucks the water down so it's kind of a cool phenomenon but when you do it in these it doesn't it does a real half-ass job you don't really need that but some of the finer bags like the 25 to 45 it comes in pretty handy to help it move water [Music] I get this nice chest [Music] let's not be about dead I don't went so I'm just gonna let it settle for a little bit and then dump it out if you weren't using fresh frozen and you're using dry material when you added the water before you started a jet\u00e9 ting and you don't want to let it sit for probably about 20 minutes to rehydrate or you just end up with a bunch of [ __ ] so um I will pause this and be back in a minute there's an interesting factoid for you these type of burritos these big burritos it's got everything in the kitchen sink in there you know rice beans this is a chicken fajita so it's got a bunch of bell peppers and veggies in it they put salsa sour cream cilantro I'm not sure what all else they put in there but that burrito was not invented in Mexico it's called a mission burrito our mission style burrito and they were actually invented in the Mission District in San Francisco so it's kind of interesting it's anyway I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna rotate this thing so that this this pickets on there this side I just put my thumb over it you leave it like that as it empties out this is gonna lift up and be wanting to come out too into the bags move it out just a little bit keep your eye on it trust it too much we laugh about every last drop drain out of there we're gonna be running this a few times so go so in this bag there's going to be this is my trash bag and there's gonna be some leaf material in there we're not running the material inside of it so anyway that's what's in there one way I always tell if there's anything good in the bag if you do that and you squeeze it together and your fingers kind of stick together you know there's some fry crumbs in there and I do feel a little bit in this so that means to me that whatever's underneath that's gonna be pretty darn good so this bag I'm gonna go ahead take it out wash it out in the sink I'm not gonna put it in that other bucket over there I'm just gonna I don't want any of this crap floating around and I'm taking it to the sink I got place to hang it outside and let it dry so here I'm washing the hash down to the middle and this is a really nice color looks really nice and I filed it here [Applause] [Applause] this one works pretty good for moving larger quantities around this one right here is better for cleaning once you've got it down to this point so really switch over no we're just gonna move it around a little bit just you can't watch out any thing any contaminants that we don't need in turn quickly with it that was pretty good so now we're gonna kind of dab the bottom of this on here yeah let me grab a scraper I like these plastic playing cards I work pretty good so see if we can see how this works put it down great that app sit over here on the screen that was the 120 there's 120 I've got another scraper I'm gonna scrape that off over there now we can't stick this down there and wash it we wanted to and we'll move on to the next one and so on and so forth so we're just gonna keep doing this till we've run all these bags through here I'm gonna add some water back to the machine get it dialed in they do another three-minute run and then I'll be turning it up to 6 6 minutes or so until I get tired of doing it or I run out of decent looking material but you know even when it gets down to really not that great of material it still is good enough to extract without ethanol and you know make edibles with it so I usually get tired of actually doing it before that happens oh yeah because I'm really only interested in the really the the cream of the crop out of it and I get enough cooking material I'm just doing what I'm gonna do this anyway I'll check back when I get this down to I'll show you how to UM get the water out of some of these bags there's a couple different techniques one is kind of grabbing the bag by both hands that kind of shake popping it up and down and yeah you get a little rhythm going - yeah the water comes out pretty fast and also raising and lowering each side so it's gonna be hard to demonstrate that with the phone but you know you just raise your right hand and lower your left hand as you're dropping on each side of the bag back and forth and you'll see you know it moves the trichomes around and allows the water to pass through a little easier so anyway in case this thing does die on me you know basically everything is done here when this when I get this all done I take this into the house and I'll put this on a paper plate I'll stick it in the freezer and I'll get the hatch removed off the screens and I'll put that on to a piece of parchment like this knob each parchment on the paper plate and I'll freeze dry it I'll put it in and out of the freezer for a few days let air dry freezer drying I don't know what you know what's the best combination of that is I haven't done any research I just play it by your I don't know it doesn't it doesn't really matter to me but the fact is that it does get freeze-dried and then you can take a hash card a half grinder and you could use a microplane you can crumble it with your thumb and forefinger which is kind of the method I prefer to do because that's just the way I've always done it and I don't know I like it lick my fingers when I'm done called today I'm gonna put this on pause so if there's anything else I think of as I'm reading this last run the rest of these bags and getting this done I will come back on but otherwise that's really about it you know keep everything as clean as you can this is certainly not the only way to do your bags or stack them up or do a washing machine you know you can do them by hand you know I've got a putter golf putter I use I'm using these five gallons buckets but I do do it differently you know with with the five gallon I don't have all the bags in there when I'm doing it I'll just have the work bag in the bottom or I'll just pour this into the work bag and go from that that way anyway good luck I remember another way to do that popping up and down hmm this is the last bag 225 is the hardest you can gather it at the top see how much more is coming out now than was before anyway and I'll show you stretching on here no pause this okay so this is why I'm five notches stretch kind of tight I can still pull it down tighter though watch this down off the side and up the screen down to the middle bottle you see how much greener this is definitely going to be a lower grade of hash here pull this down I'm sure you can hear that water so I can relax it now let it go back down and pull it back down again also there's just no end to the fun you can have with it but this is definitely cooking material you know be all fine I'm making cookies don't even bother with 25 and stop at the 45 it's gonna look like this I just dumped it I just might I don't know anyway to see what got so far the 120 looks a little grainy focusing on that or not but the rest of them look pretty nice the 90 in the 73 definitely gonna be some nice hash 45 looks pretty good too surprisingly enough but I'm sure it'll be no slouch but I don't think I'm gonna be as good as these two anyway all the rest of this it just being it like I said it's just gonna be a repeat load the water agitate except for etc all right I guess that's about it you guys have fun good luck", "q772B_dsYgQ": "so the most questions I've been receiving from the Rossum tutorial video is where to get these filters from this is a 25 micron filter for ordering them on eBay they come in a4 sheets a little bigger depending on how much you want to order and you can cut them to size for various types of hash weights to ground well then whatever you want to do depending on what you like to achieve and sometimes when I'm just cleaning bits of already made of oil then I use very small bits and wrap them up but this is about giving people the opportunity to do it for themselves where they might not have access to gain this kind of stuff so simple solution French coffee press or a French press coffee press or whatever you want to call it it's a particular type of one it has the three parts sandwich on the bottom and it allows you to unscrew this part you don't want to have one where they've actually glued it all together and you'll notice that on the ones that are poor quality they tend to have a nylon filter here but what you ideally want is one that's in three parts like this where you can take it apart and this filter that's left behind I would say looking at it could be between 50 and 90 micron but it's difficult to tell but it's better than nothing and it will clear your hash and clean your hash to a relatively good level although you may still get some residue when dabbing although that's a small price to pay for at least having access to some kind of good filter and you can always wash it once again once you've cleaned the oil in order to make it a little bit cleaner than it originally was if you can find anything finer than this then please let me know because it'd be nice to share with other people that this is the best I've found so far that's available in most normal shops or supermarkets", "T6o8v7FV_kw": "[Music] your people what is good so we've just done the like review sort of quick extract video on the odv free hash rosin by sub-zero extracts really really enjoy an x-ray for you know what [ __ ] it let's get another pot ordered uh so what we've got here is a 3.5 gram of cool latte rosin by sub-zero extracts uh it's in a slightly different part we'll do should give you a quick little sort of teaser so you can see definitely looking nice from the bottom what we'll do is we'll get that opened up so we can have a little look into it and see exactly what that's looking like so just got that opened up damn it's defo looking fire really really nice a real nice color to it looks like it's got a bit of wetness to it not quite as wet as the other one but definitely still a little bit of sort of wetness to it but that looks a really nice consistency does it doesn't it's a little bit paler than the odv3 i would have said adv feels almost like a little bit more yellow this one's a little bit more paler it's a really nice color and for those who don't know uh coolatto is across her face on fire across girl scout cookies cross gelato 33 i've got admit i'm really excited to try this one let's have a little smell yes really really fire like um like a cookies or a gelato just with quite a lot of gas in there as well definitely spending fire when i put my nose to the pot looking like a real nice consistency i can't go i can't wait to start having a little dab of this what i'll do is i'll quickly work the flashlight for you so hopefully you can see that maybe a little bit better and then i will like last time i'll get a video of you playing it but i'll get it recorded outside so we can try and see it in the natural lighting and stuff let's just get the flash on quickly and have a look at this there you go that is the cool art oh just with the flash on like i say a little bit paler than the odb3 it's a really nice color this one is definitely a little play around with it and stuff like that see exactly what it's saying in the natural lighting when i get a chance but damn that's definitely looking good in it trying to get the zoom to see sort of the wetness in there damn looking really really fire i don't think this flash is quite doing it justice what we'll do is we'll get some videos out in the natural light and like i said we'll try and get a milk shot as well but yeah cool art oh hash rosin by subzero extracts looking really really fire let's get to dabbing this [ __ ] your people so i just want to show you this really quickly this is the uh cool latto uh hash rosin super super fire i've been absolutely loving it i just want to quickly show you sort of a consistency sort of check as you can see it's just real real nice waxy consistency there's a little bit of moistness there but it's not quite as wet as the odb3 sort of bounces back there when you when you do press into some of these parts but generally speaking up real nice sort of waxy hash rosin sort of consistency perfect for like donuts and that melts beautifully as well we'll try and get a little melt sharp but i just wanted to quickly show you a video this consistency just so you can see that this this cool light is absolutely banging probably probably one of the best things i've ever done personally sub-zero extracts have killed it with this one so yeah we'll try and get a little milkshake but just so you've seen it in the natural light that's the consistency of it coming real real nice banging yo people what's good i just wanted to try and do as a quick sort of melt shot of this uh cool latto hash rosin by sub-zero extracts you'll see i've got a nice little glob for us in there ready to hit a dab um i do have a new dab rig as well this is the uh wax made aries e-rig uh saw papa shane uh reviewing this i thought you know what i'm gonna grab one of them give it a try looks all right on that i've been enjoying it i stuck a fresh out of my zorans so we can see how nice this burns really because this cool light is super super fire got a real nice sort of gelato we should be taste to it some gas underneath there as well but yeah we'll try and get a little mulch shot i don't know how what i'm going to do with this but i'll do my best to try and get you a little a little something so you can see how nicely it's melting but yeah big ups or zero extracts for this one absolutely smashed it like i said we're going to try to get a little milkshake on this ear rig but uh just bear with me i don't know how well i'm gonna do this um but we'll at least try and get a milk shot i don't know if you'll be able to see me smoking or not but try and get a metal shot so let's just [ __ ] get this on there you go all on and fire away cheers boys let's go in for a little dab oh straight away you can see how nicely that one's melted let's get the uh carved cap on let's get hitting the dab all right cheers boys yo people so slightly flop that air melt shot obviously you got to see a note in and put the e-rig ran out of charge as i was dabbing it so i only got sort of like a decent pull of it uh i'll work on that for the next time we'll try and get your proper mulch on there film some clouds as well but this one's been absolutely lovely i mean i said it a few times in this video absolute fire big up sub-zero extracts like i say some of the best stuff i've ever dabbed on this definitely getting more of their work in the future because i just love these last two bits this and their adv4 both been special so big up sub-zero extracts and yeah we're back with uh with more content and all that good stuff real soon", "6qj_ybKWsqk": "hey everybody's Siobhan here with gross sisters today we are making bubble hash [Music] alright so we have got a bowl full of frozen nuts what I've done is added I just put them in the frigerator for about 20 minutes and they are frozen so what we're gonna do is we're gonna dump them into our bubble box and from there [Music] so I'm adding a little bit of water to the ice mixture to kind of aggravate it and what we're doing wife elbow hash is so cool is that we are creating a freeze of the THC of those triumphs and knocking them off why call ash is so cool it's because it's a solvent lift hash we're using blueberry muffins today 3 this oh hush so now what we're going to do is shake it around and aggravate all those trichomes the teach seat to fall the other thing that's cool about these bags is that they are gauged from a very high gauge to a very low Cajun so what we're doing is as our procedure we as we go through what we're doing is we're catching the different stuff so you're going to see that there's gonna be like more material and chlorophyll kind of like in with the bigger stuff as we get to the thinner stuff so the reason why I have separated my two bags is because these are really thin holes and we're just gonna go ahead and use all of the water that comes through all these ones there's because that's gonna take a minute it's gonna take too long to drain this just moves the process a little bit faster self [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "cZmHh9FoZI4": "all right party people what is up we are here for the next review of the night we're going to be packing up a little hash ball for everyone in the room this is the OG Kush hash sativa dominant from a weed in Studio City and it's your basic kind of water hash how much was this a gram cushion 20 I was 15 a gram for sure for sure so we got the special VIP but yeah some really really dank dense hash its kind of dark on the outside I'll break a piece off real quick first smoke up you guys can see on the inside it's a little bit sandy it's been definitely pressed together pretty hard it's just your basic water hash you know it's got that typical OG Kush passion all from the weed I don't know if the regulars are the we know I'm talking about it's got that kind of on Irby earthy kind of og smell to it but with a really really hashey flavor definitely as well but it's got that slightly Irby kind of OG essence to it and it's a really unique kind of hash flavor to the weed that they get from this one place I'm assuming at this one person but it's some really nice stuff you can tell we got kind of looks like an edge or something here or someone use the knife on that edge cuz very flat just a really nice piece of dense dense soft bubble hash it's just a really thick chunk right here but it's very soft you can peel it off and little pieces let's see if I can split it might be kind of tough there we go yes and see in there you dislike things kind of [ __ ] up there we go yeah help Oliver with a new [ __ ] - Magus 7000 whatever this thing called now coming here from this angle just a really nice hash I'm gonna use this the rest of the reviews but it's a really really good bubble for 2015 I mean this doesn't break your magic fun I have like the iPhone 3G and it's like ancient stone piece of [ __ ] compared to that mm-hmm yeah when that thing drops like 300 bucks in prices so ridiculous I was him old man I got a crackling [ __ ] maybe a little patty of this hash smoked up putting the lux pool took it out of the roar don't have your music going or playing modern warfare in the background you have to actually start up music which is the only reason why we're not looking I think so whatever

xenon that metal to action go was in there really really good tasting yeah she tastes a lot different than it smells for sure it's got a much more og kind of typical flavor and there's a lot less of that earthiness than in the smell quite a good bit of just pure Hoshi flavor but it's got a much more lemony og essence than the than the smell gives off it's got a really earthy kind of oregano kind of smell but when you smoke it it's just really slightly sour OG you know it's really really good you definitely taste the strain in the hash a lot just going lighter was it huh never seen it go lighter old-school style oh yeah this isn't any of your weird oh you're not like a [ __ ] like like I suck your soul out it's not it never is your slave I have to do it that's why there's no girls in

with a lot of og flavor for the price you're getting a lot really good flavor out of this guy you know in your average hash grab so definitely a great pickup from the weed for whether lower priced hashes is definitely a very very good choice name so we'll see you guys on the next one peace and pop", "CkGesipt7t4": "[Music] [Music]", "bYdCOS_d3xk": "welcome back to the talking head I'm Josh McCain and this is your cannabis business podcast today we're gonna make hash Frenchie cannoli style famous hash maker that you're going to need a couple of things products for one we've got some trim you'll need a scraper you need some kind of matte weather silicone or otherwise you need some ice and then access to a hose or water bucket different micron bags they come in all different shapes and sizes I'm going to use a few of these friend she uses four different bags he starts with one ninety then one sixty forty five to twenty five if you don't have those exact numbers don't worry about it I don't either I'm starting at 220 followed by one sixty seventy three and then twenty five you should yield about ten percent on average but we ran our last batch came up with not so great you know pucks here a bad product and bad product out has probably already been Keith we're gonna try new bags same ice same cold ice same method and see what kind of result we've got I've got a nice bubble machine is gonna be helpful as well you're gonna want to towel some alcohol to soak the microns because after the first and maybe third wash it's gonna clog up you'll no longer have that sift function so we're gonna fill this up a third of the way with ice a third with our material and then again a third I'm gonna have a trim sandwich [Music] five or six times the first one we're gonna do for about want to make sure to start everything clean make sure to clean as you go so after this first round we're gonna clean that micron bag I'll show you that in a second after we drain this simply just take those run it through nice and green we run that through all of our four bags you can separate each bag with a different bucket if you want I'm just going to run all the bags consecutively and put some water in it fill it up and then run it for two minutes so we're gonna use our tool bitch bag after getting most of the hash we're gonna end up cleaning it with some alcohol so could scrub it get it really clean so after we clean the smallest micron bag in this case it's a 25 micron bag we cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol at 99% whatever you've got to clean it real good put it back in there and network going to flush the second time after it ran for two minutes I feeling it a third time we're gonna run for six minutes now [Music] you may find that the filter and the machine clogged so by turning it on and off that will spin it hopefully unclog it allowed to drain more so after the second rinse we're going to check the filters of the bubble bags the trick to that is kind of just pretend like the panning for gold we wanted to shake it make sure that there's enough air so for example with there's holes at the bottom of this bucket and if you don't lift it up and give it air it's harder for that said water to drain through as you sift to get the water to drain out a lot faster otherwise you're gonna be there for days hoping it just drains out [Music] top bag is retinues you just toss that out throwed the backyard yard waste is illegal interstate open this up like a piping it's freakin south you can also grab a cold frisbee throw it in the back here this makes for a nice little pleasement just read this out a lot [Music] this is a 25 micron bag so after about 3/4 of the way through we have about two and a half percent yield normally you're looking at at least 10% because we're using unusable trim we don't expect so after it's dry 4.2 ounces here so it's all mixed in from the different micron bags you can see the different colors but just like data shit in shit out so we're finally done what the hash was very long process took a while we did about two or three different bags per day obviously over a few different days we'll leave a link to the show notes of how friends she does it takes him about an hour per cycle I did it a little bit faster because the product I was using wasn't as good obviously Frenchie and only professional and does a phenomenal job starts with the best product I didn't have that luxury but for us we're done so with that we're gonna roll this one up I'm Josh Kincaid this is the talking heads don't forget to Like share and subscribe or don't an amount [Music]", "2pGtr_Iw6KU": "[Music] so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "bPtgrC2fuVY": "hey what's up youtube all right guys um i'm gonna start this video again i started it and then i [ __ ] up and i accidentally [ __ ] it up but anyways i'm gonna make some bubble hash on this video guys i'm gonna show you how i make it i got a 5 gallon bucket set up with all my micron bags and i'm i'm not running every single micron bag guys i'm running the 30 and the 70. the filter bag and then the work bag okay so i'm only filtering out the 70 and the 30 micron and i'm using 15 pounds of ice and buds you guys uh out these are a bunch of lowers and some trim that i have so it's hard to see but it's all frosty buds um so i have it set up now i've dropped in about already about two ounces maybe a little more than two ounces and i have another three there and it's all buds and trim guys so most it's gonna be a good yield on this one um for now i'm just gonna set it up like i said i got a layer ice i got it two ounces or three ounces of bud i'm gonna drop in another uh five pounds of ice another layer and keep layering it until i get there guys give me one second and i'll be right back with you all right guys i put in the other three and a half ounces uh all together it's about i don't know seven eight ounces something like that maybe half a pound uh but it's quite a bit of cannabis in there so i'm gonna go ahead and fill it up with water now and this is just tap water and this is uh my broomstick i just take off the broom handle and i use that as my uh as my uh mixer you can use a drill but a drill is uh too aggressive for me and it'll uh it knocks off the car film i just fill up the bucket so i see that there's uh just enough water in there to mix up all the cannabis and the water and the ice mixed together this is called the cold water extraction guys for anybody that's not familiar with this procedure and you can see there's still quite a bit of ice in there and there's just enough water in there for me to mix it around so what i'm gonna do is mix this up for about 15 to 20 minutes a little bit and i'm going to mix the ice the water and the cannabis all together and i'm going to mix the more i agitate it the more uh trichomes are going to fall off the buds guys and this green bag here is the filter bag it catches anything that makes it through this big and then after that is the actual uh the filters which is the 70 micron and the 30 micron i can actually add a little bit more ice in here because there's not enough ice all right give me one second guys all right guys i know it's hard to see that's why i brought out a flashlight but right there that's about the perfect amount of ice and cannabis mixture there's quite a bit of cannabis in there like i said and water mixture you just want it slushy you don't want it you don't want too much water in there you just want enough water to separate and agitate the material and the more you mix it and the faster you mix it the more uh more trichomes are going to knock off so you want to do this for about 20 minutes guys in about 10 minute increments so you want to do it for 10 minutes let it rest for a few minutes and then go back and hit it again and then you can do a second watch you guys this is just going to be the first wash and then yeah and then we'll go from there give me a second and then i'll bring you guys back around once i finish watching this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] i'm just showing you guys how i mix it and how long i mix it for and how aggressive i am with it the faster you go the more you're going to knock off the trichomes but you're also going to break up a lot of the foliage and the buds as well and that's going to allow everything the more you make it the colder it gets because the ice and water mix together especially when you mix it it gets colder than ice actually is so that's how it works the process and like i said it freezes the trichomes off of all the buds and whatever filters through this first bag gets caught as far as the garbage and everything else the trichomes will fall into the different micron bags whatever you have stacked i do have them all but i don't feel necessary to run all those other microphone bags that's the 70 and the 30 i think are more than enough to filter out all of what you're going to need as far as the trichomes go try not to hit the bottom of your bag guys with your stick because you might tear it or rip it and then you'll you'll contaminate all the rest of your product just by mixing it like this will agitate it enough to knock off all the trichomes and this is pretty much like a light wash a 20-minute wash is really really light especially if you're using bud instead of trim if you're using trim you want to go a little bit more aggressive but you'll get more chloroform which means uh the green will beat screw all the material but in the end it doesn't really matter because you're gonna wash it and i'll show you when we get to that point i'll see you guys here in about 20 minutes after i'm done mixing this up all right guys i've been mixing for about 10 minutes now what i do is i pull the bag up and i just kind of drain it knock everything all the water through it and then i'll let it float back in the water and fill up the bag again and then i'll start mixing and i'll do it uh i'll let it rest for about four minutes five minutes and then i'll start mixing again guys but for now i'm gonna let all everything that i agitated settled through the filters and go through the filters and collect and then i'll see you guys here in about five minutes and we'll start to mix again all right guys it's been about five minutes i'm gonna go ahead and start mixing again and i'll do this for another 10 minutes i'll run about 5 minutes and then i'll wait a second like 30 seconds and then i'll start again it seems real repetitive but that's how you get the most out of your uh your buds or your trim as far as hashtags and then from this you can make it into rosin and you can do it a bunch of different ways to make rods you can do with the hair straightener you can do it with the iron you can do it with a hot plate and an iron sorry my cat's running around it's going crazy and by pulling up the bag guys what it does is it filters it pulls everything to the bottom and just leaves the ice and the cannabis in there and as it settles the water starts coming up underneath and you can start mixing again and there's still quite a bit of ice in there guys ice cannabis a lot of cannabis you could tell i'm not mixing it too hard because the water's like a lime green and it's not green like the color of the the leaf you don't want that to bleach through you can wash it off at the end with oral water or just tap water but give me a second we'll get to that point guys [Applause] [Applause] all right guys i'll be back with you when we go to the sifting process give me one second all right guys it's been about 10 minutes i'm still mixing it i'm gonna mix it for about another uh probably a minute and a half two minutes and then we're gonna go to the sink and i'll show you how i shift out my cannabis in my heart [Music] all right guys in order to sift out your cannabis uh these aren't necessary but they're good to have uh they're micron screens this is a 30 micron i think or 25 micron i'm not sure exactly these are 25 micron if it zooms in and focuses there we go 25 micron okay so these are 25 micron bags and what you're gonna do guys is you're gonna is i'll set it up here on my counter right there and when i'm done uh scooping it out of the bag i'll scoop it right on to there and i'll fold it over and i'll press it with the towel on the bottom of the top and it's gonna strain out all of the all of the water and it's going to leave just behind just the just the rosin just the hash so this is uh these are essential to have and you can buy them on amazon or ebay for like anywhere from uh three dollars to to fifteen dollars depending on how many you buy i usually buy them in bulk and you can buy them uh ten packs five packs uh three packs you can buy them individually uh but they're really really necessary in order to make the to sift out the hash you can you can just let it dry out on a piece of cardboard as well if you don't have any screens you can just get a piece of cardboard put it on there and just uh scrape it up after the fat on the cardboard and it'll just come right up like i said the cardboard will suck out most of the most of the water uh this is just a way to sift it out you put it on top and you squeeze it and i'll show you how that's done when we get to that process but for now we're still mixing up the hash and we're gonna give it another probably let me see if i sing zoom in if it'll clear up there we go so we're going to mix this up for about another minute and then i'll show you guys how we do the the extraction process [Applause] you you don't want to try to mix it too hard guys you don't want your material or water to fall between the bags because what will happen is it'll contaminate your hash that green bag is actually a filter bag so if anything falls in between there it'll catch it but you don't want to try to mix it too aggressive where it's splashing because the water carries a lot of hash and a lot of material and it'll contaminate your hash if it falls in between the flaps usually you're supposed to fold them over but this bucket that i have is a little bit wider than a regular five gallon bucket and these bags don't fold over so i'm just doing it like this and then you know i don't have any issues just don't uh don't don't uh don't fill your bags up too much and too much ice and where it's going to fall over or fall between your bags you don't want that to happen because it will contaminate your hash you'll have pieces of uh of bud or whatever material in your hashing and you'll see it too you can pick it out but you don't want to it's better just to do it right the first time you can even add more ice as the ice mouth when you're mixing as you can see there's not i mean there's still quite a bit of ice in there but you can add more ice and it'll freeze it even faster uh the colder bets the better that's why you keep your your fresh frozen in the freezer as soon as you trim it off the plant you put it right in the freezer and you just freeze it and that's why when you're freezing it makes it easier for it to fall off the track when you actually put it in the ice in the water all right guys we're going to go ahead and do our bag extraction i'm going to show you how that works right now let me back up my tripod and there's the other bucket that we're going to use and uh as soon as this thing clears up all right so what i do guys is i pull out my bag and it's going to filter out all the water and all the sediment all the all the hot is going to come out the bottom and i kind of mixed it up as the water is going through because it's just like stirring it up but all right guys and i'm going to go straight into another five yellow bucket so i don't use any of that hash water that's coming out the bottom because that'll go on my next run all right and this one right here is just my filter bag this catches all the trash any trash that may come through that bag or if that falls on the side so it's not really a 14 this one here is our zombie micron and it's pretty loaded i can tell you now because the water is kind of coming out fast and this bag changes pretty fast so what i do guys is i got the top just like this and i'll pull up the other bag make sure i'm not going to lose any of this water because anything that comes through this bag is going to get caught in the 30 micron any other hatch and i'll shake the bag let's see how fast that water came out because that tells me that there's some hash in this bag how much i don't know we'll see i used quite a bit of material so we'll see you don't want to let any of this water go to waste because anything that's falling out is getting caught in that second bag guys remember that we got a good little mountain here and this is actually some people prefer this bag over all the others as far as quality of the cannabis goes because uh this is the gold gold bag this is the one that comes out the most uh golden and actually i've had 30 micron come out golden too but it just depends on the material all right guys we're gonna come to the bag over here set the tripod up let's bring it up now it doesn't look like quite a bit now but once i run some water i'm going to run some water through this and all that right there is hash guys the gold selection and i'll tell you i'll show you how that looks like here in just a second give me one second so i'm going to lay the bag in there i got a cup of tap water right here i'm just going to wet the sides walls down wash any hash that got that got caught on the sides i'm going to wash it all down to the bottom screen and i'm going to shake it and it's going to all gather together in one spot um and no matter how much water you want to i probably lost a little hat from the bottom end because there might have been some 30 micron that just went down the sink but uh it's all right and now i'm gonna pick up the bag and let it all gather in the middle and i'm gonna wet it down let it catch all together just shake it this one is probably the easiest bag of hash to make because uh the micron is not so small where you can't uh or you can gather it with a 30 micron it catches everything and you have to really work at that bag right now what i'm doing is i'm just running cups of water through it and i'm washing it washing off any of that green color that may be in the hash and you guys will see that if you mix your hash too much it'll it'll actually turn your hash green now what i'm doing is i'm going to grab the bottom of the bag where the hash is at i'm squeezing it you see it and i'm going to bring up through the bag and then right there is our hash and you can see how good quality that hash is this is the creme de la creme most people like the 70 and a couple of other microns that that uh that they like but that's a good amount of hash guys if you guys ever run hash you know it takes a lot of material to make hash and you can see that this hash is actually really decent this will be really really sticky if i uh don't uh gather it real quick and put it on the on the microphone bag on the screens and i'm going to show you that process right now guys you can use a spoon or you can use a credit card or whatever you want see how that one just fell right out and you can just scoop it all on on the spoon and then just knock it down on the screen and you can even run more water through this and gather all the all the hash on here that you can't see that's real small because this stuff is like dust guys um it's just gathered together with the ice and the water and you see it after the fact is it's like a sediment and there's still hash on here guys but anyways what i wanted to show you guys about the sifting process so i got a cloth here just a regular cloth i'm gonna fold the the hash over and i'm gonna put it on the outside of both sides of the hash and i'm going to press on this guys and the water is going to get absorbed by the by the by the rag and the hash is going to be on the inside and that's your finished product guys or one of them and then you can uh you can squeeze this out a little bit more if you like um like i said i'm gonna go ahead and run the run the water through this bag and i'm gonna collect whatever i didn't miss whatever it was on there because i know there's quite a bit of quite a bit of material still in there and this is just the first wash guys this is not a aggressive wash by any means most people uh do aggressive and they wash their stuff really really really vigorously and that's where you'll get that green tint to your hash and you can wash most of it out but sometimes you can't wash it all out that's why not i try not to get that aggressive on my first wash and i try to keep it as simple as possible um so what's left in there is uh about another quarter teaspoon of hash as soon as i gather it all together but that's like i said that's pretty much the way it works guys it's not very hard it's not complicated and then i still got the 30 micron which is quite a bit too uh let me pause this video because it's getting long as hell and then uh we'll get to that all right guys i'm getting the last 30 micron bag as you can see it takes a lot to get this through because it's a it's a really really fine fine bag the 30 micron is really really small and this is what i do to get out because it it'll get real foamy as you shake it as you can see inside the bucket all the foam and uh i'll try to squeeze out as much as i can you're not supposed to do this but it just takes too long to do it any other way at least for me it does i get all impatient and i'll go to the sink here we'll open it up see how much hash we got in there and it looks like a decent amount i'm just gonna run the sink turn it half a gallon of water 16 ounces of water go through there and then uh it takes a while you got it this is the way i do it guys this is the quickest way to get it out of there and and i know it's cold that's why i clearly empty it out and then i do a little bit of tap water so it brings it down to temp um but it's not going to filter through this bag once it's uh in this bag but this is how you get off the rest of the water and it takes a while guys just be patient try not to force it through like sometimes i'll squeeze the bag the way i was doing just before i brought it up to the thing uh but this is uh the other way to get it out because if not you have to wait for it and it takes forever and even if you leave it sitting there it'll it won't drain completely you have to physically go in and drain it but once most of the water is drained you can just squeeze the bag and most of the house will be on the bottom and like i said this is a quick wash guys you can wash it three times or even four times i don't usually do it more than twice or sometimes three times it just depends on the material and how much i'm running just be patient that's all it is being patient i'll uh be back with you guys in just a second hold on all right guys look at all that hash in there i know it doesn't look like much but it's quite a bit give me one second all right guys so that's the finished product of the 30 micron it's like peanut butter but the best kind of peanut butter and this is actually more than the the 90 or 70 micron and it looks just as good that's why i really don't do any other ones and these two because they always come out really really similar and the quality is always the same if you're growing quality and you're putting quality in you'll get quality out and see how golden that is compared to that one it's very it it's barely any difference this one looks a little lighter to me but there's at least a quarter ounce right here of uh of product and it'll be real fire once it's dried and a lot of people put this under a press and press out all the water you don't have to do all that guys as long as you're putting your body weight on it and you're using the right micron screen you're gonna get all the water out and then it'll dry within 24 hours see look there's a piece of material that got through right there is that green a piece of a leaf or something went through the screen and made it through that screen but uh no biggie we can sit that out after the fact and uh i probably will i'm gonna go ahead and rinse this bag one more time run a little bit more water gather the rest of the hatch together and now i'm gonna do another maybe wash or two and i'll probably end up with about uh 10 to 18 grams of hash by the time i'm done i've cured done hash because i usually let it cure for about a week or two and then we'll have a nice uh oxidation on the outside but the inside will be nice and creamy and light colored i'll usually mix these together to be honest i usually don't uh separate them and then i'll press them into hash but everybody has their preferences on how they like the hash this is the way i do it it's real simple it's easy um you can even save this hash and break it up like some people do or you can just leave it in a ball and it'll oxidize and it'll turn into like a temple ball you can roll it and some heat with your hands or a bottle and make some even better hash full melt if you like but yeah there's a lot of ways you can a lot of things you can do with hash from edibles me my personally what i'm going to do is i'm going to press it into rosin and then use it from there and uh edibles or however i want to use it but that's the best way i like to do it because i can do my dabs smoke my oil that's how i like my oils personally but yeah so this is my process guys real simple easy it takes about an hour to do it but a little longer because this time i'm showing you the process as a step by step more or less and the bags that i use and like i say that green bag there is just a filter bag it's not it's not for any hash or anything uh the two filter bags that i do use of the 70 and the 30 micron that's it and then a filter bag to catch any junk of course and then uh the work bag which is the 30 micron which is in there in the bucket underneath the green bag because i'm still going to wash this material at least one more time but yeah that's how i do it guys so if you have any comments or anything you want to know anything let me know in the comments below have a good one stay safe and stay medicated guys have a good one", "WZjAY1I-KRw": "hello

watching smoke with me dub is well yeah I mean I enjoy your life but be safe bless see you next time", "JDrSy1On8LA": "[Music] what's going on guys welcome to today's CBD hash review today I've got amnesia and the Sour Diesel from hemp elf which is two of a collection of hash they do Supply on the website this is the Sour Diesel and their amnesia which is this sativa to peen hash they do actually have mango on the website too which is an indica to having hash but these are two other collection of hash that they do have on the website they sent this over so first of all I want to say thank you to handbell for sending this over to me to review so now we're gonna shoot down to the desk to see what this hash looks like up close and here we have the amnesia hash and open the tubba and see what this looks like on the inside and as you can see it's just a ball of hash as you can see there I'm gonna break it in half for you guys you can see what the inside looks like it's pretty hard to describe hash really it's just almost like a ball of play-doh really that's kind of the only way I can really describe hash to you as you can see it breaks up really nice though so it would be really good for add into like blunts or stuff like that this stuff would be perfect for that sort of stuff if you want that little extra hit of CBD and when it comes to hash reviews it's a lot easier to tell you guys what it looks like because like I said to you pretty much just looks like play-doh so now let's shoot up and see what this stuff smells like and that is what the hash looks like up close guys so now I'm gonna do a lot smell test is a pretty obvious smell in both of these and that is pine so I'm gonna break this one open and smell the inside and I'm gonna be honest guys this it does smell really nice it does have a really pungent strong piney smell - I wouldn't say I dislike the smell to be honest with you it smells good and it smells nice and strong - super piney smell if I was being really like critical about it I'd say there was a so slight smell difference but honestly guys it's really not much of a difference at all going from the two there's really you be pushed to tell a difference between the two of these so guys I think there's really only one more thing to do and that's to show you how I use this hash and that is mostly with the dynamap and what I normally do I'll show you just get a little ball chuck it in the dynamap put the cap on and there's probably some people faced by me right now but this is the easiest way I've found to do this you can put this in your blood sugar roll it but little snakes and just plant it in there and just smoke away for me I don't really like smoking blunts too much unless they're pre-roll so I'm terrible at rolling so this is kind of hard going right now with the bomb and the dynamap so I guess let's let's go guys let's see how this works who wasn't too bad luck this cap I think I need to replace it this week I've been using it for hash and I think I may have overheat you did a few times which is damage the cap which isn't good so we're gonna bounce the diner back now and I think we're gonna go the old standard way with the bomb I've got a screen here I'm just gonna chuck that into there and what I'm gonna do is just pack it like normal like I normally would with some flour I'm just gonna go the normal way so there we go we loaded up with a little bit not too much let's go whoo nice smooth no real throat irritation again like a piney flavor the truck that the flavor really transposed pretty much what it smells like is what it tastes like oh it's like throat scratch there but nothing crazy on the screen let's go whoo slight brattiness on the back of the throat nothing too bad though so guys we've done a couple of hits with a hash like I said I've been using this all week so I pretty much know the effects already so I sit into the review so first off guys let's quickly tell you guys about the smell definitely as a piney smell to it literally like a pinecone does have an earthy smell to it but not too strong the pine is really coming in strong with this one now let's get to taste guys the taste was good for the first few hits it was nice it was clean it was smooth and then I started gonna be a roaring hit in the back of my throat a little bit the one thing I do like about this hash more than anything though is the pain relief you guys obviously know about my chest pain now and this is probably the one thing that kills my pain relief more than anything I've used with a lot of flowers that I use they are good for pain relief but with this it's just it's different I'm pretty sure it's because it's got that much more CBD this does have 22% CBD so it is a lot higher than my love CBD flower strains but this one is really good for killing pain you can also use this in plenty of different ways that I didn't show in this video as well guys I used in a diner and the bomb you can roll this up into like a snake shape and putting your blunts add that extra hit of CBD to it so guys this is currently going for twenty pound on the website reduced from 22 pound and to be able to get a gram of hash with 22 percent CBD in it that's pretty good but the smell the taste you've really got a like hash to like this although one of these were Sour Diesel on one of these was amnesia like I said you guys have been using these all week flavor-wise smell wise effects wise I didn't really see much of a difference between the two if I'm honest they do do a mango Kush hash though guys and that does have indicator beans so I do wonder what the effect differences between these and that I do feel relaxed for me though I don't feel tired the toilet don't really be on my eyes don't feel it in my heads at all I just feel chilled out and like I said you guys the pain-killing properties is what I like most about this one so but that is the end of the review guys so if you enjoyed it remember leave a thumbs up put some comments in the comment sections I'm going to be doing a Q&A in the next few days so whatever comments you've got from me put him in a comment section I'll answer them in

is a 15 minute wash it you did about somewhat the same kind of maybe a little less but the quality fell off but it was still worth it to wash I'm pretty sure you probably could have went a third time and probably got some something off though too but nothing that was really worth it to me but this is really some decent quality for a second wash pretty happy with the results all ball we should would do it a little bit more but the quality is totally there especially off this first wash which was uh it's gonna be well worth it yeah it was a six minute wash being the but this is the wedding

coach clouds tv this 18 nova channel designed for people of marijuana music and sports and today or tonight we are going to be doing a strain review on something different now normally i know i give you guys strain reviews on flowers but today we're going to be doing a strain review on some hash or some bubble hash so we went out to the recreational pot shop locals canada house like i always do i went out there and i thought you know what i'm going to see if these uh this pot shop here happens to have some hash now i went in there went to locals canada house and asked them hey you guys have hash and they're like uh we really don't carry hash but we actually do happen to have some bubble hash on deck so i was lucky i'm lucky enough to actually be able to get some hash today so i'm really happy about that now hash is something that i actually first experienced probably about five years ago i went to one of the medical dispensaries that used to be open up here in spokane washington before they got shut down and raided and uh i went out i went there and i actually bought uh it was 20 for one gram of some hash and it was the very first time i ever bought hash and normally for like i'd say the past couple or should say the past five years when i usually buy hash the juicy comes in a uh a little container like this but it's usually a glob like it's a rock hard nug it's just solid nug and it's either black brown or green like a dark green and it's always been a rock hard solid nug but the bubble hash that we happen to have here today is kind of grinded or teepee like i said i yeah but when it comes to hashtag i really love hash like if i had a choice between either like if i couldn't smoke flour if i had a choice between hash or oil i will pick hash all the time just because i like taking that rock hard one gram nug i sat sit there and put it in a spoon pipe and i could puff on that bowl for days like all day every day just non-stop smoking and it just it never like never burns out just keeps on burning all like all the time but enough of that like i said we're doing a strain review on some bubble hash this is our first hash strain review or essentially our first strain review that isn't flour so like i said one of the locals can house and the the only hash they had was this stuff here which is grown by sour face which if you guys haven't seen my cherry og strain review you guys can go and check that out they actually uh sourface is the same people that are the same company the company that grew that cherry od that did shrimp review but they are the ones that made this stuff here now this is some permafrost bubble hash i'm going to show you guys the package here like like i said this is recreational wii or hash or legal hash so this here cost 18 for a half a gram which is a lot of money now like i said when i bought hash from dispensaries back in the day it was around twenty dollars for one gram but i never ever gotten hash that was like kefi like this now let's go ahead and get into the actual uh stats of this uh permafrost bubble hash now this here has 52 percent or 52.5 max thc so 50 thc that's a lot of [ __ ] thc normally flower has like around 20 maybe 30 thc this is 50. and cbds is 0.2 percent so high on the cbds and very very high on the thc so this here was obviously sold at locals canada house it was processed by sourface and it says dob or date of birth of this hash is 11 115 net weight half a gram now like i said this was 18 bucks and normally it's like 20 bucks gram at a dispensary but the recreational hash here this is 18 bucks half a gram but lucky enough or luckily enough i was able to afford it because i can't really afford something that's like maybe 35 40 a half gram that's just out of just way too ridiculous now it comes in a plastic bag like this and then when you open it up you actually get this little container here so as you see it's a little plastic container so we're going to open it up and we're going to smell it and tell you guys what this bubble hash permafrost smells like so the first smell i got off of it was a hashy it was like a little mix of hash but a really strong smell of tootsie rolls like if you've ever guys opened up like a tootsie roll before i've ever smelt that that's what this smells like it smells like really sweet tootsie roll mixed with uh some really good smelling hash yeah this smells like a tootsie roll with a little hint of that hash smell but it smells like a straight up tootsie roll so some really good smelling weed i'm gonna have to give the smell on this a five out of five i like the smell of this [ __ ] it smells really good now to be honest with you the looks it looks like some pretty good hash now like i said normally when i buy a hatch it's in a solid like brick graham thing but this here is actually like really grounded up type of like i don't know it's just really loose it's almost like heath let's go ahead and show you guys what this looks like here now it is a light brown now like i said there's three colors in hash there's like black there's like this dark brown and then there's also a dark green those are usually the colors that you'll see in hash now i really don't know if the cut what's the difference in the colors if it makes a difference at all now you see there we got some hash now i will show you what i mean though by it's like keepy or groundy like now like i said it's usually like the [ __ ] i buy is in a rock hard nug but as you can see there it's just grounded up like some teeth it's really strange so smells really good looks pretty good looks we'll give it about i guess a four out of five some really good looking uh hash here and if you guys don't know what bubble hash is i believe bubble hash i don't personally know myself but i'm pretty sure bubble hash is where you take marijuana and you it's something where you take marijuana and dry ice and somehow you manage to get this stuff here i really don't know what the whole process is but i know it has something to do with ice or dry ice and marijuana if you guys have to know the process go ahead and let me know down in the comments and help you know educate me a little bit because i really don't know how to make bubble hash i've never made it before so we're going to open this [ __ ] up if i can we're going to load some of this up into the heavy hitter ball now this here is like i said some kiki stuff so we actually have a screen in the heavy hitter bong here and we're actually going to just lightly tap some stuff in here because we're not going to smoke the whole half ring because like i said this is hash it's 52 thc all right so we got some hash up in the heavy hitter here and now what we're going to be doing now just telling you we're going to do a hit and we're going to do a essentially a greens taste test i guess you could say we're going to tell you what it tastes like on the green set now we will not be doing an after greens taste test just because it is hash a i know hash always kind of just has the good flavor all the way through and it's never had bad flavor even if it's like almost gandhi it still doesn't taste bad but i'm going to take a hit here and i'm going to tell you guys what it tastes like you know what the hash tastes like and then i'm going to take a couple more hits i'm going to tell you the high that i get from it so i hope you guys have your smoking devices loaded at home hope you guys are enjoying it or with me we're going to take a quick hit here tell you what this hash tastes like and what hash essentially tastes like but what this hash also tastes like that makes sense what hash tastes like and what this strain tastes like there we go that's a little better and then also take a couple more hits and then tell you what the high's like because this is very high in dhc it's like i said smoking devices loaded join your herb with me here we go toast guys permafrost bubble hash 18 bucks half gram recreational marijuana toast although we took a big one oh [ __ ] oh now if you guys don't know hash is actually very harsh especially if you're someone that usually just smokes flour and you're not someone who's used to smoking ash or oil it's very very harsh on the first couple bowls so the taste i get off this is just the taste of hash now if you guys at home i've ever tried hash or smoked cash then you know what hash tastes like this here just tastes like some really really good hash there's really no sweetness or anything like that it just tastes like really good hash like i said hash kind of has its own flavor and like i said if you guys have tried it at home you know what it tastes like so it tastes like some really good hash and if you never smoked cash the best way i could describe it is maybe smoking keith you kind of get or maybe smoking a jet fuel type weed it this here is like the definition of strong jet fueling taste like if you guys have ever had some jet fuel we just imagine that times 10 that's what it tastes like holy [ __ ] we're getting to 10 minutes here so this probably will be a two-part strain review but we're gonna take a couple more hits try to get this video done before 15 minutes and tell you what the high's like so keep on smoking along and toast guys oh man oh oh my god okay alrighty so we're going to take a couple more hits but we don't need to at all i am so [ __ ] high i just keep on getting higher every time i cough oh man alrighty so the high on this uh permafrost bubble hash just taking the two three hits that i took i have an extremely extremely euphoric head high as you guys can see here i actually haven't smoked any weed or anything at all today this is the very first thing i smoked look at my eyes [ __ ] blood shot right off of three hits so the high extremely good head high and very strong body high but the head high is a lot stronger than the body high but everything's just a really strong [ __ ] high holy [ __ ] so the high very strong so my official review of this permafrost bubble hash i'm about to give this [ __ ] here a five out of five i would definitely buy this again not only that i recommend you guys to go to your black market dealer your medical uh dispensary or your recreational pot shop and go get you some permafrost bubble hash this [ __ ] here is dank like i said i got this at locals canada house on spokane valley washington 18 bucks a half a gram so and this stuff here because it's grinded up it'll last a long time you can sit there and just put a little bit on your bowl on a bowl of wheat and it'll last so like i said five out of five for this permafrost bubble hash this is great [ __ ] it smells good it tastes good and it's been a while since i've smoked some hash so this definitely brought me back to back when i used to smoke this is really good i love hash so i have a great time smoking more of this so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did give the thumbs up if you haven't subscribed channel definitely subscribe for more kush clouds tv and probably should say i give this here a five out of five taste smell everything smells like

Lucia's overall economic benefits it starts with the development of a proper legal framework and controls that means the type of product the type of cannabis is available who is benefitting from the from the cannabis industry how they are benefiting from that industry how people are using cannabis how our medical people getting access or how our patients getting access to the cannabis products that are relevant to their particular condition how trained are doctors both herbal doctors and allopathic doctors how well are we trained to prescribe cannabis products for particular ailments and so on so and that that means a new law cannabis law it also means education King posited that st. Lucia has a unique advantage in the cannabis industry explaining that the recently concluded poohmandu labs research indicated that small farms can make up to $70,000 pearl harvest per acre on cannabis production easily you can have three harvests in a year of cannabis right that means that of every acre a farmer could would get in excess of a hundred or 200 thousand dollars per acre from cannabis once we locked in to the international market and we could get those kinds of prices King added that the cannabis plant is also unique in its ability to remove toxins from the soil part of the new economic model King recommends includes the introduction of a cannabis pharmaceutical plant to create added value to the local industry the price of cannabis extracts I suspect is in another three or four years it's going to drop on the world market as supply cranks up of extracts cranks up st. Lucia we need to have a new agricultural model which cannabis allows us to have where we do value added so we need to bring in a pharmaceutical plant here so we put start to produce pharmaceuticals in st. Lucia because the price of pharmaceuticals does not drop dr. King argue that the usual post-colonial agricultural model which existed during the green gold era cannot be allowed to manifest as we begin to explore economic investments for cannabis but we need to go to a legal environment where we allow the herbal cooperative to manage all small farmers and also to have partnerships with any investors I am not averse to foreign investors however they must be partners it cannot be the old planter cozy style of Agriculture whether well the foreigners or the rich people come do a bigger state and we are labourers right that's not good enough so we must be part of the wealth generation so we must be partners and the Hubal co-operative allows the farmers to be a partner in the businesses that the foreigners bring here and the government policy should be if you bring in an extract plant down here if you bring in a pharmaceutical plant down we need a share of that our our of our farmers need a share in that production the whole value chain King suggested that cannabis development seeks to improve the economic political and social well-being of solution people for choice news now I am lhave Spooner reporting", "VJyG7xGaiHU": "[Music] copyright streams like a [ __ ] on this one oh see here i'll turn it off you know didn't bring down was a tool unit dev tool um i use this one but we can use another adapter yeah you don't have your cap here what's that your carb cap uh is that a 30 mil yeah graduated to the big boy cd i introduced you to the 30 minutes up welcome welcome welcome to another live stream it's the daily dab it's a special edition we're at cv's house we got the tfl tent going baby had to come over here to the conventional dabbers got all my uh old seedling plants brought over here hooked up in this nice ass 5x9 gorilla grow tent with a 4x8 tray i went ahead and put in the uh automated irrigation today hooked up the troll master over there in the corner got these lights only at fifty percent right now right here we got the four herzog g's kosher kush crossed with larry og hers one two three four somewhere in here then we got uh g6 and we got three g6 right here we got three frost factory right here and we got two orange icy and then over there at the end two tropicana creamsicle so all those are ready to go they're going to get another week of veg i'm going to help them get dialed in kind of learn the plants learn about phd the nutrients and observing the plants and the growth and all of that and then in about a week we're going to go ahead and flip it to flower increase the light intensity and we'll be booming it's okay okay see these beautiful little girls my bad y'all you know you gotta throw up you know tfl sign you got the babies calling you out man show up and that's bnd slaps and uh we're gonna bang it out in here and do this phenom hunt and uh we'll find out what kind of goodies we have in here and then after this run we'll get them laced up with a clone run and we'll bang it out and be trying to hit about anywhere from three to five units out of this tent off of these little three lights three to five units all going straight to hash nothing else just hash so be nice and simple nice drain to waste setup so you know we had to get a little dab sesh on real quick without further ado hopefully uh hopefully you guys follow along in his journey i'm gonna let him take the helms on it and uh i'm just gonna be controlling [ __ ] from far away and saying hey it's time to change the res or go ph it or whatever but i'm gonna let him [ __ ] run it you know damn look at that some wedding crashers this is trim dude yeah that's true this is amazing bro yeah bones comes out [ __ ] sick yeah he's doing a good job shout out hambone and boom bone gardens they said it's a road show episode today a road show actually i don't even know why i'm not [ __ ] on the live dude let's see it's on youtube um he said he has the same setup as you fpv as a 9x5 okay okay stinky said yeah right you're gonna pull six out of there that's douche honestly i did hit um two pounds per light on these when i ran them in my room so there's no reason that we wouldn't be able to hit two pound per light off of them in here especially with all the cross lighting and everything else but um it's a nice space a pound and a half per light is um is really reasonable for this setup and uh these are big girls they're not gonna get flipped this big usually so we're going to throw these probably on some unislabs before we flip them so that they have a little bit more root space to take off and i fully expect all of these things to perform really well anyways like stevie said man we got some fire wedding crashers here from the boy hound bombs absolutely throw down i think let me see what yours is set at 4 10. what do you want to dab at that's cool we'll go low so you're dabbing at 4 10. i'm going to hit mine at uh 4 20. we got the dual can uh dual email controller from 710 coils right here rocking both email setups got the gentry rig with the grav labs drop down 30 ml deep dish coil got the casa glass right here recycler floating right there we got the 30 mil 710 coils compliments of uh your boy solving this bacon vape with the wedding crashers trim run hash rosin can you believe that's trim run guys that [ __ ] looks amazing man do we call this segment two rigs one controller is that what we call this segment here don't forget we got some heady mops not glob mops but hey you know these things have been working a charm you know they're organic they got some little wood sticks to them my boy's been hooking it up so we got some good stuff right here we got the uh little dark crystal glass cleaner here just a little bottle get the job done for the day uh i don't even remember who the [ __ ] made this bubble cap but this is my one of my original 30 mil bubble caps right here it's beautiful right there i mean i even have the uh like terp trunk we're gonna use the bubble cap it's like a pacifier yeah it does uh all right let me see can compare dab sizes are you [ __ ] half the size of mine hey man i got family pictures if i can do over here bro he doesn't want to be all red eyed no no cherries no cherries only chinese bro cheers y'all cheers man um extremely low temp that's it dude that's amazing bro that tastes absolutely amazing i told you yeah i was trying to get all terps i'm gonna let this heat up a little bit more let that vapor build up that should taste amazing shout out hambone gardens and solving this bacon vape right here putting them flavors together man bro when i first watched this [ __ ] after the the first press i did the test press on the trim yeah i was so caught off guard because i was expecting that that certain trimmy taste that you get but he brought it to me so fresh that it just most people wouldn't even know that's not actual like you know oh yeah they wouldn't suspect that it's trim run i mean the color on it's beautiful too all right my dab's done i might take another one right now actually wow see i don't want to go on it too hot because i don't want to get super faded right now we will get lit tonight though that's for damn sure look at look at bacon vape over here if i can talk and [ __ ] with his nods let me dab you up on the next one bro you'll be good fine fine yeah right dude yeah right i got you hey i wanna i wanna make it out of the house [ __ ] your wife can carry you right i mean she was a linebacker back in high school i was just kidding is this our dc that's it dude bro what's up how do you what how are you doing this are you dipping it in there just try to drop it straight in dude yes sir no me gusta that's no no because it just burns right off i like putting it on the q-tip for sure dipping in the jar yeah i got my little i haven't been really using dc because i got the puffco man the peak bro i use that a lot and your puffco ain't ripping like a rig oh yeah you know what it does the job though man take two dabs always on the ground oh so always man always discreet too you know always got to be a little more discreet i'm conventional dude i'm not yeah that's all good i'm like big dabs everywhere we go yes no time for being discreet if you don't like what i'm doing too bad don't watch amen amen to that see this guy was one doing all the [ __ ] work but i still feel relieved knowing the fact that uh we got this thing dialed in brother i know i'm really my man is over here hand watering twice a day getting up to three times sometimes a couple times i did man look at her look at that good roots on him um off to a great start i mean for somebody that's never grown a single plant before i couldn't have expected him to do any better i didn't give him any direction really when he left the house with the plants he took care of him on his own for like a good three four days did his own research to figure out how much to feed him blah blah blah blah so i mean as an apprentice you can't ask for much more it's there's nothing worse than trying to teach somebody how to grow when they don't actually have the passion to want to do it and want to learn because then they're just going through the [ __ ] motions and they don't they're not active they're not proactive and it seems almost corporate at that point you know you're just growing a plant this is different we're not growing a plant for the plant we're growing a plant for the end product in which we take out of the plant take away separate so i mean it's part of the craft of it you know it's not uh we're not the big big big cannon nothing like that no way man there's all craft homegrown single source that's the ultimate goal fire genetics fire hash fire rosin in the end great [ __ ] high enjoyable smoke so that's what i'm in it for man that's what i'm in it for to enjoy some good [ __ ] some good oil what do you guys think he's going to hit on this first yield let's take a pull what do you guys think you give give me the whole tent yield there's a total of 11 plants in there right are you sure you know how to count four six eight ten two four six uh-huh what was it thirteen uh-huh we're gonna let him figure this out eight ten twelve oh fourteen oh [ __ ] i don't know where i was getting eleven i'm like eleven bro irrigation and there wasn't eleven plants oh so you did more than twenty two [ __ ] drips yeah i know i bought a bunch sure i don't know what made me think it was [ __ ] eleven i don't know maybe i was dealing with 11 all day yesterday or so i have no idea why the [ __ ] was i counting [Music] we'll never know oh well oh well hey i got nutrient weights down though this is that's just easy oh damn that's funny man your boy [ __ ] up [Music] let's see look at look at his dab versus mine dude this is my functioning dab dude this is actually like a little bit more cheers [Music] oh my gosh this has like a cinnamony spice to it i don't know why this is delicious what's you're not even [ __ ] coughing let's take a bigger dab then but it's okay you got it you got family stuff it looks like a bigger dab we'll show you a nice sized dab later man tonight i mean when i'm ready to wind it down and be at home and not worry about anything else for the rest of my [ __ ] day i'm a [ __ ] dad i'm going to take a fat [ __ ] dab we'll get a good melt shot this is going to make for a great milkshake i can't even look at you seriously right now i've got turkey tears my turf caves are rolling i'm coughing off and you're over here actually like you just put some bubble gum in your mouth right now oh man it was hitting nice it was really nice unacceptable oh come on when you come over at night dude trust me i just dude i'm on the clock right now my boy is really coughing up over here my dad was like four times the size of yours and i went in 20 degrees hotter yeah you're nuts dude [Music] bro oh man i'm already feeling that dude man you got a crazy tolerance brother yeah you got a mad tolerance i ate all those stupid skittles and they didn't do anything to me no she hey close the door okay okay oh [ __ ] yeah those were some big dabs brother that's what i do i know i know you do he does he really does man and you'll be feeling great too huh for a little while yeah and then it's time for the next one so i probably wouldn't take it down for at least another few hours man but i work completely completely that's true and i process so it's like you know how it is when you have it you have it no [ __ ] blow through it end up smoking like [ __ ] once you get past the grandma day it's all downhill from there oh [ __ ] is it is that where you're at right now um yeah oh what how much like two no no we're just gonna say a gram a day yeah oh okay for sure all right yeah see that that see no i wish it was a grandmother no realistically right now i'm dabbing about a gram and a half to two grams a day wow that's impressive man that really is is it though because it's not a lot of variety that's the thing it's like i'll get one strain but i process i super fire so i'll smoke that and then i'll run out of that and then i'll get the next thing and i'll smoke that so it's like you build up the tolerance quick true right absolutely so maybe like the first couple days of a new strain or something i haven't had in a while i'll go back down to maybe like just a gram a day or maybe a little less but after the first couple days of dabbing on just that it's back up the tolerance back up like i my body builds a tolerance to this [ __ ] so quick i think that's why edibles don't really affect me anymore that could be it man everybody said oh your rso is is done wrong you didn't do it right you didn't de-carve it all right well i de-carved it fully and it still didn't hit me i still took a half a syringe a half gram yeah that's nuts i haven't even had the opportunity to try it yet man i have not given myself a situation where i can relax for the rest of the night and actually enjoy it usually as i'm finishing up here in the garage i'll go upstairs shower up the girls do you know the routine right to bed see i'm curious to see how it affects you and i send it to my aunt but she takes small portions and only at night so it gets in her sleep so she sleeps better for sure but i'm curious for another person who dabs on the daily how is my rso going to affect them right because it didn't affect me and i'm like i didn't overcook it right no id carved it and it still didn't affect me and then i was like let me make sure that it's not you know my rso that [ __ ] up so i got those puffins skittles puffin makes great edibles everybody i know that gets slammed off of them i ate a third of the bottle a fifteen hundred milligram bottle i ate a third of you i saw it one night did nothing and then the next day i woke up and i'm like all right that didn't do anything let me just verify so that that day i literally ate the entire rest of the bottle right it did nothing it tasted great though i love skittles didn't do [ __ ] so it's just uh it's it's hard you know homie said ah bro not with the kids in the next room we're in the garage this isn't like we're inside and we're just smoking in the next bedroom or something we're actually in a sealed garage and the kids are inside with their mother so i don't see anything wrong with this oh man not bad guys but yeah what's everyone was saying uh guessing weights and then just talking about a bunch of stuff for sure you just immediately they said you just humiliated that man with his baby ass dab talking about juicer it's all good man my baby dad got me feeling good man see that's what happens when you dab some sv full spec yes and you get off of that 90 you first watch teddy boy [ __ ] no yeah you get lit with [ __ ] solving this bacon but my brother absolutely you get more than flavor with my [ __ ] yes you get the company you're the best of both worlds high and terp music here what are you guys dabbing on in the chat drop it in the comments and let me know how does this look [Music] there's [Music] almost two minutes i'm almost trying to check to see how the garlic oh there we go oh that's amazing my nails they're my nails guys my bad who smokes out who it's hard to say i mean this this guy's got a huge tolerance man this guy's tolerance i mean it's it's not your common your coming buddy coming over to smoking j man i mean this guy's gonna smoke a half gram of my house right now you know my stress is twice i kind of feel bad for the like the homies cause they know if i'm coming over it's a bad day for them right they're not doing anything and the cool thing is they don't have to pull out nothing i show up with my own jars that's what's good i show up with my own rigs with a dual controller dude we can both take dabs the same [ __ ] time you know i'm not gonna sit next to this man with a torch you guys know that's not gonna happen friends don't let friends torch he disagrees with me but what it's a novelty why do i just you're hooked on the torch right now for that you need it you can't get a good milk shot like this you can't it is hard yeah you're right you're right about that so absolutely i'll leave you this this one oh you don't have a controller huh i'll get one so i'll just say i leave you the coil and then banger and then what you could do is if you put the temperature up to like 450 465 gonna take it off take the coil off for sure and then you can dab it straight and it's money hell yeah i'm done for that this is gonna be [ __ ] cool a close-up of the plants all right yep yep yep so the plants uh just started getting nutrients a couple days ago and they're not being phd at this time because he hasn't gotten a ph meter just yet we're getting the troll master aqua x ordered up and then um we'll get the ph right these all just got super cropped over today so that they could uh obviously get the net drop down on top of them and you can see uh here where there's the old growth with that was red and the new growth that's coming out nice and green up here and that's the same across pretty much all the tops all the new growth that started over the last day or two is starting to come out nice and healthy the herzog over here the larry uh lario g crossed with the kosher kush it has a really good node uh node stacking on it all the phenos do but especially these two back here they're a little bit taller and they stack pretty hard and uh hers number three has this [ __ ] rotten salami bologna sandwich smell i actually gotta grab some cuts and then the what is this here g6 i believe no this is frost factory right in here these free three frost factory is electric oranges crossed with a cookie jar and it is super super fire comes out with this tangerine creamsicle taste it's not like an orange peel or a tangy peel it's like juice turps and then the g6 is um platinum platinum wi-fi i think crossed with the same cookie jar and it comes out super [ __ ] gassy and frosty um with a little bit of a sweet undertone to it there's three of them in a row here the frost factory and the g6 both have the same cookie jar um cookie jar parent and uh they both stretched about three times their height and then i've got two uh new ones over here orange icy v2 this one and this one and then tropicana creamsicle this one and that one it's tropicana cookies crossed with uh orange uh orange whip f3 and uh both of these have the orange whip f3 crossed into it and should be some real terpy monsters but uh they're unknown not sure if they're gonna hurt them out or if they're gonna be [ __ ] weird the tropicana creamsicle already doesn't grow very big and fast and if it weren't for this man i probably would have thrown it away already but he wants them terps so we're going to flower them they all got nice big stalks on them um i'm going to go through like i said and grab some cuts right now and when i grab those cuts i'll probably clean them up pretty good and uh get them ready to go pull all this [ __ ] [ __ ] off the bottoms right they don't need it um so yeah i'm just gonna grab a few cuts the stalks are all nice some roots they're getting air pruned so you're not going to see like huge huge roots dropping out of the cube like you would on some people's trays where the cube is directly on the tray they they're getting air pruned so and then you can see these stocks are probably going to outgrow these once we get them on unislabs and these are just crazy node stacking this one was affected the most these got nothing but ah excuse me they got nothing but ro thank you they got nothing but ro for like four days straight the last week that they were at my house and they suffered [ __ ] 55 to 50 degree temperatures that whole week too while i was hashing in that room so they're on the the road to recovery right now and they need about three to four days of solid growth under high intense lighting with proper nutrition and they'll recover just fine and you can see these lights right now the intensity i've got them dialed all three of them back to a little less than 50 percent and you can see this one here i'll dial it up more and it's also got reds and uv that i could turn on so we can increase the intensity quite a bit turn it back down to about 50 we're going to get these things acclimated get them healthy and then we're going to boost that lighting up quite a bit so yeah that's the setup those are the plants and oops those are the lids those are the and those are the lids so we still got a little bit of work to do got some cable management we're gonna install a few more sensors a few more controllers for humidity dehumidity things like that and uh make sure that the irrigation gets dialed in with the feed times and then we'll uh be a full send you're excited man yeah homie first i bet you are i'm going to put the unislap down uh probably like two two to three days before the flip and we'll give them just one two days to get rooted into it and that's it um you don't want to give them too much time on the unislab before you flip because that's the whole point is you want those roots to be able to push out further and as they push out further they're going to push out more growth up top so the ufo above the canopy that is [Music] a 525 jesus that's a high temp um so that's a paper plate covered in foil it's basically just keeping the direct light off of the temperature and humidity sensor so that way it gets an accurate reading of the ambient temperature and humidity in the tent and not a higher reading than it should get so that's what that's for do you have to cover the tray um no we don't cover the tray the roots don't come out they get air pruned that's the whole purpose of having them on those little black root risers i'm not sure if you saw them underneath the cube they're sitting on little plastic risers that keep the cubes elevated off the tray so that the roots get air pruned and as they get air pruned you get faster dry backs more consistent dry backs more vigorous growth and then i do that throughout veg and then once we get ready to flip we'll put them on the unislabs and the unislabs will allow them to continue that explosive growth and and support the big plants that they're going to become because these plants are going to be pretty massive for these six by six by four cubes and it's not going to be a whole lot of root space to power them through i mean they've already been vegged in here for about easily two to three months now that i've kept them in these cubes and these are all from seed so it's going to be really really good to get those on unislabs and fire those off in a flower the flip is gonna happen probably um in about a week what are the strains i just went over them if you go back in the the stream about 10 minutes you can see what the strains are [Music] so yeah this setup is going to get even better it's not even at its at its peak yet we'll get the unislabs down and the unislabs will contain the roots we'll just cut two little slits on each end of the unislabs to allow them to drain and the roots will stay inside of the unislab packaging so we won't need to lay down any additional cover over the the root bases on the tray or anything like that no plastic sheeting i mean we could the way that i built the irrigation inside here we could easily lay some sheets of plastic over it but there's no need to at this point [Music] yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna leave strip i'm gonna actually need to take some cuts real quick and um yeah a permanent marker i think i do oh no did i take all those no i left them right here [Music] scalpel and some gloves and uh i'm gonna go around and take like three to four cuts off of every plant store them in a ziploc with some coronavirus breath and then i'm going to seal it up and then i'll take them home and i'll put them in the refrigerator and i'll store them for a couple of days until i'm able to root them if i need to store them i might just start rooting them but um yeah it's easy way to go around and take some snips you could toss them in water and a cup of water you can do a bunch of different things this is just one easy way to do it if you're going to go home and root them right away then definitely want to throw them in like a cup of water but i don't intend on starting these right away i'm probably going to have to let them sit for like um a day or two before i'm ready to start them so [Music] my turf cave is still leaking from that last dab i know you ready for another one no i'm good man i won't function bro not even a baby one i'll take a big one i'll take a you size dab and then you could take a mini you dab all right [Music] [Music] cheers [Music] me this tastes better and better man i'm so lit guys oh man my tolerance is [ __ ] low dude see how it's draining right now yeah every time that the system depressurizes in between feedings it's gonna drain all the old nutrients out of that spot right there okay so every time it feeds it's going to get a fresh feed and because this spot over here is lower than that spot it all drains this way for sure nice okay dude i don't even know that yet what can i say except you're welcome for the game that i brought to your tent thank you i think my man's is officially dabbed out now for now to be continued to be continued oh [ __ ] hey make sure you guys go follow the new page uh the conventional garden it's in collaboration with solving this bacon vape i was dedicated to this tent grow right here uh you can also follow me uh on my personal hash page it's uh the conventional dabber uh follow me there um of course you guys are already following sullivan's baking vape so you don't have to follow him uh make sure you guys give it a thumbs up on this video though uh what else i'm gonna drop some links here and your [ __ ] right now oh

really want anything to do with either one of those after this grow unless they just surprise the [ __ ] out of me and come out amazing so i'm gonna grab the hers one through four oh my god my back i can't bend over all right curse one through four um the g6 and then i need one more right here the frost factory are you watching the chat no they're like they're like his mind is upstairs oh dude that is so true man let's see where why is he looking yo my mom my boy is stuck sticky stuck sit at the end of the table i guess nothing's too special about to happen excuse me guys grab these four give them one more quick trim my boy was stuck like chuck his mind teleported upstairs but his body stayed in place that's my battery out here battery might die on you guys but it's been real it's been fun you can trim these down before you put them in here but i'm just transporting them home so they'll be straight take that last little bit and you want to blow that humidity in there co2 and that's it you're ready to go you got like a little cooler or something you can throw them in a cooler make sure it's labeled take those cuts with me now we're just trimming these away and then we'll move on to the next one which is first two really stacky [Music] [Music] okay there's two getting time to go home and [ __ ] preserve all these genetics just in case just in case he kills them anything could happen anything over here the front is hers four perhaps on this that one so foreign [Music] [Music] so so okay i got all my herds plants oh yeah this is my stinky dish right here smelling like a hot salami sandwich it's like little goodie bags to go i've already looked into tissue culture i'm not going to tissue culture if i haven't tested them yet i'm doing this pheno hunt so i could find the keeper phenos and then send them to tissue culture for storage the camera is going to die right now just giving you guys a heads up you guys so i'll catch you guys on the next stream probably tomorrow maybe later today i'm not sure i'm gonna grab the rest of my cuts though and um i'll catch you guys on the next one yo it was my speaker i'm really loud not really loud no oh okay

a few minutes ago I want to do with that that's our DS Baum [ __ ] man can't get enough of it I forgot all about it I know like a bag of weed show you guys okay now obviously I know [ __ ] idiot and I've shown very nice buds on my channel before but sometimes it's not always about the looks obviously I wish you guys could smell this because that's where that's where it's at in this one right here this is some cheese some outdoor cheese alright so I don't want everyone being like audit some bunk [ __ ] yeah I know it's a little duck the camera also isn't the best quality either but yeah this stuff is some cheese it's supposed to be some cali yeah it smells and tastes great not a big fan of outdoor buds but uh yeah I got the bud was probably yeah I don't know about an inch long maybe a little bit bigger was like a half eighth or something like that gave them like point2 I've oil just for a little trade just so I'd have a little something but uh I mean when you crack the stuff open it smells like like Northern Lights jack herer and like he's like a nice premium blend of all those strands like you can smell them specifically i don't know i really enjoy those strains so to me come on focus to me that was appealing but obviously outdoor isn't but wish my camera was better there are some nice trichomes in here nah and it smells delicious too dad it does so oh no i'll probably [ __ ] ah roll myself up something nice and tasty later on throw some sour diesel in it and I yeah that'll be a wrap I just wanted to show you guys a little bit of flour cuz it's not too often I do it's not the best right now but I wish you guys could smell it cuz smell will change your mind about the way this stuff looks at the idea i'm sure whoo that's look I hope happen camera would show that

token reef Florida with an update I know it's been a while but yeah whatever here's an update now so here's what we got in here the four in here no so we have two headed monster which is now and we're starting week six i have had a ph problem that I my meter was not reading correctly so this thing started to die back early to really hello now bad and I don't know what will happen but smell very gravy very great lake yeah we go there's two-headed monster right here we have unknown bag seed number two it's getting pretty big it's pretty decent to me but look like be kind of small but this is and we starting late floor so I don't tell a lot of sites web site on alright then we have el alchemy stuff from samsara seeds this is in week starting meet Green as started before leave yet week four start a week 34 this it's really nice nice knowin structure pretty tight pretty excited for this one actually again this is ak-47 cross with Northern Light anyway they all kind of have pH problems there's [ __ ] on the leaf right here you can see and I thought this was I mean I did have cal mag deficiency too but the reason that I'm having deficiencies is because my roots are not taking up nutrients because I thought my ph was at seven was that actually at 8.2 so yeah I've been that's what I've been running with this whole entire time so definitely got it fixed now I got the pH down ph meter that we're anyway that's it Tim this is not the correct so 78.2 and forty percent humidity which is right on target where I want to be this is full on middle flower periods that I'm here so yeah he's staying down pretty good yeah this is a stilling beat one I just put this in here five six days ago this is just a little one this is critical sensi star which is the one I thought as a firm in my first video and come to find out it's not I'm sorry about the shaken settle down anyway there's the updates we got four in here now and yeah so two more weeks on that one and then it should be done or close to so give or take a little then yeah harvest video on that one now you can see how that leave these here buckled down everything is yellowing like this leaf is really oh this should not be happening this extreme yet I mean this shouldn't happen so I start flushing much I haven't started flushing it so obviously it's locking out a lot of nutrients with my ph being screwed up so but like i said now it's fixed and move forward and it's a learning experience just remember make sure your shits always calibrated correctly and you know when you're messing with your ph then get yourself some calibrating flu and it really makes a big difference anyway that's it from the flower room life and token reef florida them out peace", "8U5_sO7enTQ": "what I would hold up man okay christen was

my eye look man I see what it was oh yeah we good she that's what I got no better already good I don't only want to go my leaving the store I looked down seen that book was the same one he walked out with so you see I already made the right choice right please man trust your mercy this thing even if you they you know someone might like this bill hey man trust that first instinct if you don't then you can always go back and keep it in its gonna come back specially for some spray that people ask for people a lot they will keep especially if they know you're gonna purchase it why not why not

sprinkle me sprinkle me man that's it you don't have to deal with a lot of that don't be in there trying to cover up the whole brunt because you don't want to see you touch that's gonna be a mistake two reasons one you're wasting two you don't need that much because it is so hot potency when you get to adding three board of two scoops you better be three forty four scoops ready because if your tolerance isn't that high you're gonna have a real serious problem man you're gonna pass out and whatever time he was supposed to be doing what I will he was supposed to get to that's out you ain't

yellow which looked warm man the truck home cool charcoals little hairs that hang off the ears they're nice they not just super thick and you could look at the charcoal man you know I've seen some that be thickest as the boy toothpicks and you can hide a man I mean from the tip up on my wood to pick you see my little fibers of trichomes that would be that thick those are you ones that are gonna be heavier THC content because they hold more trichomes on that now excuse me what THC crystals is cover now the bigger the tracker on the more air you leak and cold so remember that man eats a little distinguishing point about your book can't tell you something different about it man ask your bud tender talk to him keep waiting look but this one I want this what I'm looking for this is what cam

the ones we value are the ones we have I don't sinb lunch man but as of right now we not saying that multiple months of the entire Pacific but that would be only for two reasons one recreational use to medical to keep me not hurting so either way I have a medical card to purchase it to do both okay and mainly it's for medical reasons yeah because I do have I have my sensory nerve was cut in my right hand okay it tasted funny give me a scratchy in month oh wow not gonna wash bad nasty like make my thirty like I wanna cause but I'm holding it back but other than that the smell the taste of our tongue the smell not so much look beautiful the taste I don't have a problem with it I still need a little scratch in my throat you know when I pulled on a deep but it's not a book that I will put down it's not something that I would not smoke again [Music] they're gonna see them by halfway through my blood I am fighting to feel the high you know it's more of a cerebral not feeling too much of my body or nothing you know nothing my chest the banker think about the taste cuz you get there and you really see told you that since I get over I feel like every time I see Steve he might just did some segment I'm just saying you might be a one at the end like a dollop he and dr. Mills gets man man he gonna be fine don't be see the rittany and I even took too much he'll be fine when Judas seen him sit there you need 500 milligram brownie you know me take that out to dad they're 300 out of month I want to find enough medicine and medication can keep me there in the beginning so I don't have to go that high bro we'll go that hot and then come down to where he finds

cushion that will give you a panic attack attack art and good anxiety I'm a plenty of people that has happened to me see that's my bro won't certain smells of spring he won't be 1 by coz I got related with my experience ribs and he know the last time he had the attack with that blue I smell by if they any resemblance to me they look fuzzy cloudy right he won't see the frosty looking nice snug Asteria corner looking [ __ ] that's it just stay away from because a lot of reminding the crystals is different right what is one on this bike buzz mm-hmm fuzzy fuzzy young another windy difference so fuzzy don't you wonder if it's real rise you know right now you got the muggles there whistles on but those those the one that doesn't go on right that was a fall off when you sit there playing with the bug to that other frosty those is like little hairs how to eat a little individual part of the down to those small pieces of water leave their limits that still may be trimmed back yeah and as you can see I'm down to the hagnes blunts burnished slow go slow and ain't what I want some you know beautiful table scraps but I said the back here didn't have much of a smell you look wonderful

pressing somehow let it cool down real quick oh love hash and you get more of it i'm happy i'm starting a bit more this year it's a massive surprise I'm you just getting the steward of pho whatnot so okay first out of the day and it will be this nice crack there we go see if we go like close up or someone but yes that is the hash I just brushed out a little bit of and I'm going to do nice job of that for the morning I would cut in half I'm not ready for that yet not the morning there we go I'll roll it up until I go can or anything and take a dub so I got the email coming as well so that's good don't have to talk over over the course anymore right one point see you look like a 1.3 deep-dish nail can be good can't wait for we aren't really good bye guys shot because he hasn't had many followers at all and he should be well known with that hash definitely well known his name's Oaks sticky buds for 20 i think on instagram go give them follow we gonna shout out after this video on my Instagram so then you can check it out then but our cheers everyone this is the be Roy cross with star killer or just a mix i think run obviously ryan star color 120 grade of glass cheers arun oh it's such a mix of taste of this I've never had you do these two strains but I'll pipe some of the fathers and straight like mothers of these strains so and I mean if anyone has a nice spare camera I would love to buy one off you because this phone is [ __ ] for recording and keeps turning off throughout videos I have no idea when I set up on this little tripod that I have right now but I want to go through the vintage of the three for the two different strange so the first one is historically which is a cross between skywalker OG which is my top strain ever and rode a nice number two so to first go down the road thickness that is a cross between ghost o.g chemdog and triangle cush which creates the number one and then that is crossed with Grape Ape to then create number two which I found out so this is such a nice train as so many good og cush ISM everything in it so then also Skywalker road to you which make up the Starkiller and it's just Skywalker and og cush I'll open that one in a second so close those down so don't get too fused so then Skywalker is maser crossed with blueberries of basic strange strange but then once you cross it with the og it just creates the best thing ever my favorite so then to create the rare dankness one you have to go wait not hold on for the Leroy this is the second part of it so you have to cross triangle crush with rare dankness number two which was that last one so pretty much you need to cross triangle crush with cam dog ghost o.g and that grape ape to get Leroy set this this flavor on this is just in the same I just found this out this morning so going through all the different lineage and flavors that you would get out of this so you get earthy fuelly diesel tiny [ __ ] like Barry and then also the cushy very cushy there's so many cushions on this i'm just sad with this thank you so much sticky buzz you are a legend for doing this so i'm going to try to get like a most show i'll do another dive and i tried to do a decent most shot of something i just want to show that again oh so knows i cannot get over this hash poised on the bus you care of smoked but UK hash but i'm gonna do a nice little another dab of it real quick I'm just some different well I'm just going to turn the volume up so I can try to hear if it does go off hopefully not but yeah I'm gonna do a quick doubt and then try to get a milk shot but it's just like a showcase I still awake makes mix of two things but if I could just run hatch it's on need more hash makers over here need more growers extract Iran ash not just people get pardoned and extract it anymore single source people so I can never wait cheers real nice bit of Leroy Starkiller that's what the coach is coming we're gonna try a little macho you see if this D work maybe maybe not okay don't turn it off again I'm still coughing dying dab sweats coming it's let's try to get this and see if I can guess working there we go I can get this okay just gonna keep this up take a nice little dive off it and then do em up shop unless hopefully this works cuz then I'm just going to take a chunk off you actually now I was told it does go better when you press it so I'm going to I'm sweating right now [ __ ] you know I'm loving this at the other side honey transit oh this licet is going to knock me out so this is probably did indeed the end of the video after this but this is the only new thing in my stash so there you go that's suppressed out if it seems up folks it do you and I'm just gonna heat up I'll take all this in one man died give you a better map showing okay can I die everything I'm probably a hole in the shower after this shutting it is assumed up on it so I can yeah that's better zoom up there we go I'm sure to get a better angle on the light yeah that's it okay here we go cheers everyone and happy wake and bake oh thanks you really hope that is all I wanted to share for today otherwise she's gonna hear me coughing for like ages Oh got snot coming out

trying to get trying to solve the some cures for some for some diseases on other planets now I'm working on the new the new new planets disease is here with the new strains we got growing done with this planet I carried everything moving on now I I wish well I mean who knows who knows what we've got here you know think about it like this you know do you think maybe there's another reason why yeah why they soften me yeah cuz I'm too good at what I do maybe I'd say so they knew right away though they're like oh [ __ ] this dudes actually giving the exact formula for perfect cabbage every time so yeah I don't know what to say boys we got this sativa here - you resin guys ever seen resin before just stick that are in the teacher it oh the gate it's gonna be flavortown just going to do laps around flavortown boys give me a minute smash that like button a everybody share the video did you look at the fade on the sativa here is the wrong branch where's that other one that's a different kind with nice might be the same as that one so this is the this is that miss apiece from yesterday this is a tiny tiny piece of mrs. Eva you can you can't really see it though it doesn't show up that I guess you can kind of see no you can't see it like I can it's a shame this is all purple here it's not like bright purple like that one or whatever but it's purpling already and it's this is early like this is this is way low look at this [ __ ] movie this is crystal this is haze cross and the heads there are you okay so you can see it's purple there I mean I didn't expect that from this one not at all so so far I made something go purple that I haven't seen before but Purple Haze is a total thing so make sense right so right here was this nugget here this is a cross a blueberry let's see blueberry skunk this thing is frosted over and smells like a goat's ass this one is so crystal II and so resinous I'm putting it back so I'm gonna get oh yeah I'll tell you after your dusty after I'll tell you something after for you I mean I know it is velocity on here and this is that strain or the sister strain to her but let's get you're hearing it so much this did you I like sharing I mean I've looked at these but I noticed that I I want to give you accurate descriptions and the only way I can bring you accurate descriptions is to get in depth with the smells which I say I really try to do I ask all of you the same questions that I usually try to pose to myself but after doing 20 buds or you know 20 different types I may skip a few steps per strain right cuz they you know I don't sit there and have the 1 through 5 s in front of me right the five big questions right we'd have to watch one of my videos to see what the five big questions are Jack asks them dusty ask them fresh fresh the ask some Freddie and the skia has the oh my goodness I'm trying to really shorten you get shortened everybody's name this is some like my scissors are you gonna start to get bigger they're gonna skunks cornholio what are you doing smelling goats asses I've actually never got too close to a goat before but they reek a goat reek lambsbread I actually smells really good last friend or lambs breath and this buds purple oh wow wow wow so this is actually doing it wow so this is if there's purple hues through her like all through here is purple hues but the bud itself has purple so I now recognize I now fully recognize and appreciate this is one of the most magnificent right here this is truly magnificent right here this is a smaller side shot from way low and I mean it's not I mean if we weigh this is there's something decent here it's not very resinous this is gonna get trimmed very close I want to get all the sativa would just trimmed out a piece you know that's going on the good trim while I know there's a it's just a close trim while I should say so everything in the freezer is very cold very frozen I am going to yeah I had a dump a bucket rinse a bucket out give it a good scrub scrub a dub and then there were off to the races again with another batch of hash this evening I have to start clearing some of this stuff up so I can crop down the rest of this put it in the freezer and make room because this is I don't even have freezer space left to take all the I'm glad that this is just you know for a couple months and then BOOM don't have to do it again for however long I don't know how long it'll be and I am gonna save some cabbage not a lot but I'll save it you know I'll save a decent amount to last for the winter I can dry sift you know couple grams every five days some edibles or my necks killing me I haven't made edibles for so long I can't wait to see the improvement from making edibles rather than just tincture and massage oils but I'll like massage oils because they affect me differently and my uptake is different you don't think scissors are supposed to sound like that there's a mini frog in every pair of these a they put a frog in them [Music] you know this is actually for hash I mean for true Jim - Jim hash starting off with the tiny buds who could lift that plate off the ground so what I did was because the temperatures dropping I actually took a total of you know some really under sized pieces and rather rather than trimming it at all you know putting it on here having any stick to the bottom which it does it looks like honey was spilt on the bottom I just take it and what am I talking about I take the I take the buds in the small stems and everything and I just put it in one of these blue totes put a lid on it put it outside last night and then I brought it and put it in the freezer in the basement and just barely sneeze totes fit in the basement so I froze it off really good and then I you know because I had the extra freezer space and then I took what I needed out made hash and then I just put a big tote in the freezer instead of using those containers I'm gonna use the containers up here for one more batch and then I want me to anything after that but just use some containers to care in or jars whatever brown paper bag cardboard box these are all deflated and smaller these are a few days you know these are picked two weeks early and then they're sitting here for a couple of days and they're starting to dehydrate she's a Gouda hi

spades for tens I'm so glad you asked I'll teach you but I can't tonight but I'll play cards with you from another country [ __ ] I'll teach you how I'm gonna be playing all kinds of stuff with people wait you see what I'm doing angel I'll play cards with you babe I'm gonna do card games yeah you have to have one more actually you need a bunch of people no you need one more person there we can play three-way cards for tens yep yep yep done it's supposed to be my favorite way to play for tens is with partners but we'll play you can google it you guys should you get you need four players you want me to teach ya don't could yeah I know and trust me you don't want to try and play it it's it's not super hard but you want me to teach you so you learn the right way it's [ __ ] fun click points there's Trump points is a trick so you're trying to collect tricks the same way in elimination and what you said there that freaking crazy no no forget Crazy Eights Trump games you know Trump games are there to collect tricks why you guys don't say that card tricks card tricks and it's what it's there's a book about this ship boys and girls yep is too pat like let's say there's four people let's see there's four people mean your partner's hand model and dude that went for the beer partners right so you sit across from me I go first you dealt so [ __ ] the the guy that went to get the beer on the right is went first so I go next now you don't need to you deal 13 cards out each okay that's this is four tents thirteen cards out each is the whole deck okay that's 52 cards so you deal with the whole deck that means there's 13 tricks in this round you get it you feel me because you all have to lay a card down now the winner of the trick is dependent on the the card that's laid down if it's a heart if I play a 10 hearts first and hand model plays a [ __ ] nine hearts and you play the eight of hearts and [ __ ] here plays a [ __ ] two of spades or that no let's see plays a 10 of spades and it's that's Trump that round then he [ __ ] takes that trick he takes the 10 yeah he takes it and if I played the 10 of Hearts he has to put the 10 hearts visible and the ten of Spades visible and that's where 20 points plus the trick the hand itself of four cards adds up to one point so it's really really really good but there's more to na but if you you guys you guys should play spades you guys should play spades if you can play spades then you can play for tens Oh I crush like I honestly I'm Gloria Lee hope that you guys are good because when I play you're gonna swear I'm cheating I'm
