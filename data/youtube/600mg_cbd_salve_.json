pharmacy calm [Music]", "wRuY6JSRoME": "oh yeah I got caught smoking weed at universities I had my girl bring my kid away and I was outside of the Jurassic Park I didn't get called by the police but I was outside of the jurassic park ride and i was like all right you know bring him to go get a soda or whatever i'm gonna sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors I get person into costume but it's again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how I watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it I went up and then I just sir not here fade it off yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago Wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was all dude like get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny that's listening to this old dude on just for the for the [ __ ] of it I was listening the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs because they'd use him on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just [ __ ] putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the alzheimer the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they just give it in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away bright how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's it for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have [ __ ] hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is is sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we SS doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are our podcast and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're [ __ ] dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line I don't know the [ __ ] effects I smoke weed every day as well so I'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits then just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey [ __ ] cell it's crazy still there still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis calm eyes that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what it's problems election [ __ ] Lewis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they [ __ ] they look like they're about to fist [ __ ] me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst because it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they go all right we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to [ __ ] get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed kid drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were targeted that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids", "AvSJ0rc8Uxg": "[Music] welcome to TV mall and today we are making sure that we take care of all those important challenges that you might be facing I know lots of us are battling with the anxiety depression pain is actually a challenge for most of us and today we've got a special product for you from Moringa Foods International and it goes by the name of CBD oil you might have heard about it but today I'm not alone in the studio about the CEO of Moringa Foods international to make sure that they can give you the lowdown and make sure you understand fully what CBD oil is about Jay welcome today thank you for having me in the studio and thank you for joining us and I know lots of people have heard about CBD oil but what many are sure of how to use it what exactly is it and this is why today we've got you to explain and give our viewers more information when it comes to CBD oil thank you so be a pleasure to share that information with you yes let's start with the one that we've got I like you if you write premium this is the premium CBD oil and this is from hemp that's right and I wanted to start by saying here we've got the six hundred milligram that we've got for you today and I like the fig that we always about good prices here TV more you're not going to pay 750 rounds and because we care about you and we want you to save and so that your money can go a long way you're going to pay six hundred and fifty rounds that's a saving of a hundred rounds so that's the premium hemp CBD or 600 milligrams tell us more about EJ you mentioned the fact that we use the word premium on our label the reason for that is because it denotes quality very high quality and high efficacy okay we expect the results to be positive on every single application or use we we see of what the benefits there which we're looking at pain relief we're talking about increasing appetite I hope we're not talking about overeating they're reducing stress promoting healthy cell growth and of course I like the part of the nausea and fatigue and also the brain health can you let's touch mostly on the pain aspect because I know most people are using lots of money on painkillers they are using lots of money on energy supplements they're using men of many on sleeping aids but and I know as we were talking Elia on you spoke about CBD or being able to assist in most of those conditions most definitely and without the side effects of a lot of what people are using currently so son if you look at the used to cost factor yes you'll find that it's cost-effective for the results that you're getting but I must point out something very important about as efficient as CBD is yeah it's a non psychoactive is very important because most people will always confuse and say ok the hemp one and the one that comes from marriage one what's the difference well it's actually taking on a high we're actually saying viewers when you talk about the premium hemp extract from you know from from the marina food I international there is no high that's associated with this is not psychoactive so this is actually a very good one if you look at the comparison there look at that we could it contains 0.3 percent or less of the THC the THC is actually the component that actually you know causes the high you think we always throw this the temps can you actually tell us what so what you'll find is that th is the psychoactive ingredient in both hemp and cannabis Jen drop the gentle plant species but what you find is Barlow be required to remove it from all our products okay so the maximum usage per day is twenty milligrams legally so be ensure that is absolutely no THC definitely below the legal limit I can see as you can see there we've got the comparison quite nicely there to make sure that you know we can understand that there is a difference and we look at that THC and actually how the plant look like but when we look at it we're saying this the one from hemp does not actually cause problems in the sense that it is not psycho active not have lots of THC so I think just to tell our viewers more about that the main difference because the too many greens being CBD and THC you find that in in marriage one I have got more of the THC and less of CBD and it's actually the reverse when it comes to the hemp one we've got more of the CBD and less in fact almost if I can variant very negligible and in fact what we do is we have a certificate of analysis that actually shows the breakdown of every ingredient in our products and you'll find that the MP is about ninety-nine point eight percent yes and then you get CBDs CBN's and CB G's that'll make out the difference I like the fact that okay you guys we have got the three hundred milligrams are on offer today our call center agents are waiting for your call zero eight six one a triple zero one seven three we are saving you a hundred runs normally you would pay 750 runs but today we are giving it to you for six hundred and fifty rounds of course they also do make a three hundred milligram which you can also purchase so but today what's on offer is the six hundred milligram and when you took dosages it's important because people want to know this is a 30 mil bottom in terms of how one would take for example if I'm taking it for pain how much would I take well each bottle contains about 600 drops okay and you only required on the 300 yarn you required to take about six drops three times a day if required okay because you determined that by your pain factor so we normally measure pain from zero to what to tare to ten so if you in about the three to four factor region yes then you'll use this like normal users following the the dosage instructions and they'll probably last for about two two to three months okay if it's for insomnia then you don't have to take it all day long just take it before bed time until outreach with your city so we've got lots of people I know what battling to go to sleep because we using lots of stimulants during the day and that affects how we'll then you know I produce those hormones that are supposed to help us to sleep we're telling you today that we've got a premium product premium hemp CBD oil which is going to help you so if it's way insomnia one we'll just take it before they go to bed actually so you just how many drops would you take so on the 300 you probably take about six drops okay you can actually determine yourself and we need to take you know how much is enough for yourself and is a dosage charge that's that comes together bottle people normally worry about overdosing jealous would you really say it would be a concern when it comes to your products the premium see video that we've got in terms of overdosing No so science in depending scientific studies show that with the removal of the THC there's absolutely no psychoactive activity which means you can't overdose quite quite honestly you could finish most of that bottle in one guy just like you sleep so we are giving you a product that is actually very safe for you to take the only side effect would be you'll be wasting your money if you took all of it so take it as directed so that it can last for about a month or two so that you can get all those benefits that we have shown you there we're looking at pain relief I've told you lots of money is going into pain killers lots of money is going into you know taking care of anxiety and stress lots of money is actually being put into sleeping tablets and if you look at it how better you know to just get one product that will give you all those benefits a 650 runs only 650 runs we're saving you a hundred grands because normally you would pay six hundred and seven hundred and fifty runs for the six hundred milligram strength J in terms of far when you're taking the product are there any people that are exempted are any people that should not take this product that CBD today studies have shown that you could actually use it anytime and anybody can use it so in age groups you check in kids can also take it again but control number of drops okay and in association with the discussion you have with your medical practitioner most definitely so we're actually telling you that at least the good thing is now your medical professional they actually know more about CBD oil that's why it is actually available since it's a product that is actually legal that you can purchase from your outlets there your retail outlets but we are saying to you today let's save you money instead of going out there to pay 750 runs pay 600 runs 650 runs for this 600 milligrams strength but we also told you that the 300 milligram strength is also available for so this is CBD oil to take care of your anxiety your stress manage your stress well make sure that you can sleep better I like the power of sleep because J I can tell you if we look at the statistics lots of people are not sleeping well and for me I value sleep a lot because if you look at it we're supposed to be sleeping eight hours a day that translates to about a third of our life so for someone was six years old you should have been sleeping for what 20 years so that's the value of sleep because that's when now you recharge the batteries that's when you actually get to be able to wake up energized most of us are battling they start their day on a cup of coffee why because they are lacking energy how about now using a product that's going to help you to make sure that now you don't have to depend on those stimulants you don't have to depend on those sugary drinks to get your energy we're talking about the premium hemp CBD oil and we've got Jay here telling us more about it Jay what else do our viewers you think it will be valuable for viewers to know about your product it's very important to know that the lifestyle will lead and the anything that we consume affects us serotonin dopamine levels okay so what you'll find that this regulates it positively so using a good level or mood but at the same time in the calming with a calming effect that it has yes makes you more efficient that anything else that you do that is actually very nice to you so those of you who might not know he just mentioned the serotonin and the dopamine serotonin and dopamine are hormones and dopamine is the one that normally that's associated with addiction so when you burn a good product like your premium hemp it actually helps you not to get too addicted to substances you're getting the feel-good effects quite nicely and the serotonin is also that hormone that makes sure that you can control how much you eat you do not go over Egypt but a healthy appetite that's why the CBD or is gonna help you with your appetite but also the same hormone is used at night to produce another hormone that's called melatonin which makes it easier for you to go to sleep so we're talking about a product that helps you right through the whole day we want you to be productive during the day we want you to do with that anxiety and stress and we want to make sure that when it's time to go to bed you can sleep well pain-free for that matter that's true the pen the pen therapy is unbelievable you found that a lot of sports people are using it apart from the normal time that we experience so well whether you approaching 60 or not and the pain associated with that it'll treat that but a lot of sports people I was actually gonna go to that in terms of actually their sports people in order so it's a product that you would recommend for people who are highly active that's right and we're talking about in terms of pain are we talking about a product here that also controls inflammation and then also then gets to take care of the pain that's right so a does handle it does help with the inflammation and pain but as I said it makes you more efficient we found it on the golf course I

related but it is CBD related and you guys seem to be really interested in that so we're gonna talk about this stuff today well this is hemp extract CBD oil by potent potions they sent us it um thank you guys so much for sending it to us now this stuff is twelve hundred milligrams meant to be taken orally or I guess apparently you can like rub it on your extremities that are in pain or whatever I'm not too sure but this stuff I'm gonna drip directly into my mouth um that's how you're supposed to take this stuff so let's jump beat around the bush I'm just gonna go for it uh-huh so you shake it up real good first and then you just pretty much grab a dropper full and then pop it in your mouth let it hang out for a minute so if fully absorbs and then you swallow it and then you should be chilled out so I'm going to do it here goes a drip one minute 57 seconds later alright it's been about a minute there we go alright oh when you swallow it you really taste the flavor it's um it's pretty minty which is cool yeah I'm going to let that CVD effect really set in and I'll tell you guys a little bit about this stuff so potent potions is a company out in California who makes really cool stuff it's completely organic and if you're interested in doing this stuff and you want something organic these guys are a great choice to check out now I will warn you guys this stuff is kind of expensive this 1200 milligram bottle was a hundred and twenty bucks so that's that's pretty that's pretty steep but apparently I mean it's super deluxe like 1200 milligrams is pretty pretty high potency makes sense I guess it's potent potions on the back of the bottle it tells you the nutrition facts which is kind of funny um apparently it's 9 calories per serving so if you're watching your weight only take one serving but yeah every serving is one dropper full and it gives you 40 milligrams of CBD in the filming of this video I [ __ ] it up a bunch so I'm on like eight servings right now and I'm pretty freakin mellowed out Motz crazies you know you're not stoned you're you're chilled out it's CBD there's no THC so it's supposed to help relieve anxiety stress pain all the normal things that weed helps with without getting you stone or so I'm told I don't smoke weed but apparently it's supposed to help you out in that way which is cool now if you look closely on the bottle guys this stuff says it's medical grade so I don't know what that means I wouldn't take it too seriously I think that's kind of a marketing strategy I'm not sure but it's definitely good stuff you know flavor is nice and it tastes like CBD stuff like if you have experience with CBD vape juice or whatever or if you've done other oral you know means of taking CBD it definitely tastes like it and this stuff some got like a mint kind of overlay on top which is pretty cool top to bottom you know this stuff is pretty cool I've used it a bunch already and you know on video right now after a bunch of different servings I'm pretty I'm pretty chilled out which is great it definitely works but you know it's pretty expensive now there's other options you can get it in lower concentrations and obviously the less concentrated it is the less expensive it is but I'll link down below for you to check out but yeah if you really want to get into it and you want something that's strong check out the 1200 milligram it's a 120 bucks like I said but you know it's definitely worth it and it'll last especially like I mean [ __ ] we've had this stuff for so week and a half using it everyday pretty good and you know if you don't want something so so powerful you can jump in at a lower concentration and really get your feet wet see if it's something you want to check out and if you do use our link because it helps us grow which is awesome and you know what guys if you enjoyed this video definitely hit the subscribe button I mean we're always here but we need more subscribers and hit a thumbs up because this video is awesome as all and until next time guys peace out", "KGWNCeuuYnw": "I have had chronic pain for the last ten plus years and I've tried pretty much everything that Western medicine has to offer the main cause of my pain is enemy tree osis basically my vagina in abdomen area lower back all of that good stuff hurt all the time but to be honest no surgery amount of yoga prescription pill anything that I've tried has helped me as much as CBD has all the products that I'm going to show you today are very high in CBD and have low to no THC so that I can go about my day without being stoned out of my gourd these are the products that I use every day the first one are these premium gel caps it's just 25 milligrams of CBD they helped me so much with getting an appetite because one of my biggest symptoms with endometriosis is constantly feeling sick to my stomach nauseous never wanting to eat next up I have this paper pen from select CBD the reason I really like select is because they have peppermint flavor that for me helps me a lot like I said I'm nauseous a lot so getting this like quick ingestion with a little peppermint flare where I don't have to have the oil in my mouth is like all I can ask for this is called mad ritual it's just a little balm that I use specifically on my abdomen and lower back it doesn't feel as heavy as other bombs and some lotions that I've tried either like and you don't need to use very much of it which is great because some of these bombs can be pretty pricey these are called basic suppositories so it's a CBD suppository if you don't know what a suppository is it's like this little thing of CBD that I put directly into my vagina so it goes right to the problem area during my period or when I'm having a particularly bad in Demetrios this flare this is kind of specific to endometriosis but I had to include them because half the population has periods this is a lotion that I loved from sagely it's just it's called relief in recovery which is why I started trying it because anything that says relief I really like what I love about sagely products is that they smell very natural and they have pretty good ingredients in them and they also go on non greasy very white and they smell nice so it's kind of like you're just putting on like your daily lotion but you're getting pain relief or benefits from it this is another good option for anti-inflammatory lotion this is a really great option for just a day to day especially if you're like me and you're like typing or on your phone all the time I use this a lot on my wrist to kind of help relieve this is just a simple basic CBD tincture I don't really like tinctures because I don't like putting oil directly into my mouth I'm just it's a weird texture thing for me so this one I mix with a drink and do it that way this has taken me a couple of years to figure out what works for me and unfortunately with CBD it is a lot of trial and error but for me all of that trial and error has been a hundred percent worth it because now I use it every day I really look forward to the day when CBD is as commonly used as aspirin because I I truly believe in it and I truly believe in its effects and I think it could help a lot of people", "QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and

the second of our two-part series or four part series on CBD which is the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant and the healing benefits that you can gain from that I want to start today with a showing you some products these are topical creams and these creams come in regular strength and extra strength and then I also have a CBD cooling stick so I want to show you some options for healing if you have joint or muscle pain particularly arthritis or if you have sore muscles from your workouts or any other thing you twisted your ankles or a carpal tunnel syndrome for example anything where your joints or your muscles have been affected and you're looking for a non-prescription and non-medicated type of cream or non-pharmaceutical I should say this is plant medicine and I'm going to just simply show you how this is used this is extra strength and the extra strength comes in a little container like this and and really speaking you just apply it like any other cream if I have a little bit of soreness around my joints so I'm gonna take this extra strength and rub it in and generally speaking I feel the relief in about 15 minutes or so and I like to do this in the morning first thing in the morning and then I also do this at the end of the day just before I'm getting into bed you could apply to three times a day in order to feel the soothing effect over the course of the entire day it depends on your schedule depends on how often you want to use the cream but this one works really well you can see that it's not very greasy it's not - it's easy to absorb into the skin and if goes on really nice and there's no scent on this at all so this is an option if you've got joint or muscle pain this is an extra strength CBD cream healing balm so that you can heal topically the other option if you're experiencing inflammation so let's say you have an injury and it's a it's a it's a pain that feels inflamed so there's a bruise it's feeling warm to the touch the other option is to take cooling stick and so this cooling stick you apply it it's in the shape of a deodorant and you take the stick cover off roll it up a little bit and then apply this to your skin and you'll feel a cooling relief almost immediately and then this one also includes a little bit of the smell of peppermint so using regular essential oils this has a cooling effect and also a great way to work through any topical pain so the option is here rather than to go for something from the pharmacy or from the drugstore is to take mother nature's course first is to apply a little bit of plant medicine notice how it feels this I've seen also my clients use if they've experienced some tenderness or soreness after they've done a yoga class and they come out and they have applied some of this cream and in to great effect so I wanted to share that option with you if you're looking to purchase some of these you can click the link below and you'll have access to all of the different products that are available and remember this is CBD so there's no psychoactive effect you won't feel hi this is on your skin and a great way to leverage what we know about plant medicine is that it works very intuitively with your everyone has a different kind of healing benefit and it might just be the next best thing for you happy to help and if you have any questions please leave that here underneath the video and subscribe and like and do your practices about thank you setting um Salima and we're signing off now watch for video number three and four coming up next", "cFkATLe5J3A": "so as you may or may not know CBD oil has gotten tons of positive reviews in the marketplace due to its ability to induce relaxation instead of the high filling however there is limited information about the appropriate dosage for once use and it has been challenging to settle on definite quantity of CBD CBD that a person can take since the substance that interacts with the anti endocannabinoid system receptors meaning that it plays a role in the secretion of the hormones that are related to our response to stress so this system it changes one's psychology changes so physiological changes sorry so the dosage it's gonna vary depending on the CBD concentration the weight of the user and just his or her own body chemistry so I did do a little digging and this is what I found the current measure that's recommended by many of the CBD experts is that we take one to six milligrams of CBD for every ten pounds so this measure it actually applies at a 220 pound individual can comfortably take twenty to thirty milligrams of CBD while a 165 pound person can completely do can-can comfortably do with ten to twenty milligrams these measurements are just what works for a majority of individuals it's not does it mean that that's the scale so you never know until you try and I remember the first time my friend introduced me to try CBD started at 50 milligrams a day and I had no problem with it I felt a little drowsy I had a little bit of dry mouth at the same quantity so you need to just experiment until you find what's comfortable for your body and the other requirement is that you take they say take CBD twice a day for better results so a 220-pound err will take 10 to 15 milligrams in the morning in the same quantity at bedtime so you should this quantity when you're first starting out on seat with CBD just to kind of have a consistency for the best results however after a month or two of usage you can actually double its insure and no strong with me endo cannabinoid receptors will have adapted to the effects of CBD and this was just some research that I that I found you can find it to the experts in the field actually recommend that daily dose should should not exceed two hundred milligrams but you know you might be having questions about whether there there's a difference between the percentage of the CBD and its measure in milligram and these dosage recommendations are actually measured in milligrams since many CBD oils they are naturally extracted so that means they're a hundred percent pure so to start with twenty milligrams CBD per day and see how that works for you also you know consult with your doctor if you feel better about it and see what he or she would recommend for you and and also I really think that it depends on why you're using CBD and this is just my opinion I think that if you're using it maybe for some sort of physical pain then I think that you would need to take maybe more but if you're you but if you're using it for some sort of anxiety take less I don't know I usually I take mine specifically for anxiety and my boyfriend takes it for sleep and to have an extra pep in his day and also I know a few people that have taken it for headaches for for elements for for pain of physical physical pain so like I said I'll do some other videos on different reasons that CBD oil is taken for what reasons like I did another video on the my anxiety that I have and the reason that I take CBD for it and then when I'm sleep and then I'm going to cover another one on migraines headaches because it works amazing for that and yeah so share comment like if you take CBD oil let me know in the comments below how much you take what you take it for how much you weigh what you would recommend and or if you have a doctor that recommended how much you should take then just let me know in the comments below and I will see you guys on the next video bye", "mfawz0ujn_8": "[Music] hi guys I'm going to talk to you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please do us a solid share it on to a friend subscribe here baby juice TV and stick as a comment below if you've got your own opinions bye", "8AjfOxhmjcM": "how much CBD should I take when starting out with CBD many people want to know what's the best amount of CBD to take it depends on what you want to achieve each person is unique and will experience different effects CBD takes time to build in the body much like some vitamins you can take a small amount every day well you might not notice an immediate effect over time you should begin to detect more balanced calm and peace of mind in your life some people may notice a more extreme difference than others imagine someone who is deficient in vitamin C taking a vitamin C supplement will create a radical change in their health CBD is similar to a vitamin and that it helps to maintain and support overall health if your endocannabinoid system is depleted or imbalanced taking CBD could produce tremendous changes more quickly than someone who has a healthy endocannabinoid tone if you're already healthy CBD may not be noticeable right away what your friends may take a high amount of CBD and notice immediate changes you may not need the same amount the following is a general guideline a good way to start is with the mild range take the amount recommended for your weight not feeling anything within the mild range if mild doesn't work for you it could be good to reach for a higher dosage and try out the medium range go for the high dosage if you haven't noticed any changes in the medium range some people take more than 100 milligrams of CBD each day it all depends on your health and your body experiment to find out what works best for you how often should I take CBD there are three main schedules that people use to take CBD once or twice per day every two to three hours so that they feel the effects throughout the day and hourly micro dosing for CBD oil we recommend starting with one quarter drop daily during the first week moving up to one half a dropper during the second week three quarters of a dropper during the third week and a full dropper on the fourth week for CBD balm it's suggested to apply a healthy amount to the area where you are experiencing pain dryness or stiffness every six hours for vaping CBD you should start with three normal inhales and wait 30 minutes to fully feel the effects until inhaling more for edibles and soft gels start with one shoe or one capsule every 12 hours so what is the right amount of CBD to take there's a few key points to remember when you're determining the right amount of CBD to take remember to start slow and work your way up there is no right amount of CVD to take each person is different you can use our chart as a starting guide until you figure out what works best for you enjoy the process and the wonderful calm and peace that CBD can bring into your life [Music]", "yNjvAdbrOFA": "I'm not alert and I'd like to find out if CVD all is going to work for me [Music] anxiety sometime a month to feel a little by now so it's something I'd like to see the back off there's a cannabis extract that's now so popular that you can buy it in just about everything from oils and vape liquids to shampoo and makeup to drinks and even chocolate its classed as a supplement and is being sold in shops and online it's called CBD and at high doses a regulator type is being used in medical studies and it's getting some positive results it's everywhere but there's just so much conflict in advice as well and this song which to choose from two months ago I haven't taken any yet I'm not sure of but I'm not sure how they'll interact okay now some are I mean I've since been diagnosed with other things I've tried a number of prescription drugs mainly antidepressants nothing or pulling me through so you get to a point where you'll just try anything especially when it's been advertised as something more natural I've looked at a couple of sellers website I'll try five milligrams but also a percentage strength I'm just not really sure what all different colors mean I guess the fundamental questions that I want to know over the next couple of days is will it work for me will it work for others how will it work what dosage should I return should all those be taken hi I'm Nathalie thanks for showing us around hi [Music] so we go never look a crop that I planted ten days ago yeah that's good yeah I'm just curious to find out what you grow here and how it works from your side well we grow hemp and flax for fiber we've got a whole processing plant so we can sell clean fiber 4 goes into mattresses and loft insulation by the beginning of August hopefully this will be 10 feet tall travelers people are interested what's the difference between this and marijuana well hemp and marijuana of both cannabis plants yeah but you've got different varieties that produce different cannabinoids how illegal is this and when does it get to the point where it becomes illegal we are perfectly legal because we're licensed by the Home Office to produce hemp strong we're not allowed to harvest the leaf and flower so we have to leave the leaf and flower in the field what do you do with the leaf flower do just leave it there for rest ok so the bit we're throwing away is the part of the plant that the CBD has been extracted from it frustrates me somewhat that the OL CBD producing companies in the UK are allowed to bring leaf and flower in from abroad but we can't produce it if the leaves and flowers go to West well of are they CBD UK are y'all coming from all the UK produced products it's a the core information Europe Oh America ok didn't realize that I'm much of loss people don't most people do when people hear cannabis they usually think getting high and although CBD is cannabis it doesn't get you high and it's legal and that's because cannabis is actually the name of a group of plants and both marijuana and hemp belong to that family cannabis plants have around 100 different chemicals in them called cannabinoids and they can have various effects on us marijuana plants have been bred to have higher levels of a psychoactive chemical known as THC whereas hemp plants have high levels of the chemicals CBD which is not psychoactive and can sometimes have pain relieving and calming effects from researching the CBD oil I just assumed I it was all made in the UK well what I've read nowhere states differently I've been learning today that the local homegrown farmers kind of amused a bit that make the CBD just a little bit of doubt and confusion once again so it's a really exciting area I think especially in psychosis because we don't really have treatments there are as effective as we'd hope and they often come along with lots of very unpleasant side effects it seems that CBD is relatively safe and well tolerated so the study that I worked on looked at people who were at risk of developing psychosis and we gave them a six hundred milligram dose of CBD or a placebo for three weeks and we found that CBD was able to normalize the dysfunction that you see in certain brain areas have got involved in psychosis I haven't tried it but I've opened it and it stinks like I bought this one offline and it's two point five milligrams of CBD per drop that that's probably not going to be very effective if you're looking at 300 milligrams or 600 milligrams I think the risk here is that we just don't have the evidence of whether it works or not the research that we know about is looking at sort of quite high doses 600 to 2,000 milligrams and we know that this could have a clinical benefit but there's the things that you can get on the high street often they have much lower levels and we just don't know basically whether they work or not I know lots of people report that this is helpful however it's difficult to know how much of that is sort of because of the drug or because of a placebo effect and often a placebo effect isn't a bad thing what would you recommend what was your advice before purchasing a product online I think it's important to speak to your doctor if you're considering it because the other thing that we don't know about CBD is the effects that it might have when you're taking another medication for example our bodies are full of receptors that react to cannabis these receptors are part of an internal system which helps control our bodily functions such as our appetite pain relief and coping with stress and anxiety it's called the endocannabinoid system or ECS and it got its name because it was people's use of cannabis that helped lead to its discovery we naturally produce these chemicals all the time and the chemicals THC and CBD from cannabis plants also affect our ECS and can have various effects on our bodies and that's why scientists are now researching potential treatments using them it looks fairly positive I might help man it might be a good impact something but I am still there looking to see what is inside a lot of thought and how much CBD is in it my vaults been open and passed around a little bit so I bought a new bottle do the testing on to make sure that it wasn't contaminated in any other way [Applause] [Music] and can this machine tell us what other chemicals and that being the CBD while CBD and THC are the main ones it also looks for other THC precursors within your product well CBD oil is legal that does depend on how much THC it varies depending on your product and no matter if you had a one meal bottle or a one liter bottle you could don't you would only be allowed one milligram of THC right now in the UK there isn't regulation or manufacturing standards specifically made for CBD supplement products but there is a law that means that the amount of THC that's a psychoactive chemical that gets you high must be less than one milligram per item and it doesn't matter how big the bottle or product is it can still only have one milligram of THC in the whole thing there's strict regulation around the type of CBD that's being used in medical studies that you can't buy online or in shops and there will probably be more official guidance and even laws around low-dose products like CBD oil very soon so of all CBD products in the UK tested and regulated in the same way that we're doing now so in theory yes for every product released in the UK they would need to comply to labeling standards they have the correct amount of CBD that they're advertising within their product if you've ever want to check a supplier should be able to provide you with a certificate that says we've had it tested for this match this is what's in it we ran a series of tests on the product and identified that the THC content within the product was just over four times the legal limit so the legal limit is one milligram per container and we identified just over four milligrams in this in this product four milligrams of THC isn't gonna do anything notable to a person you'd have to have a considerable amount of THC in there for there to be a psychoactive response we found that the CBD content was was pretty much spot-on to what they'd claimed on the product when you extract CBD from the hemp plant you end up with THC as a by-product so it could be the extraction process wasn't cetera as it should have been at separating the cannabinoids properly it could also be a pure misunderstanding of the law the problem is and if you know how to interpret it it's just a page with a load of numbers on it so I think the there needs to be a simpler way of explaining this to to the consumer that doesn't rely on complicated reports on this I would say to Natalie don't worry you know that the THC content in there is very very low don't fear CBD products as a result of this experience and as the industry grows and becomes more mature brands will be explaining better to consumers about their products and making sure that those products comply with all regulations [Music] [Music] [Music] all I have learnt so far I don't think I meditate CBD oil just until a few more studies and tests of being completed I've never seen no attacking it especially because it's becoming more prominent in the media and in the research labs but I definitely keep an open mind about taking it [Music]", "0_0gj6pZVnQ": "SAY INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD\nCOVER THE COSTS, SO WE\u2019D LIKE TO COVER THE COSTS, SO WE\u2019D LIKE TO\nHEAR FROM YOU IF IT WORKS FOR HEAR

didn't know when an appropriate time was to post this video because I clearly do not want to be insensitive to everything that's happening right now but like many of you I have been glued to my phone social media the news and also the last you know I guess how many days I've been I've been out and about at the protests in downtown LA and Hollywood as well and the other day I honestly needed a mental break after coming home from the protest it's been very emotional and powerful but I did need to just I ended up watching some Gordon Ramsay and then I watched him RuPaul so what I was saying is I I think it's okay to take a little bit of a mental break this is something that so many of us hopefully all of us watching this right now are just so passionate about and mad about and and ready to fight to make change for which is already happening but also we need to be able to recharge as well a little bit so I'm not saying that watching a video like this is necessarily an escape but a little bit of a mental break and a little bit of a ability to recharge and then get back out there and do what you can I also did reach out and speak to some of my subscribers out there and asked if this was an appropriate thing to do and they kind of voice the same feelings that I am feeling right now so clearly YouTube videos are a lot more plan they're not necessarily in the moment and right now with what's happening everything is so in the moment it's changing so rapidly so if you want to catch up with me and see what I'm doing in the present moment you can catch me on Instagram I'm posting on there quite a bit any Adsense made from this video I'm going to be donating to blacklivesmatter and I'm planning for at least the month of June any videos I make adsense there I will be donating to an organization affiliated with black lives matter and I also have a very important message at the end of this video that I personally would love more information about and I do need to learn more about and I feel like as a community we need to as well so please stick till the end of the video and yeah I hope you all are staying safe out there I love you all and enjoy what's up everyone AC girl Stephanie and today I am gonna share with y'all some of my favorite CBD products I've been a big fan of CBD for quite some time now is really impacted my life positively as well as other people all around me and Josie's too so before we get into it if you haven't yet please make sure to subscribe below come join the sisterhood no matter your true pronoun or gender identity come join the family alright let's get started okay so before we get into the products let's talk a little bit about what CBD is so CBD stands for cannabidiol which is a chemical compound derived from the cannabis sativa plant aka marijuana CBD is non psychoactive meaning it does not have a strong effect on the brains cognitive activity and doesn't cause the hive associated with marijuana and in fact has been found to have a lot of great health benefits currently there is so much research going on with CBD in terms of cancer research epilepsy but in terms of just 182 CBD in daily life I think I have four health benefits that you know anybody out there would use CBD for these ones I personally use them for so here we go I have pain relief so studies have shown that CBD may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity reducing inflammation interacting with neurotransmitters we have anxiety and depression reduction so CBD acts on the brains receptors for serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and social behavior third we have sleep aid so one study showed that CBD improved the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder a disorder in which a person acts out in their dreams RBD is associated with poor sleep and nightmares and then in terms of on the outside personally we have acne treatment so CBD oil may help treat acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to reduce sebum production and also there's a lot of research on CBD in terms of other skin issues like really dry skin eczema and that kind of stuff so those are really the health benefits that I guess I'm gonna be talking about with these particular products and of course we have different ways of using we have ingestion and topical so we're really gonna go through a variety of different products here we're gonna start this off with ingested CBD and this is probably the form that I use the most and these are gummies so here are my favorite ones in particular this is by plus and as you can see I have different kinds here so if we're just starting off with two of these here these are 700 milligrams the CBD per 10 there's 14 gummies in here so that means our 50 milligrams of CBD per gummy that is a lot for a gummy product I actually have now tried and maybe over like 10 different brands of gummies and these are quite small but for me this brand tastes the best but also because there's so much CBD in there and you can taste it a little bit more it's a little bit more bitter obviously with so much packed in there you're not gonna avoid the flavor or like the terpenes of the plant itself so typically because this is 50 all like cut this in half or even into quarters sometimes or you know eat one whole I want to I started taking CBD because of anxiety I definitely deal with daily presence of anxiety I don't think that I have the high some anxiety ever at all but I feel like as a normal person we're all dealing with anxiety you know what issues within our own lives all the time the way that my anxiety Manifest is I just feel like I'm going a million miles an hour while I'm doing nothing and I'll like hold my breath really and I just get really tense and I don't even realize I'm doing it I have to consciously just like let it go CBD really really helps with that it just helps me just relax a little bit and just slow down has absolutely no effect on my brain function like I said or anything it just makes me just relax a little bit more so that's when I started eating these gummies I really like these but the ones I really like these are my favorite just CBD gummies are these ones they are 90 milligrams CBD and 10 milligrams THC now there's a lot of research out there currently that says that CBD is more effective when you have a little bit of THC with it and this is called the entourage effect and it kind of shows that in terms of like the chemical compounds of the plant they work better together than as their individual components so that's why when you look at a product that contains CBD it'll either be full-spectrum broad spectrum or isolate I'm really not going to go too far into that because this is a lot to talk about but I'll just say that full spectrum does have a little bit of THC in there legally for it to be just sold everywhere it has to have under 0.3% I believe so this one is not legal to be sold everywhere I had to get this from a dispensary because in terms of like one dummy actually there's point five milligrams of THC you don't feel it at all when you're eating this one but I do feel like this one in itself gives me the same relaxed feeling the feeling of calm as one of these so this one only has four point five milligrams of CBD per gummy this one has 50 milligrams so I really do believe in that entourage effect there is one more from this company that I think it's worth talking about this is their melatonin gummy this one is 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy one milligram of melatonin so it is a very low amount of melatonin per gummy I find that eating one of these has the same effect as eating like a melatonin pill and I want to say usually those are like five milligrams of melatonin so I really like to use this I don't eat melatonin super regularly but I do have racing thoughts sometimes like I said my anxiety can carry like into the night so sometimes taking something like this really does help and I will say that in terms of like whole flour marijuana or something like that I do use like a little indica pen to go to sleep as well that's pretty much my the scent of my marijuana usage but of course I live in California and it's all legal I use it to help me go to sleep but sometimes if I just have this I don't need that the pen at all I do know on their website you can purchase any of these separately and you can also buy these three as a pack which I did and like I said I had to get the one with th seed a little bit of THC and they're from a dispensary another brand of gummies that I do enjoy our CBD effects and this brand in itself has so many options for CBD they have got like gummies tinctures everything so and I believe on the site that might even have packs you know that you can have a variety pack of different things so if you're just looking into like diving into CBD and just trying whatever you want this is a great company to go to I like the concert or this one and itself too because it's pretty small pack I think they're like eight gummies or there were four gummies no eight gummies in here these ones for only five milligrams per gummy so you're not going crazy oh oh like going 50 milligrams and you don't have to obviously cut it up all by yourself so if you're really very new to CBD I think this is a a brand to look into I think that they have one like small pack like this left and it's there like spirulina you're not gonna get this specific flavor but you're gonna get the same like five milligrams CBD gummies another thing actually that I really do want to circle back to about doing your research is you really have to look at the ingredient list in the back and if you can't see it if they're not displaying it on the website do not buy from that website because there are some brands they label their CBD like gummies in particular like extra chil CBD and actually they've added melatonin to it without telling you explicitly on the packaging like you look at this one it's called sleep blackberry tea with melatonin there was one brand that my sister really liked no where on the packaging did it say CBD with melatonin but she was like Stephanie these ones are so good for sleep every time I just eat one of these gummies it knocks me out right away and I was like whoa that sounds like it's a little bit too relaxing but maybe my sister's just very sensitive to CBD so I bought it and I remember it was like 5:00 p.m. I was working on my computer and maybe like 45 minutes later I was like I'm so tired right now what's going on at first it felt like I was just like really relaxed so I was like this is crazy this did not have that much CBD in it and also like it's making me not just relax but really sleepy then I just went ahead and looked at the packaging and you know back here it said melatonin I was just shocked because I went on the website on the page of the gummi know we're on there to say anything about melatonin until you went to this teeny little ingredient list at the very bottom area that you had to like click a tab for and then under everything it said melatonin so just do your research and look over everything before buying a product and if a product doesn't explicitly say that has something like melatonin in it I'm not sure if I would trust that brand so next up after gummies the product that I use the most are tinctures so I have two here for you I have one by Lorde Jones this is their royal oil a thousand milligrams CBD and then I have this one by anda which is their full-spectrum CBD hemp extract now the Lord Jones royal oil is advertised as being topical and I do use it in that way as well but I didn't have the pleasure of meeting one of the cofounders of Lord Jones Cyndi Capobianco and she did tell me that this isn't just about as well because all that's in here is I believe grapeseed oil and the CBD oil one dropper pool is 40 milligrams of CBD so maybe I'll you know do half put it underneath my tongue and just hold it there for a minute if you're really not trying to mess with a lot of added ingredients you don't want you know any sugars or anything from the gummies this could be a great way to go and it is a very multifunctional product because I do have some neck shoulder pain issues and this is a product this is the first really effective CBD product that I found to really help with my my pain in my neck I think especially topically the thing that I really grasp about CBD is that it reduces inflammation and inflammation can be the cause of a lot of bodily issues in terms of pain management skin issues a lot of it has to do with inflammation and this product actually what they recommend is to use it in your skincare so you could put it in your moisturizer a little drop of that or even end it just on your face but like I said this one I use mostly for ingestion and if I were to put it topically like on my shoulder and then this one by and I just wanted to mention it because I haven't used it too much but I have seen a friend who does like this brand I need to look into it a little bit more I believe actually the all the packaging has changed very drastically since I received this one but if you are looking into another brand if you look into this one if you just don't want to taste anything at all you don't want to deal with any oils you don't want to deal with any gummies we have capsules here for you of course so I have two here where I'm from CBD effects again it's one these little envelopes there is 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule and then we have a little jar here of the Lord Jones hemp derived CBD gel capsules this one as well has 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule you know in terms of all these methods of ingestion it really comes down to I guess just your preference personally for me a lot of CBD is about the process I guess and it is I hey it's the word of like mindfulness of understanding that I am you know rubbing this thing on me or eating this thing to help calm me down or to help me in some way so I enjoy that aspect of CBD cuz it makes me kind of focus and be like okay just chill out this is what I'm trying to do to help myself so it's a little bit of a self-care moment if you don't need that moment for yourself like go ahead and just take a capsule or you know this could be that process for you as well I personally have not used these too much because I enjoy using the other ways but I have gifted these to friends you know a bunch of these in the bottle I have gifted to a friend and they were dealing with some real pain issues in their back and they said that this one really helped them along with other products I did give them though I'll talk about the other one in a sec it but yeah this is just a way that you'd want to ingest EBD go ahead and try it in terms of incorporating CBD into your daily life I have been enjoying some these products that make it even more of I guess like a ritual so I have a couple honey products here so this first one is from potli this is their cannabis infused raw honey this has 100 milligrams of CBD and 10 milligrams of THC so this is another one of those that you might have to purchase from a dispensary I believe this one is only sold in California and again because it has the little bit of THC in there you get that entourage effect to make it a little bit more effective this is something that I would put into you know anything that you want honey some tea you put it on some granola it just incorporates CBD in another way into your daily life without maybe making it feel so Medical like you're not taking a tincture or a capsule you just have it in your honey and this honey tastes great this brand potli is wonderful the founders are fell and Christine very are my Faria girls and I feel like they're killing it I have another product here from them that I want to talk about this is a product that I really really like and then if you're looking for one that has absolutely no teach C in there that you could just purchase online this one is from iki pers natural this is their beat chill raw honey and hemp there is 500 milligrams high potency hemp oil which is CBD in there I actually personally know the founder of bee keepers Naturals as well which is so cool so now I've talked about three female or four female founders but her name is Carly Stein she started bee keepers naturals because she actually has grown up has lived with her whole life with an autoimmune disorder and she found that natural bee products like propolis and royal jelly and I guess now added with CBD actually really helps with her extra so you're looking for just a really nice honey that has some CBD in there as well but no THC you can look into this one I have one more food product here again from potli and this is their hemp infuse extra virgin olive oils so this is cold-pressed estate Tuscan olive oil with 250 milligrams of hemp derived CBD again just one of those products where you can put it on to a salad you know just put it into your daily life and this olive oil is like really really delicious this is my highlight my special occasion not a special occasion but I wouldn't I would not cook with this olive oil I would use it for something raw I mean my favorite dressing for our salad would be some olive oil and some nice balsamic vinegar and we're good to go so you're fairly new to CBD and the idea of taking a pill or gummy or something is not practical for your life but you are a tea drinker or you're a salad eater you know this could be the form that would fit into your lifestyle earlier I mentioned my friend who I gave these capsules to who was having some really bad back problems I'm not sure it she it was like a pinched nerve feeling but she's not positive that's what it was but it made her very immobilize some of this one for her to put on topically and this is the bebo therapy's high potency CBD body balm there is 750 milligrams of CBD in this jar so topically what this balm claims to do is to reduce inflammation so if you're having just general body aches maybe just from working out this is a product that you could rub onto your muscles to help you out the other day Michael had a really weird back spasm it happened while he was bike riding and thankfully he wasn't that far away I think he was just like in Chinatown so I had to drive and go pick him up like he could not move his back was in so much pain it was actually really scary but when we go home he took a hot shower and then I rubbed this on its back for him oh no it was it was like his shoulder within his shoulder blade down his back you know some it was really weird but I rub this onto him for like half an hour and what they do recommend is to keep this on for at least half an hour and I think that it really helped obviously it's a combination of things like he took a hot shower clearly I'm giving him a massage which I think in itself helped there are other ingredients in here a lot of really nice oils that could help but in itself as a balm I feel like it does give some relief the CBD in there gives some real relief in terms of physical aches and pains this one plus the Royal oil are ones that I personally have used on my back and my neck for the pains that I have and you know when you're rubbing it on yourself you clearly can't really work it in and I personally have felt just that strain and my neck down to my shoulder just like loosen up after having this on for an hour it just says it just feels so much better even now like I still have the issues if I'm doing this all I'm hearing is just like I can't got crack all throughout my back you know just when I'm on my computer I'm hunched over and that's my tension as well that's my stress I I carry all in my shoulders and I hold my breath when I'm doing stressful things so all of it all CBD kind of helps me with those issues without having you know necessarily to take the next step into taking other things I will say this bomb is not the most friendly in terms of soaking into the skin it definitely is one that's great for massages because you can just keep working working working with it it does not soak in that well but that just means that a little bit goes a really long way because if you just use a teeny tiny bit of it it will obviously spread thin and soak in but it just is it's just I know it smells great it's a really nice bomb but yeah be careful if I don't know laying down on your white sheets or anything because it does a little bit of a tint on there and if you're slathering it on you know clearly you see that it has a color to it we're gonna jump into some other skin care products before we really hop into the face stuff there's another bomb here by Lord Jose and this is their high CBD formula body balm and this has 200 milligrams of CBD in there so you know this one over here has 750 this is 200 I would say if you are looking for something for aches and pains and those kind of things for inflammation of the muscles this is one that I would more recommend this one I don't even think that they don't claim anything about helping your muscles or helping aches and pains this one is just like a balm that you would put on for really dry skin the thing that lower John's really talks about in terms of CBD with this product is that it is very soothing and very a restorative ingredient and it is really good for dry cracked skin so especially now that we are all washing our hands so much using so much hand sanitizer this is the kind of product that like at the end of the day I'll like rub on my knuckles and my cuticles of course like I said with the previous product there are other ingredients within this like beeswax and oils that do help with that I think this product is a good example of how CBD can be really incorporated into your regular products in your everyday life it's not a miracle ingredient every single time they're claiming in this one that is just good for you know maybe some dry skin some cracked skin it's not going to solve your arthritis or anything so just do your research I guess on the product with CBD that you're purchasing so I have two more skincare products here another one from Lourdes Jones I just you know I think Lourdes Jones is maybe was the first CBD brand to go into Sephora they really did break out in the high-end skincare realm I really don't know a lot of other skincare brain ants that have CBD in them so that's why there's so much Lord Jones products if you have any recommendations for me please let me know in terms of CBD skincare clearly I have a lot of other brands that I like with CBD but I just haven't seen much CBD skincare that I really like because Lord Jones uses some really awesome ingredients outside of the CBD but yeah if you have any recommendations for me please let me know the thing in terms of skincare from Lord Jones I think I really like I really really like the most and this is probably the newest one for me is their whole plant formula acid mantle repair this is a CBD moisturizer this is quite a rich cream I am an oily person this is good for all skin types so typically this is my nighttime cream and it's this is gonna last me a long time because I've been using this for a minute and it looks like I haven't even really skimmed the surface you don't need that much at all along with the CBD there are some really great ingredients there's hyaluronic acid so it's highly moisturizing but because it does have the CBD in there it is really a restorative kind of ingredient it is great for acne and it's so funny because I do really love just scrolling through online reviews whether they be really bad or really good and it's it's awesome because on Sephora there are so many positive comments about this from people who look dry skin people who have acne prone skin it just seems like an all-around great very positively reviewed product so if you're looking for a really nice nighttime moisturizer if you are oily or disah all day everyday moisturizer if you got dry skin yeah this is just a really great straightforward moisturizer and the last product for the face that I have here is the Saint Jane luxury beauty serum again this is kind of one of those products that supposed to be for all skin types it has 500 milligrams a full spectrum CBD with 20 potent botanicals so it supposed to hydrate detoxify help with dullness uneven skintone wrinkles it's just kind of supposed to be yeah a miracle serum I haven't been using it for that long but I will say I feel like my skin is glowing afterwards I did have some breakouts that I had like I want to say they started like a week and a half ago I really consistently was using both of these at nighttime and my chin is just like really cleared up and I thought that there was gonna be more popping up but it did kind of back back then they went back in there so I'm gonna continue using this one I would say out of any of the skin products this is the one that I've used the least and it is also the most luxury product that I have here so I'm really being stingy with it but also again from all the reviews that I've read online a lot of different people with different skin types really have been enjoying this product hi Joe I just woke Josie up from snoring heavy sometimes when I'm recording now she just starts snoring so loud that I do have to I have to wake her up because she's just right here in front of the camera well speaking of Josie we do have a product for her this is the blossom full spectrum hemp oil this has 300 milligrams per bottle here this is the one I purchased for medium dogs you administer 0.25 milliliters per 25 pounds of pet weight CBD for pets is super effective I I feel like it might even be the most friendly gateway into CBD for a lot of people because they see immediate effects in their pets whether it be giving it to them during you know hard car rides where dogs have a lot of anxiety during that time or with fireworks so there was one night for some reason that there was a bunch of fireworks going on all outside Josie was a little bit nervous she's not usually nervous about loud noises but I think Michael wasn't around so it made her a bit nervous and I gave her some of the CBD and she calmed right down it was very I don't know it was pretty amazing and I have you know babysat other dogs where they're really anxious dogs and CBD just helps so much so I feel like just in that to see how CBD works for your loved animal and how it calms them down is just a really great testament to how effective CVD can be for you it's all not saying that everything you would give your dog is be good for you but I'm just saying we have a direct example there I do like this brand I feel like there are a lot of CBD for pet brands and a lot of the brands that I'm showing here let me see I know this one onda I saw on their website they have one specifically for dogs so I feel like a lot of brands that make CBD is just smart for them to also make it for pets as well so I would definitely recommend tinctures I'm not so sure about treats but I'm sure those are you know also effective I just have one last form of CBD not for pets but for humans and that is just the flower here so these are from Lowell smokes first off I have their premium hemp smokes so you can actually buy these from Lowell smokes it's just hemp and in this pack they also give you these little matches the packaging little smokes just kills it with the packaging is very very smart and I have gone through a good number of these little pre-rolls like I said I feel like for me personally part of CBD is the ritual and I am NOT a big just like weed smoker like I went sit down and smoke I was gonna say blunt I wouldn't go it's a ton of smoke a lot maybe you know back in my bay area days maybe but I went to sit down and smoke a joint on any given day but I do enjoy that process of sitting down lighting it and just relaxing with it so in a way I can I can have that without the high and we have it here with these CDP rolls if you don't want to have a whole approval because I understand I'll usually have to just like smoke a little bit of it put it out and then doesn't necessarily taste that great you know when you have to relight a joint they also just have the flower so this right here is 3.5 grams or 1/8 of the CBD hemp flour it's just crazy because in my mind like this just this is weak but yeah there's no THC in there it is just CBD is just hump and you can put this in your little pipe and smoke it so that's another option for you if you just really want to have that also I feel like if you're trying to not smoke so much weed but you enjoy that process this could be a great thing you know for you to do just smoke a little CBD so you're you're you having your ritual but you're not getting super stoned all right all those are all of my CBD products I have to show you it was a lot but I wanted to give you some options and I honestly I didn't realize that I really use a lot of sea wheedies so I hope you enjoyed this video before we close this up I did want to touch upon this in that you know currently marijuana is legal in California and in a lot of other states decriminalized in certain states I believe and it really is moving quite rapidly a lot of people a lot of companies are making a ton of money now in this industry and yet there are still thousands of people currently incarcerated for charges as small as carrying marijuana just possession and as a user of these products we need to be mindful and understand and become educated and become advocates for people who are currently in jail for crimes that are no longer criminal and I mean shouldn't not have been criminal in the first place I know myself I need to become more educated on the subject so I would love to hear from you any suggestions for anything that all of us should read about any kind of information or charities or organizations that we should look into because there's there's a lot of information out there but it's hard to really weep through it so I would love your help on that and I would love to be more educated and with that said I hope y'all are well and hope you are staying healthy and safe there's a lot of stuff going on right now and I hope this video maybe gave you a little bit of a break from that and I love you and I will see you in the next video bye", "ElFETa0-H7M": "hi there I'm dr. Strube I'm a chiropractic physician in Pinellas Park Florida CBD oil what is it Hannah Biddle oil if kena Biddle is the substance that is in c8 CBD oil now CBD oil is a derivative of the hemp plant ie marijuana however it does not have much THC in it and THC is the component of marijuana that gets you high so CBD oil will not do that now CBD oil has been tested fairly extensively and is utilized in most of Europe for a vast array of different types of conditions the things that it can be helpful for are varied it can be everything from anxiety to parkinsonian tremors chronic pain joint stiffness and pain a lot of different uses anxiety glaucoma hello yeah there are a lot of different uses for CBD oil the mechanisms by which it works it binds to receptors within the body and within the brain

going to cure every problem you've ever had some people get great results some people marginal virtually everyone says it has benefited them and it's always a question of degree so if you are having significant problems with chronic pain or anxiety things like that CBD oil may be something you would like to try there appears to be no downside to it and it has been deemed safe in numerous different amounts and dosages so there's not much likelihood of it car a problem a pretty good likelihood of it helping with any of the problems aforementioned that you may be dealing with so something to consider you've got the information do with it as you will and I want to thank you for your time and I want you to have a good day already you", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also any editor i put into a tupperware [Music] container [Music] if you

for tuning in to mis TV today be sure to hit like and subscribe it's today we're gonna cover a new slightly unorthodox but very popular aspect of vaping C B D what is CB d now CBD which is an abbreviation of canna video is a completely legal non psychoactive extract taken from the larger cannabis plant now unlike the illegal yet far more popular tetrahydrocannabinol or THC CBD has had all psychoactive compounds stripped away from it meaning it has all of the shall we say physical effects of the plant without any of the mental effects of traditional cannabis now people have been using cannabis and cannabis derived medicines for years to treat many different symptoms however many are a little bit nervous about engaging with the devil's lettuce due to elements such as it illegality the sometimes complicated nature of procuring it wherever you are obviously you should be doing that because it's illegal and also the slightly nerve inducing or paranoiac aspects of it that many people do suffer from when trying to use it as a medicine now traditional THC operates on the body's cb1 receptors many of which are located in the brain CBD is a little different CBD operates on the body's cb2 receptors which are located primarily in the body's inflammatory system meaning that the effects of the substance are entirely physical and whilst not straying into language that I cannot use all of its effects are going to be those which operate on your body's inflammatory system so if you find you are having issues that involve inflammation CBD can be a very powerful compound now as you're probably aware by this point you are watching this video after all CBD is growing in popularity at a rapid pace here in brighton and hove alone we already have CBD specialist or CBD products told from help senses CBD dispensaries even cafes and kitchens which specialize in CBD infused cannabis and other foods containing CBD but you're here because you're interested in vaping now what would be the benefits of vaping it there are some when vaping CBD it enters the bloodstream far quicker than when ingesting it orally or using it as a topical balm this immediate and strong onset of effect can provide a lot of its users with a greater sense of control over the symptoms that they are choosing to treat with it and generally speaking when people vape it they can be very confident in the fact that they have a very determined idea of exactly what their dosages and when and how they're going to apply it now if you've chosen to vape CBD there are a couple avenues you can take some of which are related to ease of use other ones about more precise dosage and control of dosage now the easiest thing that you can do would be to purchase something like one of these ten mil pre-mixed CBD infused e-liquid by us here at mist the e-liquid clocking in at a hundred milligrams which is a fairly reasonably strong dose one that you'll certainly get the chance to feel and a great way to experiment with the subject with the substance without having to worry about it being too strong too weak anything like that using something like this all you would need to do is purchase yourself a simple mouth to lung kit or some kind of POD system and then like usual just go about filling it the way that you normally would no complication to it and those strangeness and like usual just pop it in the side and fill up to about the top of your window I do specify the use of a mouth to lung machine like this because the majority of pre-mixed CBD II liquids are going to be very PG heavy they're rarely very thick however there are as an alternative we would recommend these these are what we refer to as CBD booster shots these are effectively CBD top-ups all you would need to be doing is getting an empty tank popping in something like two to four to six droplets of this substance in there and then just filling it the rest of the way with your favorite eliquid these booster shots generally are going to be a little bit pricier than the pre-mixed ones but this is because they are going to last you these are far stronger coming in 500 milligram and a thousand milligrams spectively you will need to be adding this by the droplet now don't worry about getting nervous about measurements here on our website just type in CBD calculator we have a very simple to use robust system that will take a few details from you like how much CBD do you have let's say 10 mils of it how strong is it let's say 500 milligrams grant how big is your tank probably a 2 mil tank if you bought it in the UK and then what's your preferred daily dosage and then you just type that in hit the button that will instantly tell you how many drops of CBD booster to add to your tank so as to infuse it and infuse your favorite a liquid with your daily dosage now there are a couple different varieties of CBD that are used in a liquid and the mist range uses a particular one known as full-spectrum CBD as opposed to the previous industry standard of CBD isolate CBD isolate is painstakingly extracted from the plant and it's an extremely pure process they just take the absolutely necessary CBD from the plan the CBD we use here at mist is referred to as full-spectrum CBD full-spectrum as a post isolate takes everything it legally can from the plant so as to give you the most possible good in your substance we hope we've given you some good explanation as to the ease of vaping CBD today if you would like some more info please come on down to any of our retail locations for

Christie and we're here at the pottery in Los Angeles today we're going to talk about cannabis sublinguals people like tinctures if they don't like to smoke anything if they prefer faster method of ingestion or faster activation compared to edibles and it's more direct than say a topical or anything like that it's still getting into your bloodstream and it's still you know if you're taking active THC it's gonna get into your bloodstream as an active cannabinoid a team shirts are good for places where you can't smoke maybe you can't even be seen smoking something just discrete easy to use one you would just take your dose is worth you know whether that's a drop or a full dropper full and you just put it you know open the dropper put it under your tongue and let it rest under your tongue for about 15 seconds it usually takes about 15 to 40 minutes to feel the effects but it could take up to two hours so don't double down until those two hours have passed so the first one I want to talk about is the love potion number seven from Humboldt apothecary this is just a strictly THC tincture technically a sublingual it's in MCT oil and it's got it also has damiana cinnamon kava kava I guess to get the blood pumping if you will considering this one's called love potion number seven that sounds good and then next I've got a CBD sublingual from prana this one there p5 is a non psychoactive or non intoxicating CBD only tincture and this one's got 400 milligrams CBD in it and nothing else besides ACDC terpenes which is your CBD strain so it's CBD flour whole plant cannabis derived terpenes and CBD but there is no trace THC in this this is just pure CBD in terms of cannabinoids this one is a normal eye dropper I just don't have it is childproof on the outside so I can't quite take it out to show you but rest assured it's gonna look like your typical eyedropper it's gonna look like an eye dropper but you in your mouth so the next one I've got a high CBD meta haze tincture from chemistry so this one is interesting because it has CBD a in it CBD a is the raw form of CBD so it still has an extra oxygen molecule but in this case we've got both it's got CBD and CBD a as well as THC and THC a so this is a really nice combination of the raw cannabinoids as well as active cannabinoids you will experience a little bit of psycho activity due to the THC the high CBD should help with any anxiety or paranoia again if you're not comfortable with THC this one's probably not for you if you are comfortable th see this would be a really great awake painkiller or anxiety reliever now we've got a 1 to 1 tincture that's THC to CBD strictly coconut oil cannabis oil nothing more nothing less in a 1 to 1 ratio which is the you know the optimum healing ratio it is going to be psychoactive but it's also going to be very effective for pain relief maybe help you sleep at night as well but this one will definitely have some psychoactive effect so up next we've got something from one of my favorite brands poppin barclays right ratio pack this is a new thing from them you've got a 30 to 1 CBD the THC tincture and a one to thirty th see the CBD tincture essentially what they want you to do with this is create your own ratios they're giving you the full CBD one with trace THC and the full THC one with trace CBD that way you can make your own ratios you can do a four to one or essentially they're giving you the power to find out what works best for you it's a really good product for somebody who wants to experiment maybe try a little bit more THC than they're used to or a little more CBD to see what that does so all in all I like to think that sublinguals and tinctures as opposed to something like a pill or a vape pen stays true to the spirit of cannabis and that sort of holistic natural wellness side of things where you know you'll take a team cheer for it as opposed to taking a pill or a battery vape pen or something it's a very natural way of dealing

[Music]", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

But I wait.\n- Right, so the science. - Oh, yeah, we gotta get-- - If you're new to our channel. - Sorry Chris we've gotta-- - No problem I can duck. - This is all the commercial part now.

Go to Instagram or Twitter, we've got a 60 second version of us and if you go to Facebook you'll also get our giveaways. It's always pinned to the top. - Pinned to the top, yes! - All right. All I've been hearing about CBD oil, Brad, is that it's good. - Right. - Like it's a miracle drug. - Right, it's gonna... You're gonna lose weight by it, you can cure your cancer, all kinds of things\n- And anxiety-depression. and I'm thinking, well it's a CBD oil. Does it look-- You know little bottles like this. - Yeah it looks very harmless. - Maybe it's one of those\nthings that can work, but we're gotta find\nout what's behind this. So we've got Chris here, so. - So, do we wanna say what it is first? - Well I mean, CBD oil is one of the, you know there's the marijuana plant and basically, it's got about 140 some odd chemicals that come out of it, but the one that we're-- It's true that most people\nare interested in is THC which is the one that gets you high it's the one that everybody\nseems to be all about. - Sure. - But CBD is actually the one that's kind of catching on and it's an interesting chemical compound, because you don't get high from it and with the new guidelines in your state and you should probably check with your state's laws and ordinances, but most of it's pretty much dekernalized, because the CBD oils that\nyou see everywhere now in gas stations, supermarkets,\npharmacies, vape shops I mean they all basically\ncome from, essentially, hemp. And so hemp, by design,\nfor basically the laws, can only contain 0.3% THC. So there's no chance that\nyou can get high from it. - Or less. - To a degree and we say\nthat with the degree, because the, you know the products that are out there, not\neverything's what it seems. - All monitored the way it should be. - I mean it's the wild wild west right now and I think we really, you know, I think we have to pump\nthe breaks a little bit. Some of the claims with\nCBD are a little crazy and, you know, people want to gravitate to something that's gonna help. I mean if you have a problem\nlike anxiety-depression you know, you want relief\nfrom pain from cancer, or arthritis or, you know, what have you and actually, more importantly,\nseize your control. I mean I think it really does have applications for patients. So, but we're probably easily 20 years behind the 8-ball insofar as trying to get up to date with the research that needs to be done and-- - Which is interesting, because it's been around a long time. - It's been around for thousands of years. - Right, that's what I thought. - So it's not like it's\nbrand spanking new, but I think with the decriminalization of marijuana and the\nstates now legalizing it, I think you're finding that people are gravitating towards alternate routes of healthcare. - Sure. - And I think that, again, there's lots of research\nthat needs to be done. So it's not just a simple\ncut and dry yeah and try it. - Right. - I mean, it's something\nthat may work for you, but there's risks associated with it, too. I mean we have to watch it, you know it can make you\nfeel nauseous or queasy, it can affect your liver so we do have to be careful and-- - And you mentioned\nthe percentage of that, can you do that again? - Well... - This was with seizures? - Well, yeah and there's actually the only prescription CBD product out there is a seizure drug called Epidiolex and it's used for two very specific seizure disorders typically in children and they've, you know, it's right in their safety guidelines it is a black box warning that says you do need to make sure that you're taking liver\ntests on these patients and, you know, from\nfive to 20% of patients have had either liver failure or at least liver injury. So with that particular-- - Again, what was that, how much? - Liver failure-- Oh, five to 20%. - Which is a significant amount. - And that's specifically for Epidiolex, which is a very, very\npotent prescription version of CBD, so it's not like the products that you're getting anywhere else. So, there's a clear distinction that has to be made.\n- Sure. - Isn't that a topical use or is it oral? - Well, CBD can be ingested\nin many different ways. You can-- - But I mean for that specific-- - For that one it's an oral medication. - Oh, okay. - So you take by mouth. So from that standpoint and, again, it's a very\nspecific subset of people, so. - Yeah, Chris, talk about how people do take the oil. - Yeah, so I mean CBD can be ingested-- So let's say you're somebody that has you know, performance anxiety if we're gonna do something like this. I did not use CBD before we came on. (Bob and Brad laughing) - We better test you maybe. - And it shows up on tests so you do have to be careful with that and we can touch on that later, too. But, let's say somebody's a little bit uncomfortable about speaking, just an anxious situation or just has an anxious day, CBD does have a tendency\nto work for people to help them to kind of feel a little bit more\nrelaxed in some cases, but you should always\ncheck with your doctor to make sure it's appropriate for you, so. - And like doses, is there any idea what dose to take? - And, again, remember how I kind of said wild wild west. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - That's part of the problem is we're really behind in the science that we need to do applicable doses. One interesting study that I read that was, probably poor science, but at least showed some results, was a Brazilian study and there is, you know they just took\npeople that wanted to do, kind of did a public speaking simulation, and so they kind of came\nup with a target dose, so they had about 53 people come through the study and basically set 'em in a scenario where they had to speak in front of people so it created that anxiety. - Sure.\n- Sure. - So they just didn't quite feel right or comfortable. So they tried varying doses of CBD and so what they seem to-- and it was an oral dose, it comes out to be 300mg seemed to be the sweet spot, so that seemed to work really well. The interesting thing on the study was that a does as low\nas 150mg was useless and a dose as high as 600mg was useless. - No kidding. - But 300 was kind of right in the middle. So it's kind of an interesting-- So that's just one example. It wasn't double blinded so we didn't see a placebo done with that, so let's say, you know in my world a lot of times doctors\nwill prescribe Propranolol for people for, you know\nspeaking engagements. It works really well, but you know, it'd be nice to see it get one-on-one. - Right. - You know, just to see what's going on. - Compare the two. - And I'm sure that there's research facilities out there and you know, in the university setting it's a hot topic, but it's hard to come by so it's interesting the consumers can get it all you want, but the universities\nhave trouble getting it to study it. - So it's kind of...\n- Okay. - Yeah, kind of an\ninteresting conundrum, so. - So at your pharmacy, I mean how is it offered? - Well, where I work\nit's basically gonna be something that's gonna be a topical. So, it's gonna be something that you would rub on to... You know, so it's gonna be for pain it can actually be used for anxiety, it can be used to rest-- - So you just rub it on your skin? - Yup and there's also-- - Non-prescription? - Non-prescription right off the shelf. - Right off the shelf. - And then you know there's drops that you can place underneath your tongue. So we were kind of talking\nabout ways to ingest it, it's such a wide topic. So you can vape it-- - So is it, I'm sorry to cut you off, but like when you get it in your pharmacy does it tell dosages to take it at? Or are people gonna be reluc--\n- They have suggested-- - I mean do they just jump in and use it as much as they want? - It's interesting, 'cause I kind of looked at some of the\nproducts that we carry and so they have you\nknow, for anxiety relief, for pain relief, you know to help you to rest, calms, so they have all sorts of different names and packaging that kind\nof suggest their uses and they give guidelines, but there's not a controlled dose. So it's very, very difficult to figure out just how much is enough and so that's the problem. Is we just don't have\nenough controlled studies, (Chris clears his throat) 'scuse me, that show what we should be dosing it as, the reg-- And you know, so they'll suggest a-- - Are these large companies\nthat are offering this that you feel that you\ncan trust at this point as far as the quality of the product - You now, I mean, as a business person I think they're all\ntrying to get it right. I would imagine that they're all trying to make the best and greatest. So I mean there's different\nways to process it, to extract it and they're\nworking, you know, to try and make it emulsified\nso that it absorbs better more effectively, so\nthat you're getting more bang for your buck. So I think there's a lot of good science that's going into it, but what we need is the\nscience, the research to show proper dose and proper frequency, minimization of side-effects, you know, things that we\nhave to be careful with insofar as liver damage and you know which is actually\na big thing with that. You know if you're on a blood thinner, I mean it's certainly something that we wanna be mindful of, because there is a risk for bleeding out which is very, very significant. - A lot of people are on blood thinners, so this is really\nimportant for you to know. - So if you're on blood thinners and you're considering CBD, you better consult with your physician. - I would say, I would just say no at this point. - Okay.\n- Oh really? - It's that cut and dry. - Well, you know 'cuase\nyou just don't know and we don't know the doses. It varies form batch to batch. I mean there was a study that showed that you know, they took all\nthese samples of products and only 20% actually had the right amount of CBD in there. - That's what I was wondering. - So there was stuff\nthat had much too much, there was stuff that had much too little and there was stuff that had actually a lot of THC in there, which is the active\ncomponent in marijuana. So and what I kind of\nsaid, briefly, earlier so putting yourself at risk I mean, you can test positive, so. You know with the decriminalization of it I think there's a lot\nof employers, these days that may or may not have problems with it, but, again, you should\ncheck with your employer, you should check with your doctor. I mean these are things that you really wanna be clear on. - Right if you're in a position that there's no tolerance for it, I mean maybe a pilot,\nor something like that, I mean you don't want to take a chance. - It could cause problems. - Sure. - So we wanna be real careful with that, but again, you know with\nyour own health, too. You wanna make sure that it's something that's\nsafe with your medication. So, I mean-- - So, Chris, how long\nyou been a pharmacist? - 24 years. - So it's 24 years, have you seen drugs like this before that, I know I'm putting you on the spot, but like that seems like it's having so much promise and then all of a sudden, you know, they kind of unveil, take the wrapping off and they find out, no\nthis is not as good as-- - Yeah. I've seen it on the\nprescription side of things. - Sure. - So there's many, many\nthings that the FDA has, you know allowed to go through and then all of a sudden as we get into larger scale more mass people taking it. - Yeah. - All of a sudden there's\nacute liver failure, I mean Viox was a very popular-- - Yeah, I was gonna bring up Viox. - So I figured you guys\nare physical therapists so I'm sure you guys remember\nthat anti-inflammatory. - Sure. - My mom was on it and-- - It was a great drug. - Yeah it was the drug! - But, but... (Chris laughs) - Yeah. - It caused cardiovascular problems so, yeah, so they pulled\nit off the market. - So we've seen this before. I mean, you know, it comes\nout with great promise and then you realize you\nknow take the veil off. - Yeah and I think, yeah there's times when you have to pump the breaks. - Yeah. - And I think we just need to learn more so that we can help people to, hopefully maybe even help themselves, but I think it works well when you have a physician that's on board and is knowledgeable with\nthe products as well, or your pharmacist or\nyour nurse practitioner or your PA or whomever you get your healthcare benefits, your care through.\n- Service, yeah. - So I think it's important to make sure that everybody has kind\nof a teamize approach to ensure that we can do what's safest for the patient, to ensure that they're\ngetting the safest thing that they can do for themselves. But we just don't even know real doses. - Sure. - Touching on that earlier example I said. So it's really, really high-- - You go low you go high\nan it'd be ineffective and you gotta really find that sweet spot. So how do you do that? - And what are the\ndangers if you're taking other prescriptions? - Right, right. - So it's something to be you know you want a grain\nof salt with this one. You wanna be super careful with it, but I mean, I think that it, you know there's lots of studies that are now showing that yes it can help you with\nanxiety and depression. So, is it something that we wanna embrace? I think it's certainly something that we can reach out for and see if we can help some people. - Sure, right. - But, again, you wanna do it in a very professional\nsetting insofar as allowing your doctor to be in on the care plan. I think that's very, very important. You know, some people self-medicate and it's certainly a\nchoice that can be made by themselves, but it's just something to just be aware of the risks, I mean,\nso you wanna make sure that probably if you're\ngonna be a user of it that you probably see your regular doctor to make sure that they're looking at your liver functioning. So that's one of the few organs we don't replace well. (Brad laughing) So that's certainly something-- and that's not a joke. - Yeah.\n- Right. - I mean it's something that we have to be careful with that, because we just don't know these doses. And, again, yeah so if you're gonna choose something be consistent. Probably go to the same source, go to the same product. - Sure. - Go to the same retailer, because I think from that standpoint you can always guarantee\nthat you're getting at least the same quality product that your body is adjusted to. - So you mentioned anxiety and depression, is there any other area that you think this is really showing\npromise in right now? - Well, yeah, I mean if you wanna look at, specifically medical marijuana, so it's a little bit off topic, but medical marijuana has THC and CBD. So you get the benefits of both. - Sure. - And it think from-- So if you're somebody that's suffering severely from cancer pain. - Sure. - Or glaucoma, or and\nactually seizure disorders, those three in particular probably show that medical marijuana probably has a real application in all three for very different reasons. - What about CBD oil? - Well CBD oil will work in\nall those cases, as well, but medical marijuana, specifically... - But medical marijuana\nwill be a step above that. - If you are a cancer\npatient and you can't you know you're taking something like a very strong prescription narcotic. - Sure. - Don't know I'll just throw\nup Fentanyl, for example or Oxycodone for example. - Sure. - Which are buzz topics in the medical world, as well. You know some people have just found that the medical marijuana provides them better pain relief and they don't feel as weird form the side-effects\nthat the opioids create. - Sure. - So I think from a\nstandpoint of quality of life I think there's an application, but again, we have to be super careful, we have to make sure that it's legal in your state, we have to make sure that your doctor's on board with it. - We were talking before, Chris, you and I and didn't you mention\nthere is a CBD oil-based prescription that is used for seizures? - Yup. - You've seen it's very\neffective and it's-- - Well, it's a newer product that came out last year and it's called Epidiolex. - But isn't that the one\nthat you said is topical? - No, no, no. These are there's actually some very-- For CBD oil and seizure control there's some incredible videos out there of patients that have had severe seizures and then they take a CBD oil product and actually I've seen it\napplied on a child's feet and it actually abated the seizure. I mean it's almost\nmiraculous what it can do. There are applications\nwhere they're studying for Parkinsonism insofar\nas kind of helping with the motor movement to try and help with the issues with that. There's some, actually\ninteresting topically, they talk about actually\nits improvement for acne. So I mean it's certainly something that can certainly help out. I think the mainstays are gonna be anxiety-depression, pain\nrelief and seizure control are the main ones, but it's got a lot of other claims. I think we have to be careful, because there's some wild claims out there that say it may cure cancer. - Right. - I think that the carrot\nis way out in front of the horse on that one.\n- Sure, yeah. - I think with proper medical research, large scale studies, I think maybe we can\nsee some very positive effects that may occur from it, but we still don't know the dangers of it. And you know and I think\nwhat we're gonna see when more and more people start to use these products we're gonna start to see a litany of side-effects do occur. - Sure. - That will become--\n- Years down the road? - Years, you know, days,\nyears, weeks, months. - Yeah. - I mean it just kind of depends. - Sure. - You know, because if you\nreport it to your doctor then they can pout it into a database and then they can actually learn from it so we can do more for\npeople and hopefully-- - They'll learn from experience, especially if someone's been down the road for a long time here. (Brad laughs) I mean in all seriousness, I mean these things start to crop up. So you really wanna have shown caution. - Oh yeah. Very much so, very much so. - All right. - Any other final thoughts? - No, I mean I think, again, I think we just have to make sure that we're being careful with our usage of it. I think it may have a place in medicine. I just, you know I just stress to anybody if it's an interest that you have, to discuss it with your physician, because I think-- - That's step one. - Yeah, that's your first step you wanna-- Whoever your provider is, I mean it's just something to just-- And then you know the sourcing of it and the dosing of it, so. - Right. - Be consistent where you get it from. - Sure. - And I think there's a lot of knowledgeable people out there that do sell the products and so, you know it's their life, you know it's their livelihood. And so they're gonna take the time and care about you and try and provide you with the best product. I don't know that I would necessarily go to your local gas station and buy it. - Exactly. - Because I don't think they're gonna be the knowledgeable ones, but when you go to a retail\nsetting a retail store that does sell these things I think you can get a\nlittle bit more information. Do research on your own, too. I think there's small volumes of evidence, but be careful with it. And that's why I think it's important to have a dialogue with\nyour physician or caretaker, because they're the ones that can help kind of sift you through what's right what's wrong, was it really good data? Are we missing something. - Yeah. - We just wanna keep everybody safe. - Right. - And I think that's\nthe most important thing that we can take away from this. - Right. - So once again we wanna thank Chris for taking the time, all right. Man does this guy have\nknowledge in his head or what? - Yeah, it comes out well. (Bob and Brad applauding) - Thanks everyone. - Yeah, thanks everybody for watching.", "pScK_MW5taA": "[Music] hey beautiful people this is a warning that you must be the legal smoking age to view my

practices and care about their community to create our relief bomb we use our proprietary infusion process utilizing heat water and pressure and no chemicals or solvents this transfers the cannabinoids from the plants into the oil maintaining the full spectrum of the plant we then mix that infused pure coconut oil with essential oils vitamin E and beeswax beeswax is a primary ingredient in the balm and we source from only top-tier organic farms we designed a heated filtration process on the fresh capping wax to remove impurities we blend all of these ingredients together with a combination of artisanal blending and automation to finish our product we use premium sustainable packaging and that's how we make our world-class bombs crafted with care for you and the ones you love", "qXTz_JpZoaU": "[Music] hey guys it's shaylee i am really happy to be making this video today i know it's a little bit different from what i normally do you know talking about makeup or clothes or vlogging but today's video i think is so important if you do watch my other videos you know that i have struggled with anxiety for a very long time you know this year i think it has been introduced into people's lives that have never had it before which is really unfortunate but looking at my wiener dog over here trying to climb up on the table what you doing girl you want to say hi to everybody say hi i'm in this video later i have something that's even for dogs for anxiety so i'm going to share that it just was weighing on my heart to make this video and i'm just really excited to share some things with you guys that i think really helped so i have five products today that i want to share with you and then i'm gonna make a follow-up video about things you can like physically do that i think help with anxiety so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss that second video like a little mini series but yeah let's just get started five things you can go out and buy that are gonna help you with anxiety okay so the first product that i think totally helps with anxiety is cbd you can get cbd so many different ways and i feel like it's one of those products that people might be a little afraid of because they think am i gonna get high is this gonna like make me get in trouble at work but cbd oil is legal it will not get you in trouble like on a drug test it won't make you feel high it just helps calm your body down there's so many things that cbd does you can google it and you will learn all about it but what i personally use it for is anxiety and then i have back pain sometimes from my job so i use it because it's anti-inflammatory so i have used several different kinds of cbd i've done like the gummies i've done bath bombs um and then the main thing that i incorporate in my life that i know helps with anxiety is oil it's something you could just take every single day i'm gonna do it right now to share it with you guys so this brand you guys know i like to keep it real this brand did reach out to me and asked if i wanted to use their oil and try it out and i was like absolutely because that's something i've already used for years why not try a new brand so the way you use it is you put it under your tongue i like to take about half of a dropper just like that and then you wait 60 seconds [Music] and then you swallow it this brand in particular they're called premium jane who reached out to me and i just love their name first of all premium jane classic so when they reached out to me the first thing i did was i went to their website obviously you guys were putting this in our body and just because i had tried cbd oil i wasn't just like yeah send it over i wanted to make sure it was a good brand and i actually was really pleasantly surprised everything they make is from hemp grown here in the usa they have third party testing which i thought was really cool because again we're putting this in our body so to pay someone else to test their products and make sure they're good that's awesome you can check this all out on the website i'll link everything down below obviously and i liked on their website how they had all these different flavors and that's kind of what makes me like them the best i like i said i've tried other brands the flavor was just kind of if you've tried cbd oil it tastes kind of like weed it does and this is the first one i've tried that i'm like oh the flavor i got is mint and it's actually super refreshing danny even commented on it because he's been trying this too he's like that's actually really good so that's one thing i really like also about it but if oil isn't for you you can do they have gummies and they have bath bombs and they have topical lotions and the funnest thing is that they have dog treats too which is so exciting i will insert the footage from the first time i gave these to my dog so they could try it i like them because they're these little tiny mushy treats i was afraid they're going to be hard and my dogs don't really eat hard treats so these are chewy sit rose good girl good girl you like it gracie girl here you go yum belly bear she's the picky one she even took it are you gonna eat it are you gonna eat it she's taking it this one scarfed it down so did that one she's eating it that's amazing because she just ate that and she is my picky girl that like won't eat a lot of different things i'm gonna link everything down below and it's awesome because they gave me a discount code for you guys so if you use the code shaylee at checkout you can get 20 off i very first started trying cbd i was like wow this is kind of expensive but you have to think it's a self it's a form of self care you're really taking care of yourself it compounds in your body so like the longer you use it the more you feel the effects it might last me about a month maybe less because i'm going to be sharing it with danny because he also uses cbd oil so we might just order like two different flavors okay the second product that i know is going to totally help you with anxiety because i use it all the time is essential oils so the brand i like is called doterra if you've never heard of them you're probably living under a rock but anyways i will also link their website down below essential oils are so great for so many things but for anxiety i just feel like it's one of those instant gratification things so the most basic one i think for having anxious moments would be lavender because it's just so calming what i like to do is just put a couple drops in my hands rub them together and then just like breathe it in it's just like an instant calming effect i love it eucalyptus is another one i love i love putting this in my bath water if i'm just trying to have like a really calm zen bath i will i think i've shown you guys on a vlog i will just like make it the most calm environment in my bathroom i'll put spa music on i'll put these oils in the bathtub i just i'll put incense or candles on i love it and then another one i really wanted to mention was breathe you guys know this year we're dealing with a pandemic that attacks the respiratory system so i'm sure this has happened to you if you have anxiety you'll sit there and you'll think like oh my god can i breathe like do i have it i know it might sound crazy if you don't have anxiety and you're just randomly watching this video but if you have anxiety i know you know what i'm talking about i've literally laid in bed and been like oh my god can i breathe and i will freak myself out so i have used breathe and same thing you put in your hands i don't want to put a ton more oil in my hand but you just breathe it in and it's just like great to help you breathe anytime but especially when we're dealing with what we're dealing with this year so that is number two essential oils okay so you've already taken your cbd oil for the day you've already smelled in these essential oils to help calm you now we're gonna make a calming drink sometimes when i have anxiety just like doing something that's mindless you know like making a fun pretty drink can kind of just take you out for a minute too like take your brain to a positive space if it's like daytime i'll just do tea with some lemon in it i like lots of different teas but for night this is my absolute favorite i've talked about this a ton on instagram it's called this is basically an anti-stress drink is what it says on the front and it is a magnesium supplement so if you get like cramping and stuff it's great for that too this is the flavor raspberry lemon it also comes in an unflavored option but i like the raspberry lemon a lot i'll even add some lemon wedges into it to just make it a little bit stronger lemony pop my little electric kettle on get a coffee mug and i put like a teaspoon of this maybe a little bit more and pour my hot water in there and then like i said i add a lemon wedge it is so good everyone in my family is so into it like danny's into it emily and sean my sister and brother-in-law when they come stay with us it's like a nightly thing like we make four cups of calm and everyone drinks it it's delicious you can get this on amazon so the fourth thing is this little guy and i don't know what he's actually called but he is a projector and he puts stars up on the ceiling in your room so i like to plug him in at night time and you can pick different colors you can pick different there's different settings when you click the link to go see this on amazon it'll show you pictures i like the color blue and i will put it on the one that has the stars going in and out like in brightness because it's just like a visual thing that helps calm me down i like to watch the stars like come in and come out if you have anxiety another thing that people tell you to do is like what can you see what can you smell like when you're having a really anxious moment you need to focus on something so for me that's one visual thing i like to do when i'm anxious is just like watch the stars i don't know if that sounds weird but it just it's so reminiscent too of being a kid that i think that nostalgia calms me down because don't you guys remember when you were little the little mobiles or what are they called like they were little projectors i had one that would put butterflies um around in my room so this just kind of takes me back i think it's kind of weird maybe if you're an adult having this in your room but i don't care i love it and i also love it because it's a bluetooth speaker so i'll put like calming music on my phone like waves or um you know spa music and you can hook it up so it's not right there next to you at your bed table it's across the room where i plug this in so that's why i love this so much okay last but definitely not least is this guy and i'm so sorry if it has dog hair on it it's the life i live here with three dogs but this is a weighted blanket and i found mine at walmart this is actually danny's i bought it for danny like two years ago and we use it all the time it's pretty small it's not like a full blanket like a comforter it's just a blanket so you can sit on the couch with it or we just drape it across the two of us on the top section of us and it just makes you feel like you're being cuddled and ours is 12 pounds i really wouldn't suggest going any bigger than that because or heavier than that rather because then i feel like it would do the opposite like if i couldn't move i feel like that would give me anxiety so i feel like 12 pounds is perfect i don't know how that works if it's a bigger blanket if you'd have to go up and wait but maybe just start around there i am telling you guys if you take some cbd oil smell in some essential oils take a drink of kong put on that starry night projector and lay with that blanket you cannot tell me your anxiety won't at least be a little bit better so i really hope you enjoyed this video please before you leave if you have products that you love to help calm your anxiety please leave them in the comments below so we could all read them obviously i only talked about five today there's so many more and i will see you guys really soon thank you again for watching", "UnIG_E16fuM": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to dose your CBD infused edibles so first things first how do you calculate the amount of CPP in your hand well as long as you purchase your seeds or dried hemp buds from a reputable source it should come with an estimate percentage of total CBD the percentage of CBD is calculated from dried trimmed buds so all you need to do is take the total weight of the buds after drying it and then multiply it by the CBD percentage to get an estimate of the total amount of CBD in the buds for example if a plant is able to produce 15% CBD then for each one gram of dried hemp buds there's a hundred and fifty milligrams of CBD with this calculation you can easily estimate the amount of CBD needed for every recipe based on how much dried buds are used as part of the recipe as for how much CBD you want in your products there isn't a one-size-fits-all amount and there will be some trial and error when gauging your proper dosage since the effects of CBD will vary from person to person if you're not sure how much you need it's always best to start low around ten to twenty milligrams for adults per serving and gradually increase the amount if needed based on your medicinal need so for example let's say you want to make and infuse the brownie with 25 milligrams of CBD per serving working backwards each pan of brownies can be cut into 24 cubes so in total you'll need 600 milligrams of CBD for the entire batch now that we have the total amount CBD needed for the recipe we just need to match that with the amount of hemp buds needed to equal that amount if we use a batch of buds with 15% CBD we'll need to use four grams of decarboxylated dried buds in total to infuse with the butter for this recipe [Music] and that's it", "ECC_KgUep14": "hi I'm cat with cats naturals and I would like to introduce you to our brand new topical cream which is a 600 milligram in a click dose applicator this was created for the people who don't like the mess on their hands and it's a little bit stronger each bottle has 45 milliliters and one click equals one milliliter and 15 milligrams of CBD all you do is you take off the top and you're going to see a bunch of holes on the top and then this bottom is your click doser every click equals one milliliter when you get it you're going to see no cream at the top and this may require a few clicks from the bottom just to get you started but once it starts coming out of the top click to dose apply to the location where you want it no mess [Music] you", "hjA1Cn9o6oo": "[Music] hi we are talking today about skin care specifically as it relates to both psoriasis and something called keratosis polaris also known as kp now you all know i am a pilates teacher i'm a physical therapist i am not a dermatologist at all i'm giving you this information because i personally was diagnosed with psoriasis over 10 years ago i know what it's like to suffer through that and then our beautiful daughter was born with kp she is almost 8 now so i've spent the better part of a decade trying to research and find natural products things that i can buy over the counter talk to dermatologists on how we can manage both of those things in our household so that's where i'm coming from with this i'm going to tell you the products we have found that we really like that work i can tell you some of the things that i have tried that don't work and i can tell you when i have gone to a dermatologist to get medication because there's definitely times i've had to do that as well and then at the end i'll tell you how we use all of them in a daily routine that works for us i have found that for both of those conditions psoriasis and kp it's a very similar routine even though they have different mechanisms on how they work as a skin condition so it's really nice that we can actually use the same thing so i'll go through that i can't tell you if it helps rosacea eczema those kind of things feel free to leave it in the comments someone else might be able to help you with those but i can't comment on those because i have never dealt with them personally this is just my experience okay so we're going to start with the most mild and then we're going to move to probably the least mild of the products that we have used so for psoriasis just to keep in mind it is characterized by what they call scales or plaques it gets really itchy the skin can dry into these scales and then sometimes they'll fall off it's very different than dandruff go to a doctor if you aren't sure that's how i was diagnosed finally i did kind of figure it out on myself but i was diagnosed by a dermatologist for me i get it the most on the back of my scalp here so that'll be a little different because there's shampoo options so back of my scalp sometimes my earlobes and then i have had one really bad case on my face a few years ago and that is when i went to the doctor and got medicine right away it hurt it was itchy it was red it was bad and it was gone within a week with medication so there are going to be times that you are going to want to go that route i am talking today about the things that you can use at home that we use to help us manage things kp i can tell you is characterized they call it chicken skin our daughter was born with it both of these conditions are incurable there's not a cure for them it's again something that you want to manage many times with kids um the research shows that it can be gone by the age of 30. i know it isn't always but for many it is it's what the literature says so it's characterized by bumpy skin um sometimes it can get itchy in our daughter with her it's worse in the heat so in the summer when she's sweating a lot it gets worse but typically it's upper arms thighs and face and again it's just bumpy skin 99 of the time it doesn't bother her whatsoever and so i'm the one right as a mom telling her we're going to do these things to help manage it so let me tell you what we use all right so these are the products that we have found that we like that i keep here at the house one of the most important things that you can do to keep yourself and your skin healthy is to stay hydrated and i personally know how hard that can actually be i have great aspirations every morning to drink my water and by the end of the day i feel like i've never had enough built boost actually helps me hydrate myself it is a powder that you put in 16 ounces of water it's delicious and it's full of vitamins that i need vitamin b vitamin c so it helps boost my immune system it also has echinacea and it gives me natural energy so i don't crash i feel good and i know i'm staying hydrated my friends at built boost have offered you a coupon use code volant20 v-a-l-a-n-t 20 to get 20 off your order and the link is below so i'm going to tell you first kind of like i said the most mild and i'm going to show you both of these coconut oil and shea butter i'm going to start with coconut oil so when i first started researching this years and years ago coconut oil wasn't coming up very much but i knew it was something that worked well on skin from other research and things i had tried and things i had done so i used it first on myself on my scalp and found that it actually worked pretty well and then what i did is i ended up mixing it with some shea butter because with both kp and psoriasis one of the things is you want to keep it moisturized okay that's what it needs with the psoriasis specifically what happens is you keep it moisturized when you're in a flare and it can help the plaques come off that scaly stuff come off so what i find that i would do is use the coconut oil again on the back both on my earlobes when they were really itchy and dry and they hurt and then also on the back of my scalp i would put it on on the in the morning on the day that i'm gonna wash my hair that night because it is oily it's something to keep in mind i know so we have to work around these things so i put it on the back of my scalp in the morning it would help some of those plaques come off it would calm the itching down and then that night i would wash my hair i would wait a couple days and do it again and then what ended up working really well for me was i would mix one part coconut oil with one part shea butter because this is less oily this is a great natural moisturizer and so i would keep that just in a little tub that i made myself again half and half it's shelf stable so i would just keep it in with my skin care stuff and i would use it again sometimes at night on the back of my scalp and sleep that way on my face on my earlobes and that was my first foray my first step into trying to kind of deal with it naturally and that worked really well and i still use this and i think it's great on kids as well okay so this is something that if my daughter was six months old i would be happy to rub coconut oil on her skin to help because what you're trying to do is soften up those bumps okay so these are two things that i found are really really helpful for me now one other thing and i don't have it here to show you but something that i have found in the last year that i adore and use a lot is cbd sav okay so cbd and the sav is a rub basically it's not lotion it's actually called sav s-a-l-v-e and it is great for skin i have found it personally and again there's also some cases out there that show that it can be really good for skin conditions i have now used that a little bit more than the coconut oil so i will use them both and interchange them especially again on the back of my scalp but that cbd salve has been a life changer for me just on managing when it's itchy when it's bothering me it also is something i feel comfortable using on my seven-year-old again it's topical you guys cbd sav has no marijuana properties whatsoever in it so don't worry about that you can go do your research on it but um it's something that'll rub in and can help so i use that mostly on myself occasionally i have used it on her arms but mostly on myself and it's something that i really have had good results with okay so let's move now into something called kp away so i want to talk a little bit about age so those like i said are the most mild things that i have that i would be comfortable if my daughter was six months old putting those on her body she is now almost eight so we're at a point we're trying to you know find some things she can do for herself and manage it and that we can both kind of use so this is something i found recently we're halfway through this it's called kp away and it's kind of something i found that's called a cult favorite so we're going through the whole tub and so i can't tell you whether it's something that really has had great results or not because they say to use the whole tub about 90 days use it before you see results but a lot of parents say they're seeing great results with this i like it because it is free of all the stuff out there i don't want on her body so that is something that's been hard for me to find it's important to me to have products that do not have parabens in them that do not have sulfates in them you want things that don't have fragrance if you can help it you want the most mild sensitive things that you can find for both skin conditions and there's a lot of reasons i don't want parabens in our bodies so i find things that don't have parabens for our family but at the same time it's hard to find things that then have the added ingredients and properties that we need for these skin conditions so kpoa doesn't have any of that yucky stuff in it it has water it has coconut oil it has um emulsifying wax in it it has things that are meant to keep the skin moisturized and it's just a white lotion i don't know if you can see inside it's just a white lotion and it's nice because it's less oily than the coconut oil so one thing i will tell you is a lot of these things are going to feel like the coconut oil they're going to feel oily i don't like it either but i can deal with it and i'm an adult kids not so much at least my kid first off i'm not gonna load her up with oil in the morning on her body and have her rub it all over our furniture and two bless her heart our kids sometimes are sensitive with what goes on their bodies and their skin right so this is nice because it's a lit it's a thick lotion but it does rub in which is really important to me when it comes to her doing it on her own and us doing it every day so we do it in the morning and we do it at night right after bath or shower and again it's called kp away and it's kp it's specifically formulated for keratosis polaris and i have really liked it so far okay so that is one that i do like now i'm going to start one more mild one this is what we use on our daughter's face so it's actually neutrogena ultra gentle it is paraben free which is nice not all neutrogena products are so i found this one specific i have tried some other face washes i haven't liked as much this one i do really like again it's something she can use on her own or i can use for her when i'm helping her super gentle it's not specifically for kp necessarily but when you are looking at face wash or body wash you want the most gentle least stringent possible okay so that's what i use for her on her face now we're going to go into the things that are a little less gentle because if you've done some research you have probably read about salicylic acid for both of these conditions psoriasis and kp especially so salicylic acid or alpha hydroxy acid or urea sometimes they'll talk about those three things those are all meant to slough off dead skin cells which again with the plaques with psoriasis with kp that can help get to the skin below and then you can moisturize and help that which can help the bumps so salicylic acid again what i have found in my research is that they you don't want to give it to kids under the age of two i personally was not comfortable giving it to our daughter until she was about six okay and let me tell you why if you are a woman who's ever used a serum with alpha hydroxy acid in it and let's say you've put that serum on with possibly a sunburnt face you know how much that can burn because it's actually doing things to your cells it's sloughing off the dead skin cells so imagine doing that to a young child who has sensitive skin already if they don't have the words to tell you that it's hurting then they can't give you that feedback so i knowing what it feels like myself to put it on i was not comfortable giving it to her till she was six until i could get that verbal feedback from her on how it felt so i that was my personal choice again i have read things out there that say you can do it after the age of two i personally didn't want to do it until she was a little bit older than that but salicylic acid i have found really good results for me personally with the psoriasis i have seen good results with our daughter with the kp using products with salicylic acid in it so let me show you one of them that i really like it's a brand called touch this is kp exfoliating lotion it has 12 glycolic acid and 2 salicylic acid touch was actually a brand developed specifically for kp and they've expanded a little bit but it was specifically developed for that has no parabens it has parabens it has no sulfates it has none of that stuff in it and so it's a brand i can trust it's easy to access all of this is really affordable and so this is a brand that i do like we're using their lotion right now it does have the salicylic acid in it so let me tell you what i do this is my mama hint if you have a child with kp who either doesn't like the oil on them or doesn't like to put on lotion or if they're are sensitive and they just don't want anything that might burn a little bit which again salicylic acid will so try it on yourself first one hint try it on yourself first you should know how it feels second try it on them when they're awake let them give you some feedback and if you blow on it right away after you put it on it makes it feel a lot better and it's gone within 30 seconds okay but something to keep in mind but what i typically do is i'll use this for her just once or twice a week i don't use it every day once or twice a week and i go in an hour after she's asleep and i rub it into her face and her upper arms when she's asleep our daughter sleeps really deeply she doesn't wake up she doesn't have to worry about the lotiony feel or the oily feel at all and it can take all night to seep into her skin it doesn't bother her that is how i make some of this work but again try it on them when they're awake get feedback you want to make sure that you're treating your child in a way that they will feel empowered with this that's what i'm working with i know it's hard but i want her to feel empowered about it um okay so that's touch like i said i do really like that and then we're gonna get into two more that i use only for myself i don't use for her i mentioned shampoo because that is where my psoriasis bothers me the most in the back of my scalp here in the bottom so again neutrogena makes two shampoos that are really good one is t sal and that has salicylic acid in it this is actually coal tar believe it or not coal tar is one of the things that can help psoriasis on the scalp and i use it just once a week if i feel it coming on use it once a week you put it on in the shower the directions are here you leave it for five minutes i just put it right here and then i rinse it out and then i wash my whole head with my normal shampoo this stinks to high heaven i will tell you it smells so bad um but once you use your normal shampoo it's kind of okay and it works really well but i only use it once a week if i'm kind of in a flare okay last one you guys are doing great for sticking with me here this is amlactin i don't not know how i stumbled upon this but somehow i did back when i was having one of my worst flares with psoriasis and i swear by it and i keep one in the house at all times now i only use it once a week on my own face because it does have parabens and i don't like that at all parabens are preservatives they're not good but this has worked so well for me to manage again what's on my face that i am just going to use it once a week even once every two weeks it's called amlactin this is the ultra soothing and it does have the alpha hydroxy acid in it okay but i only use it on my face so let me review how we actually use these keeping in mind that kp can be there all the time it might go away as they age my daughter's has definitely decreased as she ages again i'm doing this mostly so that she as she learns about hygiene and how to manage things on her own that she can just feel empowered and make decisions for herself on whether she wants to use things or not i want to really find health what i feel like are healthy products that can help and have them there for her if she wants them and then psoriasis really comes in flares it can go into remission and come back personally i find it gets worse in times of stress it can get worse if i eat a lot of sugar for a long period of time those things kind of things really flare up my psoriasis so i'm in a very much a management stage for it right now so on a daily basis for our daughter we use the kp away every morning every night on her face on her body we use the neutrogena face wash morning and night that's what i use every day that's the basic for her and then i will use the touch on her face and her arms once or twice a week and again typically i just go in and put it on her face and her arms when she's asleep um sometimes she'll let me do it after the shower so that's just once or twice a week i do that okay so that's what i do for her and then for myself i'm using the amlactin as my night lotion once a week maybe or once every two weeks that's a management for my face i use the t-gel shampoo once a week or once every two weeks again just for management on the back of my head here and then i am using the cbd salve again if i start to feel a flare-up come on i use the cbd salve and some coconut oil mixed on the back of my scalp here or wherever it flares up ears back of my scalp and i'll put it on in the morning and kind of reapply throughout the day i tend to do it on a day i'm at home more i just try to keep it really moist as the plaques come off i'll peel them off and then that night i wash my hair like usual and i will do that for like a three week period maybe every other day or every two days on the days i wash my hair that's what i do to really help if i find a flare-up coming up and then finally see a dermatologist as needed don't suffer through it i am someone who just feels sometimes like i should just be able to handle things naturally and sometimes you just can't there's no reason to suffer through things when i do go i actually have a backup of a medicated shampoo that i keep if i get into a bad flare it's here if i need it she's just given it to me and said this has used helped you in the past keep it if you need it so i have it upstairs just in case i ever need it and if i ever do get a flare up like i've had on my face before i will be there in a heartbeat to get medication to help it calm down that was a lot of information i just gave you i hope it does help i hope it shows you that you have some options that you can try different things and if they don't work move on to something else i know what it's like to have to deal with these skin conditions i also know that there are tools out there that we can use to help manage them don't be afraid to see a doctor and find someone who will listen to you and your needs throughout all of this and thanks for being

subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody and welcome back to York River cannabis and today's video I'm going to be doing a very much requested video from all of our subscribers which is how to make extra-strength CBD oil but before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please consider hitting that subscribe button and supporting our channel also if you already have subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show that support so folks the number one request I've gotten and it's our second most viewed video on our channel is how to make CBD oil but a lot of people want to know how they can get more bang for their buck and how they can get more CBD in that oil and today I'm going to show you how you can do it but before we get into the details of how to make this exercise CBD oil if you guys are interested in hemp flour go ahead and email me I'll leave all that in the description below check out our website we have a new menu all new prices and a lot of our customers make CBD oil at home so we've adjusted a lot of our pricing to accommodate people who make their own CBD oil so go ahead and check that out and you can always email me and we accept most major payments at this point via PayPal folks the ingredients really is just one extra step to make extra strength CBD oil now this is a request for a family member this is not how I make CBD oil here on the farm to distribute so this is just as order for a family friend but I thought I would take this opportunity to share with you how you can do it at home so first thing you're gonna need to do is of course you're gonna want to have your hemp flour now again guys you can always grab this from us and again all that information is in the description below but here is some cherry wine hemp flour that our our family friend requested and we are going to make CBD oil with it now our cherry wine has a great amount of CBD in 19% to be exact so we can get more for our money by adding one simple ingredient and that is lesson 10 now with lesson 10 why does it make so much of a difference well MCT oil has a maximum absorption rate which means even a 100% ratio it really can't absorb all the CBD that these flowers have so to bump up the absorption rate you can add less ATIP and less if it has all the essential things to be able to absorb more cannabinoids so that is why a lot of people adolescent in now there is a ton of different less attends out there there's soy lecithin with granular and liquid you got sunflower lesson 10 grandeur and liquid love about capsules but I just buy liquid now I buy sunflower less attendant that is in the liquid form because I don't like soy I'm not a big fan of eating soy I think it's just in too many foods in the United States today so I went with sunflower lesson you can go with regular if that's what you prefer when you filter it out using our magic butter machine it doesn't really make much of a difference I just prefer the liquid now in order to get this started we're gonna have to decarbonise if allah grants stay the same for our CBD well as it does for this we're going to be doing 28 grams of CBD flour and 2 cups of MCT oil so that's approximately 14 grams of flour per cup now you can range that between seven and fourteen depending on your potency but we're really trying to maximize the absorption rate of the oil and the less intense so we're gonna do the maximum amount and we're going to be adding less aten so I'm going to go D carb our cherry wine flour that we have here I'm going to weigh it to 28 grams we've got our D carboxy R and you can see I've already waited and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fire up the oven I'm going to put it at 250 degrees and I'm going to be doing it for approximately 30 minutes so I will see you in 30 minutes with some D carb flour okay folks our flour has now been D carb is out of the oven and it is ready to go so obviously the first thing we're gonna do is go ahead and get all this flour into the magic butter machine now you all know that I absolutely love my magic butter machine you can't convert this recipe to work in a crock-pot or anything else but as always I just want my magic butter machine so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna add our MCT oil now this was purchased online 16 fluid ounces I know a lot of my subscribers always ask me what is my favorite MCT oh oh whoa this has pretty much everything you want to look for it's organic non-gmo and of course it's USDA certified organic which is a big deal so first and foremost we're just going to take the wrapper off of this and go ahead and add it now again like I said 16 fluid ounces equals two cups so there's no need to measure this we can go ahead and add it directly into the machine now here's the change of the recipe folks it really depends on how much less attend you want to add I wouldn't go any more than two tablespoons per cup so a maximum for this recipe would be four tablespoons of less eaten but I'm gonna do right in the middle there I'm gonna probably do about three for this recipe because it's such a high CBD amount that I don't want to overdo it but I also don't want to under do it so go ahead and get your tablespoon measure and you're just going to measure it out now you can see it's very sludgy so it takes a little bit of time it's almost like molasses type texture it's very slow very syrupy so you're gonna have to take your time with it but maybe we'll just do two for this round two for videos sake but you can add whatever you want so as we wait for this to go into the magic butter machine go ahead and cap everything now here's the thing for for you folks at home here's a little trick to the trade keep your MCT oil bottle because a lot of them come with spouts like this one and what I like to do especially for family members isn't the first time I've done this for family members is I usually just refill the bottle with the CBD oil and hand it back to him and you can do that at home and that way you don't have to use a mason jar or anything like that you can just you know even put another label over top of this I use a sharpie so you know that it's cbdo so you don't try cooking with it or anything like that so most of the lesson2 is off but what we're going to do is we're going to use our trusty magic butter spatula and make sure we get it all off of the tablespoon here and you go ahead and see so that's about it best we can now now that we've added the Blessington we're gonna go ahead and fire up our magic butter machine so let me get this plugged in now folks as always same as before we're gonna go up to 160 which is the middle of the road for this so there's your temperature 160 and I do 4 hours for the texture so folks I will see you in four hours to show you the final product all right folks so this has just gone off the magic butter machines timer has gone off so I'm going to do is go ahead and unplug it and you know go ahead and get all the stuff you can off the top of the machine here this one looks pretty good right now actually now the whole lot to get off of there which is good I find that the little spatula that magic butter makes works really well for this now we got their spatula kit from the a couple weeks ago all right so now as always guys you see how it's always on the edge here so you just want to scoop that down in because that has oil in it get all that ends all right and so this process is going to be the same as we've always done with all of our other oils you always put it on the love glove or the the silicone glove you always put it on your dominant hand if your left hand and put it on your left hand it just makes things easier okay so that is the majority of the oil right there now this oil will definitely be darker than a traditional CBD whoa and that is because of the sunflower lecithin note no worries about it it doesn't really have much of a different flavor but it's just something to note if you are using the liquid less inton it will have a darker look to it and I'll show you here so you can see it's a little darker than normal CBD oil not by much but it's definitely noticeable a lot of times when I make it with the by ox you know it comes out a little bit lighter and so typically what I'll do is I'll get all the other stuff there's still plant material that needs to be squeezed but I want to show you guys this trick I go ahead and I put it right back in the bottle okay so what this does to is it frees up this Pyrex measuring cup for me to be able to get all the plant material really not have to worry about splashing any of the oil or wasting any of the oil so you go ahead and you just put it right back in the bottle and then go ahead and put all the plant material in here and get rid of it so now you're not going to get a lot of oil out of the plants but it is worth giving a good squeeze you know making sure it's all out of there get as much as you can again you don't want to waste it it's good stuff takes four hours to make so you want to make sure that you get your money's worth if you're at home looks pretty good one more scoop here all right so that's it get your uh your glove back on and you kind of shake it all down there you're just gonna give it a good squeeze try to get as much of that well as you can out of there now you can refine it a little bit more if you want I have Magic butters other screens the 190th which is what they provide with the magic butter machine works great but if you don't like any type of sediment or plant material in your oil you can't even refine it more but I recommend making sure you do this round first and then go ahead and use a different screen but yeah so we can add that we need to get a lot out of the plant material but it's enough I would say that we got a pretty decent return probably about 13 ounces out of the 16 you're always gonna lose oil so that's just the nature and there's still some in here but that's what I have for you today guys again remember if you need hemp flour my contact information will be in the description below go ahead and check it out we have adjust our prices for people who make their own CBD oil at home to benefit them because a lot of our sales are for that so we're trying to adjust accordingly and I appreciate all the YouTube supporters out there that have purchased from our farm and support our farm I do appreciate it guys but yeah that's the extra-strength CBD oil recipe I hope it works you guys at home you guys have any questions leave a comment below and you can always find me on Instagram and Facebook that information will always be in the description below so that's all I have for you today guys I hope you take care hope this recipe works for you and I will see you in another video", "Zkodwj-6bHc": "[Music] hello my name is bear real and I am the director of plant biology as well as a certified herbalist here at CWM so a lot of you know already that some of the wonderful benefits of consuming our dietary supplement this beautiful hemp oil that we our company creates but today we're actually going to make something topical so as well as digesting it you can also apply it to a lot of your skin ailments in a topical fashion and so today we're actually going to make a really nice soothing skin South with our bottle of everyday or if you want an extra strength we can use every day plus so the recipe which it will be posted on our blog is relatively simple I am gonna incorporate a few other herbs just because why not they're fun and it'll help with the synergy as well as the efficaciousness and so this recipe is pretty loose you can use almost any of your favorite herbs of course if you're not certain contact an herbalist in your area and they can help you out with more of the choices specific to your own needs so the recipe that we're gonna make today is going to be using plantain leaf calendula flour lemon balm and lavender so the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna measure out our dried herbs so in South I like to use dried herbs just so that all of the water is already evaporated so that way we have a really nice good and strong oil extraction that will base our salad on so first we're gonna start with plantain leaf so plant a go major or plant a go major mmm wonderful ten take a major is pretty common to a lot of places in North America it's a really low growing weed and a lot of cases but it's really great at drawing toxins out of skin especially when used fresh and apply but of course today we're gonna use dried it's also antimicrobial anti-inflammatory it's really great for stings bites burns skalds it's really wonderful like healing the skin so we're gonna use an ounce and a quarter I'm just gonna measure out one cup in case you don't have a scale at home and collegial flour also called pot marigold calendula officinalis it really is good at helping heal and break up scar tissue when it becomes hard it really is good at penetrating that wound and making it soft again so it can really regenerate the tissue it's just wonderful for the skin I love it too so we're gonna use two cups of this and pour those into our ball and next we're going to use dried lemon balm leaf also wonderful and fantastic it's really great at healing eruptive conditions of the skin like shingles herpes things like that that really kind of erupt lemon balm is really wonderful and soothing it's great at just easing the stress emotionally physically as well as oxidatively it's also a really nice anti-inflammatory so we're going to add a half cup of that or half an ounce okay and the last thing I'd really like to add is just a bit of lavender flower I mean it smells wonderful it's gonna add such a nice fragrance to ourselves as well as it's also good at stimulating the circulation around healing tissue varicose vein scratches bumps bruises things like that so we're gonna add a 1/4 ounce of that or a quarter cup as it turns out of our beautiful flowers so now we just have this lovely blend of herbs that we're we're gonna use isn't that pretty our glass dish and you can use any baking dish that you like we're gonna put in our dried herbs okay into the nice glass pan and now we're gonna take our oil pardon my reach here okay so I'm using almond oil today but you can use a variety of of oils you can use olive oil sunflower oil I really like almond oil because it's really good for all skin types and today we're going to use about three to three and a half cups of oil just enough to cover all of the dry herbs beautiful all right now I've poured it into a glass dish because if you don't have a crock-pot at home you can just put it in the oven or if you're using a crock-pot just put your crock pot on low and then you put the herbs directly in the crock pot but since we're gonna I wanted to show you what it looked like in a pan we're gonna put it in the oven on the lowest setting possible so if your oven goes to 140 put it on 140 if your oven goes 170 put it on 170 whatever the lowest setting is possible go ahead and put it on that and we're gonna really lightly heat it for about four hours anywhere between three and five whatever your time allows or you can put it in the crock pot it's an easy way to do it so make sure you don't burn it for about four hours and then we're gonna come back and put our CW hip extract on it okay so it's been four hours and we have our beautiful oil infusion here we've taken some dried herbs poured in some oil and extract all this beautiful components of the herbs into the oil it smells wonderful all right so now we're gonna have to strain the dried plant material out of the oil at least I like to so you can let it cool down for a little bit just don't burn yourself so I have some cheesecloth here into a strainer we're just gonna pour that in there okay I have this beautiful rich golden green oil and this is the fun step we're gonna add our bottle of CW okay and I'm gonna add the whole bottle okay the next two ingredients are optional but I like to add them I like to add some drops of vitamin E oil also really wonderful for the skin and it also helps preserve the integrity of the staff so I'm just gonna add a little bit and eighth to a quarter teaspoon nice I'm also gonna add a few drops of essential oil I think it's just a really nice fragrance to add as well as all those beneficial properties of essential oils like antimicrobial antiviral I'm adding lavender today but mm you can add whatever your favorite is again contact your health care provider if you're unsure which ones to use okay so now we have our oils here with all their wonderful properties I'm gonna give that one last stir and what makes an herbal oil LaSalle's is just adding some beeswax so I find it's a little easier to mix the two and the beeswax is already melted which you can do over a double boiler but it's not necessary you can just add it straight to the oil but you might have to reheat the oil a bit so it melts I'm just gonna add that right in there okay so we have our beautiful oil and our beeswax and now we're ready to parse out so if you find that your beeswax is having trouble melting into your oil all you have to do is put your oil back on the stove at low heat for just a few minutes and it'll incorporate really nicely okay so we have our infusion with our herbs we have our CW every day or every day plus for extra strength we have our essential oils beeswax little vitamin E oil as far south so there we go and that's all there is to it and now we just have to let it cool down so it's liquid right now so we can pour it but as it cools down it'll Harden and we'll be able to use it for any of our skin ailments that we happen to have around thank you so much for joining me today and I hope you enjoy your new self you [Music] you", "3wD0KpsGIhI": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats and it is tincture time guys one of my favorite things to review here on your marijuana review show uh we are taking a look at a product from select we've reviewed quite a few things from select in the past they're sort of the jack of all trades of uh marijuana companies we've reviewed carts i think i've reviewed um disposables um they're in a lot of different uh markets select they're selling a lot of different products and one of those is the tincture and they have a pretty uh wide tincture line now have had it for a while with a whole bunch of different kinds of dosages and mixtures between thcs and cbds and different potencies and yada yada yada so this one here i purchased at a dispensary in long beach for 50 i believe um and it is a pretty good value for what you get inside of this box and it is a little confusing i'll show you here um so this is a one to one tincture uh one to one thc cbd one milligram for one milligram however that's not actually true uh it does say there this is the unflavored 500 milligram thc 500 milligram cbd well actually there's a sticker up here clarifying it's actually 600 milligrams thc and 513 cbd so you get a little extra great who doesn't love that uh and then uh as i said this is their unflavored i think they also have like lemon and ginger other things uh and on the side we've got our dosing uh sort of guidelines um they recommend that each full dropper is 10 milligrams which is a single serving and they say this whole uh tincture bottle has 60 droppers in total which makes sense for 600 milligrams of thc um so we've reviewed a lot of tinctures here i really like tinctures uh they usually work pretty well for me and i absolutely love the form factor uh we'll be doing this one sublingually like we do with most of our tinctures under the tongue which means it actually comes on quite a bit quicker than if you were just taking it like any other edible uh the effects can start to hit as soon as about 15 minutes and really get going at about 45. um so uh let's go ahead and get this open i was looking okay so this is uh an mct oil based um tincture i was wondering what their base was and it is mct oil which is basically just coconut oil so it is coconut oil but just a specific uh chain of molecules i guess um okay so let's open her up our one-to-one drops now i'm not particularly a big cbd guy uh it's not something that is especially um helpful or useful for me i i don't really um uh get a lot of benefit from cbd uh more power to everybody who does i'm i'm glad you really enjoy it uh i don't dislike cbd it's just it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on me but i will definitely keep an eye out uh because this one is almost equal parts cbd in here as well we'll see if that makes me feel any different than the normal thc review uh so like all of our weed reviews we're gonna do uh or excuse me tincture reviews we do uh 100 milligrams not the whole thing and not just a single dropper i like to do that as our baseline for pretty much every tincture so that would mean 10 full droppers of this is going to be our dose we'll see how that goes uh i'll probably do three or four two or three four on camera with you and then the uh remainder that i will be doing the next you know six seven i will probably do on a live stream i've been doing a lot of live streaming thank you to everybody joining in um and i'll probably do uh a little bit more there so i hope to see some of you guys join in for our live streams anyways i'm going to shut up now and i'm going to go and open this up and get this process started smells like nothing at all not a thing okay i'm expecting this to taste uh very neutral uh as mct oil tinctures normally are uh not able to get the full milligram it's only about the 75. got to keep that in mind i have to do uh maybe closer to 13 drops in total uh hung ahaha [Music] um [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's all i'm gonna do um i i there are uh various opinions about how long you should leave it i usually go for about a minute or two and that seems to do the trick pretty well uh and as i i suspected largely tasteless just that vaguely kind of coconutty oil aftertaste um but it's so un you know it's just it's it's really uh it's not a big deal at all i took three droppers full and don't even feel like i uh need to rinse my mouth out or anything um so in terms of the uh unflavoredness of this tincture it is really unflavored um so we've done our first three or two and a half worth droppers there i've got another you know we'll say 10 to do because i wasn't able to get the full one dropper uh and as i said i'm gonna hope to do some of that with you guys on a live stream uh before i wrap this review up oh i think i forgot to mention uh like all of our wheat's reviews after i do my 10th dropper or so uh about two hours or so after that i'll come back here and let you guys know if this select one to one cbd thc tincture is as good as i am hoping until then stay high stay healthy hi guys i am back about three and a half hours after our first journey with the select one to one drops 600 milligrams of thc in the very specific 513 milligrams of cbd that's not how much i did i did about between 100 and 150 milligrams would be my guess which is probably between 80 and 120 milligrams of cbd and a lot of you got to hang out with me while i was reviewing this we did a little bit of a live stream and i appreciate everyone who tuned in uh and to all those who were there you probably remember that i liked this quite a bit this is very good um an affordable tincture i see it for about 50 bucks normally which is already a good deal for 600 milligrams of thc then you get the added bonus of that one to one cbd double-year cannabinoid goodness um so normally the cbd stuff doesn't really do a lot for me i'm not a big big big huge user of cbd or even sort of i don't really get the uh too much of the positive effects uh i respect it as a product it's just not super effective on me but i did notice it here um the the the high i'm experiencing is way more relaxed even than normal um sort of very very pleasant kind of experience less cerebral than normal for me not really neurons really aren't firing quite as much but i feel very at peace so i'm going to attribute that to the almost equal amounts of cbd in here so this select one-to-one unflavored drops it gets a really really big thumbs up for me i like it quite a bit my dog's thinking about barking but she's not going to she's not going to she really wanted to um so yeah huge thumbs up for me and before i bounce here guys i want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something that you can enjoy that i can share with you that isn't necessarily about wheat in this one you may not want any weed before you check this out because it might be a little too much i'm going to recommend a couple of books from a japanese uh illustrator it's manga i'm sorry i'm a nerd i guess it's only the second one i've ever read so don't judge me too harshly um the artist and writer is a guy by the name i apologize if i'm mispronouncing it junjie ito um and the two books i want to recommend from him that are utterly grotesque i mean truly some of the most shocking images i've ever seen somebody uh put pen to paper but i mean that in the best kind of way uh they are depraved in the most uh wonderful kind of cosmic hori sense of depraved uh and those are guillot geo again probably mispronouncing it which means fish in [ __ ] japan um and uh the other one is uzumaki which means spirals and it's all about spirals and i think adult swim is gonna do some kind of adaptation i've talked a lot about genji ito don't mix the two that's my advice definitely try this and definitely give junjie e2 a shot if you're a fan of gross stuff but keep them apart all right guys well that's going to do it for this review here on wheats really like the select give a huge recommendation my boy genji whatever however i'm sorry i'm still very high so thank you so much for watching guys stay high stay healthy and we'll see you for the next review i'm hoping my dogs aren't going to trip they might we did it [Music] you", "2ExUSe3vekg": "my name's Aaron nos fish and I wanted to show you a quick video on how to get CBD ads live on Facebook it works primarily well with topical products but it also works with dentures and edibles and other products and I'm gonna show you real quick how I'm getting those ads live how you can get those ads live and how some of the biggest brands in the game are currently getting them at those ads life before we go into that again my name's Aaron I've been in this Commerce digital marketing space for quite a while now I've been doing a lot of Facebook Instagram advertising for the past few years it's been about four million dollars on the platform at a at a return and for example I have my Facebook shirt on actually today which I picked up from Facebook headquarters last time they invited me out there so real quick I own a company called symbiote sim like own this with Matt cyber is the cannabis consulting company where we consult people see the CBD or cannabis companies either early stage or they started generating revenue and they want to scale and we help them do so this awesome logo was designed by Paul Booth he does an excellent job over at just brand it and I own one other company called loosen media and loosen media does advertising and creative services so we create awesome and compelling videos that are viral in nature and then we advertise those videos for you to drive a return this works we do this for both direct-to-consumer ecommerce companies with a social conscious mint socially conscious mission as well as for CBD products okay but you're here to learn about how to get ads live for on Facebook and Instagram for CBD products I'm going to show you how to do that real quick first off let me go show you how you can see ads that some of the bigger brains in the game do have live currently and how you can replicate that success so this is pure canna I'm sure many of you are familiar with them they've sold their company just recently or acquired I think by heavenly Rx for over 90 million dollars or around 90 million dollars let me show you real quick how to see the ads they're driving go ahead and visit their Facebook page in this case it's pure cane a premier premium scrolling down you'll see the section says page transparency click see more and then go down and click go to ads library this is gonna show you all the active ads that this company is running at any given time so as you can see here let's look at what this ad says and why it's approved so this is a CBD topical product it looks like a roll-on gel or roll-on ball topical product what we notice first is in the caption this is talking about that product but there's no mention of CBD in here pure can appear results topical gel topical gel that's what it is in shipping and it's slogan but again nothing no mention of CBD so where do these links go to you let's find out click through that check this out it goes to a landing page on this landing page look what they're mentioning hip no mention of CBD not anywhere on this landing page so that comes to our first way to get ads live on Facebook for CBD products you can run an ad that doesn't mention CBD to a landing page that mentions hemp and if you click through that landing page you can run that directly to your topical products or your CBD topical products on your website so you example you can see CB right here this is pure cane as an actual website you get to have oils and capsules on here as well but this is their this is a collection page for the topicals and I could buy any other topicals right here so that's the first way you can get that at live let me go ahead and show you how to do that real quick in the back end this is a campaign the traffic based objective campaign and you click through the ad sets on this ad set I just have a basic ad set this is running to everyone in the US 18 to 65 okay this is just for an example jumping over here I have one now that got rejected in Wonka advocaat repeat approved let me show you the differences so if I go to this sad let me click Edit you'll notice what I did here I have a caption that is the exact that they have for their current product no mention of CBD although it does talk about CBD products I have a c-more URL and a display link this goes to that landing page that we just showed you but then I also have different links going here in the in the in the actual carousel ad so you'll see this link now I got this lat approved going to this link now let me show you that so you can actually run she just comes the second way to get CBD as approved you can run CBD or you can run ads that don't mention CBD to topical CBD lean pages so this is actually pure cannas product page for their topical CBD ointment I'm not affiliated with with pure Canada I just wanted to demo how they are getting their ads live out there so this goes directly from the ad clicks through to their product page for their topical no landing page in between so that's another way so that's the second way you can get it live but a lot of people think that's about it and that that that's pretty much the only way you can get ads live for CBD but frankly it's not true so with that let me show you a couple more this is pre mas I mean you heard a prema prema was started by one of the I think it was one of the executives from the honest company which was a billion-dollar wellness company I think they made home chemical or home natural natural chemicals for the home and a bunch of other products but so he started this company and if you look here again I'm just gonna go to their Facebook page down to page transparency see more then go to ads library see this page is currently running as oh curious go to their ad library look at that tons of CBD ads cool right okay so how's it working again what do we see no mention of CBD in the ad caption no mention in the headline no mission in the description and I click through this is going to their actual website primer Co but look at that Facebook - info - V - so this is a landing page built for Facebook ads specifically by prema holiday magic what do we see here again no mention of CBD they're just talking about the products and the benefits of the products but no mention of CBD don't take our word for it cool great job prime I you guys are doing great there you have a wonderful brand and this is a great way to get ads now what you can see here is they have a cream they have a serum they have a bath bomb and they have a skin therapy now those are all topical so you might say Erin okay that's great but those are still topicals I have a tensor product how can I get a tint your product live for Facebook well let me show you I'm sure a lot of you have heard the company feels feels that's probably one of the best websites brands and experiences in the game right now great job feels and I am very impressed by what these guys are doing and I'm sure you are too but before let me show you what's interesting about them is they have primarily only at ensure product I don't think they have any topicals or any other products currently they have at ensure product in three different shrinks and they have a flight of testers again let's scroll down see more oh oh they're running ads go to ads library what do we see look at these ads Wow a bunch of them okay cool so what are they ads well two things you'll notice here one look at that pings IOT meets your match I'm sure a lot of you are dealing with the restrictions due to the FDA I'm not being able to make claims one great way to come out around that is use creative words that that aren't making claims that are not diseases and that you can offer solutions to you can use words like sue the relieve you can't use words like treat or cure and so be careful but learn from of the brains that are doing it what feels is doing here they're making up a word anxiety but what do we know we know they're talking about anxiety we know that the time about anger we know they're talking about relaxation that's what comes to my mind when I see that it's really curious but now what about this ad again no mention of CBD but check this out if when I click through to it what is it well it goes to Cosmo this fancy new CBD procs so I went from the ad that showed 10 chairs but didn't mention CBD goes directly to a landing page on Cosmo I talks about CBD literally in the headline well there's a product right there at intra product huh as we see we scroll through here now this is a this is a Cosmo writer talking about their CBD product of what we see down here is links to their product their there there and all throughout this page so we go ahead and click through and just like that I am on feels Pro website this is their actual website not even a landing page and I could buy that product for at insurer right there crazy that's a great way to do it very few people in the game are doing this right now and this is a strong way to do it okay so I've showed you a couple different ways on how to get ads live on Facebook for CBD but that's not the only one so so far we've talked about you can get ads live for Facebook that go to our for CBD that goes to an ad that doesn't mention CBD that goes to a landing page that mentions him that redirects to a checkout or to a to a category page or the product pages that do mention CBD therefore topicals or an ad that doesn't mention CBD to a topical product page that doesn't Incheon CBD or you can go from a ad that doesn't mention CBD to a landing page that has all your topical products on it similar to how product primer does it they didn't mention CBD at all on theirs and that's how they're getting theirs approved more easily or if you have a 10 shirt product you can do something like Fields does where you go from your they add that doesn't mention CBD talks about the product or hints at it directs them to an article that does mention CBDs and talks directly about their product very clearly and promotes it very clearly that redirects to your website or finally there's a couple or actually a couple more there's two more ways you can get CBD is live and we talked about those um another way you can do in some companies do is they either create an blog on their website that top that creates articles about CBD but don't sell directly CBD products they might say what CBD is good for why she CBD should be legal the benefits and the cons of CBD whatever kind of educational content now some people are hosting this on their websites where they actually sell CBD others are putting it on other websites and redirecting to their CBD products that is a way you can get ads live there's nothing wrong with talking about CBD on facebook ads as long as you're not actually there's nothing wrong with promoting a CBD article on facebook ads as long as it doesn't up sell directly the product so they can they could be about awareness articles or activism articles or what-have-you so those are articles you can get live and then finally there's one last way this works for all products you can run facebook lead ads that generate leads for pre qualifying questions so say you have a soothing muscle CBD gel for that you roll on or as a South right you can run ads that say having trouble with your muscles or sore back question mark or whatever it is generate leads for people who qualify for these conditions or for these for these they or rather they're people that are not conditions that that would be you know to be careful with that that would qualify for that that are interested in the solution that you're offering you gather their emails you throw them into an email marketing sequence and then that converts them that works for about any CBD products and most people that promote the fact that they can get CBD ads live that's how they're doing it so what I wanted to show you with this is that you can get CBD ads live there are many ways to do it and there's many more that we haven't talked about once you shouldn't understand them mechanics of what Facebook does allow them doesn't allow you can come up with new ways to do this that being said I'm a big proponent of information being free that's why I'm sharing that's a lot of people who

delivered no waiting time unlike similar products out there and it does what it should do makes my arthritis pain almost negligible and it tastes pretty good too have a rare pain inflammation problem and this oil provides a modest but noticeable level of relief it does what it says this is my third bottle also gave them to relative who works nights and hard to sleep during day and he says it really helped in addition i gave some to my daughter-in-law who has a very stressful job and she said she takes some before work and now stays focused also said it wa i can't say enough about how much this company cares about customer service and satisfaction although i can't tolerate the orange flavor the spice was better i recently sampled their caramel cbd chews and these were wonderful tasting and i am hoping to be able to get some relief from my illness and the pain that comes with it hands down a definite 5 star company [Music] works extremely well within just a couple of minutes after taking a dosage i can feel it working and maybe 10 minutes later it peaks and i am totally relaxed it's an awesome product and ill continue to do business with you guys through your website as needed real deal but know what you are purchasing to treat most serious health conditions you need medical grade cbd oil that has higher intensity than this blend at 250 milligrams per ounce this is a beneficial dietary supplement no more however i felt it to be a wonderful uplift within the chronic physical drudgery that i experience daily to be effective with my medical conditions diabetes fibromyalgia chronic myofascia pain lyme disease i need 25 to 50 milligrams x2 daily of cbd at minimum to have any effect at all so at 2 ounces 500 milligrams bottle will yield either 5 or 10 days of use for me once you know what you need you can better choose which product will be best for you obviously i would be better served with a more concentrated product like restore 6 to obtain the results i am seeking click link in description for more reviews", "DZuUFlJo1y0": "okay so I purchased this product about a year and a half ago my husband takes about one day sometimes to Dave he's being one more anxious that day as you think sitting we've gone through a good bit of the bottle he stayed with the gummies tastes really good he likes the flavor they don't taste like medicine or anything like that they are 25 milligrams each which is higher than the 10 milligram ones that I had bought originally and a whole lot cheaper you get a hundred and twenty on this one for one of you five or thirty dollars on these I can't remember now but the other ones I bought was 30 days worth for $60 and that's just crazy expensive to me so these I got a waiting one there's about four months worth of you take one a day and I got way more for a lot cheaper at least give me one a try but don't don't try it for like a day or two later okay no it doesn't work if you have to you do have to give it some time to like build up in your sister on things like what he does when he takes them is he puts one in his mouth and puts it in his cheek and lets it sit there for about five minutes or so just trying to get some medicine into his system later faster by swallowing it and stuffing it already being like a juice and then he chews out the rest of the gum and after about five minutes and then he eats it so yeah I would definitely recommend this product yeah", "hTAaheSCzeo": "what's going on people shout out to warfighter hemp for sponsoring this review hey I'm sorry kids and welcome back to star cash babes oh wait we're about to getting something a little different it's legal doesn't get you high but definitely has the possibilities to make you feel better health-wise but don't quote me on that if you're under 18 I don't know how you got here because this review is eight restricted let's go so about to get into a hair product please know that there is a difference between hemp oil and CBD or yes there's a difference we have all CD I'll put the link down below in the pin comment so you can check it out for yourself and understand educate yourself so we have what is the package that it came in yeah different formula and it's like yeah and it was the cartridge was in here but the battery came separate yeah they sent me a battery as well and in here you have the USB charger but you know I didn't use it first off the back the packaging is not is that yeah it's snapped it's not really chopped ooh it's not chop this should have been sealed also you know where you have to cut it open so that's something I think should be thought about yeah yeah it's a hundred percent course the glass is the non leaking tank they say on it it says the patent is pending so yeah so I guess this was in and this sponges behind it's a cushion it's so I travel in commute it wouldn't break now we show you the cartridge that is the cartridge well now you know look I was like oh that like is a tip somewhere else is it packaged separately or something but no that is the actual set of three holes you know where you inhale it's different than any cartridge that I've come across I mean yeah it's different so so this is how the whole thing looks when you inhale to know that you know what your battery life is and here's the USB chargers plug that's where you plug it in to charge so quickly it contains 600 milligrams of active cannibal cannibal oil mixed with organic hemp you see yeah hemp oil that can aid in everyday stresses help manage pain and Aiden sleep plant-based ingredients locally locally and organically grown in Colorado contains less than 0.3 THC we recommend inhaling 2 times and waiting to see how you feel as vaping is nearly instantaneous before taking another drawer effects usually lasts 1.5 to 2 hours now I make sure this is the first little bit of hemp or CBD I'm taking into my body so I can talk to you about how the product is first of all you ever wonder what hemp oil takes like I was trying to you know I've had hippo before but I've never really don't think I've ever said how it tastes what maybe I haven't I said it's working so I'm not going back see but I'm going about my experience now it's not an earthy taste you know the only thing that sticks out of my head is aromatic but then when I look it up online it says Oh compared to wait walnuts tastes or I've got the other thing I'm like not being walnuts I don't like walnuts but this don't taste like walnuts so for me the only way I could describe the way ham taste is like a this is an aromatic taste it's not like it's not it's not bad and it's not great it's just okay you could say there's a light her boys I mean it's the light its pleasant alemannic I'm not it's not floral it's aromatic I guess only that's dope that's what I that's what comes to my mind yeah again this is warfighter this is their six hundred milligram hemp and it is instantaneous yeah yeah relaxation relaxation who's that one of the things I said I don't know but that's what to do for me yeah I can eat in everyday stresses health manage pain at a sleep yeah it's been a stressful yeah and so this definitely does help and I would recommend it again please remember that there's a difference between hemp oil and Caterpillar you even read when I read it see what it says contains 600 milligrams of active cannabis oil mixed with organic hemp oil with a QC mix so that means there's two different things coming together and they work they have many benefits to the body please people do your research Warfighter hemp again shout out to them for making it possible this is something I've ever recommend now this set is $80 that's what the battery but I'm trying to see if they sell it without the battery I'll say get the battery along with it I mean it's it's another $10 I'll see if you know they'll give me a discount I don't know we'll see if so I'll definitely update the pen comment because the cartridge alone is $70 and the kid is 79 so I mean yeah you know if it was oh my god that's expensive but look at it as your prescribed medication or over-the-counter medication you take you don't buy a bottle of town oh we love Jesus I just pray you don't you don't buy a whole bottle of Tylenol and down the talent or the whole bottle it gives recommended dosage I'm saying so as it's isn't taking to seeing how you fail if it works for you huh take it like you do medication this is what like every six or eight hours that's what you do or as needed you know don't say the whole day and go through this don't do it would you do that to your prescribed Medicaid God please I hope you don't but I'm saying keep try to keep that thought process in your head you know before anybody asks me how long that lasts look this is to help medicate keep you feeling good so keep in mind try to mimic how you would do this to prescribe medication or over-the-counter medication on that note again shot it again so war fighter hip and I'm out thank you for checking out the review all information is down below where you can get the product for yourself remember thumbs up subscribe all that good stuff and I'll catch you in the next one I'm out", "reZc34YFp2M": "welcome back fellow youtubers fellow medicators fellow subscribers fellow viewers fellow fellows all right here's the deal so you want to get

his own line of products now i'm sure you guys know that by now i've been posting on instagram on my facebook my facebook group any and everywhere i can tell you that the bho is hot bro the bho is hot it's selling like crazy i blew through two rounds of lifter and a round of electra i got some electra left probably about i don't know eight grams i'm gonna do another run of bho real soon some more electra for sure um i got i got plenty of biomass i got plenty of everything okay um making it over here okay but i'm gonna try my hand at making some moon rocks and if these turn out good i'm gonna bring you all with me we're gonna learn together these turn out awesome i'm gonna have some labels made i'm gonna buy some containers and i'm gonna make you [ __ ] happy because i'm gonna make some moon rocks if this turns out all right and y'all y'all gonna love them y'all gonna love them so what i did was i went out and i got a shaker i don't know if what you all know what this is i'm gonna do a review of this later but it's part of this here so i'm gonna give you a sneak peek at this okay so basically oh that's on there tight okay so you grind up your junk you put it in there it's about just about a half ounce of electra i ground it up real fine put it in there right and then you and then it comes out the bottom fills up the bottom with that right there that's keif okay so here's the main ingredients of this little experiment and if this works out we're gonna we're gonna manufacture some y'all gonna y'all gonna love me so what i got i got some choice picks of electra flower here okay i'm we'll put them out here on this little this little spot here all right some electric nuglets some chunky flowers okay and then i got some electro bho i blasted myself right there it is this is one of the last like eight grams telling you this stuff this stuff is going fast i am getting calls left and right forward back up and down my phone's ringing off the hook guys you don't want to miss out on this if you want some of this you gotta get a hold of me okay so here it is there we go delicious looking stuff okay so main ingredients you're gonna need to be able to get your keef so we got the keefe you obviously need your your flowers you got the flowers okay we got the bho the honey oil that's what we call we just caught some honey oil because it's delicious and i got one of these little handy dandy little [ __ ] right here i made check this out now i don't want to get all sticky and oogy if i if i find i want to make like a thousand of these because i got a whole bag of flowers so i got me a little dowel rod and a little thingamajig here i don't know what you call this a flugel binder a widget of some sort i guess i guess it's to hook like wires together or something i don't know but what we're going to do is we're going to take this flower here and we're going to hold that little sun [ __ ] just like that just like that so i don't get all shaky see and then we're gonna take this tool and we're gonna scoop up this oil like this see it on there and we're just going to begin to paint this flower like this we're just going to cover this flower and lovely stuff okay paint it with this now you gotta make sure you get a well-trimmed flower because anything shaggy or straggly is probably not gonna work out too swell but we're just gonna smear this all over this flower just like this um excuse me guys hmm okay so now we got all but the underside covered so now we're just going to take our keep here you know what let's just let's just dab it hill with it well that's looking pretty much like a moon rock to me well now that i've made one i'm beginning to understand why they're so expensive i probably got four grams keith here and i got a gram of bho and probably a three-quarter of a gram flour so one of these right now i just made this is probably worth 70 bucks really i mean that's a bit steep that is a bit steep now granted companies that make this stuff they make this stuff on on a larger scale you know what i'm saying guys on a much larger scale and they probably do it at pennies on the dollar because they can afford to blast large amounts of bho and they can get really cheap flowers i mean i i can say i get biomass so i mean i get a hefty deal but it's not you know it's not like i'm breaking any records of my purchases here but as you can see that's a pretty nice moon rock right there i mean uh that looks like a moon rock to me i mean that's pretty sweet it looks pretty tasty too so i would say mission accomplished but i don't know man if you're a bigger company and you make moon rocks like say you're with uh tweedle farms or mystic roots or somebody and you got the 4-1-1 on how to make this affordable for a guy starting out hit me up with my phone number it'll be in the it'll be in the description but there you go guys there you have it my tutorial on how to make moon rocks i got i got a handful here yet that imma make um i think what i'll do is i'll probably uh pause this and uh yeah you know what let's just send it here i mean why do you gotta watch me make like six more here it is it's a moon rock but now you know what goes into making it and how to make it easier i mean you can see i got nothing on me i fiddled with bho bho flowers uh keef and uh i'm pretty much clean so i thought this through pretty well before i started making a video because i wanted to make sure that i showed you guys if i was going to educate you on how to do it how to do it really well and not make much of a mess because most people you know we're medicating at home i mean your your dining room table your kitchen table your kitchen counter you don't want [ __ ] everywhere you know you don't want to have to be because i mean the only thing that gets out rosin is spit i mean what do you want to go through all that for you just get some wax paper make yourself a little handy-dandy little widget here to hold this flower in place and just bounce with it you know now i'm not trying to take business away from tweedle farms or any companies that make things okay but if you're around your house and you got some bho and you got some keefe and you got some premium flowers now you gotta remember this electric flower electro bho and electric keef because i got a ton of electro flour in fact there's like four more pounds over there you can't even see all completely 100 legal hemp per the 2018 farm bill so don't even think about busting dm blair because my herbs are legal that's a disclaimer for the doo guys but if you have this around your house i digress if you have this stuff around your house you know my mom always said why go to the why go to the restaurant up the road for an omelette when i got eggs ham and cheese right here i can make you an omelet for free makes sense to me so and and you know and you feel more accomplished i feel i feel like i accomplished something here i mean i would really like to make these and sell them that was another point of this video the description down below or not the description i'm sorry the the comments the comments let me know if you think this is practical and if you'd be interested in buying some if i uh if i went to all that i mean i can just stick with the products i got but it seems like the hot thing now this mean i'm not like trying to ride on nobody's coattails or or steal their thunder but i'm in the business of making medication for people and i'm in the business of helping people get well and this seems to be working for a lot of people so why the hell not so to recap before i bounce get your shaker this is a cheap one i got this at uh excitement video smoke shop in new york pennsylvania completely legal i bought it in a store over the counter guys it's not paraphernalia like nine bucks i got my bho i made myself right there some premium flour and the keef down here right there now you can see how much i used i used a good bit so excuse me so until next time guys be safe be well be kind thank you for coming along and learning with me um i hope this helped i hope this helped cut the curve a little and show everybody that you

guys thank you", "ULgHQ0vNfOM": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel today's video I'm going to be making a much requested video from our subscribers which is how to make CBD lotion that's right liquid pumpable lotion that you can use at home but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up so folks today we're going to be making our CBD hand lotion and first and foremost of one ingredient that we did make here on the farm is our hemp Keeffe you can find this on our website pricing and everything and you can make an order this lotion will be available on our website so go ahead and check out the pricing if you just don't want to bother making it you can purchase it from us so just visit our website and all the prices are there and I do appreciate all the support from from all you subscribers that are watching this video I appreciate a lot of support that we've gotten so thank you very much let's dive into what you're gonna need to make CBD hand lotion at home okay folks you are gonna need a lot of things for this so let's get started with you will need an immersion blender or a stick blender of some sort for this recipe you could use a real blender but I don't recommend it you're gonna need some sort of container to put the lotion in here we have a pumpable container you're gonna need some sort of spatula or just you know a mixing device you're gonna need distilled water shea butter emulsifying wax vegetable glycerin which you really can't see in the bowl here and avocado oil along with a preservative of your choice and you can just Google which preservative you think would work best for you this is what we have here and of course our hemp Keith the other thing you're gonna need is a large pan I'll bring it over here you're gonna fill the pan with water and you're gonna have to separate bowls inside the pan and we'll get to that shortly so these are all the ingredients that are required to make this CBD hand lotion it is a lot and like I said folks if you don't want to bother whether you can visit our website and purchase the CBD lotion so folks let's get this party started and let's get into making our CBD hand lotion okay folks now as you can see the big pan here is filled with water we have two separate pots we're gonna go ahead and turn this on to medium low temperature and first we're gonna start doing our oils so we're gonna go ahead and add the emulsifying wax our avocado will now this isn't measured by fluid ounce or anything this is measured by grams and I'll leave that exact recipe in the description below and we're gonna get our shea butter now that's going to have to get brought up to temperature now meanwhile there's two things I want to want you to consider now we're gonna put our water in in this other pot here now this is distilled water okay now the great thing about having vegetable glycerin in this recipe and why it's so important is because the hemp Kieff goes into the vegetable glycerin and this is how it dissolves again and gets into the lotion so I'm gonna bring you back over while this is heating up and we're gonna start dissolving our hemp teeth in the vegetable glycerin alright folks so now that we have all the hemp keith's dissolved in the vegetable glycerin I want to show you kind of what it looks like before we go ahead and put it in the water and it's really like a nice thick pasty no clumps or anything like that you really want it to be nice and thinned out and that is ideal for when we're making the lotion so now we're going to go over and add it to the water part of the lotion there Keefe is nice and dissolve we're just gonna add it to the water bowl here the one with all the water that don't add it to the oil add it to the water and you want to make sure you're getting all of that Keef in there because this stuff is expensive and it really brings up your CBD content for the actual ocean so get all that as much as we can and go ahead and start mixing that around a little bit now you can see it's separating from the glycerine a little bit don't worry about that that is perfectly normal and once we get the oil in it what you won't even notice it does like to separate once it's in the water but not by a lot I mean you can still see that it's fairly dissolved so now we're going to wait for everything to get up to temperature and then we're going to start mixing stuff around so I'll see you in proximately 20 minutes okay folks everything is melted down and at the same temperature and again this is important it has to be the same temperature so what you can do now is you can put the oil with the water or the water with the oil this is going to be the pot so to speak or the container that you're going to emulsify everything in so make sure that it's the larger of the two containers we're gonna go ahead and just add that now and as you can see it became a very white creamy type of lotion look to it and that is perfect for what we need now we want to make sure that that Keef gets in there so we'll be adding making sure sometimes it likes to stick to the side so make sure you get that key off the side that is important for your CBD content of this lotion all right so now we're going to wait about two to three minutes while this sits in the same temperature bath it isn't required but this is something I like to do and as you can see the key floating up here we're gonna mix it around so I'm gonna give it about five minutes and then we're gonna be right back all right folks it's time to take this off the heat bring it over here to cool down we're gonna get rid of this pan of hot water and then what we're gonna do is going to go over here and start reversing blendering everything getting it started to get mixed up as it starts to cool so this is key all right boys have been off the heat for about three to four minutes and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna emulsify and this takes a little bit of time so you're just gonna go ahead and mix it and you don't want to get a lot of air in it so don't don't bring it up and down like that too much just I do it in the very beginning because sometimes some of the oil try separating to the top so I like to bring it down but right now we're just gonna mix it and you're gonna do this on and off for approximately 10 minutes so it's gonna be a while but you don't have to do it continuously you can go ahead and take a break and jump back into it but you're gonna want to mix it for quite a while and get it nice and mixed up so I'll see you folks in probably about 10 minutes all right folks so we've been mixing for about 10 minutes and you can see it's nice and thickened up now I'm gonna turn it on for you real quick and you can see that it's getting nice and thick now it's starting to look like that yeah typical lotion look to it you don't see the the the hemp chief any longer it's all mixed in and so now you're gonna have to wait another 10 minutes while this cools off and while we're waiting I want you to go gather your preservative of your choice again folks you got to go out and research which preservative you're comfortable with there is a lot of them out there this is the one that we went with but you don't have to use that one but you have to use as preservative because of the amount of water that's in this you can also grab some vitamin E you can add that that is not required for the recipe and along with some essential oils if you like essential oils in your lotion so that's what I'm gonna do oh do me to get all that stuff together and I'll see you back in ten minutes it's been about ten minutes and we've measured out our preservative and now as you can see the lotion is exactly what you would think of as a lotion it's very nice it's cooled off and we'll get some of this lotion off of the emulsion blender here yeah it looks awesome and so now is the time you want to get everything going so this is what it looks like nice and fluffy just a typical lotion now there's a lot of ways you can get this back into a bottle for the most part we're going to just put it into that pumpable lotion but right now we're gonna add our essential oils and I'm gonna do about about 10 drops of vitamin E about seven drops of lavender I don't like a strong essential oil so it's not for me you can add as much as you want then we're going to do four grams of preservative and this is really to extend the shelf life of this because it's water-based you can't just get away with not having a preservative you've got to have one all right so now this is all out of their way and so now we're just gonna mix it all around and now you can see that lotion is getting that just nice liquids look to it and it smells absolutely wonderful and so now what you can do is get ready to put it in your container of choice now for us I like to put it in the pumpable bottle but you can put it in a mason jar but the reason I like the pumpable bottle is because it's contained and you're not constantly putting your hands in it because it requires a preservative and because it's water-based you don't want to be adding bacteria to it eventually that preservative won't be able to keep up so what we're going to do is we're going to add it to the bottle and the trick to that is you go ahead and you can get a plastic bag and you put the lotion in it cut the corner and you can fill it that way you can have like a pastry funnel you can do it that way there's a bunch of different ways one of the easiest ways of course is the mason jar but you know the mason jar again you're putting your hand in it constantly folks that's all I have for today I hope you enjoyed this I hope you liked this recipe I mean just look at how awesome this lotion is it smells absolutely wonderful you cannot smell the hemp in it at all because we use em Keefe you can't smell it it is absolutely awesome it's wonderful it smells like lavender and again you can add more lavender if you shoes or you can add any essential oil that you want i like lavender but i don't like a lot of it but it is awesome it smells like a lotion you buy at the store and again it's CBD so this is good for joint pain or anything that you think that CBD can work for you know I'm not going to give any recommendations of what it can cure or anything you can do your research online but yeah this will be available as requested on our website so go ahead and reach out to me again the hemp chief is also available and we'll be getting that out soon so go ahead and visit our website folks but that's all I have for you today I really hope you enjoyed this recipe I hope it works out for you and thanks for watching the video and I will catch you in another video", "U_x7bGEwoQA": "welcome to

getting is a topical mist with infused pain relieving plant extracts such as arnica peppermint juniper and of course cannabis it comes in a two fluid ounce or sixty milliliter container with 50 milligrams of THC and five milligrams of CBD and cannabis oils this topical spray is not intended to ingest in any form it's only intended to be used externally on the skin the applicator cap has a somewhat involved process to accessing the spray nozzle you do this by pressing the safety lock button then shifting the teeth on the top of the spray button to rotate it to the proper point of operation the applicator cap is pressed onto the container neck for a secured non removable cap Apothic Anas cannabis infused skincare has essential organic oils and plant extracts which focus on relieving pain through the skin this cooling topical spray is packed with powerful plant extracts such as arnica peppermint spearmint juniper and cannabis these flower extracts provide fast-acting your leave from pain and irritation usage is easy first spot test with a half a pump application if no irritation or allergic reactions occur then continue on spray one to three pumps on sore areas swollen joints and problem skin you can let it air dry or rub it in however be aware of the degradation from rub off and be advised that if you touch the oils with your hands keep your hands and fingers away from your eyes because irritation will occur upon application you will immediately experience a smooth and deeply cooling feeling as your skin is absorbing this topical treat allow 5 to 15 minutes for pain relief effects to occur while the cooling heat continues apply it respectfully as needed be advised to stay away from open cuts or wounds and discontinue use if irritation or discomfort is present the pros of the Apothic Ana extra-strength pain relief spray are is that it's fast-acting it feels great the child lock system is secure to keep it away from children and it's also a clean and secure appearance that keeps a peace of mind when you're applying it in public areas and you also get a lot of sprays out of one container the cons are is that the safety lock system although effective might be a little hard for some people with hurting fingers to use and also the labeling was not consistent on the two bottles that we had one of our bottles was labeled at having 50 milligrams of THC and 5 milligrams of CBDs while the other otherwise identical bottle was labeled as 50 milligrams of CBD and 50 milligrams of THC overall I give a path econo extra-strength pain spray 5 out of 5 blazin pot leaves in my opinion Apothic anna extra-strength pain spray is a great organic all-in-one body pain spray relief that relieves pain from your extremities down to your lower back if you'd like to learn more or to purchase one please ask for Apothic anna at your local medical marijuana dispensary I'm sure they can provide it for you or at least offer a comparable cannabis

this camera down just a little bit so you guys will really understand what I'm saying we thought I get fancy schmancy me like check this out first look at this beautiful design by Gaia class right now I've seen fancy glass before so that's not the part that excited me it's this it's an extra filter right and they use coconut it comes with coconut carbon doesn't have a smell no it does not have a smell so check this out you take the coconut carbon and you put it in here oh oh oh oh some kind of no did I think that's enough all right I'm gonna put too much in let me take a little bit out still

carbon right so I saw that I was excited I was like okay that's gonna make for a less harsh smoke I was excited I was excited here's my little but that right there but this is the part that got me super high this is the part that excited me like this was somewhat excited I'm not gonna it's gonna be dope but this is the part that excites me because a lot of people tell me that when I've done my bone reviews they tell me to use ice cold water that make it stay hit better I've even been told to put just ice inside of it to keep it super cold so what Gaea did was check this [ __ ] out when you get this you put this into fruit you see that you see that coming off of it can I see that but anyway it's frozen this is liquid it's a liquid I don't know what it is it must be some kind of gel or something but you see that whole entire chamber that's inside there it's frozen around the smoke chamber so they say that you only have to put it in the freezer for maybe I think it's dirty or maybe 40 minutes or something like that but I had nothing but time so I actually put mines in the freezer overnight so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get me some water and heat it alright we get that one in there you definitely did okay okay so I got my water in there then you put this on right and it comes with this little snap a little time right here you put that on that and what that's gonna do is I'm gonna Lock everything in place see now it's one piece because just because of that snap cap everything is locked in place and I am ready well I'm not ready but I'm ready today I'm going to use I'm using a little bit of this purple rain from family wellness that's what I'm gonna use it here today let me let you give a a look of how everything looks put together I like this I love when people take that time to make quality products and just a new way it's like you can tell somebody who smokes came up with this because who else would know that you needed ice-cold it so I'm using some of this purple rain and it is purpley get out of my screen red cup you to let me tell you straight out though I'm a little bit nervous because bombs killing me man they be killing me but this has got to be the ultimate I got the freaking I got the the carbon filter I think you know what I think I can put more in there I think I can I think I can put a little more now because if I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it if you don't do it do it right fill this hole Chang I'm gonna fill the whole chamber up you know if you're gonna do it do it see now I have the whole chamber filled with that coconut carbon you're gonna do it do it right so now I get that in there I got me some bullet broke down that like I said I'm using the Purple Reign strength Purple Reign from fabulous weather is down in Teddy Nietzsche all right salute to health wealth itself self-love is the best love if you haven't heard the risk I love you today then get to the closest merit in yourself self I love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself you need that's not home what would say make sense make sense didn't make sense so let's see what we got here oh [ __ ] that's good hold on let me see let me really hit this thing I hit it but I'm gonna hit it now yeah oh yeah yeah yeah coming through that ice chamber really close it now makes for more satisfying here let me put a little more water in just a wee bit more I'm a little cap back on it and I think that I think that I didn't have to leave the light on there that long I'm still learning but thanks shout out to everybody who's gave me little tips and hints and suggestions on how to better do the bong but I will tell you this it is definitely a difference using this right here because the heat is so cold oh [ __ ] we got my nose running but I like it I like it I wanna see how how much fun thought this is came and just that that short amount of time see my little bubble I was I've heard enough how slow it was going up you can see it moving just a little bit faster now not much now just to see if I can see the difference I'm going to remove my coconut carbon and I'm going to take a hit without that to see if I can tell any kind of difference you know what I think I put too much money in it Oh work with me guys I I'm not a perfection I'm not perfect at doing these wrong [ __ ] there we go there we go take a little more all right there we go gotta put this cap back on this stuff is too beautiful to be messing up and now let's try another hit without the carbon just to see if there's a difference I'm gonna see if I'm able to taste the difference yeah I like it a lot that is a smooth fit this really doesn't make a difference you get my nose running though that's because bones I haven't quite got it yet today I'm gonna hit them won't focus baby choking me but I am enjoying this I am enjoying this then they have a it also comes with a second piece right now this one right here which I should have had on with that with me already this is the second one that you can use now this one has the little pinchers in there like I said for you to just go ahead and drop drop ice down in it and that way your your Hittle be cold but I like this I really do it's already cold it's already chill I like this I like this i'ma hit it one more time I mean one more time cuz it tastes so good and we hit it cuz it tastes good it tastes good I've tried to leave the whole bulletin I've tried breaking it down let's see what you got a guy yeah I think I took out some I own that one I'm not [ __ ] with it water no market yeah once I get this water proportion up exactly right what's his dip day we go yeah I like it put some more man I'm gonna get it right I'm gonna get it right I got a little piece that's stopping me yeah right there that's what it was that little piece was blocking my airflow now I gotta try it again without my airflow being blocked devil piece was throwing me off all right there we go I'm gonna use the carbon again this time that carbon I was taken out to make a difference see if there was a difference the coconut carbon does make a difference it does make it way smoother yeah oh man I can tell you this with that carbon and this being cold this makes for one of these smoothness hits out of a bomb that I have had this is yeah I can't stop like usually a bone would have choked me out so much by now that is just not enjoyable and I guess I because I'm not too good I'm not perfect at the bombs yet but this is enjoyable yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay got your glass I don't like it I like it a lot two times that I really like when I love the fact of how cold this makes you hit me and I bet you do only have to leave an end I think they specifically said you only got to leave it in for like 30 minutes and you're good to go but even if even if this is not ready for you yet being able to load this with ice which I should have done it let me do that so let's see what this does in there because it has the picture see how that stops the ice from going down that Pinscher that stops the ice cream going down my bowl Oh give me another little piece right here of this Purple Reign just the milk I'm gonna take an ice hit and see see which one I really like now let's see now let's see he dropped out on carpet on the floor [ __ ] I'm making a mess oh but I do like this I like the ice chamber - this is good guy in glass I like it I like it then we let you look at this again I like that I like that I'm making you two thumbs up

positive or keep it pushing keep it positive we'll keep it pushing getting salute", "RybfqE03gmI": "Sometimes our digestive system can stand in\nour way. Now, what I mean by that is, when you take\nsome kind of oral supplement or an oral compound, you have a level of degradation that occurs\nsimply because your digestive system breaks things down. Now, does that mean that it's bad? No, absolutely not. Does it mean that oral compounds don't work? Absolutely not. That is not what I'm saying, but what I am\ntrying to allude to is the fact that if you have a specific area where you're trying to\nget some relief, let's say in the way of maybe some stiffness or anything like that, well,\nCBD can work in a transdermal topical form, and because it ends up skipping that oral\ndegradation and that gut biome degradation, you might have a better chance of relief at\nthat given area. You see, a lot of the pain in our body can\nbe indirectly or directly triggered by what is called inflammation. Now, one of the unique properties of CBD is\nthat it helps promote the healthy modulation of inflammation within the body. So, what that means is that it works upon\ninflammatory cytokines, things that would normally trigger inflammation, and a lot of\ntimes you'll have these inflammatory cytokines or have inflammation at a localized source. So, in essence, if you use some kind of topical,\nit makes it so you could potentially directly affect that inflammation at that very spot. You see, one of the major roles of CBD is\nthat it slows the cytokine production of immune cells. So, when you take it orally, you're working\nat a systemic level, but when you take it topically, you're working at the very topical\nlevel, although you do have some effect that still trickles down to the system overall. Now, additionally, CBD is unique because it\nactivates what is called the TRPV receptor. Okay. This TRPV1 receptor is also known as a vanilloid\nreceptor, and it controls a cell signaling protein, if you will. So, it controls this mechanism from the top\ndown, as far as inflammation is concerned, which is pretty neat. So, when you're looking, again, at the modulation\nof inflammation within the body, this could be a really cool way to target some of your\njoint pain, maybe some of your stiffness, things like that. Now, let's jump over really quick to a study. Okay, this interesting study was done on rats. Now, I know what you're thinking. Because it's done on rats, it's not applicable\nto humans. Well, no, it still is applicable. We could still take the common knowledge and\nthe common denominator from this study and apply it over to humans. So, this study took a look at rats that had\narthritis. So, they induced arthritis in their specific\nareas of their body, in their joints. Okay? Then they applied four days of 6.2 milligrams\nof CBD topical. Okay? It was really interesting what they found\nout, okay. They found that it significantly reduced the\njoint inflammation. So, what they found is that the joints, on\naverage, went from 72 millimeters all the way down to 65.6, in just a four-day span. Now, millimeters, we're talking small little\nrat joints here. So, that's a lot. So what they're finding is that the inflammation\nthat comes in from arthritis could be modulated by the CBD in this particular case. So, we translate that over to how it could\nwork for someone's given ailment as a human. You can see that there's a lot of potential\nbenefits. Pretty wild stuff. Now, the cool thing is, is that you don't\njust have CBD coming into the equation when you look at Octagon Biolabs. Okay, there's beeswax in the mix, okay, and\nbeeswax draws moisture into the skin, which is really interesting. So, it makes it so not only the skin is healthier,\nbut it makes it so that you're going to be able to hold in the compound a little bit\nbetter, as well. Additionally, MCT oil, which is going to make\nit so that there's a little bit more of a moisturizing effect, but also lavender oil,\nso there's a calming effect, and lastly, eucalyptus oil, which has a unique property when it comes\ndown to being antibacterial, but also being calming and potentially anti-inflammatory\nas well. So, when it comes down to utilizing CBD for\na specific thing within the body, a topical CBD might just be the solution for you. So, there are a lot of ways that CBD can affect\ndifferent things within the body from an anti-inflammatory standpoint, acting upon endocannabinoid receptors\nlike CB1 and CB2. But when it comes down to brass tacks, being\nable to directly impact where your pain points are, or directly impact where you're having\nsome bothersome issues, that might just be the quickest line from point A to point B.\nSo, as always, make sure you're keeping it locked in here with Octagon Biolabs. I'll see you soon.", "ye-aKzqj5so": "what's going on everyone my name is chris here at CBD review lab and today i'm reviewing ananda hemp's 600 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil so ananda hemp is part of the australian genetic development company if ago fiber which has over 20 years of hemp growing and breeding experience with over 300 acres of hemp from over 25 countries the seeds from echo fibers hint plants are transferred to the states to Kentucky and distributed to contracted farmers to be grown without pesticides or harmful chemicals and from these plants we get some high-quality a CBD oil which is continuously tested every step of the process from seed to plant to oil so by the time the product reaches the consumer it's been tested at least three times for potency containment incident equality and just in terms of quality control I don't think I've ever seen a company this meticulous and they actually even go a step further by providing individual batch numbers to see the exact certificate of analysis of the product in your hands so their oil has a golden appearance to it with a little bit of a grain and it has a faint botanical smell and taste to it effect wise I was pleasantly surprised with this product considering it's only 600 milligrams I started out with one milliliter dropper which is 20 milligrams of CBD the effects were subtle but I definitely felt it and the effects obviously increased with the more you take I've taken a couple sixty milligram doses and the effects are exactly what I look for high-quality CBD product in my opinion this is a great option for someone who's never tried CBD before price-wise it runs $90 but if you use the coupon code CBD review lab it'll bring it down to eighty one dollars Ananda hemp also offers a 2,000 milligram CBD oil which I hope to get my hands on one of these days so overall Ananda hemp is a solid CBD company that offers a high quality product so if you were thinking about trying them out but we're on the fence on whether or not they were legit you can have some peace of mind knowing they are so I hope this video was helpful if you have any questions about Ananda hemp or CBD in general please don't hesitate to leave them down below I'm very responsive and I'm happy to answer any questions so thank you so much for watching hope everyone has a great day peace this is moose", "16zJMWMnORU": "[Music] good morning Liberty it is Wednesday morning June 19th 2019 my name is Michael Bolden broadcasting to you live from my home office in studio here in downtown Los Angeles for the Tenth Amendment Center we multicast our stream live every Monday Wednesday Friday at 9:30 a.m. Pacific time you can find all of our archives and the podcast version of the show over at Tenth Amendment center.com good morning Liberty otherwise if you're watching live whether it's on YouTube Facebook D live twitch periscope wherever or if you're watching in the archive I really appreciate you spending some time with me today on this episode we're gonna talk about the latest status legal I guess legal status I put legal in quotes of CBD under federal law and regulation a lot of people tell me over and over again like oh hey Bouldin you know this CBT stuff it's it's everywhere so it must be legal I can find in the store I can buy it online I can have it shipped across state lines so it must be legal but this is absolutely not the case and the FDA just held its first public hearing at the end of last month I think it was on the 31st of May something like that to discuss what they're going to do to regulate and control this market they're basically behind the ball and trying to get their little grips on it right now but it is illegal according to the FDA in most situations but yet we find it all over the place now normally I would go right over into the live chat and say hello to everybody I am saying a quick kind of broad hello to everyone I appreciate you spending some time with me wherever you are joining us whether it's live or in the archive but I do have to cut the episode a little bit shorter than what I normally do on the Monday and Wednesday shows which are the longer ones Friday is 10 to 15 minutes usually but I'm going to cut this one a little bit shorter than normal because at 10 a.m. my time so in than a half-hour I'm recording an episode of the Tom woods show back on that show for a first time in quite a while pretty excited about that with Michael from Libertarian Party Mises caucus this morning so I want to cut this one short so I can have time to make sure I've got everything set up and ready to go to talk with Tom but look for that interview in the near future I think he usually publishes them a few days later at Tom woods calm so let's get right into this first of all I want to reference one episode that I did right at the end of last year because this so-called farm bill I guess we could probably call it the Food Stamp bill rather than the farm bill because that's really what it does after they passed the farm bill everyone was telling me oh they legalized hemp so now CBD is legal as well well I covered that in full detail on an episode on December 28th what's next for hemp and CBD after the farm bill I will make sure that that link is in the show notes archives over a 10th amendment center.com slash good morning Liberty if you want to jump over and watch it now if you're on youtube you've got the link accessible to you now but the short version is that even though they legalized or decriminalized industrial hemp in that bill they have a specific exception to it which makes it so it isn't at least on CBD but let's let's look at a few other things first of all again people always tell me that CBD is available everywhere and here's this article from Forbes according to research the market is anticipated to reach 20 billion in sales by 2024 even my own brother at some point he was out here visiting recently on some business and we hung out a little bit and he was saying how can this be illegal how can this not be a legal substance like people are making billions of dollars on this and I think to me that is an example of how nullification works nullification is really effective even if people don't realize that what they're doing is nullifying when there's enough people enough states enough businesses all willing to do things that the federal government says that they're not allowed to do you end up with 20 billion in sales by 2024 they say from candies to cosmetics see is expanding to new product categories for example Ben & Jerry's just announced its plan to launch a CBD infused ice cream once CBD is legalized at the federal level so Ben and Jerry's recognize isn't part of it and they're not going to cross that line I think some of the larger manufacturers are staying or larger companies are staying away from it because that's maybe a little bit more risky or they're they're more risk-averse in their business and then they go on and say it currently 47 states have legalized CBD for human use according to the Consumer Reports I'm not sure if that number is actually correct I think it's actually a little bit lower but it's a significant part of the country that is saying you can do this and this other report that I saw at marijuana moment led me to tsa.gov supposedly the TSA is now letting people have CBD on the flight and the short version is they basically updated their policy and if you're watching the video now I've got the TSA policy here for medical marijuana they consider CBD either medical marijuana or if it has a certain THC level or above if it's below it it's an industrial hemp product but the industrial hemp product is still regulated by the FDA and they say this marijuana and certain cannibal cannabis infused products including some cannabidiol CBD oil remain illegal under federal law except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC or that are approved by the FDA th TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law to local state or federal authorities well which ones which and how does it qualify basically what the TSA does is they've made a statement that says we are not trying to stop people from getting on planes because they are carrying CBD but it is up and it says here at the bottom I can't even scroll up high enough it's as quote the final decision rests with the TSA officer on whether an item is allowed through the checkpoint so people are getting a little bit confused they see a report that says the TSA is now allowing it basically that TSA is turning a blind eye they're reiterating that the FDA has control over this and I'll get into a little bit more detail on that in a moment and at the same time they're leaving it to the discretion the TSA agent what they're gonna do now if they want to say this thing is illegal if that particular agent says this is illegal we're not gonna let this person through what they would do is they would turn them over to local law enforcement and now with local law enforcement because 47 states supposedly I'll have decriminalized or legalized CBD if local law enforcement doesn't actually have any criminal activity or criminal charges for someone carrying CBD then local law enforcement does nothing maybe the TSA just makes you throw it out I just flew with TSA well lax is a different story but back and forth to Milwaukee I flew with some CBD products back and forth and had no problems I mean I just laid it out in the cart because whatever I mean if they're gonna throw out a couple of gummies it's gonna cost me a few bucks but it helps me sleep or relax reduce some anxiety through travel which is a horrible experience so the confusion is all these different things are happening so therefore it must be ill it must be legal and Mike Meharry in his article that I'd like to cover here points out that this isn't the case and just a quick reiteration of what was passed in this so-called farm bill and he writes with the passage of the farm bill the federal government now treats industrial hemp as an agricultural commodity instead of controlled substance and because CBD which it comes from a number of places but it is most commonly extracted from the resin of the flower of the industrial hemp plant which is not the marijuana plant for lack of a better term they're cousins cannabis plants different types of cannabis plants the marijuana version has high THC or can be bred to have very high THC and the hemp is used for clothing for rope for oil for food granola and soaps all kinds of other things and then you can also get this CBD this compound from the the flower the resin of the flower and so people think oh well industrial hub is decriminalized and this comes from the industrial hemp plant in most situations so therefore it must be legal quick reopen this while the DEA Mike rights no longer has the authority to regulate hemp the provisions of the farm bill have no bearing on FDA rules and regulations regarding CBD in fact a section of the farm bill makes this explicit they say specifically regulations and guidelines affects another law states quote nothing in this subtitle shall affect or modify the federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in other words the so called Authority for the FDA now mind you I believe the FDA shouldn't exist under the Constitution the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act shouldn't exist under the Constitution but under the people with guns the way that they read this the people who passed the law specifically said we're going to decriminalize or legalize hemp unless it's CBD and then we're kicking the can over to the FDA and here's what the FDA had to say about this is their overview they just published this on June 14 so five days ago this is an overview of the hearing the first public hearing that they had on CBD late last month and this is an overview it of it they say quote on the state level some jurisdictions have eliminated certain prohibitions on cannabis or cannabis derived compounds on the federal level the agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 the farm bill removed cannabis and cannabis derivatives that are very low in THC from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act at the same time that legislation specifically preserved the FDA's responsibilities over such products so the FDA is reiterating what the farm bill says they are now the ones that determine whether or not a CBD product is legal or not and they say as these law other laws have changed and as more cannabis products come to the market whether lawfully or otherwise this is in their own statement there I don't think they really want to say there's billions of dollars flooding the market it's totally illegal because they're gonna look like an incompetent they're gonna look like what they are so they just kind of hint that you know there might be some products that are not lawfully on the market they say the FDA's role is becoming more practically relevant to many effective stakeholders so the FDA is now reiterating just last week or I guess late last week that would've been last Friday that they have authority over CBD and they also go through some of the ways they have so-called authority over this they say for example if a product is being marketed as a drug meaning for example that it's intended to have a therapeutic effect such as treating a disease then it's regulated as a drug and it cannot generally cannot be sold without FDA approval so anyone who is selling CBD and making a claim that it treats something doesn't matter what it is insomnia anxiety inflammation as soon as they say that on the packaging on their website on the label whatever it may be FDA says this is a drug and there's only been one drug approved called epic dialects it's a CBD isolate it's not the full natural version basically from a plant and it costs thirty-two thousand dollars a year thirty-two thousand dollars a year compared to like maybe twenty dollars a month for the same dose if you get it from the plant version from a lot of these manufacturers so they're basically saying as soon as it's marketed soon as someone markets this as being able to treat something then it's a drug and it's totally illegal unless unless the FDA goes through or less they go through millions and millions of dollars of research and clinical trials that the FDA approves multiple phases long time so anybody who's got a CBD product that makes soon as they make that claim it's it's an illegal drug they also say quote food including dietary supplements is regulated differently but with the same overarching goal of protecting consumers I don't think they're protecting anybody but the people who want to charge thirty two thousand dollars for a fifty dollar product to be honest with you and they say among other things it is currently illegal so even if you don't make a claim that it has therapeutic effects that it acts like a drug it treats something soon as you put it in a food or dietary supplement which is basically everything else I think it that can the most difficult gray area is when it's in Beauty and cosmetic products but I did another episode on that and I don't believe that the FDA sees those as legal either but there's just so much of it happening that they're just trying to kind of drill down on certain parts of it so soon as it's marketed as a food or a dietary supplement I get it in my coffee cold brew coffee with CBD in it you can get it in teas you can get it in all kinds of stuff at least here in California I mean I'm not sure how available when I was in Milwaukee a couple or last weekend was it last weekend I went for my nephew's graduation so I apologize Pierce if I don't remember the exact day there was a whirlwind man so when I was there we went to a little health market in in in their neighborhood and they had all kinds of stuff chocolates and other foods that were available in Wisconsin as well but soon as you do this it's illegal because according to the FDA it is quote currently illegal to put into interstate commerce of food - which CBD has been added or to market CBD as or in a dietary supplement period and we know how they view interstate commerce basically anything in the marketplace affects interstate commerce so therefore they see it all as under their control now they've even started to issue warning letters on these and there's a whole page on the FDA website talking about how they're sending out and they're only I don't know how they're picking which companies to target with these warning letters but there's a few that are sent out every month I don't know why it doesn't format but when I have it at this size I can't see the full list but I did pull up one - nutria pure LLC this was sent out in March and this is the letter the claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under this section because they are intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease and or talking about being specific here they are not being very clear and or because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body basically if you sell CBD on your website and they take products for quote hemp oil that contains CBD and CBD soft gels and because supposedly this works doing something and they say this on the website then the FDA says this is a drug and they go on and they say as explained further below introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act they give a link to the FDA website not to the Act itself but they give all these different sections of the federal act and so they're warning people you're what you're doing you're selling this this is illegal and then they go on for people who try to do an end run and say well it's a we're not gonna market it as a drug I know like some of my friends in the health freedom world what they'll do when they're talking about things for example like on a youtube show they'll say well we're not making any claims about what this product does and that's generally the end run around being targeted for marketing an illegal drug or a non approved drug according to the FDA you just don't make claims about what it does you can have someone else talk about it like for me it does this for me CBD and since I don't sell the product I say for me it works great for inflammation after I run I have a very sore ankle or a sore knee I take a little bit CBD v or two and a half milligrams and it helps reduce the inflammation far better than something like Tylenol which is incredibly incredibly bad for my liver so a lot of people say well we're just gonna mark it as a dietary supplement we're not gonna make any claims about what it does but the FDA takes it to one another level and they go in this letter and the the varying letters to different companies are about the same they say although you market hemp oil and CBD soft gels as dietary supplements FDA has concluded based on available evidence that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under these sections so they've got this these exception under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act that that basically say if you just market it as a dietary supplement and you make no claims about what it's going to do people can make their own choice on their own then you can sell this stuff but they have specifically said that CBD does not qualify to be marketed as a dietary supplement because it has gone through multiple steps of clinical trials for this at the dialects so as soon as someone started making it for an fda-approved drug then there's no more dietary supplement selling allowed because some company that wants to sell for thirty two thousand dollars a year I'm not sure if anybody's even buying that which is absurd they say there is an exception if the substances substance was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were Ofra were authorized however based on available evidence FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product epidemics as soon as the company started doing that and the FDA accepted it for clinical trials and tests and then approved it as a drug that no one can sell it as a supplement so they held this hearing to determine whether or not they could make an extra exception and they had maybe like a hundred different industry experts come out and testify on this in a public hearing and here's how let's see what Mike had to say on May 31st the FDA held its first hearing on CBD after the meaning the same questions remain as before will the federal agency continue to maintain its current regulation and prohibition of hemp derive can a banana Benoist or will it give into market forces and open the door for general sale and use of CBD and he points out that the hearing that they had just last month did not result in any kind of policy change but as widely seen is the first step toward a comprehensive regulatory scheme I love that he called it a scheme for the CBD for CBD what that will look like remains to be seen and like I said there was around a hundred industry experts that testified and almost all of them and I'm not sure what kind of industry experts there weren't any Austrian economists clearly there weren't any libertarians there weren't any constitutionalist because every single person was basically calling on the FDA to institute regulations rather than just say you know what forget it we're not gonna touch this we don't anything to do with it we're gonna say it's a free-for-all go ahead I think this isn't our job we shouldn't exist that will never happen from the FDA basically what they have now is an open comment period because they're going to issue regulations on CBD we don't know if they're going to make an exception on CBD I think the the comment period is going until July 2nd or so I'm not sure exactly one but they have an open comment period where people can submit information online or submit paper for or against regulation of CBD and then the FDA will take that into consideration and make a choice on how they're going to treat this product and we'll know in the next few months whether they consider it fully illegal like they do today or if they recognize that the market is already filled with billions of dollars worth of this product and then maybe they just try to clamp down and only support the big companies that are doing it I'm not sure how that's gonna play out and mike puts it this way and i think this is really the most interesting part of it all he says even with both the FDA and DEA theoretically enforcing federal laws and regulations banning CBD state and local action have already nullified federal prohibition and practice and effect there's no reason to think that won't continue as long as states maintain the same stance on CBD as they did back in 2014 simply put the feds lack the personnel and resources to crack down on CBD even if the FDA wants to and I'm pretty certain based on the statements that I read that they absolutely want to but will they be able to do anything about a market that's this large this fast I've heard some people say it's the fastest growing product in the I guess we'll call it alternative natural medicine or healing realm in history they've never seen something take off this quickly will the FDA be able to get their grimy hands on it I'm certain they're gonna try but as Mike puts it if enough people continue to say no do what they want if the market continues going forward markets are stronger than government anyways I do have to cut it short like I mentioned earlier because I'm gonna in a few minutes here I got a record an interview with Tom woods I'm pretty excited about that keep an eye out for that I hope you found this interesting educational fun to watch all that good stuff make sure to smash the like subscribe continue leaving comments I'm gonna check in the next hour so I'll go back and look at the comments that you guys have lest left here on the live stream or later on in the archives reviews over on iTunes are very helpful and of course all the archives over at Tenth Amendment center.com slash good morning Liberty thank you so much for joining me again today I'll see you next time on Friday and have a great day", "EHaOT7p9akE": "hi everyone I'm coming to you today to show you my three favorite beauty products at the moment yeah let's just dive right into it okay my first product that I love and I have been using for years now it's actually a men's line but ladies don't be scared and don't let that turn you off it's called uncle Harry's natural products they have a wide range of products whether it's from natural toothpastes this right here is a hemp blemish cell it's used for it says it's a healing ointment that helps fight skins painful blemishes with natural herbs and oils I use this just all over my face after I've washed my face it now I exfoliated whatever you do in your routine I just throw this on and kind of just let it sit and throw out the night before I go to bed I just kind of mix it in a little bit to make sure it's all soaked in a lot of people to I feel like are a little hesitant about oils because they don't want it to clog their pores or this and that but I mean this one has done nothing but wonders for me so I really like that for just face makes it really soft and helps with blemishes but also another thing that I use for it is with eczema I've had eczema pretty much my whole life nothing has worked and then I found this originally had it for my face and then I just put it on like a little patch flare-up when I had it and it really did work so natural healing ointment great my next product is another like its CBD and CBD you're probably thinking alright but really um I have suffered with like anxiety and things like that for a good majority of my life I've always been told you know you can go on this pill or that pill to help reduce the symptoms I've never really been a fan of taking pills or medicines I've always liked to explore my natural options before I resorted to that and just recently actually I got sent some of this CBD oil from Alpen organics it works awesome for anxiety it says you can put it in your food smoothie whatever you want but I just probably get let me say let me open this half this little vial thing and put it directly under my tongue hold it for 15 seconds and then swallow in voila not only for anxiety I use it for I also use it for headaches and that time of the month ladies cramping all that it really does help so this is also one of my favorites at the moment last but not least is NYX Cosmetics I'm sure a few you guys have heard of it before the reason why I like them is they have a huge range of products from lip faced anything really honestly but um yeah I love it because for one thing cruelty free all my makeup is Grotti free that's like a huge thing for me they have a wide range of products as well as colors so every skin tone I'm sure you find something that with that would be good for you and then yeah I don't know it's just good and it's affordable I feel like it's kind of hard to find well at least people think it's hard to find a cheap makeup brand or a cheap line of makeup that has good results like the higher-end and people will just automatically assume the more expensive the better but I feel like for NYX that's not the case I'm gonna show you a couple of my favorite products that I use on the daily from them so this one is the NYX micro brow pencil it's very similar to the Anasazi just a really really thin applicator and then you got a little spoolie on the enta brush so this is amazing and second of all the HD finishing powder it's a strength it's a it's a translucent powder and I just put it on after my makeup it doesn't have any color but it kind of mattifies it just the perfect amount your highlighter will still shine through and all that but mineral based cruelty free yeah that's I mean can't go wrong with all of those so that concludes my favorite three products at the moment I hope you guys enjoyed and let me know your feedback if any of you have purchased any of them and just tell me how you guys feel about thank you so much", "jvxugbo6Z2k": "the pleasure of discussing south african uh scheduling for cbd and thc with my guest jackie ramich from she's a responsible pharmacist who i met about two years ago at a gp's expo as well as a pharmaceutical manufacturing expo and welcome jackie i'd like you to maybe tell the audience a bit more about yourself you know your journey as a responsible pharmacist and how you got into you know cannabis ultimately uh which probably at the time was a bit contentious as a you know coming from an rp background uh with you know the need for more clinical evidence but we're both very passionate about this and i'd love to hear how you came into the plot morning jeff thank you so much um as always it's wonderful to have a discussion with you jeff and i have traveled a long road since we first met at the the gp tps expo and we've maintained and continued our discussions around around cannabis and analytics and regulation i think as a broader broader picture so i studied pharmacy at potter's student university which has now become the university of the northwest um we were actually our group of one of the first english-speaking students to be writing getting afrikaans lectures with english textbooks and writing opercon's exams so it was um it was quite an exciting time and if i have to incorporate it i gave it a little bit of thought later is that it was already sort of disruptive then in a long-standing profession so i was almost setting up my my timing for being a professional in a within a disruptive industry which i think where is this is where we sit right now and uh serendipitously came into into cannabis because i was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago um i went through the whole chemotherapy radiation double mastectomy journey and there were a lot of discussions around cannabis and there always have been discussions around cannabis whatever in whatever context we were in as students or if you were in a pharmacy in a regulated environment in a controlled in a law enforced environment medicines are very strictly controlled strongly regulated as they should be and along came the the changes of the cannabis regulations and i had then been approached by a number of clients to to then consult so i've i've consulted i might have a strong background in cultivation and knowledge in setting up facilities as well as analytics and my passion still remains the patient though and i'm very glad that every morning when i check myself that the patient is still my my ultimate goal we we ultimately go into this profession to help people to nurture people to to make people better any health care professional their origination comes from a need to help people and that's essentially what i'm like to continue to do in the proper way in the guided way but in a typically me disruptive disruptive industry so yeah in short that's my little bio i do also have sorry caveat is that i do do some clinical evaluations for sapra but because of a whole bunch of lots like i told you about professor mark blackman his conflicts of interest and his disclaimers are just lights so i will speak in the context of public domain and we will go from there perfect and public domain is definitely where we're going to be focusing is um at the end of the day the my care is also with the patient and the consumer and for that reason i find it vital that there's more information available to the public and with that intent we've basically focused uh heavily on the production of you know content uh relevant content um the discussion on scheduling i feel is more and more important as we see individuals coming to to basically market with products um and we want to make sure that um you know it's important to push the boundaries in the space uh you know we're waiting for regulation and it's taking a bit long it's important to need to you know start to get products out there but i also want to keep consumers safe as well as those individuals from overstepping and this is why i think it's necessary to have a discussion around scheduling what it means so that the public as a whole have a better feel for that space so in light of that um the main discussion we're gonna focus on today is obviously the distinction between the scheduling so whether that's schedule six four or schedule zero um in that regard um i think it's nice maybe jackie to bring you back in just to briefly discuss the medicines and related substances act you know where did it originate for from what was the point or the purpose behind the act uh because ultimately a lot of this is put in place to protect consumer safety and maybe you can speak a bit to that sure jeff so medicines and related substances act 101 of 1965 it had been in in working for for quite a while in terms of our industry healthcare and specifically the regulatory industry is is very much of a a prospective view on what people or what patients and what healthcare professionals should be doing so you know it's not like suddenly i often liken the industry to to the tech industry is where the tech industry has come so far uh ahead that we've now been making retrospective laws and retrospective regulations on regarding social media i mean one of the examples i can think of is you know can you get divorced on whatsapp or via social media suddenly the lawyers the social media and the tech lawyers had to think about that because that's what people were doing and the the medicines and related substances act came into that perspective regulation in terms of the laws around medicines the laws around excipients the laws around who can handle what product who can dispose of a product who can prescribe a product who can be a custodian of a product so we we attempted what i say we i mean the people and the the groups who attempted to put the medicines and related substances act together were trying to be as prospective as as they possibly could in an industry that could easily be over-regulated but also they can be under-regulated where we see that people are using medicines for incorrect reasons or that prescribers are prescribing without outside of their gambit or pharmacists are acting outside of their um their their um what do you call it their scope of practice so that's why we have the medicines and related substances act and then also to explain to people about the scheduling obviously it goes into quite specific professional jargon but it is it reads easily once you know what what the basics are and how we navigate those schedules perfect and i mean i would like to highlight as well i mean the point of um you know putting an act together like the medicine and related substance act is really to protect the consumer uh often from charlatans uh offered to introduce standards that should be imprisoned in the place not to have anyone professionally step outside of the boundaries um i know this is obviously a situation where we're trying to bring um let's say cannabis into what would be a medical framework and not to say it hasn't been in that space because it was in the u.s pharmacopoeia for years uh prior to his prohibition so i mean it's one where you know for the for the sake if we look over 200 years and longer there's a lot of you know use of the plant and i think it's one where at this point it's just finding that balancing act between you know how it will ultimately play out as more clinical evidence establishes itself in the space and ultimately how to protect safety uh in the space so i want you to quickly jump um i noticed a bit of dogs in the background that's completely fine yeah i'm sorry can we discuss um obviously we had initially seen back in 2019 a release from uh you know sakura in terms of how they were placed in scheduling and then they updated it in may of 2020. can you discuss and i wouldn't say briefly let's maybe discuss this comprehensively the difference between uh something like a schedule four and six products on the shelf or not on the shelf when we talk about on the shelf we mean you know in a pharmacies secured away from the public you know only schedule one and two perhaps will be an otc and schedule zero is completely available to be placed in any general store um how do you how does a company what is a schedule 6 substance and you know just in general if we don't talk cannabis specific how does one go about getting that in place absolutely so i just wanted to add that the medicines and related substances act is when we look at products um and medical or any product that's available we look at quality safety and efficacy for the out the outcome of the patient so that's that i want to highlight and i will keep as much of a golden thread through as possible because again at the end of the day quality safety and efficacy is what speak to the patient so if we have to speak in scheduling and scheduling status most of the previously illicit substances heroin cannabis and i don't even like saying the two in the same sentence because they're completely different however they were in the medicines and related substances act they would just they lay within the gambit of law enforcement and they were under shed when we still had schedule 9 schedule 8 and schedule 7 they were then in those tears of the medicines and related substances act so they weren't even ignored even though that they were illicit substances they still had to be accounted for so as you said let's take away from the fact that talking about cannabis we speak about a scheduled sick substance a schedule 6 substance is kept in what we call an hfd or a habit-forming drug cupboard or a high formulation drug cupboard at the back of any pharmacy in any space so it's within a public health care space private health care a retail pharmacy a hospital pharmacy it's kept under lock and key and the only person who has that luck that key is the responsible pharmacist on site and then possibly maybe the pharmacy manager if they're a pharmacist will then have a duplicate key somewhere and that kin is never ever given to any other support personnel the reason for that is that schedule 6 so it has to be controlled it has to be documented it has to be balanced four times a year and any auditors in an external external auditor or a software auditor or evaluator or we don't call them inspectors anymore we call them compliance officers they can come in at any given time into a pharmacy of any sort of any description and they can check your schedule 6 register and if it is not balanced if you cannot account for any dismissed or product that has been thrown away or not thrown away but incinerated then you have to explain why you can't account for that um schedule six can only be given by a healthcare practitioner who is registered with hpcsa and who is allowed to do so they don't need any other extra papers so a gp a pediatrician a gynecologist an orthopedic surgeon a physician anybody who a health care professional who has done a their prescribing course through their health care profession can prescribe a schedule six so that i want to be quite clear about from the beginning even a pharmacist who has done um a public health care course cannot prescribe a schedule six we can only prescribe up to a schedule for if we we've completed and got that that certification so schedule sixes are very controlled substances they cannot be repeated on a prescription i'm talking on a very granular level the prescription has to be within 30 days of issue so a patient who comes to a pharmacy on the 5th of august and their script was written on the 3rd of june we are not allowed by law to honor that prescription so that's just giving you an idea of how controlled that substance is we then go down to the schedule fives which are generally anti-depressants sleeping tablets some biologicals schedule fours generally would be hormone therapies hormone replacement therapies thyroid medication they need to be controlled but they are permitted to be under certain circumstances prescribed by pharmacists with a special permission or all healthcare professionals these at at this point i must say are all kept within the dispensary area of a pharmacy or the dispensing area of a public pharmacy or or outlet so so to speak i'm speaking when i speak about pharmacy i'm speaking as a generalized hospital retail commercial public uh wholesaler they have time there's more paper trail of them yeah exactly they have to be all monitored in terms of you know when was it dispensed then and we'd compare that so if i'm going to use cbd as an example um cbd is scheduled for for the most part unless it meets certain exclusions as was gazetted by government so one of those exclusions relates to complementary medicines uh where they specifically outline that the pack size for cannabidiol cannot exceed 600 milligrams for sales pack and then obviously specification that the maximum daily dose is 20 milligrams and that there's a low risk claim okay can you maybe in that sense what we are talking about is a product that can be sold you know otc over the counter at any pharmacy it can be sold even at you know typically a pick and pay or any retail store um and then on that uh low risk claim can you elaborate a bit about that and you know you know that that contrast between the two you know schedule four and schedule zero so it's a it's a massive contrast jeff uh if you look at so we we just discussed a while ago you know paracetamol paracetamol and you know whatever the the actual component the trade name is whether it's panado whether it's calpol um it's schedule zero so it's available to everyone who can take it off from off of a shelf they don't need interaction with anyone they don't need advice from anyone however paracetamol in its own molecular state uh can do quite a lot of liver damage so we we have to be very cautious when when we start stepping into these spaces of just because it says schedule zero and that it's a cams or a complementary medicine or it purely means that there are no substantiated claims or or research now i'm not saying this for paracetamol i'm saying that the opposite so paracetamol was fully fully clinically researched it was allowed to be researched it wasn't a pre-present a previously illicit substance but it was found that it required a scheduling and that it was safe within certain parameters and that then relates back to the medicines and related substances act a 14 year old can't go in and buy as much panado as they like um well they shouldn't be able to let me put it let me just caveat that on the side however when we start dabbling with schedule zeros to say you know it's a cams product it's complementary what is it complementary to and what is that complementary medicine advice or information based on uh are we saying it's complementary because we haven't got substantiated claims and we haven't got substantiated research for it yet or are we just trying to jump in on a market where something is a buzzword and we're not actually 100 sure of of why we're doing it and this is where the gray area in the industry becomes difficult it becomes difficult for healthcare professionals to manage it becomes difficult for patients and for the public to understand how healthcare professionals should be looking after their health and it also starts creating a little bit of um if you could call it discredit um and and um doubt in in a consumer's mind so patient slash consumer we don't want them to be doubtful of the care that they're receiving or products that on the market and because there might be sort of a wild west approach to the fact that oh look at south africa you know we come so far with our regulations and we really need to get product on the shelf but we we need to be very cautious of the way we approach this into in terms of substantiating products that that are on the market so schedule zero complementary medicines essentially mean that they have found to have some form of benefit and what i use here is african traditional medicines they've been used for hundreds and hundreds of years and we discussed it on a recent workshop that we had and we had the african traditional healers we had bush doctors and we had we had a lot of rastafarian elders as well and the the amount of years or eons that these products have been used beneficially um have been really well documented i mean we look at rooibos tea roibus tea is not schedule zero however it does have certain antioxidant properties that have been researched and that have been proven and this is where i go back to to how we have to approach the scheduling and how we have to approach what we what we talk about and when we talk about it with cbd and with thc perfect 100 and i fully agree i mean one of the things that you know as i know it's a balancing act for all parties in terms of we all want more clinical information so we can have a better understanding of not just cbd and thc but all the components within the plant um so that that work is somewhat taking its place internationally and with the israelis and other groups the question obviously for me the more concerning point is things like the post importation testing uh that is required around these products i mean who is going around actually testing these products that are on the shelf i mean that's a question i think we've both had for a very long time and i know that they'll call up yeah it's one of but i mean this is actually where it starts um for me if we're talking about consumer safety um and at least consistency i want to know if even if i'm if i'm convinced based on my own research and literature and it's a schedule zero substance and i want to buy it for let's say helping me sleep um i want to buy a product i can trust now do i trust in the international products do i want to support the local products or any of the products being tested um and i think we can both kind of lean into that one because i think we both know working in the space that unfortunately you know there isn't as a stringent protocol for some of these being tested jeff let you say you said so diplomatically and that's why we've always i love we love i love our chats um and i'm laughing already because you know i'm so glad you brought up the post importation testing because i think if ever i get a new tattoo it's going to be on my forehead that says post importation testing because i'm i'm a voracious supporter of anything that comes into the country so we start on let's like you said let's exclude the cannabis conversation for now and you want to bring in an api um it is no longer protected in terms of trademark or generic ip it's longer than older than 20 years and you want to bring in a generic paracetamol molecule you want to bring in a paracetamol isolate you want to bring in a paracetamol excipient you want to bring in some sugar from i don't know from india or something like that once that reaches the port whatever it is excipient and it's when it's marked for a wholesaler a manufacturer a third party it will reach there with a certificate of analysis from that country that it came from that certificate of analysis i mean you and i know but for purposes of our audience they need to know that it's basically an identification method of whatever that product is and we can extend this our previous conversation in joburg with that with our other colleague extended to traceability and even if it wasn't a medicinal product we still have to extend it for traceability purposes coming onto south african soil or into into the country so let's go back to our example you want to bring this api or this excipient in it's marked for a third-party manufacturer or wholesaler and they the certificate of analysis gives it an identification so what is this product what is in it and what components of what are in it at what percentage or what ratio it doesn't matter it basically gives an id of what that product is and if i take a bit of that product i take a teaspoon or a vial or a container of that product and i take it to my independent laboratory and i ask them to test that whether ftir whether gc whether hplc they test it according to what is most appropriate in a pharmacopoeia for that product and then they also then print me a certificate of analysis if i as a pharmacist you know already i've spoken about it a lot if i want to completely validate that i can then maybe go to my own in-house laboratory and i can have it tested as well so then we've got two south african tests and we've got one uh certificate of analysis from from the country of origin of the pro the product within ranges within stipulated ranges that are set within pharmacopoeias and in the regulatory in biopharmaceutical environment those three certificates of analysis must be within at least a range of each other now obviously each product has its own range so let's say for example paracetamol the coas can be 10 art for example in a range but they can't be 15 out and then we look at so that's just analytical identification and then what is in that molecule or what is in that that api then we have to look at specifically very very importantly in south africa is the microbial analysis so what microbes are potentially or have tested to be in that product now you don't you don't ever get a completely 100 percent microbe free product unless it's an injectable which i've done under very different circumstances and the import of api for injectables also follows a different process in terms of supply chain however there are certain parameters that those microbiologicals need to fall within so they'd be sort of no less than 10 cfus which are called colony forming units which means how many colon colonies of that bacteria are formed within a certain centimeter space on when they do the petri dish testing so i'm going quite deep here but it's just to give our audience an understanding of how micro biologicals are tested so we have to look and see in that product what are the microbials in that product and do they match our microbial post importation testing that we have done and jeff you know with respect i've used this example before i will tone it down a bit but i honestly don't want to know that a product that i'm choosing to buy or using has been made in somebody's kitchen garage backyard um outside in the snow in minnesota with a very dirty pan and they haven't washed their hands after they've gone to the bathroom and that is that is very much i'm not specifying in this industry i'm specifying in any industry that we need to be aware of is that how that product gets to that point of the port or gets to the point into our country is incredibly important in terms of consistent supply chain consistent traceability consistent tracking and consistent certificate of analysis or certificate of conformance for example if it's an excipient and maybe a non-medicinal item then it would be purely a certificate of conformance that this product conforms to the guidelines of what food grade sugar should be to be used in a sachet for indigestion and that is it sounds very involved but when you give it that last sentence it's super simple yeah exactly and i mean for me this is the thing i mean even if your product is being shipped from a gmp which is a good manufacturing practice site that's fully licensed it doesn't negate the responsibility to post tests you know when post importation testing happens the reason is a lot can happen uh during the transit you know the ship can stand on water for a few extra days or if it's a flights it could stand out in the sun for a couple days all of this can accelerate microbes being grown up in the sample as well as uh deteriorate the actual active uh in that substance so i completely agree like the first call of entry really needs to be that decision to test every substance coming in uh in addition so that it complies so that we know that what we're providing to whether that's a contract lab or it's a finished pharmaceutical product that's going on a shelf that it actually conforms to what it needs to meet and i'd like to jump forward here a little because i mean we've discussed this um a bit as well in terms of you know currently and the way i see it and the way i've been told from different parties in the industry is in terms of cannabinoid based uh scheduled four and six substances um at this point it seems there is no full marketing authorization or some company or party hasn't brought to south africa an application where they have gone ahead and actually got in a schedule four or six substance so schedule four being a medically proven cbd products uh perhaps like epidiolex and schedule six being a thc containing substance um and they haven't actually gotten an authorization for these products in the country and for me this raises the next point which is a gp is within their full rights to go and prescribe let's say a schedule 6 thc dosage but where if the patient cannot get access to it we are kind of sitting in that chicken and egg scenario where it's great that we now allow the scope of schedule four and six but you know if no one's authorized or gone through a marketing authorization maybe you can tell us a bit about what a marketing authorization is what maybe a ctd is a common technical document how does that all relate and what is required so that if someone goes ahead and an applicant files for this uh this application it will actually enable doctors to start taking that next step which is prescribe a schedule four and six substance yeah so jeff you know you you nail the passion points with me every single time just when i think okay i can just sort of now just just calm and just be pat just be calmly passionate about your your industry boy you come with and firing with with the full passion questions now you've hit my full passion point which is where where the regulators are sitting with with thc and cbd and how they're approaching it and by no stretch of the imagination must we think that that that that the regulator is sitting on their hands where where uh cannabis is concerned i think what is happening is that the the the capacity and the resource to address it fully um is still being figured out so i'll give you my my professional opinion and not to tell them what they need to do but just to give an input in terms of where other schedule 6 and schedule 4 products are lying as well as where we're now putting cannabis um and there is there is a misalignment um which i don't think is deliberate i i just think it is a more of a protective mechanism um as to where we are with with the rapid rollover of the regulations that happened i just wanted to mention jeff one more one more thing on the the last bit is that chain of custard is incredibly important in terms of the integrity of a product so you can't always be certain that there'll be a responsible pharmacist or a pharmacist or somebody at the port health receiving a product so you have to have some sort of a chain of custody and an accountability partner or person who is responsible for checking your certificate of analysis or certificate of conformance at port health and then whoever is receiving it on the other side is also part of that chain of custody and it's what we talk about in the industry specifically with um higher scheduled products and that chain of custody becomes really really important but onto in terms of the schedule 6 and the schedule 4 i'll give you a practical example is that if any any gp in in south africa is allowed to prescribe a schedule 6. so you can go to a gp you can go to a pediatrician you can go to whoever your health care providers are and tell them of your condition and they might need to prescribe you schedule six um some of those common ones are methylphenidate um the common the trade the originator the trade name was i know there's a couple of different generics now but the originator was ritalin um and then there's morphine there's codeine and then there's methadone which they use in the rehabilitating um drug and substance patients substance abuse patients so you can hear that they're all really sort of high in not high end but sort of high potential for addiction products but anybody can prescribe them so you can go to your gp tomorrow and say you have an extreme pain or you know for some other reason you find you have morphine your gp is allowed to give you morphine because it's available here if your gpu your gp can also write down sativex on that prescription but sativex is not available in south africa so you as the patient will then need to go to the digi and tosapra and to the company wherever oversees it it's a us fda approved product so it would be a u.s product and you would then have to apply to get that product as sativex as it is in because currently we do not have any schedule 6 thc or schedule 4 products in the process or in the entry level or in the system can i so to speak in that ctd triangle system which i'll get to now that are even remotely approaching and authorization they they're they're not even at the beginning of an authorization now i have to say in terms of caveat with to in terms of my um my clinical evaluator position with sapra because i am involved in cannabis cultivation i am not allowed to evaluate any cannabis uh dossiers at all so i don't know i don't i don't know but i've spoken with sarpren and sarpa also said on a public domain webinar that they don't have any products at the moment so exactly it's public knowledge so on the schedule for issue and that's possibly more where um so we've addressed the scheduled six the thc um you know i i personally and professionally don't think we should be tying doctors or gp's hands further to say well you need a you need a section 21 to be able to prescribe thc they prescribe any schedule six they prescribe all the others without any other section any other papers why must they need it now for thc the only reason is that because is because we don't have any current registered evaluated and and um regulated thc product within the south african borders number one number two when it comes to schedule four if it's for example i'll take the practical example of epidialex which has been proven it's fda the first fda approved it's been rolled out in many of the other countries because it's fda approved and been used in the two epileptic seizure conditions for for small children and in fact some some adults they're doing some clinical trials and adults now as well but that you your dual gp can prescribe for you can write down epidialex you'd have to go through the same process because epidialex is only available from the us and in only recently in the uk um and before it was available in the uk i read a story of a mom who was who was trying desperately to get epidialex for her daughter her three-year-old daughter and it was going to cost something like 4 500 pounds per month for her to get it plus she had to get special authorization to get a schedule well when in our terms a schedule 4 to give to her daughter now i think any person who has got any parents sister child friend with a condition of any sort and you could help them i've i have yet to find somebody who would say no uh so we we start getting em embroiled in a in a legitimacy issue in terms of we need products we need people to start registering products but in order for them to start registering products they need to do relevant clinical trials which which are in the process and universities have been able to do start doing clinical trials but because of the nature of the product has it been previously previously illicit those studies seem to be a little bit slower so we're leaning heavily on the u.s market where they they are a little bit ahead of us however the align the misalignment is is in terms of marketing authorization is what i want to address and i have alluded to it a little bit now is that gps are allowed to as i said prescribe schedule sixes they shouldn't need a special section to prescribe thc because it falls it now falls under the same schedule sixes as the other schedule six as i mentioned it is no longer schedule seven eight or nine which is considered in south africa an illicit substance the recent u.n ruling to to take cannabis off the illicit substances list was absolutely groundbreaking in terms of good news for our industry however it doesn't mean that we can wild west oh the un have said and they've taken it off let's all jump into the pool of the market without any rules and regulations and this is where the ectd the documentation the comment it used to be a common technical document so what a company would do is they would arrive at uh mcc back then they would arrive at mcc's doors with a security truck and they would unload maybe 10 to 15 boxes of paperwork of clinical trials of dossiers of applications of proof of pks which is your pharmacokinetic studies your pkds your pharmacodynamic studies your safety studies your efficacy studies your dissolution trials so everything that goes into making that that that drug credible is in those boxes and you can understand with the advent of technology it was required and space resources you can't have if you're doing 50 dossiers at a time you can imagine how well those dossiers and document boxes have to be marked um if you look you remember i don't know if any anybody watches csi but i'm a massive csi fan and i always used to love watching them walking down those rows and rows and rows of evidence boxes to revisit a trial or revisit evidence and this is exactly what cyber looked like these rows and rows and rows of hard boxes of dossiers that needed to be pulled out with that came what we call the slow process of tech transfer so we transferred those documents to an electronic system and uploaded it onto a central almost essential database of with obviously with controlled access onto a data base with these dossiers could then be accessed in an electronic format as if they were as if you were sort of going through a box of dossiers and a box of paper basically like a concertina file of information and in every one of those sapra has got very very clear guidelines and this is where i i respect and take my hat off to them in terms of the way they've approached they transitioned from mcc to sapra as well as their physical transition from a big five separated campus into a consolidated building and within that period of time they've managed to i know lots of people have said um you know they it's slow and the regulation is slow but they've they've had all of this transition going on and they've managed to do it as i think as smoothly as possible with as much chaos going on around them as possible so we have to acknowledge that they've tried to maintain that traction whilst working in in a bit of under resourced and to be honest the current pandemic um process and issues so the electronic common technical sorry yes no i was going to say just to add it i mean a lot of misunderstanding does happen in the space software's role is really focused on medical products and not consumer products and i think often you know they do take a lot of heat because you know people want consumer-based cannabis products uh that's not been allowed for in terms of the regulatory framework and in terms of a medicinal product uh and specifically if i'm talking about this now maybe leaning a little more towards your s4 and your s6 this is exactly the the amount of paperwork the effort the stability studies on the drug the efficacy all of this the clinical trial data this is really not something you can skate by and just say oh yes we approve i mean we see this with the covert vaccine that's in evaluation as well that's recently in i mean this is a process and there's a lot of pressure everywhere to accelerate these checks and balances but there's a need for that because we're ultimately trying to provide the consumers safe products so i just want to support your statement there that you know it is difficult they've moved campuses two three times in the last couple years so you know to be able to consolidate this information keep order i've seen some good innovations as well from their space so i i support your statement on that and obviously uh continue with the ectd because this is obviously a very hot topic when it comes to schedule 4 and 6. absolutely so what i was actually saying the kudos that i was going to give them is that they've been very hot on um on guidelines so when when something is has before something has happened in fact they have published guidelines and then again in the prospective nature and of rapidly evolving disruptive industry they have done as much as they could i mean if i look at something as simple and straightforward again also it's public domain so i'm it's you go on to the software website and look for a cultivation for medicinal cannabis application license uh what it was in 2018 to what it is now they have amidst all the moving and amidst everything their guidelines have become a lot more specific and they've they've they have they've listened if anybody wants to ever hear that a regulator is listening to the industry you need to pull out the original cultivation license application and the updated cultivation license application and that's right i have to stop you there because i did that actually two days ago and i was i was comparing my old notes and the new one and i i had the same thought in terms of i'm glad to see the iteration and then the need to go back and i think i think they've taken guidance from industry in that regard because compared to the initial one and the inclusion of uh you know other parties within government i think now it's become a little more balanced uh the approach so absolutely i support that statement so the fact the fact that they have included and have listened to industry and all role players in the industry i have to you know in if ever there was an inclusive inclusive in in disruptive industry in terms of of of regulatory and and professions i mean who ever thought we'd be speaking about cannabis innovation um you know inclusivity inclusivity you've got you know rasta guys sitting next to suit guys sitting next to graffiti artist guys and they're all speaking a different by the same language so we must we must not forget that essence that it brings to you and and maybe that's why i'm so passionate about it because i've always been a consolidator and bringing people together if i can put it that way and if ever there was something that did that brought people together in a true sense of the form it would it's can it's been cannabis and i'm not speaking from the you know the typical the stigmatized unfortunate you know this whole whatever you know past the duchy from the left-hand side or whatever it is it's it is what it is and it's an amazing it's an amazing amazing entity that should be treated accordingly and not sort of ripped apart into all these different the picture i have in my head is this beautiful grown flowering cannabis plant that's been pulled all in these different directions which it's not necessarily necessary because it's not good for the plant and it's not good for the people that are around the plant who are using it and what i wanted to say when you you mentioned um jeff about um you know the being in the industry and and and having these guidelines it's important that we remember the the essence of it and that's even if something says it's complementary when you say you refer to medicinal more to schedule six and schedule four any product that you take to make yourself feel better um is it is medicinally approached if i can put it that way now i know it can that can open up on another floor of debate so well if what if people take alcohol or use alcohol to feel better is it a coping mechanism or is it a medicine so i know i i get that i'm blurring the lines but i'm speaking from a you go to a pharmacy or a wellness store and you ask her advice on what you can eat to make you feel better or to improve your diet or what what supplements you can take because you're feeling a bit tired or you're taking it with the purpose and the intent of feeling better or making yourself better or making somebody else better and that's that for me is the bottom line um so i just want to do yeah i i can you need to rain i told you you need to rain there no we have full support on that and the one point i wanted to discuss as well on schedule four and six was um often so i look at it also from the commercial perspective of the pharmaceutical manufacturer um in a country where it's completely legal within your constitutional rights to grow your own cannabis at home um it makes it also a very difficult argument for commercial company when they look at okay do we file if if we let's say rgw pharma and we have epidiolex do we do a marketing authorization or have someone sponsor that authorization in south africa where there's ready ready access to the plant in its own private use i mean these are things that also are not often discussed but it directly impacts on the schedule of four and six side of things because you know ultimately for those registered products to be registered of sapra they need to almost have a market and there is a market for sure but i think it's also often you know compared in terms of the reality which is is someone going to pay this premium price for the product uh based on the fact that you can grow it at home and for me that's that's sometimes a bit of a pity uh there's a putting two senses there for me it's one of we do want miners to get access to prescribable quantities of precise dosing for therapeutic purposes which is schedule four and six s you know specifically has therapeutic claims and it supports the evidence around that product um that will continue internationally independent so i'm not worried about the strength and development of schedule four and six in the cannabis space i'm just worried in terms of that frustration that gps must feel that we often feel that it's not that easy to go about you know scheduling writing out a script and say your schedule four and six and go and get it at your local clicks or just came and for me this is this is a good and a bad thing of you know com of the if i talk from a medical perspective i don't think it's a bad thing to obviously you know allow people to do what they want in their own private space and it's also a result of the frustration of the existing you know medical framework that often is very intensive like we discussed the the thousand files that have to get approval but i also want to just highlight that because the question might come up to the audience which is well why is no one is it separate's fault that this isn't happening and it's really more of a commercial discussion you know it's one of just to highlight that point that you know it's not that easy there has to be a market for an international company and for a local sponsor to kind of look at pursuing the introduction of these products i do think it will be coming i don't think this will probably be something that won't be too long to wait on but it is obviously due to the fact that it's going to be more expensive and the argument can be made that you can grow it at home so you can self-medicate but again self-medicate and directed medication are two different things and you know we're very sure about that and the distinction behind that the one thing i want to jump into now because i want to keep us going forward here is back to schedule zero so now to everyone in the audience schedule zero again is over it's a general product like paracetamol at the counter you can get it at uh you know pretty much otc over the counter or at a general store the claim that needs to be on often these products is the specific one i have up on the slide deck which is this unregistered medicine has not been evaluated by sapra for its quality safety and or intended use now i don't see this on products but i also don't see this on a lot of products can you tell us a bit more about background behind this and you know to be on the lookout for this as a consumer and what it actually means sure um i just want to just add into to what you said earlier which will also feed into this unregis this claim or the statement that is put on complementary means as a default um one one definitive that we have to be very very sure of and careful of is that schedule six so anything above schedule six seven and eight currently is are considered illicit products substances and are still under law enforcement what we have to be cognitive of is is cognizant of is that currently cannabis is the only schedule sex medicine that is still lying under law enforcement its opera now in order to take away and remove and continue in a positive direction with these with the destigmatization of the of the the enforcement of law on cannabis it needs to move from law enforcement to a completely independent or a separate committee within sapra um we've just we've discussed this i feel very strongly about it there's this a lot of other professionals who who are citing and who are being alerted to the same kind of thing um it's no longer law enforcement because the schedule six it doesn't re methylphenidate um codeine morphine they're not under law enforcement it's opera and they're all also all said schedule sixes so that's where i want to to just sort of say that the the misalignments we have to be aware of and careful of and i think that's what's prickling a lot of a lot of the industry people is that um although there's been progress cannabis has still got that stigma even at the at the regulator so we need to be aware of that and we need to push in a positive and a constructive direction to advise in accordingly to remove it from the law enforcement section um as far as you know your own personal use and your private use that's also becoming a blurry line jeff because you know if i if i know somebody's growing poppies at home um i'm not going to go to them and grab a bunch of puppies because the amount of processing that those poppies need to get to the state of either opium cocaine or codeine is so extensive that that that the output is not worth what the input is and i'm i know a lot of people might say well why are you why are you comparing poppies with cannabis because they're both naturally grown products it's the same as me sort of comparing it to you know roibos tea or or rosemary anything can be extracted out of it we've just found that there are more beneficial components to it the fact that the the the statement of unregistered medicine has not been evaluated by software for its quality safety or intended use means that the product has been lodged excuse me it has either been manufactured on a pharmaceutical premises uh insufficient clinical studies have been done however there is historical or other country data to reflect that it it may be useful or beneficial to a patient but they that company specifically cannot say it and cannot claim it because they have themselves have not done that study uh that's full gambit that post importation testing uh pre-importation testing api test testing they haven't done a full pks or a full pkd um on it they haven't done the solution studies on it and it's it's inherited or it's historical data that they've used and even then um you will you would be very pushed um and i don't want to say never because it's an ever say never but you're not going to find a schedule one or a schedule two product that has got the statement on it because schedule one and two intimate that it has been in at the very least produced manufactured in a gmp and more facility because remember gmp is minimum standards um in a gmp facility it has been packed accordingly it's been packed on a on a line it has been documented it is traceable it has a chain of custody um so we need to be very aware that these aren't i can't say that they're rogue products at all that's going very far out but they are products that in the last i would say five to ten years have have the intention was good for cyber to allow for for some companies to enter the market in in terms of having a product on the market however it's like any system i think it was taken strongly taken advantage of um i don't know if any of the audience or if you yourself remember the lenin's product so there were a number of lenin's products that we even that we weren't even scheduled and it was all the bahut middle and the david traxel and swall seed and those kind of things there was one of them that we actually had to keep behind the dispensary because it had i think five percent of opium in it in an alcohol tincture so i even in my in in turn days it wasn't even scheduled but we as a professional collective um always kept it behind the counter in order for it not to be misused because of that the opium that was in it it has ultimately been taken out of the product it was recalled and it's been put on back onto the shelves um purely but with this statement on it so they had to repackage they had to re-label um which is obviously a cost a cost cost intensive process for any company but if you're if you've got a foothold in the market in terms of a brand um and you want to maintain that market then you will do what is necessary with a regulator in order to um enter that product on the market so in terms of what you were saying about us as having a schedule six and a schedule four here um i i don't think we must blur the lines with personal and private use because that is that is a a separate regulatory or a separate issue that has been permitted and i think in terms of constitutional and human rights is what we must focus on but when we start talking about regulation and medicine i think that there are two separate conversations if you come to my house jeff and you come for a a bry or a dinner i'm not going to come and bring my schedule 6 not that i have it here but if i have schedule 6 morphine or schedule 6 methylfenidate in a bottle say hey jeff you feel like a ritalin or you feel like a morphine you know um i'm not going to come to you and say hey jeff you know you're welcome there's my plant you're welcome to take a leaf of my rosemary or some of my basil or a piece of this bud or biomass there but i'm not going to put out a process schedule 6 medication and just offer it to you because first of all that's that's not allowed within the medicines related substances or pharmacy act for that matter you are actually not allowed to share medication with with with other people unless they're on the same medication or unless they're really next step desperate or you are a prescribing health care official who can who can give them that medication so i think we need to be very very aware and this also might be another topic of conversation that we can continue in in the next session um is to discuss these anomalies um because that's where it's coming perfect i think and for with that i'm going to push us a little ahead because i know there's some things we want to discuss i think we've covered schedule six uh pretty extensively what i did want to highlight was um specifically that um you know when it's an exception around thc as um i'll go back to this previous slide and i'm gonna use this as an example the cbd oil uh that's a clix product uh no i'm not uh i'm just using it as an example no you know disparity or anything about it but i i take it you and i both referred to and i think most of the industry refers to full spectrum to typically be a product that contains thc um now that won't be the case in this product uh i think this is more just the use of the language uh usually we call it broad spectrum or compliance spectrum if we're referring to uh cbd products or cbd oil that doesn't have thc in it and in this regard i would even be so cautious as to say compliant is not sufficient it would have to be almost t3 uh which is basically thc free because our limitations within schedule six is in the 0.01 percent so i'm very cautious of you know labeling claims specifications things like full spectrum extraction essentially the only way i can see this product constituted is basically a cbd isolate and by full spectrum it's the inclusion of things like terpenes which could be plant-derived terpenes and we'll discuss you know cannabis derived terpenes in a moment but you know i kind of see it as that's potentially what is inferred when we start seeing products that are trying to use maybe they're using the words incorrectly from a marketing perspective it always sounds better to say full spectrum but um i think people need to just be aware in the public space that you know traditionally a full spectrum means everything in the plant and if you're extracting from hemp or cannabis there could be trace amounts of thc and definitely at these levels present you know maybe you could get somewhere close to the 0.2 if you're lucky and it's a really bad strain of cbd but generally there will always be some thc in the product unless we are refining that product to an isolate i don't know what your view on that is so jeff yeah you touch on another another sort of passion or pressure point for me is i go back to the importation testing so first of all in terms of you know label claims and we have to we have to be super super careful because that's that first of all um there's a there's a bandwagon jumping because first of all would you have looked at that bottle if it didn't have a cannabis leaf on it because it's cannabis leaves are the universal sign for obviously we know cannabis the product um and so there's there's some bandwagon jumping but and not specifically this product i'm speaking about everybody who's become involved in in the space and and potentially wants to benefit from from the cannabis plant whether good intention or not but that full spectrum you're 100 correct full spectrum implies that it contains everything and the full essence of the plant from the top umbrella i like to speak about the umbrella of cannabis to underneath it being the indica sativa and then further down thc cbd and then all the other endocannabinoids and terpenes that are in the plant that full spectrum implies exactly that that contains everything of the plant so if that's just telling me it's cbd oil but it's saying full spectrum extraction it means that that that oil was extracted from a whole plant um i know that the manufactured would probably differ with me and would have a reason to differ with me but they're they're they're now blurring the industry with what what is full spectrum and what is not full spectrum finished in claw is the whole plant even if it was from hemp oil because hemp by definition has um less than i think 0.03 percent its hemp is defined as less than 0.03 in fact negligible thc in it and i go then back to the post importation testing because if money needs to be spent and even if that isolate was not was imported and then reworked or reprocessed or remanufactured on south african soil in a gmp facility it would still have to be have to have a coa it will still have to have a certificate of analysis no matter what and that certificate of analysis must tell me that there is cbd in it it must tell me that is naught point naught naught naught to whatever decimal space the analytical laboratory tests on is in it uh what the dispersible or the miscible oil is or whatever the the substance is is it in it is are there preservatives in it how has it been stored um i recently did a research project on the effect of uv on cannabinoids and over a period of 12 months there was a depletion or a reduction of from three to f from five to three percent of thc alone in an amber bottle thc product um so you know product stability comes into question where are the stability studies and how how can you do stability studies on a product that is not been around for that long and i understand in terms of schedule zero you can put a product on the market and then still do parallel stability testing but that requires reams and readings and reads of paperwork or for ect documentation you yourself know jeff you've been involved with the covered vaccines and the testings um how can you have a how would you get a covert vaccine onto the market without having stability studies in place so you know we have to we have to be really really really specific and unfortunately pedantic if we want this industry to be sustainable and with the very end result of our patients still benefiting and not just a big industry benefiting from from patients looking at it finding a cannabis leaf on a product and taking it so um there's lots of players there's lots of rabbit holes um i i do hope enough for us to to continue lots of sessions and discussions in this manner um because it's it's very necessary it's necessary to educate um our healthcare and our consumer population jeff you know you know how passionate we are about this and how many questions a day you get how many questions a day i get healthcare professionals of bodies of healthcare professionals have phoned and said i what do we do we've got they've put cbd oil on our shelves how do we how do we sell it to the public with the confidence that this is what it says it is and i had somebody phoned me the other day and i said ask for this the cf the ca ask for the certificate of analysis from where you got it oh but that's just a long it's not a long process it's a quick ask for where is your laboratory test is it just analytics is it is it just microbials in fact i would please lord let it hope be both but ask for the ca and then the second and the second line is is the educating your your staff in selling it you know just because it's got a a a pelergonium leaf or a peppermint leaf or a cannabis leaf on it doesn't necessarily mean that it's for you and then if it's not for you who can you ask that it is for you and now we're talking about an education of a healthcare professional system that needs to know what they're giving their patients and the outcome of their patients at the end of the day you know i say i can only speak about myself in terms of the cancer process i didn't want to just get a thick dab of fico for my my post chemo nausea and my post chemo pain and my continuous chemo pain from anybody just somebody's granny's aunt's uncle's sister's brother down the road i didn't know what how they did it how they what how they grew it um and and that's when your patient is vulnerable and obviously mine i'm talking of an extreme vulnerability but everybody experiences their conditions in a different vulnerable state even a child who has got flu or has got asthma who has got allergies or a child who has epilepsy or an adult who has hypertension they in themselves feel vulnerable because they're not well and we don't want to make them more feel more vulnerable because they don't have security in where their product is coming from exactly and i mean to that point i mean i'm glad you brought up the uv degradation i'm a passionate advocate of stability i mean we've seen in the code vaccine rollout i mean part of the reason that a lot of those vaccines have to be kept so cold in the logistics chain is because they haven't been able to localize which is basically freeze dry what would typically be a vaccine preparation so it could be resuspended and administered there hasn't been time to do the they're doing emergency use authorizations with only limited stability data and that will continue and i mean the formulation will improve and the delivery will improve but stability is often that vital end point of you know you need to make sure if i'm going to make any kind of shelf life claim or inform a shelf life claim on a product i need to put out some stability data i need to test it for the zone climatic zone it's going to be sent to i need to make sure that that product is stable that if it does degrade it doesn't decorate in excess of 10 percent uh depending on how you see certain monographs but it's one way absolutely i mean we could we could talk all day about it but i'm going to move to the next topic because it's about that because what does it degrade into you know and what are the therapeutic effects of those derivatives because you know it could go to cbn and cbn might have a completely different uh biophysical effect on the body and biochemical effect compared to your initial cbd and this is the kind of thing that you know as these products get more established as more clinical data comes out there as it gets more formalized in the space uh pharmaceutical as well as commercial products will increasingly get better and i mean the big topic for me has always been the testing and the call-up um and i think you know there's there needs to be this big push on i think it's it's mandatory very soon that you know products are pulled from shelf and tested and on this point i'm going to bring us into possibly the second last slide of discussion i know we're talking long but it's a really impactful conversation so i want to keep going on this topic because you know they say cbd is treated as schedule four except when it's complementary medicines or under schedule zero so i have a question about infused products like honey so honey is very naturally you know it's often considered loosely as a medicine you know it has biological uh it's very healthy for you depending obviously on certain limits but i want to discuss the fact that what's your view on something like this where we have 10 milligrams of cbd allegedly because i'm going to preface that because i know how hard it would be to to actually formulate this product with an even distribution because honey and you know if you're using isolate definitely yeah it's definitely a tough one i mean i would advise this to it if anything for the formulation yet so i'm sure if i pull this from the shelf and i start testing this i'm going to have some concerns in terms of distribution but um in terms of your view as a responsible pharmacist how do you see this jump on the bandwagon of natural health goods um should there be more guidance specifically on infused products that's maybe addressed next by sapra because i feel this is becoming quite a hot topic yeah it's becoming a hot topic and it's becoming the wild west for the mavericks jeff if i may just speak out of my my space a bit because i as passionately as i feel positively about it i there are elements that that i'm not saying specifically this but could do harm to an industry that wants to be sustainable so my first reaction to this is well the cbd bandwagon has become huge purely because the cbd component of cannabis is said to be non-psychoactive so now we can we can slap cbd on on any product because it's it's safe in inverted commerce um but by whose standards is it safe you know quality safety and efficacy is it safe because it's not psychoactive but you know honey honey is safe but not for children under one i have to jump in as well because i mean i've seen this point and it's i mean it's it's not a popular point but what i want to mention is cbd does actually affect the central nervous system so in some regards it's still a psychoactive product and and you know it's it's so easy and i know we've done this before and i know every i know highly respected individuals so it's a it's a technical point but it's one way i want to just highlight as well is it is psychoactive it's just non-intoxicating uh which is more the appropriate jargon but again i see on this label claim and this is what perpetuates it is that unlike thc it has no psychoactive effects and that's that's actually fundamentally not true for cbd because why would you take it if it didn't have a central nervous effect on your effect on your central nervous system so i mean these are the kind of uses physiologies this will take time i know what is intended when people say it's non-psychoactive completely agreed with that intent i've done it myself we do it constantly but again it's this type of need for label claim review um assessment of this that that kind of needs to start being i don't know if it needs to be published if it needs to be put out to you know from the regulator in terms of how and what can be said uh maybe more specifically is that too limiting from separate to do such a thing no so this is skirting the line because it's a food product and you know as you know software only deals with medicinal and medicinal products and devices and this is where this is where we've got the maverick um and we've got the rogue and we've got the wild west at some point because it is still it's because as as a schedule 4 it is still a medicinal product software would have to have an entity or an independent committee um or offices who are able to address these food issues and beverage issues so first as you say first and foremost um to say non-toxic substance okay non-toxic uh just a kind of dispute because honey in itself whether it has cbd in it or not can be toxic to children under the age of one so there already is a a label a label claim that is pushed towards the cbd but has not not taken the whole product as a as an entity into account um and to say non-toxic is if i test that in an analytical laboratory and i find an aflatoxin or i find a pesticide how can you still say non-toxic where is the where is the lab report on this honey i i want to see i want a certificate of analysis or a certificate of conformance or i want to see some form of of proof that with every product i have any product i have in my cupboard or my shelf or my fridge i want to know that there is a certification process that has gone into it don't slap it on your label certificates available that means nothing and then also unlike thc so now we're also we're keeping we want to support the industry but we want to keep thc the baddie because we want to sell our cbd so the wording unlike thc it has no psychoactive effects there are cb there are cb um cb1 receptors and cb2 receptors along the site on the along the um uh since central nervous system pathway um we know that and we can have an endocannabinoid discussion another time and where the cb1 and cb2 receptors are placed the fact is if this does have cbd in it it's going to affect the cb1 and cb2 receptors which are both in the central nervous system and non-tension nervous system the other biggest issue on first sight sorry there's a bit of commotion in the background and i hope it's not coming through too badly no perfectly fine the other thing that i mean i didn't even look at this for two seconds this label and you know it's again it's the trained eyes the professional eye however it says there at the bottom fully certified certified for what fully certified as a honey fully certified in terms of food grade hazoptasip and vasip fully certified facility and then it says 10 milligrams per serving where does it state what size a serving is do i dip my finger in a serving do i give my 12 year old a teaspoon how much is in a teaspoon if my 12 year old wants to put this honey on her toast what serving is she going to put on her toast she's going to ask me could because she lives in our household she's going to say mom this honey says cbd on it you know can i can i have it and if if i can how much can i have should i have may i have um i and again i know you've we've come across this and it's it's no picking on any kind of product i mean we don't know who the product is but i really really really need to to pull this label apart in terms of regulatory and and and consumer information and consumer protection i mean this consumer under consumer protection act this is not even skirting a line this is falling into the muddy water because exactly and i've retracted the clients information on the honey as well but i mean it's not the first time it won't be the last time that we see this and yeah i think this was part of the reason we wanted to go this long on this conversation is that you know if you're going to put products out to the marketplace i almost feel that you need to assess it in terms of two things one am i doing the best interests in terms of the consumer sure you're trying to do this to make a profit i anticipate maybe that's the reason but you've got to protect the consumer and you've got to be ready for some form of recall in terms of if this product is pulled up is it tested if it fails testing you know what is your liability around that look like because it's really just taking an opportunity and playing on a very dangerous slippery slope and i think we need to talk about this as a community as a profession because i agree with you uh it falls up in food but that's where a lot of these products are going to start falling in the coming weeks and months and i think it's really important that discussion that sapra or appropriately allocated authority starts going to retail stores starts picking these and this is a major retail store where i saw this so it's not like it's a just a mom and pop shop at a flea market this is this is commercially what i would consider one of the top five food retailers so i i mean it's one way if this is going to be on the shelf who's checking that for label claims because um this is something that has to almost be addressed in the next few months so my my thinking would be that the food retailer would have to have a buyer for that to get onto the shelf and what accountability does that buyer have to their affiliation of their major commercial store and who then picks up the liability and i will almost put my my neck out on with good money is that that retailer will pick up that liability because they have agreed to have that product on their shelves selling to the consumer consumer is not going to go after this company consumer's going to go after that big commercial that big commercial will then eat would totally withdraw recall should i i'm saying would should withdraw product from market and then the questions need to be answered and the biggest issue is what you were saying is the recall and not even the rework yet the recall i mean we had the other day because of of the nature of healthcare professionals if there is any recall of any product it has to come out to all healthcare professionals at the same time so everybody all pharmacists all gps and all direct wholesalers distributors all receive an email and a letter posted to their post boxes of re of any recall and the most recent one was of a long-standing company of a long-standing product that had a full recall of i think three batches where it was and it's a well-known api i mean it's been used for ages and they had a recall because of those particular batches there was a problem with some of the excipient now when i say excipient i mean the inert product that makes up the rest of the tablet so the lactulose the the powder filler it's nothing none of it has got medicinal product properties however because of the irregularity in it the the dissolution of the drug in the the the body was increased to double and it caused qt prolongation in hot in health in heart patients so qt prolongation when we talk about it you have your your very quickly you have your um heart waves your heart uh wavelengths and the main one that keeps it beating properly and rhythmically is the is the qt section and if the qt section beats slightly longer so you measure the difference between the waves and it causes qt prolongation you have an extra additional uh possibility of increased myocardial infarction side effects yeah and so this is not light stuff that's heavy stuff because somebody is going to have a heart attack from this product that they're taking to prevent their heart attacks so and it's crazy to think that that's from an excipient let alone inactive in that product well i am it was it was the the product we were discussing the other day well yesterday about the um the australian the 1967 australian study it wasn't the api that was the problem it was the exception that was added into the new generic and it the the half-life of the product was was halved so it wasn't staying in the body long enough to prevent seizures and everybody on it was having double the amount of seizures that they'd ever had before yeah so exactly you know we have to be very careful and this this is a perfect example of what is going to to not destroy but really is going to to affect negatively affect a potentially sustainable and very good industry um these people need to be way more more careful of what they're doing exactly and i mean i would i would like to just highlight i mean we're not yeah i mean we're probably the most proactive in terms of pushing for product safety and getting products to the shelf so we've all you know anyone listening as well like we want to see products come to shelf we absolutely are driven by this i mean i would love nothing more than to see a schedule four and six marketing authorization successfully done i want to see these products come to shelf but we need to just inform the public and insist on the need that you do it correctly just do it right so that the industry builds a great brand uh for professionalism and accuracy of information so that there is no liability and i'd rather discuss this in a format like this where you know we've retracted a company we haven't thrown any stones in glass houses we're kind of saying listen yet this is what you need to lure on the lookout for hopefully you know a company like this would pick it up or someone else is releasing a cbd-based honey they'll be like oh wait before we go to market let's be sure about the the solution that we see or the mixture of the cbd in the honey let's be sure that our serving size specification let's be sure what we mean when we say fully certified uh maybe we should do some additional testing and that ultimately is increasing the standard and what we are both in complete support of is seeing products increasingly go to the consumer that have that increased safety efficacy because we want to build the industry that's that's what we're both doing so for me i just want to highlight that and then i want to close off with um i know we've really run along on this but it's such a good conversation for me so i know that with um obviously schedule seven cannabis was removed from schedule 7 along with thc and this brought up a lot of questions for me because they've rescheduled thc and cbd but they've kind of omitted clarity for my view unless it's somewhere else in terms of cannabis derived terpenes and i don't mind a cannabinoids like cbg you know where does that fall in the scheduling i mean i know there's plant-based terpenes because terpenes for anyone who doesn't know uh and i'm sure you both you're on this type of uh discussion you know limonene when you squeeze the lemon it's that smell um so there's a couple of the terpenes out there they definitely i would say there's strong evidence to support its direct effect on the entourage effect in terms of what it provides to if we use the old terminology of sativa and indicas you know they have these certain terpene profiles that are maybe more common to them that have a certain pharmakinetic type of effect but you know for me the question is in terms of cannabis derived terpenes is it legal or illegal to bring it into the country because i don't see it in any scheduling presentation from separate jeff you raise a again another fantastically great point and i want to just also resound and resonate what you said about any any listeners you know to this you have to know that anything worth doing well is worth doing properly and this is why we're doing this we we are strong forceful advocates for the industry but we just want to make sure that we do this properly that's that's all we want to say we're not we're not sort of degrading everybody anybody or or or anyway so yeah the terpene the turbine question is is intense and um you're right there has been no scheduling assigned to the terpenes purely because um they are are considered to fall under thc and and cbd and form that that very specific unique essence of what cannabis itself is and i have to i have to disclaim at the beginning of the sentence is that i'm a purist so in terms of extracting very specific individual terpenes out of cannabis um i'm i'm not entirely certain or convinced that i'm a fan because it's taking away the essence of what of what cannabis is i would understand why people would want to do it but you know limonene is available in lemon rinds um alpha pinene is available in pine pine needles um beta-caryophyllene is available straight from black peppercorn so why don't you go and take it from those entities rather than dabbling around with with cannabis and disrupting the essence of what cannabis is so i'm just just that's my personal opinion professionally yes you're correct there's been no um certainly no external evidence given to to the public that they're working on terpenes because i think that's just another layer that is not top of the agenda at the moment when i say agenda i said loosely i don't say it in a derogatory way that somebody's got an agenda i just don't think in terms of priorities where where cannabis lies terpenes have formed a um a conversation i know that they are coming in however i go back and i circle back to post importation testing it has to i don't care if it comes in the tiniest one milliliter little tube or a big isolate or a big bottle or how it comes it needs to be taken is that terpene that's coming in it's beta-caryophyllene what is the source of the beta-caryophyllene it was this this strain it was extracted by this means and this is what it's supposed this is the percentage of the beta-caryophyllene that is in this in in this concentrate or this isolate fine we'll test it on our side rcoa must match your coa we'll bring it in and then we can start putting it into we can say beta-caryophyllene mct oil because beta-caryophyllene helps with inflammation and with pain you know so it's a it's a long answer to a short question which i'm and maybe we can have another session just on terpenes because they themselves are fascinating absolutely like i'm hoping there's more evidence like i'm sure there is at this point i'm sure there's a lot of studies on terpenes because i mean there's there's definite medical benefits to absolutely but not local at the moment no no and that's the thing i mean and one of the things that's going to be the hardest around terpenes is we discuss stability regarding the cannabinoids i mean terpenes are the most volatile chemically speaking so stability studies around terpenes and establishing it in a what we'd call traditional western type of approach uh that's going to be a tough one you know there's going to have to be some considerations some ways to manage that but i mean we've had an amazing chat thank you so much i mean we definitely run over time but i think it's been i mean i'm sure our audience would agree they'd like us to continue uh in terms of continue to discuss this the things i do i am interested to see going forward is you know how does the un votes to remove uh you know schedule four cannabis out of schedule four from the uh single conventional narcotic drugs how will that impact on local policy and future separate policy uh it's gonna take some time probably to work its way in but it is an interesting and a very positive development so i'm happy to see that and we've alluded to it in the discussion already and i'm also interested um just from a you know a safety perspective these cbd call-ups that are going to be done on products taking products off shelf and testing i think that's good for the industry i think it's good for any mature industry to test products to confirm what's in those products and then to provide you know findings and say listen there's a problem with this product either you fix it or you take it off the shelf i mean that is that is progress i see that as progress in the industry and i think it's something that should be aspired to not feared um i think even in the us there's a lot of issues in the u.s even with call-ups of products and testing where it's under-reported or absolutely nothing present in those products and this is gonna you know the worst thing for me is when something like the plant is misused in terms of you know we try to jump on the cbd bandwagon users use it they get no benefit because there's no cbd even present in the product and then it just tarnishes uh what is a great medicinal plant and i think for me that's really why you know i'm big on seeing more testing as a whole in the space just because we need to know what is in our products and jackie thank you so much i know you've you've really just uh you've been an amazing source of discussion and resources for me as well in the space and for others um you know i've put up some channel discussions before on extraction on gacp on you know quality testing for international export on gmp standards the difference between pharmaceutical food and dietary supplement um jackie is a very proactive speaker so we've been at several conferences together and we probably will be in the course of 2021 uh we're doing this webinar a week before christmas i think that shows our level of commitment to getting content out there and jackie's not always available on the phone but you can try if not i know you're very good on email jackie and then i'd like to ask you for any closing comments from your side if if someone were to reach out to you you know where is an area that you really feel most passionate about assisting uh to maybe give them some guidance jeff thank you so much yeah made us made this relationship and these series continue and grow and evolve as we've we've discussed um i just wanted to make one sort of last comment about what you were saying about stability and about terpenes and you know we talk about a lot of um stability and and and product longevity and it's important to know that most products degrade to nothing so if you take an expired medicine there will be no effect however one of the drugs tetracycline it's an antibiotic if it's left to expire it actually becomes dangerous and you know what what often happens is that um thc will degrade to thca which is the psychoactive component with heat and with without enough stability and looking after so we've got to keep that in the forefront of our mind um jeff thank you for for the relationship thus far and thank you for including me in what you do um i i'm a strong supporter and a voracious supporter of of you and what you do and how you do it and i'm happy for anybody to reach out to me preferably on email my turnaround time is a little bit normally about 24 hours it's a little bit slow and but i do i will get back to anybody who has questions i have a strong knowledge and passion for cultivation for analytics um and for for use in chronic conditions such as as cancer and and post post chemo nausea um but generally one would that is my passion is is cannabis and doing it right so thank you for relying me this voice um i know i probably wouldn't have had it if if you hadn't ever approached me so thank you so much and i i really appreciate the involvement and i appreciate your dedication um to this to these projects as you say a week before christmas and in the madness that is so thank you very much thank you so much jackie and again i appreciate you making the time because this has been a phenomenal discussion i think it's a much needed conversation so i'm sure i'm going to have you we're going to discuss this again in a way there's a lot to go into and i definitely would encourage anyone with questions reach out to us uh it always edifies us in terms of getting better content out there to the public domain and that is our objective our objective is just to communicate to the public domain because it covers investors stakeholders regulators international parties we just want to make sure that this african industry matures and grows and formalizes into a space where everyone can benefit and everyone can really utilize the most benefit from the plant so thank you so much cheers jackie thank you jay have a good day thanks have a good day", "epKyvl8ENHM": "[Music] [Music] hi my name is Josiah and today we're going to talk about CBD now more and more people are taking the CBD each and every day but are they taking it correctly this video tries to answer some questions that people maybe want to consider before trying out CBD now when it comes to medications there's a ton of knowledge out there about how to properly take them but when it comes to health supplements like CBD can be a little more complicated due to limited research and we're going to do our very best to try and provide accurate information that we can based on the data that we have well let's start with safety and side-effects CBD has a favorable safety profile which basically means it's safe to use and will not be toxic in larger quantities in fact the World Health Organization even commented on the safety of CBD the World Health Organization for those of you are wondering is an international organization kind of like the US FDA who looks after public health concerns now the World Health Organization released a report in June 2018 stating that CBD is safe non-habit forming and non-addictive after studying its use in animals and humans the conclusion is that there were practically no safety concerns they also stated that CBD is well tolerated and has a very good safety profile rating now there's no evidence of any public health or safety issues related to CBD use according to this report they also stated that no conversion of CBD to THC the component that makes people feel high occurs in humans who've received an oral dose they cited several studies where oral CBD administration resulted in no circulating THC and participants reviews of toxicology studies also showed no significant issue now the NIH or National Institutes of Health released a comprehensive review of clinical data and relevant animal studies related to CBD now the NIH reported that most studies were performed for the treatment of epilepsy and psychotic disorders primary reported side effects included tiredness diarrhea loss and appetite or loss and weight like other medications another side effect that some people may experience is an upset stomach but compared to other drugs these side effects are relatively mild when we're talking about CBD all right well what about the different forms of CBD CBD can come in a variety of forms these include oils tinctures concentrates capsules chews cream selves chewing gums vape oil suppositories crystals dabs sprays and even beauty products such as sleeping masks CBD infused mascara and lip balms it seems like pretty much anything you can think of someone has tried putting CBD in it now the forms that you would typically see though our oils capsules choose and topicals such as selves and creams so let's talk about a few correct ways to try out these variants dosage forms first probably the most common is oil oils typically come in dropper bottles and are meant to be applied sublingual lead now sublingual just means under the tongue the drop should be placed under the tongue and held there for about thirty Seconds to a minute to allow it time to absorb and then swallowed now this is preferred to directly swallowing the oil because it's better absorbed into the bloodstream through the sublingual glands in the mouth if the oiled is swallowed it will go through the digestive system and CBD might get broken down before being absorbed thus losing some of its effectiveness some of the oils are flavored which makes it more tolerable to take however other oils have the natural flavor which may not be favorable to to everybody now I would recommend if that sounds like you I just have a drink such as juice or soda ready to take after the to help you kind of get rid of that taste all right now the second form we're going to talk about is capsules capsules are probably one of the easiest forms of CBD to take now I say that because you can add them to your daily medication or vitamin supplements that you already have so the capsules come in a variety of doses so how many and how often you take them each day does vary usually you'll see 10 mg to 30 mg doses depending on what dose you want you could take the capsules once daily twice daily or even three times daily although capsules allow you to keep track of your dosage easier it is harder to adjust your doses with more flexibility just like you would with other capsules you swallow the CBD capsules by mouth with at least eight ounces of water all right third choose choose are similar to gummy vitamins they usually provide smaller amounts of CBD than capsules or oils but they're tolerability in terms of flavor makes them a favorite of a lot of folks now choose may contain additional vitamins in them as well and like the capsules depending on the dose you want you could take them once twice daily or more you should chew it and then swallow it just like you would with any other gummy product know right now topical salves and creams are different types of topical forms salves are similar to an appointment that may be used to help protect the skin creams are more like lotion products the difference is that points are more oil based and therefore stickier whereas creams have a water base and are able to be spread easier because of this appointments are typically for smaller parts of the body and creams are for larger parts of the body topicals have a more direct effect on skin and joints compared to the whole body and should be applied directly to the affected area so let's talk about dosage the correct dosage for anyone depends on their height weight genetics age and further factors such as medications or supplements that this person may be taking there for finding the dose that works for you involves testing yourself to see what works best generally speaking it's always best to start low and go slow this means starting with the lowest dose and steadily increasing it every week two weeks or every month depending on what you're comfortable with regarding CBB the dose is not set in stone dosages vary from study to study and the correct dose may depend on what you're using the CBD to help you with so according to oh the comprehensive review that I mentioned earlier chronic use and doses up to 1500 mg per day have been repeatedly shown to be well tolerated by humans the review also mentioned that in a clinical study and a small group of children was being treated for epilepsy they used a 5 mg per kilogram of weight starting dose and raised it to a maximum of 25 mg per kilogram now for those of you not familiar with the metric system the kilogram is roughly 2.2 pounds another clinical study in a larger group of children and young adults with epilepsy utilize the dose of 200 mg per kilogram daily however sometimes children may metabolize or breakdown drugs faster than adults so as an adult you may need to use a smaller dose as for how often you should take CBD each day that again would depend on your daily dose if you're taking larger doses of CBD it's probably best to split the dose into two or three separate doses per day so for example if you want to take 600 mg daily you could split it up into 300 mg twice a day or 200 mg three times a day this would allow for a more consistent absorption of CBD throughout the day whereas if you take one large dose at one time you may not get the same effect throughout the entire day this could also depend on what you feel like when you take CBD you may only want to take it at night to help you relax and get to sleep so in that case one dose per day would be appropriate basically it depends on what you're using it for and how you tolerate CBD if you need help figuring out dosage you feel free to talk to a healthcare professional and they can guide you in the right direction now what about CBD and alcohol there's still a lot to figure out about the combination of CBD and alcohol interestingly enough though in a study recently they found that CBD and alcohol resulted in lower blood levels of alcohol than alcohol by itself however the effects of both were the same as alcohol alone therefore it's probably okay to have alcohol when you're taking CBD but with everything you should use moderation if you're taking other medications or supplements and you would like to use alcohol with CBD it's best to talk about a healthcare professional to see if alcohol consumption is even appropriate now you've probably seen companies put CBD and coffee which contains caffeine so what about CBD and caffeine well as you already know caffeine speeds you up and CBD has the potential to slow you down so combining the two may result in them cancelling each other out however this is only likely with high doses of CBD although combining the two appears to be safe more research is needed in terms of CBD and caffeine to have a more definitive result so in conclusion it's important to educate yourself on all medications and supplements that you take knowing how to take them properly and any possible interactions and side-effects allows you to keep an eye on any concerns that might arise taking charge of your health and being informed about products like CBD allows you to be proactive about your health and will help you have less complications in the future all that being said CBD appears to be safe across the board and more and more research is supporting those who are claiming about the health benefits of CBD so I hope you enjoyed this video and feel free to leave me a comment about how CBD may have helped you

their needs for a higher quality of life it is no wonder that botanical options like CBD are gaining interest but what exactly is CBD cannabidiol is one of over a hundred and thirteen chemical compounds called cannabinoids found in the cannabis and hemp plants that bind to receptors in the body and are responsible for the effects of cannabis why is this important tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the most widely studied cannabinoid it binds to receptors in the brain that produce psychoactive effects but unlike THC CBD does not produce a high instead CBD binds to receptors found primarily in

today's video I am so sorry about my voice I'm just now getting over being sick and I'm finally getting my voice back but it's still a little bit scratchy so please try to ignore it I'm so freaking excited for today's video because we are gonna be discussing and testing out the latest health trend CBD hemp is a type of cannabis plant that contains a chemical called CBD it doesn't make you high like marijuana but it is creating a national buzz CBD CBD CBD sprouting up everywhere and in everything to put a simply CBD is a component of the cannabis plant with enormous healing potential you can get the benefits of CBD in so many different forms like oils edibles coffee even skin care and so many more now I personally found out about CBD last year whenever I broke my wrist snowboarding I'm sure you guys already know the story with that but after my surgery the doctors prescribed me some really hard drugs to help me cope with the pain and even though the pain was so unbearable I could not stand the side effects of the drugs so I had to start doing some research into more natural ways of relieving my chronic pain and I came across CBD oils and I've been using them ever since it's really cool because it helps you with so many other things like relieving stress anxiety migraines and it even improves my sleep when I first thought I'm doing a video like this I was just gonna use CBD oil for a whole week and kind of see what it does but since I already have a really positive experience using CBD oils I wanted to dive in into a different way of using CBD without actually ingesting it so in this video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys my experience of using a CBD cream for a whole week now there are so many different CBD brands out there and it's kind of hard to find one that you can truly trust that is organically grown the most trusted brand I've tried so far is premium Jane they provide some of the most purest safest and most effective products in the industry they are sourced from a hundred percent or grown Oregon hemp which if you didn't know I live in Oregon and we're kind of known to grow some of the best hemp out there anyways I'll be using this CBD topical solve from premium Jane you can call it assault and pointman a cream whatever I think I was gonna go with the cream it's much easier for me to say but this contains 1500 milligrams of CBD and it has some other really incredible ingredients like eucalyptus essential oil Joba oil argan oil emu oil grapeseed oil Omega 3 and 6 oils soy protein hibiscus flower extract neem leaf extract lemongrass extract chamomile extract aloe vera extract and cocoa butter these are all-natural and very powerful ingredients and I'm kind of excited to see what it can do to my skin so I started applying this every single day on my face and on my wrist [Music] I have a metal plate and screws in there that's holding the bone together and since I live in Oregon this time of year it gets super cold and the aching pain in my wrist gets so bad this cream is pretty powerful as a high dose of CBD so as soon as I started rubbing this on my wrist I kid you not the aching pain went away almost immediately and I do use CBD oils for this kind of pain but that takes a little bit longer to kick in it was really insane to me that I got immediate relief whenever I applied this cream now I didn't really see much of a difference in my skin other than some of the redness and breakouts were definitely reduced and my skin did feel a lot more hydrated and supple but I did notice a huge improvement in my lips I have this terrible habit of biting my lips and I would get these little pieces of broken skin on the outer corners of my lips because you know I feel like this oh well all of that is completely healed from just using this for one week and then that whole eyelash extension thing happened I just got out of the shower and I'm so embarrassed to share this with you guys but I have to because I am convinced this is a miracle CBD cream last night I was washing my face my eyelash extensions were kind of in the way and I don't know where I just started like pulling them out and not just the lash extensions but my real lashes too because you know the extensions is stuck to the lashes whoo I literally pulled out so many of my lashes I barely have any on oh so my eyes swole up they were so red so inflamed they were burning so much pain so what do I do I take the CBD bomb and I started applying it all over my eyelids and almost immediately the inflammation started going down and it felt so soothing this especially it was so bad like you could still kind of see the redness and the puffiness but I was shocked at how quickly the CBD balm work the next morning I woke up my eyes were not swollen anymore they look good again except for this one damn I still feel really dumb for pulling out my eyelashes but it happened I'm so glad I had something like this on hand to help treat it oh another thing my daughter brought her fingers she was trying to help me cook and she accidentally touched the pan and had a little burn around her fingers what did I do I put this on in a couple seconds and the pain went away so good stuff overall I experienced many benefits using this cream I think this is something every household should have just in case of an emergency like I mentioned this helps treat my daughter's minor burn better than anything else I'm blown away with the benefits I've received just by using it for one week I love this little jar of magical healing cream and will continue to use it every single day I've already ordered a couple more jars to stock up just in case I run out if you're wanting to get your hands on this you know where to find it I will also leave the link down below I really enjoyed filming this video for you guys I hope you found it helpful if you're feeling generous today please subscribe I'd love to have you be a part of my channel and I cannot wait to see you in my next video bye [Music]", "fejytAIWC_g": "hey I wanted to do a review on penat ryx and Charlotte's webs hemp infused Bahman which one worked for me so I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues and I just wanted to do like kind of like my take so after using this product and it's almost all gone for a solid couple of months actually maybe like two months or w-mint three in terms of pain relief it smells really nice so it's not like like we agents have this or we call this like white flour or something like that and it's really abrasive to the eyes it's really drying on your skin but it feels amazing just because the menthol on this is is intense and so I will douse myself with this before but it was really drying like I said and really abrasive to other people too like they could smell it immediately in your leg oh you're an old Asian grandma and on a 32 year old young lady so I opted for this first so this is called penetrations and this is well reviewed on Amazon and I would have to say what I was using it for is like my shoulder I have a little like shoulder impingement cuz I sleep on my side and things get pinched that way I've tried so many different ways on how to sleep but I've found a different solution this is always like things like this things like this they're always just little band-aids that help you very short-term in terms of pain relief and it's not even pain relief it's kind of like just a distraction it's not really addressing the source of your pain it's a it's a nice distraction so when you're you know when you're trying to work or whatever and you've got an ache in your neck or whatever and you have this burning cool sensation it distracts you from I think the pain I don't that's just my take on it I know it's not solving the problem but anyway this seemed to I guess be something different other than those types of products because it's an inflammation formula so if you have chronic pain it's probably because the the area or the joint or the muscle is inflamed and so no amount of stretching or like working out is really going to help you because it's still inflamed it's in a state of emergency basically so in order for you to like for myself like my knee for example or my shoulder or this like chronic muscle that was underneath my shoulder blade and it's really hard to get to gets really tight and it would cause actually migraines a lot and I would use this and you see I've run through this this container and it was just okay and I really didn't see any difference I think it was a lot better in terms of yes calming down the tissue than this guy but again if I wasn't gonna follow through like this is kind of like taking it's a topical like I guess an ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory that doesn't have to go through your liver to calm down the inflammation of the area or the affected area but if you don't follow through after calming down the inflamed area it stays weak or it stays unconditioned so for me for this example I was putting this and yes it was helping the inflammation and for me to not feel any pain but I wasn't doing anything to make sure that I wasn't going to keep that chronic injury there so I needed to do something physical where I could train those muscles or the muscles around it to activate and that way that one muscle wasn't doing all the work you know and I'm saying so there's a process right so if you're in pain and the area's inflamed yes these things in my experience do work but I went through a whole container worth and didn't realize like there's a second process to that which is to do something physical which trains that muscle not to be weak anymore because that's that's usually why you're in pain is because something is out of balance something is weak and this particular muscle that's always tied are always aching it's compensating for the rest of your weakness you're weak so that's that so I'm basically all out and on my journey of pain relief I also stumbled across things like CBD oil now I'm just about done with this guy and I was doing this is my second bottle full bottle like this and this is a 30 milliliters so one fluid ounce very small and their recommended dosage is one drop in the morning one drop at night or two two drops to full droppers okay and shake well before using and it tastes really good it tastes like minty chocolate stuff so it's in my experience it was kind of mouth drying always kind of got a cotton mouth feel I don't take it anymore I'm just about done but I haven't even touched this in a couple of weeks and I was trying to take this for like anxiety or oh yeah like if I have this pain here if I just take it will it just handle all the things in my body I don't know I can't really say if this works or not because at the same time I was also practicing yoga which to me in my example the whole shoulder blade thing the knee thing the hip thing the only thing that's really been I feel helping is yes these like step one little baby step one and then step two which is a big step which is to start training start conditioning those muscles so that you stop staying in this crappy injured in flame state that brings me to this okay so this is fairly new maybe about two to three weeks the use of this this is the 1.5 ounce soothing scent hemp infused balm from Charlotte's Web I love this smell it smells really good at submit it's like a minty my settlement enos doesn't burn your eyes when you apply it close to your face unless you put it like right here so I usually use this because I'm still getting that shoulder impingement not as bad as I used to used to wake up with headaches but yeah definitely using this in tandem with my yoga has been I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot more progress and a lot more strengthen and how I'm gauging that is just by doing regular everyday tasks so going up and down the stairs seeing if I could jog for like a little jaunt from the kitchen to the to the living room if I got excited about something or to run to the restroom like I'm that's how I'm gauging my progress and before I couldn't do that especially when I had done when I had injured my knee and so I've been applying this pretty regularly to my knee and before when I was doing yoga whenever I knelt down on to my knee onto the kneecap it was very painful and so I would just kind of find ways around it in terms of the yoga like still doing downward dog still doing forward fold still doing everything that I could you know it was really just the ones where I had my kneecap on the floor so I've been applying this directly to it and I've only started doing that for probably the last two weeks because for some reason you just I don't know when you're in an injured state you don't really think of all the ways you think of I don't know that's just been my experience and and that's been a transformation in my mind when you are chronically injured and maybe you have many things wrong with you it's kind of hard to keep track it's kind of hard to keep up with all of your issues but I encourage you to think of your body as a full system and so if your knee hurts it's not just about your knee it's about your hip it's about your quads about your hamstrings about your calves I always forget about my calves is about your ankles so that your your body's a whole system and so this has enabled me to I feel been very effective anti-inflammatory I'm not taking advil or ibuprofen for anything really the only thing that I really take ibuprofen for is if I have a feel of massive headache coming on and maybe I can prevent a migraine and then I'll maybe I'll take some or if I'm you know I have cramps or something that's the only reason why I would take that so I'm trying to minimize as much drugs as possible that I'm taking into my body and just doing these topical things that you just rub and they smell so good too and it is very I in my experience effective that I feel in my body as an anti-inflammatory agent which is pretty cool so and they and I think they make that distinction you know this has 450 milligrams of hemp extract and I've seen it go as far as to like a thousand milligrams and I'm like whew maybe that will like make it make my healing even faster because um right now with the yoga and I've been doing yoga for a good 45 days I think that's a good estimate maybe 50 days pretty regularly pretty like maybe I've missed two days and then I just did it the next day or something like that and that's given me the strength to go and do deadlifting I'm now lifting again when I was completely invalid for like a good three months or something when I when I injured my knee so that's been my experience with this this and this um so yeah not taking recap not taking this anymore I feel the yoga has replaced what I have seeked out in not gonna buy this anymore this is about 20 bucks I think and I think it and I think it does work when I was using it it's just that you need to follow through you can't just put it on to be like why am I not better yet you have to follow through physically emotionally mentally all the things I like this a lot better just because it's a little bit cheaper and and I feel like it lasts longer too cuz this is more like a this is more like a cream and this is more like a wax and like I can both they had a very similar scent this one like very kind of minty yeah mm-hmm they both smell really good I like both of them this one's just a little bit cheaper but it takes forever to get to you so maybe this is a better option I don't know it'll just kind of depend on my mood when when I go to refill this one but this I feel like it's lasting Mia quite a bit so I'll just put three of my fingers in here rub it on I'll do it before and after a workout or like when I remember to or if I'm particularly feeling little stabs of pain in my knee or in my neck and stuff and I just feel better and I've been using this for maybe good three months or so so that's been my experience any specific questions I'd love to you know answer your questions in the comments and maybe you know it'll work for you too and like I said these things are just temporary fixes and they and make you feel a little bit better for the time being but you have to follow through with all the things and try to think of your body as a as a whole system you know not even just your body like your mental state like are you do you really want to get better are you using your chronic illness as an excuse for not living I know that so yeah thanks for watching see you next time", "DQEgiUiofks": "so what I got here is plus CBD oil and this hair says it's a hand pump so this is pretty much an ointment that distributes CBD to pain areas in the body so the reason why I got this was my mother has a herniated disc and I'm using discs for her pain management so the symptoms that she has is sort of akin to the very numb feeling in your limbs and also the sort of electrical sort of tingly feeling that you get when you are very numb or that you've sat in one place at a time except it's a lot more painful so this will help in her pain management mainly for her spine in her herniated disc so she will rub this on her limbs or on areas that are very numb sometimes it's in her neck sometimes it's in her trapezoidal area so the main ingredients for this is CBD so what CBD is it is the main active ingredients in marijuana so I'm gonna open up this sort of a hemp bomb here and disappointment and straws show you how it looks so this here is the plus CD brand and the reason why I got this was mainly because it's distributed by CVS so it speaks to the quality and the thoroughness of which they vetted the company so this is destroyed by CV Sciences in so hopefully in in the CVS stores now other areas that people use this for is sort of for relaxation if they are stressed you know they they will use this I've read that they put it sort of on the under sole of their feet and it helps them sleep better and it relaxes them so this is a very natural homeopathic solution to you know some of the pain management and also the stress management so I'm going to open this up and show you exactly what's in it so this does cost $50 for the one point three ounces and this does last a long time some people say it lasts you know 30 days to 90 days so I'm just gonna remove this wrapper here and show you the ointment now the ointment doesn't smell you know it's it's not like tiger balm or any of the other sort of aunt mints that have a very strong smell and you can see here you know what what it sort of looks like so I'm gonna zoom in and give you a better look and give you a little you know so so the texture of it is more or less like Vaseline and it does not smell I mean it has a very very subtle mental smell but it's not strong where it's like tiger balm and it fills the room so just keep that in mind and just going around the bottle here just to give you a better look it is CBD oil and it is the extra-strength version and I will have these links in the description area it is a hundred milligrams of CBD and once again C D stands for cannabidiol which is the active ingredient in marijuana without the psychedelic or the sort of hallucinogenic aspects of marijuana and I mean just go around and you could see the consistency of the bomb here is sort of like Vaseline but it's not as liquidy or as thick if you look right on my finger but there you go that's what I wanted to show and I hope this helps and please subscribe and thank you for watching", "ucw8dRNNCv4": "MAINTAIN A STRONG BOND EVEN\nTHROUGH THE TURBULENT YEARS.

about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "zYFmmX2MxZQ": "Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from\nSpineCare in St. Joseph, MI. In this video we\u2019re going to ask: can CBD\nOil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually\ntackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good\nto be true? Let\u2019s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in\nfull disclosure that I\u2019m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of\nCBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on\nthe matter that I wanted to share. If you\u2019ve ever suffered from sciatica, you\nknow how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity\nuncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter\npainkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management\nthrough opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It\u2019s no secret that the opioid epidemic\nis real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk\nof side-effects, including addiction. That\u2019s why the appeal of CBD is growing,\nsince it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit\nforming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,\nand is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and\nmuch more. So let\u2019s take a look at how CBD may help\nrelieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it\ncomes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as\nhemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the\nwell known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,\neach with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic\n\u2018high\u2019 of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains\nthat have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain\nless than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering\nproperties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in\nevery state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated\nby the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let\u2019s move on to some key aspects\nof sciatica. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially\nits causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I\u2019m going to provide a link in this\nvideo\u2019s description to another video I\u2019ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video\nto learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,\nalong the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back\nand forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the\nmost common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which\nis when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again\npinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when\nit becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms\nlike mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain\ndifficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive\nand neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are\nreacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)\nthat something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves\nare damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially\neffective in taking on sciatica pain? It\u2019s this: CBD stimulates a part of the\nbrain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating \"good\nand bad signals\" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change\na bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic\nand nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including\nboth CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly\nlinking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very\npromising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure\nany underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for\ngetting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried\nCBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all\nof us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,\nplease feel free to leave them and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for watching!", "ODVX4f3eEDo": "[Music] hi there and welcome to the cannabis kitchen today I thought we would make some CBD infused muscle rub so muscle rub is a tough thing because a lot of people have their favorites but a lot of times they don't really know what's in it and so it's nice to have something a little bit more natural and it's also nice to be able to add the benefits of CBD so today we're actually going to be using two different types of CBD it is absolutely not necessary you can use either CB oil or you can use CV flour today we're going to use a little mixture of both just to add a little bit more liquid to the mix so what we're going to start with is our dry ingredients so what I've done is I've got a little bit of cheesecloth here and we're gonna put all our dry ingredients into it and form almost like a little tea bag so that we can drop it into the mixture and it will be a little bit less cleanup later on so what I've done to start actually is I've made a double boiler so I have that turned on and running right now the heat is just on low I just want the water should be hot I don't want it to boil underneath there and boil away on us so now that that is ready to go once we add all our ingredients that will start to melt together and we'll leave it sit for a little while so I have in this container this little glass I have 10 grams of CBD flour and a little bit of shake as well in there so we're just gonna add that onto our little pile here there we go the next thing we're gonna add is some cloves so cloves actually have a slight numbing feeling so that will definitely be a good add to our mixture here so I have I want to say 15 yes 15 clove pieces in here you can use clove essential oil as well I just didn't happen to have any in my kitchen so we're just gonna pop that on the pile the next thing we're gonna add is some cinnamon so cinnamon as you may or may not know has lots of anti-inflammatory properties I'm just using sugar from my kitchen or sorry cinnamon out of the kitchen but you can use cinnamon sticks or you can use cinnamon essential oil this is a little bit powdery but because it's going to be mixed in with everything else I don't think it's going to go through the cheesecloth so I've used about a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder and the last dry ingredient we're gonna add is some red crushed red peppers so crushed red peppers are gonna add a little bit of heat to this mixture so it's going to be kind of a cold hot kind of a feeling once you put it on your skin we're not adding a lot I happen to have an allergy to peppers so I can get away with using a little bit but not very much plus with all these ingredients that we're going to be adding a lot of them anyway they do have some irritants if you happen to rub your eyes or touch other parts of your body things like you like to put it in your mouth or on your lip so a little bit goes a long way so again I'm using about quarter of teaspoon just under a quarter of a teaspoon of crushed red peppers perfect so now all we're gonna do is gather this up as best we can and we're gonna make a little tea bag I guess you'd call it squish this up just like that give it a good squeeze we want it nice and tight there so now what I've done is I've just cut a little piece of kitchen string this is what you'd normally used to like tie a turkey at Christmas or Thanksgiving so we're just going to wrap this around this is just organic cotton so it won't add anything that we don't want into our mixture and leave a little bit at the end so we can tie it just like that perfect there you go so this is all of our dry ingredients ready to go and now we can start to add our wet ingredients the first thing we're going to add is I haven't here a quarter of a cup of melted shea butter I only melted it to get my measurement right but inside you can put it in as a big clump if you want to not a big deal either way so we're going to add that right into the bowl on top here there we go perfect ya know there are also obviously some benefits to shea butter shea butter is full of fatty acids which is really really good for your skin it has a very kind of high concentration so it's actually excellent for your skin but also it has some alien flare anti-inflammatory properties so of course it's the perfect addition for what we're making today the next thing we have is a quarter of a cup of sweet almond oil so sweet almond oil also very good for your skin it contains lots of vitamin E so it's gonna keep your skin nice and soft so we can't leave that out so pour that in just like that see if this will fit in here there's so much air as we can go good so now I'm just gonna add this little tea bag in as well just because we've got some liquid here so we're gonna put that in and we're just gonna kind of get it nice and saturated if we can and then we can get that started perfect all right so the next additions are small ones we've got lots of little containers here now I will put links on the website for all of these things so what we're using is some camphor and some peppermint essential oil we have our CBD oil as well I'm using the aurora and so the other thing we're adding is some eucalyptus oil I didn't happen to have any of my usual essential oil left in the eucalyptus so I just picked this up at the drugstore it's gonna suit the purposes the eucalyptus oil is and 80 and flama thick so like you can smell it in there it's gonna do just fine sometimes you have to just go with whatever you can so we're going to put all these in here there's only little bits of these as well this isn't a super big recipe so we're adding 45 drops of camphor we're adding 20 drops of eucalyptus and 30 drops of peppermint essential oil there now we're gonna add our CBD oil the CBD oil I'm adding is a hundred milliliters so about four full droppers out of your bottle if you have a 30ml bottle go perfect now the last thing we're gonna add is some beeswax pellets beeswax pellets are going to help sort of hold the whole mixture together but we're not using enough to make it back into a solid as these actual beeswax pellets we're using a lot of liquid in this recipe so when we're finished it should actually have quite a nice easy rubbing consistency so we're just gonna drop those in as well and we'll get up that all melting along so this is going to be done the same way as any other infusion with decarboxylated the flour that we're using which we always do and now this is just gonna sit and melt all together for about four hours and then we'll come back and get it put into some little containers and it'll be ready to go all right so we will check back in with you in four hours okay we are back it has been four hours and we've got our mixture all ready to go so we're just gonna pop this out of the water it's still a little bit hot so we need to be very careful so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take this tea bag we're going to squeeze it out and get as much out as we can so I picked up this cool little contraption at winners one day and I think it's gonna be perfect for the job because I don't have very strong hands so this will help me maximize it so we're just going to pop that in there I'm gonna give it a squeeze there's so much stuck in there get as much as we can there we go I think that's pretty good there we go so here's our mixture let's put that down we've got our mixture here there's not a lot here like I said but we're going to put this into some containers and then it's gonna be ready to go so what I've done previously is I sprayed these containers out with some rubbing alcohol just to make sure that they're nice and clean inside and so now all we need to do is just pour this mixture let me just get a little scraper there we go now it does set fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad I'm not sure we're gonna need to but put all the extras in there and it's already starting to harden in the bowl so you got to work a little bit quick and if it does cool down and start to solidify again you can just pop it into your hot water and that should soften it back up okay so we are back and our muscle rub is all hardened it actually has not too too strong to smell it's quite nice actually and when you go to use it it comes off fairly easily so it's nice and easy to rub on your skin just like that wherever you hurt and it rubs in quite nicely and easily so there you go you got some homemade CBD infused muscle rub which is awesome if you keep it in the fridge it'll probably last you about a year if you don't use it up first and also if you buy some nice little containers they make nice little gifts for people as well so let's fit on nice there you go you can get some little stickers to write a little label on them and I can already feel it starting to work so that is really nice and I think you'll enjoy it too so thank you very much for joining me in this episode of the cannabis kitchen I hope that you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed making it it's a nice easy recipe I will put the links in on the website if you go into the cannabis infused recipe section at www.canadianoutback.com look into doing that for you as well we actually had this one in the works to make and somebody did request it so that worked out good so whoever was looking for it I hope you enjoyed this particular recipe you can make changes as you wish you can add more camphor which is really good to reduce inflammation you can add more CBD or less just make sure that you're not messing around too much just because you don't want to mix up and get a really runny batch or a really really hard batch that you can't rub on so play around with it enjoy it if you have anything that you would want to add to your balm then by all means let me know in the comments I would love to know how you guys make yours and again please join us on our website Canadian wheat farm calm we've got lots of really great people there it's a really great community everyone's very helpful and if you have any questions you can ask them there we don't limit ourselves to

thumbnail for this video I think I needed some twenty dollar bills to have in flash in one hand I've made lots of money on my CBD bomb I am known all over the county and people send people it's infectious and the CBD bomb is beating cheaper to produce a hundred and eighty-seven farmers Hey a hundred and eighty-seven farmers in Alabama have harvested this year for the first time and in Tennessee they have even more and they're even having a problem because they don't have enough producers to actually produce their hemp into oil within a time period that's reasonable from the point that they harvest and they're trying to figure out what to do how you know can we take it across state lines and then will it be legal because you're supposed to produce to grow it and produce it within your own agricultural department program and so then that means you take it to another state's agricultural program and so they're trying to work this thing out because they got more hemp than they know what to do with so hemp is fixing the bottom but that's a good thing because there's lots of people out there hurting and there's lots of people on fixed incomes that it should not cost them so much to be pain free right so anyway I have held off you know I put my recipe right out there on face on YouTube and YouTube called me a drug addict and a drug pusher and they they took my videos down and anything that had the word hemp even hemp oil soap they took them all down and so I just you know just quit doing it but everybody's like you know they want the recipe so then I said well I'll start doing online classes regarding CBD products and other things and so finally the day has came tomorrow we or the how to make Kimberly CBD famous famous midi bomb and I'm gonna be giving you the recipe tomorrow is the discussion class yes they attacked a lot of channels let me tell you they took down some of the biggest channels they had at everything but in any case now it's risky this video I'll probably have to delete it because I use the words CBD and I don't want to have any trouble with my channel it's just scary you know I have grandkids videos and whenever the haters was attacking my channel they were actually attacking my videos that had my grandchildren in it and calling them names it was horrible but onto the positive we have our tie-dye rays coming up with positive vibes and what we're talking about is if you want to tomorrow is the discussion class and that's where we're going to discuss the recipe hopefully and all the different options you know can I put this in it can I put this in it can I trade this essential oil can can I use this essential oil can I use this additive can I do can I make a cream instead can I do this can I do that how about this I'm gonna go over all of that including the different attitudes that I'm aware of that might be beneficial like arnica oil turmeric oil things of that sort and we're gonna just it's going to be all about getting you ready to make the bomb making sure you understand absolutely everything you need to understand to change the recipe to suit yourself in every possible way and or why everything that's in this recipe is in this recipe of what it does all right and and then how it works and then the next class is the actual make it day class where I will be making it definitely giving you the recipe detailed by detail showing you exactly how to make it so that you can make the big bucks yourself because there are so many people out there hurting and like I have vendors who buy my bomb and if they accidentally run out without ordering they go into hyperventilation mode because customers once a customer uses this you know this is life or death sometimes this is whether I can go to work or not this is whether I can maintain to clean my house or take care of my children I mean that's how severe it can be sometimes in our customers opinion when they come in and we are getting low and we're worried about running out or we haven't got our supply in and we're low and we're fixing to make more and the fear that we will be out and we try never to run out we only did that one time and we don't everyone do that again so so if by chance you would like to invest and get the absolutely how exactly I make it and let me teach you everything about how I put this recipe together why I put it together the way I did and teach you everything I know about this recipe we're doing that and you go to WWE so P kiss is calm if you're a club member you do get the class much cheaper you get all the classes cheaper but you don't have to do that you don't have to be a member you can just be paid the non-member price it is higher but and you'll get to come in and be a part of the class just like everybody else we've created a secret a secret page on Facebook that you can't even find you can even see that thing and unless you have been invited to join it and so whenever you whenever you pay for the class then I get a hold of you I start sending text messages start calling cuz after you pay you go fill out a form and and you just do all this stuff and then boom we get you on Paige and tomorrow at 6 o'clock we start preparing for the class usually it starts about 6:30 but we go ahead you know we try to go ahead and get the video open and put some music on and let people start coming in and then we do the class usually the classes last thing you want from an hour and a half to two hours sometimes longer and we're gonna do discussion class if you're a member that's only fifty bucks and then then on I think it's November 27th we've had a few people wanting us to push it a little bit closer so that they can go ahead and make it for Christmas for their Christmas shows so we're gonna ask folks if they want to finish the class a little sooner for those who were wanting to do that see if that's agreeable but in any case then we're gonna have make it day and if you're a member that's $125 for making day and that's when you absolutely get the recipe and and and I just wanted to make sure you know and then we're going to be doing how to make the cream as well coming up and and so I just you know I just wanted to get out here because my husband's sister passed away and we have just been a little bit incognito you feel notice I haven't been posted on Facebook my husband received like eight days off bereavement pay and so I let him just recoup at the house for a couple of days and then I took him out in the woods in our camper and we just tried to be with nature and and just tried to you know just let him recoup we both do better outside you know and so I haven't been able to really promote the class as I normally would and of course we've got plenty of people on the page so what happens is it's just like this you will go on Facebook and get on the page and then boom there I'll be going pay on a video on the page and and we'll all you sit down at home with your pencil and paper in a convenient spot I can't see you you can only see me but you can comment and ask questions and it's a go live video on Facebook and what's really wonderful about it is if you can't be there when it happens then you can come back and watch it later you get two weeks on the page and dear until the you'll actually be on the page and you won't be taken off until after the second class and then two weeks after it then you'll be taken off but then if you can't afford this right now because it's fixing me Christmas and you want to wait till next month I mean the month after Christmas well then you can come in and we'll have a special deal for a recorded price only it'll probably be just a touch cheaper but you can't ask questions you just have to put it what other people asked so anyway I just want to let everybody know about the class because that's what I get messages on all the time where's that burst the video can you give me the recipe and I've always said well I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class well now I'm doing that class and and now CBD should become much easier to get a hold of and much cheaper to purchase so yes you won't be able to charge maybe just as much as you was for it but you'll be able to purchase it in such quantity that you'll be able to make more and have a better ample sale and be able to sell it you know instead of just being able to afford to make ten jars because of how expensive the isolates are now you'll be able to make 50 jars and and spend possibly the same amount of money on your eye slits and we sell isolates to members we have that for five grams for $90 including your shipping and you might find it cheaper somewhere else but that's we think it's really super cheap and it and our members have been enjoying that we also sell green Rhodes CBD in bulk all of their edibles in their drops and whatnot to members because they will not sell to someone who doesn't have a brick-and-mortar so you can put in an order for the things that you would like to resell at your booths or your places but if you've got a brick-and-mortar you can go get your own account but if you don't you can purchase it through me and I just try to be a blessing to you and so anyway and we're to have a how to make goat's milk soap with CBD in it and then I've promised everybody a more juice with cheaper classes we're gonna do a cheat class it's gonna be like twenty dollars how to make bar number seven how to make bar number nine you know and maybe fifteen dollars on the recorded version well you can't ask questions and so we're gonna have some classes that are only gonna be available to members but they're gonna be very reasonably priced and and everybody's always want to know exactly how to make some of my bars and I'll tell you exactly how to make that bar and then you can go and make that bar exactly like I told you and you can make wonderful money selling that bar and people can give you hugs and kisses and tell you that's the best soap you ever used I keep winning all these things you know people put my soaps in contests all the time and I always seem to win and I never even know about it till afterwards they'll call me you won you won and it's really great then it's some FDA FDA he was at a college and the FDA was doing a competition on a hot process soap and cold process soap and I won the hot process soap side-- plus-- I won overall and I didn't even know I didn't so so I'm telling you it's not me it's the soap it's just great recipes awesome soap recipes with good affordable recipes that you can make and make money and help people that's always fun so anyway if you would be interested you can go to www.hsn.com says w-w-w dot soapy SOA py kisses ki SS es comm and then if you're on your phone there's this little bitty box you with lines in it it's tiny so we decide you click on it and it'll tell you and you can pick classes available and you can see what's available and what we're fixing to do we also have some classes that what happened and they're down at the bottom and if you pay for one of those classes you just get to go right into that class and enjoy it for two weeks you can't ask questions like you can when it's a live class you know you can send me a message and ask for help but you know you can't ask questions like you normally could during the live class but you can still watch the class and learn from the class and I try to always make them nice and affordable and so I have several classes like that that's just waiting for you to take them and and all that good stuff now I have to answer questions hang up okay live chat there we go let me scroll down see if I've had my glasses on and I get some hellos and some I love yous hey April and Ramona Oh Pam hey Pam Elizabeth this stuff worked so well yes it does I had this one lady come in and she was a massage therapist and she said that when she woke up in the mornings that she couldn't even move her hands or her arms or her elbow she couldn't bend them and then in the mornings while she was waiting to try to you know limber up if she barely like thumped her hand on something the pain was so unbearable that she'd followed her knees it hurts so bad but she can rub my balm all the way up her arms and down her fingers and wake up the next morning completely and totally pain-free and go give people massages now that's some good stuff uh-oh I've lost me messages hang on I got to go back that's what I get for being such a talkative person here Denise hey measure oh there's Ramona it does it does so much food for so many people sherry hey Shadid there you go yeah they attacked a lot of channels I it was horrible yes she's making money off of it and I've augmented my recipe since then we've added things to it we've added essential oils to it to make it better and we've added we've changed it since it was originally went out and I think it works even better oh you love my shirt we sell these here at the store you know I'm just terrible pin spendthrift and I just couldn't seem to do it I just couldn't seem to take a shirt off the Shelf that I could sell to somebody gosh I love these shirts I just love these shirts and finally I just gave in and I got me one shirt and then I put in standard I had to have another one but there's this other one I've been eyeballing oh I gotta tell y'all guys a funny story hang on I got to tell you a funny story don't have nothing to do with CBD let me see but I got to make sure I get all of this yes I have augmented the pie the recipe Joanne and many people get that recipe and then they change it to suit them and sometimes they make devastating mistakes that really harms the way it works and it doesn't work as well and so what the discussion class is going to be about is making sure that you understand what each one of those products does for the recipe and why they're important and and also how they work and and then when you want to add something to it you know evaluating that item and of course you're going to be able to just throw things at me that you want to maybe add and then I'll be able to help you with whether it's a good idea or not because I've had people want to add stuff and oh you know they'll message me and stuff and I just think to myself I'm not gonna say a word but I'll tell them no no no don't do that well no no and this is why I don't do that so instead of telling thousands of people one day at a time I'm gonna tell everybody all at one time so that's what these classes are really about because my phone goes off 90 to nothing all the time you know and I don't mind my husband sometimes days but I don't mind because I love people and and everything but it is difficult to to teach a recipe one person at a time on the phone but when you can just have an online class that everybody can just sit down at home open up their device get on their facebook click on the page and sit back with pencil and paper and and and just suck me dry and then ask questions be able to get answers that's the way and do a whole bunch of people at one time and then from now on when somebody asks they want to say this class is above all go to soapy kisses comm class is available and go down to the bottoms and so that way I can hopefully help everybody from now on that way all right let's say oh hey Norway I know that name I'm you I'm not sure I'd say it right I just hate when I can't say names right but hey in Norway yes ok she says I love your soap recipes I have many soaps that I use your recipes and not only do I love them but my customers love them and that's what we need I have people all the time that tell me that ah there you go she had to see me do everything one of my favourite things at CBD coffee it's freaking expensive but I love it for Jennifer that says that CBD doesn't work for her the the main reason that Sydney doesn't D doesn't work for you is if you have been taking pharmaceutical pain medication for years you have built a tolerance up and so that means that you've got to have a large amount of CBD per dose than in your average person and that's usually why CBD doesn't work for someone but I have found that topical CBD is not affected by this resistance issue and so when someone hurts and they get a good quality product and they rub it where it hurts tada it works even when taking it by mouth you know it just seems like nothing works and for those people who have fibromyalgia you rub it from the tip of the hairline all the way to the tip of the spine and I have designed this bomb to go deep in pop that blood vessel and travel up the blood vessel which is feeding the nerves all the way up and that calms all those nerves down and all that fake pain just shuts up I have had people just go can I hug you and I'm like yeah we just have ourselves a great big ol bear hug and I've had people cry on me kiss me everything in the world with fibromyalgia but you just rub back stuff on the spine and then after it pops in you know then it goes up to the brain and it floods the brain with it and it calms all the nerves up their date on - I'm telling you it's wonderful stuff for fibromyalgia and the topical works sometimes when I've only had one person and all the years I've been selling it and all the customers that's walked in my door that's tried it which is absolutely almost everybody because we're constantly like would you like to put some of this you heard anywhere put some of this on put some of this on because it sells it say I've only had one man that said it didn't work for him on the topical out of all those people everybody's went like wow that gave me 80% pain relief or that oh it's completely gone friend of mine hurt himself and he had done quite a bit for me and so I just poked a thing in the mail to him and he sent me a message and he said oh my god complete and total frickin relief he said I just want to give you a hug and I said you're welcome and he said it's like a miracle and I think he had a hip damaged in Iraq and he was going through you know working with the doctors and I don't know what all they were doing with him but he was hurt and bad every step was super painful and then boom he could walk without pain and that's awesomeness and so anyway I know I get on it I love this stuff I know you'd never kept never picked out well you know I have a stronger version which you'll learn all the recipes when it comes to the bond and we find this for some people the stronger milligram lasts longer for them and it cuts their pain where the weaker one doesn't give them a hundred percent pain relief but that one does we call it the Terminator and and we but we do find that if this does a hundred percent of the job putting the extra strong went on there doesn't always do you any good so you commonly spent your money for nothing for the extra one so so anyway so it's a testing thing that's one of the reasons that we make these little one ounce jars we make these little one ounce jars just for that and now another thing I'm going to teach you is I'm going to teach you how to fill out your labels so that you won't have trouble with websites and with advertising your product and how to advertise it you know a lot of people give a lot of problem with CBD so I'm going to be teaching you how I label mine I worked with my wholesalers to find terminologies that was acceptable with the FDA and also would work with advertisers and I'll teach you how to advertise your product even advertise on Facebook how to advertise on different platforms that won't let you advertise we'll be going over that too and how to do your labels so that you'll be legal because that's important too and of course will be teaching sanitary so that you can make a healthy product that will not mold or have bacteria grow in it never think that we'll ever forget that part of it you've got to be sanitary sanitary sanitary and then when you get done with that you got to be extra sanitary so I'll teach you all of that we'll go through it's not just sitting down and saying put this in that and put here and heat this and poke it in there we're gonna start out with how to cleanse our surfaces all right and then how to cleanse everything we're gonna use and all that kind of stuff and the products that we use here we have a restaurant kitchen so we call it our FDA kitchen it's a three sink system with a hand washing on the side and then and we have certain chemical processes that goes in each one of them to make sure that everything's sanitary and then after they come out handling procedures of each item to make sure that we do it right because there is nothing worse than selling somebody something that moles especially if you've shipped it to them or if they don't live in the same city as you are and they expect for you not only to ship that product back to you and pay for it but also ship them a new one I went through it one time when Brambleberry sold me some preservative my opinion was already dead before they sent it to me and if it wasn't that it got killed in shipping because of the heat because they mailed it out right before the weekend and so therefore it's set in a transfer truck on Sunday and and but you know you can't prove anything like that but we just thought that's what we thought it was and we made hundreds of ounces of lotion and within two weeks or four weeks I think it was two weeks though at all well no it's sort of looking weird at two weeks and it started growing black stuff and green stuff no time after that and I had to pay for everything we took it to a show and sold it and we just had a little bit left and then the call started and we had to pay for every jar to come back and that is the only time I have ever had a product to mold ever I have never I've got test jars of batches I made eight years ago they've never been opened except for what I'm looking at him every once in a while and they've never fingers put in them and they're still just as pretty as the day I made them now if I sort of put my hand in there the preserve you probably couldn't hold up on that but for it to be contamination free you know in the jar it's still good after 8 years so so you know cuz preservative I supposed to live seen the ocean for eight years but anyway that's the only time we've ever had anything mold out of all those years and it was like I don't know four or six hundred ounces worth of product it'll in four ounce jars and we had to pay for every one of those jars to be mailed back and then make new find a preservative that was not dead and make new and ship it out and it was you know within the first few years of starting in this business and I'll tell you it was scary it was stressful and it was something I never want to go through again and so we teach people how to not let that happen to you even how to buy your preservative appropriately we're gonna be talking about all this kind of stuff so anyway I just want you to know we're fixing to have CBD bond class and it's interactive on Facebook and if you want to go to Sophie kisses dot-com and become a member then we'll get you on the member of a secret member page

chased me down let me tell you they do they they send people to left and right our business for CBD bomb just grows and grows and grows and grows and grows it's like a monster and we have a hard time keeping up with it sometimes and that's what can happen with you as well because this stuff is a miracle alright got a quick time now that look it's tight on the back alright so I gotta go home I

any wooden nickels [Music]", "L0UpRHIowog": "[Music] hi welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back I really appreciate your support it does mean the world to me and it's growing and growing I'm so excited I like Wow but anyway so today I'm going to show you two how to do a topical for pain relief using an infused coconut oil and some hocus pocus and to know some essential oils and that put together and this stuff works amazing I use it all the time now I absolutely love it I have a rare genetic disorder called ehlers-danlos syndrome and it's a connective tissue disorder which my body doesn't produce collagen so as my tendons and ligaments stretch out they don't go back so all of my joints are very very loose and although my muscles are constantly sore because they're constantly fighting to hold my joints in place so yeah it's a whole thing but anyway so I've used this and it has been great for inflammation my shoulders and everything so I really wanted to show you how to do it and I hope you do get the sigh of relief from it as well so um I don't think I have anything else to go there I'm gonna get into the as I normally do I'm gonna get into the ingredients and then the directions on how to do it alright well thank you for joining me so these are bombs that I made up earlier so this one is like a bomb like a waxy bomb and this one when we whip it chill it and whip it and multiply it it ends up a lighter or a lighter feel and a lighter texture so it all depends on your preference on what you what you like on your skin I tend to use both so what you're going to need for this is two tablespoons of your infused coconut oil 2 ounces of cocoa butter and you want it to be unrep yer 100% pure unrefined cocoa butter so you don't want anything done to it you want to pure unrefined same thing with the shea butter it's going to be 1 ounce of shea butter and you're use all-natural raw unrefined two tablespoons of all natural beeswax pellets and then we're going to get into our essential oils so for tumeric which is great for the anti-inflammatory as well and so tumeric you can get in a tincture which I've got here you can use it in its spice form but if you use it in its spice form it will be kind of gritty you can also get it in an essential oil unfortunately don't have the essential oil and you can also get it in capsules and it is still powdered form but it's really really fine so I like using this because you really don't feel it at all so that's what I use versus the versus the spice itself then the essential oils that I like to use and I put a list of the description of exactly what each of them do and you can choose which one's work best for you you can eliminate on any other choice you can just pick a few or all but I like this combination I found it works awesome for for inflammation so I've got the tumeric tincture I like I use spearmint eucalyptus lemongrass tea tree frankincense vetiver and lavender and the other thing you want to use is what's called a carrier oil and you could use grapeseed oil sweet almond oil castor oil I think avocado oil I believe is another one and what carrier oils do is you're gonna add your essential oils into the carrier oil before we add it in into our mixture and the reason is is essential oils can be very harsh on the skin and the first time I made it I figured well all this stuff's oily why do I need to add that so I just did it without it and it did I found it made me very itchy but when I add it to the grapeseed oil which they call as a carrier oil for them you I found that there I didn't have any itching at all so that is now what I do so I'll go over all those steps just a moment and then just for your equipment you're just gonna need a double boiler and you just want to use the potty Bowl that you're gonna be keep your stuff in and a spatula or a wooden spoon and also tapioca starch in is an option for you if you would like it helps to make it not so greasy so if you don't like a greasy feeling on your bombs or creams then you can looking at in the tapioca which I really like so depending on how much you can bury again it's I use about a quarter of a cup but again you can test it out and see what feels better for your skin oops yes I'm crushing all right so I'm just gonna get all this cleaned up and we'll put all of our ingredients together alright so the first thing you just set up your double boiler add your water it's important to make sure that the water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you can put that in and you're gonna set your heat to medium to medium-low higher higher to the medium side and we're gonna add in our two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil our two ounces of pure unrefined cocoa butter one ounce of shea butter and our two tablespoons of wax pellets beeswax pellets I use pure organic and you're gonna just kind of mix that in and wait for that to start melting and yeah it's not a whole lot to it so we're just gonna I said let that melt and have everything come together now it's very important do not turn up your heat you want to do it slowly it is very easy to burn any one of these components so you definitely want to melt it slowly over that medium-low heat as it begins to melt you just want to continue to mix periodically mix things so that you're bringing the heated stuff from the bottom up to the to the top and distributing the warm over the coal getting everything melted a little bit quicker and then while our little mixture a little concoction here is melting we can get our essential oils ready okay so you're gonna start with two tablespoons of your carrier oil whichever you decided I use grapeseed the grapeseed oil it's a good neutral good for all skin types it absorbs easily into the skin and yeah but as I said you can find maybe one that works better for your skin if you've got skin issues or yeah the sensitivity or things like that you may find one of the other ones that work better for you so you're gonna add two tablespoons of that and so it said this is my concoction you guys can said kind of do what works better for you this is what I put together that I said that I found really works great for inflammation and a little as well as a lot of my friends have tried it and it has worked really great so I use about one milliliter of the tumeric tincture and then I use one of the capsules of the 3050 milligrams of tumeric the one nice thing about using the capsules is you know exactly how much you're using you just open that up put that in and then I use spearmint as I said if you look in the description you'll find a full explanation to each the essential oils as to why I use them and I use about 20 drops of spearmint and eucalyptus is really good for your inflammation as well and muscle pain and I use about 30 drops of this and if anyone's really actually counting and there's a comment about oh there was 32 I don't want to hear it and lemongrass is awesome plus it smells really nice and again I use about 30 drops of this and then I use tea tree and the reason for the tea tree is it acts as a nice ant is an antiseptic so it takes care of any issues on your skin as well so it is it it helps like I said if it's got any kind of open lose or blemishes or things like that it will help us with that as well and being an antiseptic and I used about 15 drops of this and then ten drops of frankincense whoops that comes out quick stop's expensive too and the vet vetiver now this stuff is really really sick so it doesn't come out of the dropper we got to be very careful well I have to be careful most other people don't and I'm gonna use about ten drops of this and another good one for our skin although I don't like it I don't add it because I hate the smell of lavender but lavender is a great option as well it's a very relaxing and soothing for the muscles but as I said I don't like it don't really find much for me personally I'd anyway again personal option I hate the smell of lavender and then we're just gonna mix all those together now that all your butters and oils are melted here you're just gonna turn your heat down to low and you're just gonna leave it on for a bow we're gonna leave it on for about 20 minutes this is just to make sure everything comes up to the exact same temperature and everything is fully blended and melted together okay I apologize sorry my Stoner gapping move here the tumeric capsule if you use the capsules do not put it into the essential oils so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna just strain that out you're gonna use the capsule put the capsule into the into your shea butter and cocoa butter mixture so I'm just gonna fix that up here by watch it go straighter stop putting a piece of cheesecloth I doubled it up and applauding it into a small strainer all this stuff is very expensive so I don't want to waste it so now this isn't going to hurt the anything I'm just removing the chunks in there that we don't really want in a cream and then I'm going to add the capsule into the end of the oil okay so I'm going to add the tumeric capsule into the shea butter and cocoa butter and our beeswax that's where it's supposed to go and you just want to get a whisk a little whisk if you've got one and just whisk that in alright so our mixture has been sitting on the warm on the hot water there for about 20 minutes you're just gonna take it off and you're gonna let it sit on the counter until it cools down a little bit we don't want to add the essential oils when it's really hot because that will it'll burn off on the essential parts of the essential oils so we want to let that cool down a little bit before we're gonna add in the oils for about 5-10 minutes just check the bottom of your bowl if it's just warm to the touch then we're good but if it still feels hot wait a little bit so that feels good so now we're going to take a Nadder and add in our essential oils and you're gonna get a whisk and we're gonna whisk that in alright so here you got some options if you just want a waxy balm you can go ahead and pour it into your containers like this if you would like to take away some of the grease enos of it you can add in the tapioca starch so I'm gonna add in a quarter cup and you're gonna whisk that in again the tapioca is optional I like it though it makes it feel a lot nicer you just use a spatula to get anything off the sides I just continue to whisk whisk that until it is all known all all smooth sorry you want it nice and smooth like that so as I said if you just want to have a bomb then you can go ahead and pour it into your containers I'm gonna do a little bit of both I'm gonna do poor part one so the poor one is a bomb and then show you how to emulsify and make it a lighter texture so I'm just gonna pour the liquid just doesn't do it I'm just doing a bomb and I pour that let that set up and now you're just gonna let these you're gonna let this sit on the counter until it partially solidifies so we're going to wait for it to solidify about halfway and then we're going to start the beating process now this will solidify fairly quickly because of all of what the Watts that we have in it but less wax you use the longer it's going to take to to solidify now you can put it into the refrigerator to assist with it but it'll go fairly quickly like I said right now because we've got the wax up quite a bit of wax in there but if you do want to speed up the process you can definitely put it in the fridge for about three to five minutes but don't forget about it all right so you want your bomb now to be like this so you see how it's partially solidified here on the sides it's kind of solid but in the middle we're still liquidy and you're gonna get your hand mixer or blender or whisk you can use whoops and we are going to continue to mix this until it is all one homogeneous uniform factory [Music] all right so I'm just gonna let this sit again and let it solidify around the edges again and we're gonna repeat the process and each time we do you're gonna see the the product keep getting lighter and lighter all right so it's sort of quite a bit more on the sides there during your mixing process you can always test your bond to see how it feels and make sure that you like it for your texture so it's gonna be a lot more solid once it solidifies and sets however you want to see what it's actually gonna feel like just take a little bit rub it on the back of your hand and see how that feels so first it'll be a greasy L feel greasy but that tapioca you'll notice it'll start to nod not feel it and then you just want to work it in so it may be a little bit yellow on the skin but as you work it in that yellow will go away okay so I would just put it back into the freezer for about two minutes and I'm going to continue the process all right so you can see now that our pain balm is all one uniform texture we whatever we pull off the size is the exact same we're not getting any separation wax or anything like that and that's how you know that is fully blended there and it's gonna make a nice light bomb for you so now we're ready to pour it into our containers I just want to smack them down so they're nice and fun get out any air bubbles and that's it you can let them sit out on this counter for a couple of hours to fully set or you can put them into the fridge or the freezer to quicken that up and I'm gonna put these into the fridge probably for about a half an hour and then we'll all come back and we'll test it out right so my pain bombs here have set up and this was the one that I did just as wax and I didn't whip it up there and you can see it's darker my lighting is a little bit tough here to see it's pretty bright and then this one's a lot lighter so I said you can it'll just give you a little bit different texture totally up to you it's just a preference thing you're not gonna get any different benefits either way so we're just gonna give it a try here you see so you see how it goes on a little bit yellow and then you just work it in and there you go then you can see that grease enos it was first there at tapioca that's what takes that away so it just feels really nice on your skin as well and that's it so now you can make your own pain bombs at home without caught us thinking absolutely well not gonna lie it's a little bit expensive if you go with all those essential oils I highly recommend doing research on buying them your local if you go to your local health food store it's gonna cost you an absolute fortune I do recommend Amazon has great prices on essential oils a couple of things with regards to essential oils make sure that they are 100% essential oils and that they are pure that the other is that they're actually essential oils because you will also see essential oil fragrances and that is just extracting the fragrances from your different your different herbs and roots and same things so you want to make sure it's essential oils 100% pure and that's about all I can say with regards to that if you have any questions at all as always don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll always get back to you if you have anything else any suggestions or anything I'd love to hear from you other than that I hope you enjoyed the video and you have a wonderful rest of your day thanks for watching [Music]", "d3pNjEWEak4": "hi guys okay so today I am doing a video on my top 5 CBD creams I've been loving the CBD oil but I am training for a 10k which I know is not a marathon but still I run outside and running on the pavement often hurts

and you can really feel the cooling sensation in this one I really recommend it for like intense pains so if anything is keeping you up at night then that's probably a good gel to buy and then in first place I chose the CBD infused pain cream so this one comes at 1199 for a hundred milligrams of CBD that's a really good option for like small pains but is also super affordable if you're just looking to get started or unsure about CBD in general then you might want to you know get started with this one and see how you feel and then just work your way up to a bigger dosage this is also a really good option if you're not comfortable with the oil format it's really easy to use and spread on your area of pain I started to feel the effects about 15 to 20 minutes after I applied the cream after my run and then I was good for the day so I really recommend this cream or any of the five that I listed in this video if you've got any aches and pains or just if you have if you often have pain after an intense workout or just starting to feel the effects of age then I really recommend you to try CBD creams and let me know how it goes in the comments all right if you want the best deals

the oil that we carry is twenty milligrams per ml for a hundred and fifty pound person the daily dose of CBD is basically twenty milligrams or one full dropper inside this bottle is a glass dropper with a line indicating the ml or CC mark so it says milliliter that milliliter mark indicates that's the 20 milligram dosage and for anybody who weighs more than 150 pounds you can adjust the dosage upward [Music] you", "xAW6oB6E4fQ": "hey everyone I'm Shireen kasam the founder of my pain center calm the number one CVD resource for you to try and buy CBD okay what I want to talk to you about today is I get a lot of questions Shireen there's so many different CBD balms and muscle relaxants or muscle lotions out there which one should I get and that is true there are so many different types of CD CBD bombs out there that you have to make sure you pick the right one because you could spend 30 50 60 dollars on something that's not gonna work for you so how do you know what's the right one well one do your research and you can research all the products at my pain center calm we kind of break down what to look for in a product and what are the top things that our products have to check how much CBD is in the bottle and what's the size of the bottle so let's we're gonna get into that in a minute and then third just make sure that the the product has a certificate of analysis make sure that it's the correct amount of CBD that they're selling to you make sure it's not fake you know like a lot of people can now just put CBD stickers on their products so make sure you're buying your product from a reliable source such as my pain center calm we've spent over ten thousand dollars trying CBD products to make sure that we sell products to you that we really believe in that we actually use so like my mom has arthritis I have sciatica my dad has a torn rotator cuff as well as herniated discs my boyfriend is a firefighter so he's always sore and in pain and so we've only used we are only suggesting products to you that we truly truly believe in one of our favorite products is this green rose product is a muscle and joint and relief cream now here's what I was talking about about size okay this is a 1 ounce jar this whole thing is 1 ounce and there's a hundred and 15 milligrams of CBD in it that means the whole thing has 150 milligrams of CBD not every time you use it is it 150 milligrams of CBD so when I say it's a hundred and fifty milligrams per 1 ounce that is the same thing as somebody saying this jar has 300 milligrams in it and it's 2 ounces or this jar has 450 milligrams in it but it's three ounces do you see how it's all the same so technically only the price should be going up somebody shouldn't say to you that the the jar with 300 milligrams that's 2 ounces is any stronger than this one because it's kind of it's the concentration like it's all about the concentration so this one is actually one of my favorite products my mom uses this one for her arthritis on her hands I will use this on my sciatica it's a really cool application it's just a pump so it's it's clean it's easy to use and just pump it on there another one of my favorite products is this one which is a green roach product as well it's a muscle and joint but it's got heat relief in it now this one is two hundred and fifty milligrams for three ounces so it's a little bit less CBD than this one but here are the pros about this one this one I love especially at night this is one of my go-to that night because usually like I've brushed my teeth like I've showered I'm in bed I'm ready to go to bed and then my leg starts to hurt right the flare-ups start to happen either because you're laying down on your herniated disc or now your brain is kind of it's not worried about the day-to-day things you're doing so now your brain has time to focus on the pain so what I love about this one is it's a roll-on like literally it's just a roll-on and the great thing about that is you don't have to rub it and you can if you want to but you don't have to rub it in and it's got the heat relief so if you live in if you like that that feeling of like it's working for you it's great but I love it because I can just roll it on me and go to sleep like I don't have to get back out of bed to wash my hands so I love this product this one is my favorite personally because again I don't have to dirty my hands a new product that we recently started carrying is this active fit recovery and massage gel and this is great if you work out a lot if you're an athlete if you're in the gym a lot if you're if you're just putting a lot of stress on your body and your muscles tend to hurt or you've got shin splints or just sore muscles I tend to put it on before I work out if I'm gonna have a really hard workout and then after I work out after I shower but I've started using it at night too before bed because I have been working a lot out a lot and so my muscles tend to be really tight and really sore and this is a great one because this is just a this is a tub you kind of just put your fingers in it and you take what you want and apply it and then that's it and it's got its got like a menthol cooling effect to it so I really like this product too especially if you are a gym before you're starting for me I'm starting to get back into exercising so I'm I'm really aggravating my body and all the muscles as that are already in pain and all the herniated discs that I shouldn't be aggravating so this has been really useful and then my final product that I really love is Khoi healing balm and why do I love this product cuz one it's so small and compact I keep this in my backpack so it's with me at all times it's always it's always within hands reach it's kind of like having chapstick in your pocket keep this on me it's just a little balm love it like if you're just if you just get a flare-up at work sometimes I get tension headaches at work or my neck starts to hurt because I'm on the computer a lot or I start to get carpal tunnel right in my hand right here in my arm right here I can just pull it out and rub it on there it's got like a it's got like a eucalyptus smell to it so it's not overpoweringly menthol but it's got all these essential oils in it instead so I love this one just to keep in my back pocket so those are the four products that we carry and drop your questions down below and we'll get to them thank you so much for paying take that thank you so much for watching oh I need to see video me", "pWZr2n005zY": "today we're going to infuse CBD isolate powder into a thick rich body butter this is hemp derived CBD crystal powder and despite everything you've heard in the last few years this is 100% legal in all 50 states and it is real in today's episode of thermal mermaid were making New England summer body butter infused with CBD and scented with cedar wood and cinnamon now for those of you who are brand new to CBD this is a chemical that's been extracted from the hemp plant and in decades past using CBD was illegal along with its cousin THC which as you know some people smoke now CBD can be consumed or it can be used topically and the products that we have here is made for topical use it's packaged specifically from soap supply companies to go into cosmetics it's not for consumption now this is what it looks like when you buy one gram of isolate powder but you can buy it already suspended in shea butter or in an oil like coconut oil if you want to now I find this way easier to measure because I can see just how much I'm putting into my formula for myself these tiny little spoons are meant to measure 0.15 gram of powder and I'm going to show you here that 10 of these heaping spoonfuls divide one gram perfectly so one spoonful it's about one tenth of a gram now it is a little easier to divide it this way because for me it's a real hassle to get my scale to measure such a small weight if you want to be more accurate you can weigh it but I find that this is always the same measurement for me now if you want to learn more about CBD or cannabis you can learn more in my book cannabis cosmetics this is available on Amazon or you can download an instant PDF copy when you become a member at thermo mermaid calm the links are listed below now this book does go into more detail about CBD and you'll get the full recipe that goes along with this demonstration along with 24 of the recipes that include hemp oil homemade soaps shampoos conditioners face masks lotions and a variety of other things so if you're into CBD as a topical treatment you may be interested in learning more now we're gonna get right into the actual body butter and demonstrate this product here are the list of ingredients that are going into this body butter shea butter you can use mango if you're allergic to Shea cocoa butter hemp oil coconut oil argan oil goat's milk arrowroot and of course our CBD crystalline powder putting this recipe together is not even slightly complicated I'm going to add all the oils into my kitchen mixer now the hard Orioles will stay hard except for the cocoa butter and typically I'll start with the shea butter and give it a little time to break down in the bowl before I start adding in the rest the mixer you see here is set on the slowest setting now once the shea butter starts to soften up I'll gradually add in the other oils and then just let the mixer do all the work even if it looks like it's not doing anything the only thing that you may need to do is loosen the shea away from the beater every few minutes but as the liquid oils melt the shea it'll start to turn into a sloppy soup as this happens just give the mixer time to get everything blended together now if you have spent any time browsing through the other recipes listed over in the members directory at thermal mermaid you may have noticed that I label some body butters winter butters and some of them summer butters but they have almost the exact same texture in the finished product well it's not the thickness that makes me classify whether a body butter is a winter or summer formula this is just by the way arbitrary it's just how I feel about it but when I do this it's based on how my skin feels after its applied now this combination of ingredients has a light slick feel that melts instantly on contact with your skin now as soon as it's applied after just a few seconds your skin feels matte and dry it doesn't leave any build-up or any waxy layer behind and this is really nice for a warm or even hot weather it won't leave your skin dewy and sweaty feeling now part of the light matte texture is in the goat's milk which is rich in caprylic acid lactic acid and also alpha hydroxy acid and of course this also eats up the dead skin cells leaving the surface of your skin feeling fresh and new so even some of these small subtle changes to your base recipe can give you a twist on how to use the product or whether it will feel like when it's finished now at this point we have our mixer running for about the last five minutes and we're just gonna let this work for another few minutes before we introduce the dry ingredients I want all of the oils to be as uniform as possible before we add the rest now if you're an avid lotion maker you'll notice I'm not adding a preservative to this particular batch and that's because what you're watching me make this is just a gift for a friend who's gonna be graduating from Wellesley this week and I'll be going up to give this to her in person so I'm not gonna be selling this now although this product does not have any water in it and it will be perfectly fine for several months without a preservative I always put a preservative in anything that goes out for retail and I recommend that so you may notice that the preservative is listed in the printable recipe over on the website but we're not adding it in right here in this demonstration and in goes the goat's milk and the arrowroot and of course you can use corn starch if you don't put in the arrowroot those two are interchangeable and as soon as this is all blended in you'll start to notice that the butter starts looking fluffier and creaming and so we'll just give these two powders a moment to do their job while we continue mixing next we'll get the CBD powder blended in now this batch that I have right here will make four jars at about sixty grams each and each package I want a hundred milligrams of powder so the entire batch is going to get four scoops in order for me to get that 400 milligrams and of course this is a gift so here's my fourth scoop and put one extra scoop in just for my friend now our fragrance that we're adding today is a beautiful combination of cedar wood and cinnamon and you can make make this a novelty item if you want to you can pull it cannabis flower fragrance oil in there and it smells just like it and what happens is is that younger people love the surprise of something scented cannabis they're picking it up at your market tables it does draw a lot of attention but in my experience my adult friends don't want to walk around smelling like cannabis and so I find that cedar wood and cinnamon it still has that edgy musk aroma and then you add the candy spice and it really is a really pretty combination but it won't get any rumors started at work so this is the one that I choose to put in once all the ingredients are incorporated I have the mixer turned on to the highest setting and now we just let it whip with air now the volume will immediately begin to expand it becomes fluffy we have these nice firm peaks and the texture of the oils start to become something like a wedding cake sugar icing and we all get the texture that we won after we let this whip for about three minutes and then we shut it all down now at this point our body butter is almost done we only have a few more steps to give it a unique look that will make it stand out from other butters with other fragrances you can get a nice close look at how fluffy and smooth the oils have become here once you have all the air whips to this texture this won't deflate it will stay fluffy like this as long as you keep your product at room temperature remember coconut oil becomes a liquid at 76 degrees and you do have coconut oil in here so you have to keep this below 70 degrees because as soon as one oil melts it all starts to separate and it might even encourage the rest of it to melt so you have to keep everything in a neutral temperature and this will stay and remain stable the two colorants that I'm using for this recipe are angry rose and so very green and this will give me a cinnamon and a hemp themed color each part only gets 1/8 of a teaspoon and this is just meant to tint the butter not color it I'm not real big on bright colors in my lotions because this is again it's it's a cosmetic grade mica which means it's also a shadow so you don't want the color to transfer on to your skin so a nice light tint will do the job okay if you caught my last episode which was a short webinar I told you that I will be giving registered members a place on my server and a website at their MoMA made to have their own e-commerce shopping cart now this is set up very similar to Etsy so you can sell your products online the only difference is you don't have any listing fees and there's actually no fee there's no charge at all it's it's perfectly free so if you're just starting out this might be a good opportunity to get into selling your recipes now the first five people have already been chosen from the comments and I'll be announcing the winners tomorrow in my next video so make sure to tune in tomorrow so that you can see if you happen to be one of those winners and this is going to be available to all members so if you are hearing about this for the first time now and you're still interested in signing up or you're interested in learning on how to get a free e-commerce shopping cart no one is going to be left out if this interests you so make sure that you do hit the subscribe button and hit the little bell so you get the notifications so you can find out if you're a winner tomorrow and you have to be registered at with your account at thermo mermaid Calm it's four siren and mermaid level registrations now what will be what we'll be doing after I post some of these beginner tutorials to get people started with their shopping cart is we'll be discussing how to integrate your sales to the people that you meet in the real world online and if you want to follow with these conversations and watch these tutorials then make sure you're subscribed to now piping the butter into the jar is probably the most fun part of this project now you don't have to pipe this if you don't want to it might be a little bit too much effort but this is how you get that to tone to swirl into the jar now when you're doing this for real meaning if you're making a retail product just set the jar on the scale and then pipe up to sixty grams and it'll just fill the jar right to the surface and you might need to tap it down a little bit if you can but I'm over filling these so you can get a good look at how the colors blend and you can see the texture as it's being filled I'm exaggerating these Peaks a little bit just for the photos but the cream will stay in this shape and once you've put it all into the jar now remember this is not a lotion to use this you only take just a pea-sized amount and then you rub that into the surface of your skin to get a lot of coverage if you end up using too much it'll feel like you just poured a teaspoon of oil into your hand when you touch the butter and then you slide it across your skin it melts on contact so this product is very condensed if you're gonna turn this recipe into a lightweight lotion we would end up filling 12 to 16 ounce jars not just this 60 grams that we're putting into these four ounce jars so just keep that in mind when you use it but also keep that in mind when you're selling it and you're pricing it because this is a much much more expensive product than your standard lotions that you would be making so now we have our finished product and let's get one last close-up of just how fluffy and stable this frosting is now let's take a quick look at how it absorbs into my skin I'm going to take just a tiny bit and then rub this into the back of my hand and as you can see it absorbs almost instantly and it doesn't leave anything behind the hemp oil and the goat's milk leave my hand feeling conditioned but no heavy layer and here's our finished product of the New England summer body butter infused with CBD and hemp oil I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and until tomorrow happy creating [Music] [Music]", "rF1E3poCIKY": "Hey guys welcome back to my channel or welcome if you were new here I would love if you hit that red subscribe button down below and join the positive pack also while you're down there I would love to give this video a huge thumbs up that would really mean a lot to me and as you can tell by the title and thumbnail of this video I tried medical marijuana for my chronic pain and I am pleasantly surprised. I know this is a very very controversial subject Whether it's legal illegal. Whether it should be or shouldn't be whether it should be only used for medical purposes Recreational I know the gist and I just I I everyone has an opinion And I would love if you guys just kept your opinions to yourself I wanted to try something new and natural for me because I'm not the one to take pain pills when I was approached about trying some CBD oil I Jumped right on board I am so excited to be working with CBD bio natural CBD oil They sent me some CBD oil to try and see what I liked what I didn't like if it will work for me If I'm gonna continue using it and so I'm gonna be reviewing This little guy if you don't know what CBD oil it is the non THC It's the oil that doesn't give you a high. There's no THC in some of them some of them Do have low doses of THC this one on the other hand does not it is vegan gluten free all-natural No THC made in America. This is an oil that has no THC, which I didn't I don't care I don't I've never tried CBD oil before this this brand is 250 milligrams CBD drops hemp extract in MCT oil this brand recommends you take a dropper full or two Once or twice a day depending on how much you need it when I started using this I started at half a dropper Just because I didn't know how my body was gonna react, and I wanted to start out a smaller dose Just just to get the feel of it so I started with half a dropper it helped a little bit and so the next time I upped it to a dropper and I tried to keep it around there there were some days that I did do it two droppers at a time and When you only have a small bottle like this It roughly only lasts about a week, and this brand is about 38 dollars a bottle Which can be kind of spendy but for an all-natural product I can understand but If I continue using this brand I would have to probably buy a bottle a week which can get kind of hefty There are so many benefits to CBD oil And I will have them all in a blog post for you guys. You can click a link down in my description I have this all mapped out for you guys In my blog I don't have to just go into so much detail here in my video the taste of this brand Stuff they don't put any extra flavoring they keep it all natural so it does have a bitter taste Which for me I I couldn't handle it. I could not take it without a chaser It was I couldn't do it, No so if I do continue using this I don't I don't know that that's a big factor for me because If I'm like at a store, and I don't have a drink, but I want it or need it That could be an issue for me. Just because I couldn't it would make me gag It's just it's one of those things But it does it's natural, and it's just a hemp oil you can taste the bitterness of it I do recommend CBD oil I'm not a doctor I can't tell you that it's magical and it will work for everyone and da da da da da, but for me I will be continuing using it I did see many positive things From using it, and I didn't suffer any side effects which was awesome like I said this brand has no THC I did not feel high. This is just 100% for pain, and I absolutely love that I think that brand is 100% awesome I will have a link to their website down in the description section But the only downside is the taste and I couldn't do it also I do believe if I wanted to buy more I would find a company or See if they have like a higher dose because when you research CBD oil a lot of the companies are like Take 5 to 10 drops and Here I am taking one to two dropper filled things, and so it's not a very high dose which I think Personally I do need but if you have low pain I think this is 100% perfect. You can buy it online it's legal in all 50 states. There's no THC You will not get high None that jazz and I honestly think that every person should try it if they have chronic pain like I said, I'm not a doctor You don't have to try it. I don't care everyone has an opinion on this I know it's super controversial, but it works for me and I was pleasantly surprised, so I will be continuing to use CBD oil if I use this brand. I don't know We'll see. I don't know I know there are a bunch of other ways you can use CBD oil I know there is CBD flowers. I know you can vape CBD. I know that there's other oils There's other brands with flavored oils. I know that there are bath bombs and bath salts and bath scrubs and lotions and CBD infused Pretty much everything else And I'm really excited to try some of those products like the bath salts and the bath bombs and see if those maybe help with My aches and pains, but like I said Medical marijuana did work for me. I am excited to see what else I can learn from using it I would love to know if you use CBD oil if so what brand what's your favorite? Do you vape it do you use oils you smoke it? Thank you guys so much for watching and supporting me. If you haven't already please subscribe to my channel I make new videos every Tuesday and Friday, and I will see you guys in my next video, but until then stay positive bye guys  ", "x_h4UQuhjbk": "UNEXPLAINED SCIENCE THERE.

Ross hammock and we're going to continue our conversation about CBD THC marijuana and how it is used in lung cancer treatments can we start with talking about how it can be used what it's good for and maybe what's still not proven as for symptoms or a possibly a curative approach so it I mean we said there's THC and CBD so the CBD tends to work best for the symptoms that we associate with cancer and some of the treatments for cancer so it works for lack of appetite can work for insomnia it can work for anxiety it can work for pain I've had some patients that be able to come off their opiate painkillers that can work for nausea the thing is it's just a drug though I mean it works for some people and just like any other painkiller or anything else it doesn't work for everybody so it's it's just another tool in the armamentarium that we can use okay the THC has pretty limited medical role I'd say I mean there there are people who've pushed the very high THC form so there's something called Rick Simpson oil sure has that treatment for cancer and I think there's a tiny bit of truth in that but if you think about all of the developments in lung cancer it's all about personalized therapy so why should there be one treatment for every kind of cancer it doesn't make any sense and I think that's just wishful thinking okay so if someone was interested in starting to use CBD or THC as another tool in their lung cancer treatment yeah how would you want them to approach you and then let's also talk about how they can go about getting it where they should get it from and then also how they should go about using it you know methods of edibles smoking and vaping or what's the best options out there so in states where it's legal for both recreational and medical as in Colorado I mean technically you don't even have to go see your doctor you could just go in and get the stuff recrea recreationally the different recreational medical is the price it's essentially the same stuff or the same range of things that you can select it you go the the medical ramp you go to your doctor and I don't prescribe it I don't get out my prescription pad and say you need this and this dose and this often all I do is fill out the details so you can get an ID card so you can get the reduced price sure I mean my biggest worry though is then you go into a dispensary and somebody who may have no medical knowledge may really just be up to speed on their recreational aspects is then the person saying oh yeah you need this one yeah sure what are some things we still don't know about CBD and THC and its uses well I mean I mean it's a really long list so the the fact that they're I mean this is a natural product there's an analogy that's a bit like saying you know your doctor says you know you should have some alcohol and you go into a liquor store and they say the doctor said I should have some alcohol what should I get and the guy behind the things that you want beer do you want wine do you want liquor or whatever so we're kind of at that state you know which strain of marijuana do you take how do you take it generally speaking I would suggest you take something orally you know I think smoking it bathing it is a bad idea these are very sensitive tissues in your lungs it can be a solid gummy or a candy it can be an oil which allows you to be very sensitive you can't get it as creams but that's the only gonna be an issue of guilt like an achy joining the the other things we don't know is you know what dose do you take how often do you take it sometimes these things can get into your system very quickly ones that the oils tend to get in quicker some people even rub it on their gums which get into their system very quickly but if you do that if you don't or if you don't know that aspect you can overdose really quickly you know a one square of the chocolate bar I think nothing's happened 20 minutes later I eat the rest of the chocolate bar and then two hours later I'm completely stoned so all of this is unknown and desperately in need of study definitely what about drug interactions if someone wants to find out if the treatment they're on the target therapy they're on how it works with with marijuana where should they go for that information or who can they ask well what we're mostly worried about is when two drugs and marijuana is a drug are tab alized are broken down in the body in the same way and they're going to interfere with each other so they're either going to increase the levels of one of the drugs or decrease them and so the best place to do is to go to your your your pharmacist in a Cancer Center and say look I'm thinking about starting this I'm already on these treatments is that okay and I think that's the best place to start but it goes back to the idea of you know don't do the experiment in this weekend and then tell your doctor that you did it say hey this weekend I'm thinking about going to see a dispensary the first time what should I look out for okay perfect do you have anything else that you want touch base on this well so here's my question so have you taken marijuana I have many many years ago obviously not as a treatment option okay but I think what what I really like is that you answer that question directly and this has been a sort of taboo subject for a while and if the patient asked me have I taken marijuana I smoked it once it had no effect I was on a canal boat with some friends who's stoned out of their head and I was the one left driving true story there then you know you have to be able to address it upfront without being awkward about it sure and that's what maintains trust perfect okay well thanks for your time and thank you for joining us on hope with answers", "ohMeUJPyRiQ": "I'm dr. Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "E7MvGH0yMNU": "disclaimer in no way shape or form does the information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it

elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "Okpa6QMt51Q": "hi everyone welcome back today i'm going to talk about cbd products that i've been enjoying i've been a little bit more interested in cbd lately because it seems like you know it's this trendy ingredient that's now becoming a mainstay like i think we're going to just continue to see more and more of it so i'm gonna share the products i've been liking all right so let's talk about cbd in skincare products and in our beauty products and wellness products i first was not sold on this as an ingredient to look for just because it seemed a little too trendy the natural skeptic in me was kind of like are they just throwing it onto the label because it's cool to do it now it seems like it's an ingredient that's going to stick around and i think they're starting to find there are some real results that you can get from it it's a natural humectant so it does draw water but at the same time we tend to see it in oil form so we see it in moisturizers or we see it really truly like in an oil form so it can be a little bit confusing whether it's moisturizing or whether it is a humectant but it does draw water so i consider that to be a humectant the thing that stands out to me is that it's anti-inflammatory so that's why i think people really tend to like it when they feel achy is because it's anti-inflammatory so it just calms that inflammation in their bodies whether you have like eczema psoriasis if you have any type of sensitivity for your skin then it might be an ingredient that you can look into there have also been some early studies not conclusive studies but what they're also starting to find is that cbd could be good for oil production to control oil production so that's something that i'm also interested in i'm not 100 sold on that yet but it's something that people are starting to talk about and starting to use cbd for that reason but if you are using cbd truly just for its humectant and moisturizing properties then it definitely does that at the very least there are actually three reasons why i've been very interested in cbd just lately like very very recently in the past like month i've really been interested in it one is because i have scalp psoriasis so i get scabs on my scalp it's very dry it can get flaky it can just be very annoying to deal with like where my scalp just feels like it's almost on fire or it can be very itchy and stuff so because cbd can be hydrating and it can be anti-inflammatory i thought it might be an ingredient to look for in my scalp products another reason is because tada can you see this i'm like lifting up my ankle that's classy i hurt my ankle a month ago and i decided to buy a cream that had cbd in it and it really started to make me focus on cbd the cream has been amazing it's you know i don't know if it's because it has like the menthol type of ingredients in it or because it has the cbd or if it's the combination of both but i have loved it and so i you know i start to really put a little bit of a focus on oh like maybe i should be looking for cbd in some of my products and then the third reason honestly it's just been such a stressful year for everybody not just me i realized that it's been such a stressful year i've had so much anxiety i haven't slept well partially because it's been such a wild year but also because i'm coming out of that like first year of you know having a baby with isla and just starting to you know be able to get some sleep so cbd i'm really really late to it right now but i'm starting to become very interested in it for those reasons that said i'm i'm only just starting to get into it and starting to learn more about it so if you're interested in it or you do know a lot about cbd feel free to let me know more information about it because i'm very interested there are definitely products that i have tried in the past couple of months with cbd that have been so stupid and you know there is definitely a marketing aspect to the cbd products as well so that's also something to keep in mind just because it has cbd doesn't mean it's going to be a great product the other thing that's important to point out is that cbd oil and also hemp oil those are completely different types of ingredients than the thc that is in pot like in marijuana so if you are worried that you're going to get high from you know using like a cbd product you're not unless it says it has thc as well because i have seen those products too that have the combination most of them have some kind of a disclaimer that says it does not have thc it will not get you high and this is purely for the skin care benefits or like the wellness benefits of it all right so let's get into the product starting with this one this is the vita hemp cell energy ampoule and a big thank you to go selly for partnering with me on this video so in this serum they used one of my favorite skincare ingredients niacinamide and they paired it with cbd so that was really interesting to me and it's the reason why i start to give it a try i fully expected this to be kind of like a rich oil feel but it's not it feels like a light oil slash serum and it's kind of a fun application because it comes looking like it's almost in like in a vial and it comes with a little syringe there is no needle don't worry it comes with a little syringe that you you know pop into it and then you just pull out the amount that you're going to use and that keeps it all really fresh which i also think is very interesting because you know we're always talking about like keeping your ingredients fresh and making sure that they stay stable and everything and that's one way to ensure that so you pull out a little bit and then you apply it just like you would a serum it's very hydrating to the skin it immediately starts to plump your skin and give you those hydrating effects that you get from it so in that alone it is anti-aging but it's also very nice for controlling oil production and calming that redness in your skin i've seen a huge difference in the month that i've been using it this is one of those products that is really nice for everyone that's been wearing a mask if you're experiencing any kind of irritation and redness on your skin if you feel like your skin's getting really dry under the mask if you feel like you're getting flaky any of that even with the change of the seasons you're feeling like your skin's feeling a little bit more sensitive because it's colder now this is a wonderful serum to add in especially if you want to get those hydrating benefits it's also great for people with sensitive skin again it's anti-inflammatory you can also use it day and night in your skincare routine these are all ingredients that are really nice like they play well with others so if you are using your actives like your ahas and your bhas or if you're using some type of retinoid at night you can still apply this first to really soothe your skin and while this is for the face and this is how they market it is for your face for the skin for your skincare routine i have been using this on my scalp again they do not claim for this to be something that you use on your scalp it's just that i have really enjoyed using it also on my scalp it was one of those things where i started to feel the texture of it and i was like hmm i really like these ingredients for my face i think that this would be nice for the scalp because of the the feel of it it's very liquidy and i think that's why i like it for my scalp you know like serums and oils that are meant for your scalp like when you're losing your hair and when you are trying to treat something like psoriasis a lot of these serums or these oils haven't really caught up to what we've learned about skin care you know i think about my scalp as skin i feel like it's really important to find the right kind of skincare products for your scalp so while this isn't made for the scalp i have been putting this on my scalp at night and it has really made a huge difference the night before i'm gonna wash my hair i'll take actually like i'll fill the syringe and i will basically just kind of run this through my scalp area and i'll rub it in and then i have another product i'll show you that is more of an oil that also has cbd in it that i've been putting on my scalp and it's really helped to calm it really help to moisturize it again you know like i don't know if it's 100 the cbd in this but i know that this feels really nice on my scalp and it's made a huge difference since i talked about how i use that on my scalp i might as well get into the second product i use on my scalp and that is by briochio this is their be well 100 milligram cbd plus arnica flower soothing skin and scalp oil because the vita hemp really feels more like a serum it absorbs into my scalp really quickly so i've been locking that in again i'm trying to treat it like it's a skincare routine right so i've been locking it in with this oil and the combination really has made such a difference on my scalp if you're one of those people that has just kind of like an itchy scalp in general i'm not saying this is for psoriasis i'm just doing it because i have psoriasis neither of these products are claiming to be psoriasis products just i want to point that out this is just what i've been doing to soothe my scalp i really do think there is a lack of great products for your scalp out there i've got some hair oils for instance when i was experiencing a lot of hair loss after pregnancy where these oils were like full of just essential oils and you know when you turn and look at the ingredients list you're like this is so not caught up with the times like we know a lot more about skincare everybody and we want real skincare ingredients on our scalp the combination of the niacinamide and the cbd from both the serum and from this oil is really just nice for my scalp but also this has arnica in it and we know that arnica is also anti-inflammatory so i just really love this combination it's been working out really nicely for for my hair and my scalp all right so like i said at the beginning of the video i hurt my ankle and i really wanted to find some type of product to put on my ankle just to make it feel better so usually you know i'm like a tiger balm kind of person or like you know like the old school icy hot and stuff but when i was looking for these things on amazon this is the product that came up and it's just called natural hemp cream you know i decided i might as well buy it at the very least it has the menthol in it that i know will help my ankle feel a little bit better but i was again interested in the anti-inflammatory benefits of this hemp oil is the main ingredient of this cream which is which was one of the reasons why i was into it it also had really high ratings which i don't 100 take serious on amazon because it can be all over the place and it also has arnica in it so again we know that arnica is anti-inflammatory i know that the menthol is going to work well and then it has the hemp oil in it so i decided to purchase this and i have loved it the minute i started using it on my ankle it started to feel so much better could it be that it's just that i'm putting something that feels really nice on my skin and i'm also massaging it and everything sure but i do feel like i saw such a huge difference when i started using this on my ankle it's you know fairly inexpensive it's easy to get because it is on amazon it's not fancy at all but it feels really nice i have been using it every single day at least morning and night it's made my ankle feel a lot better i've even been using it on my other foot because since my right foot is not her it gets the brunt of my weight basically and i've been you know putting a lot more work into my right foot and my right ankle so i've been using it to massage both of my feet and my ankle areas it also just feels really moisturizing to the skin so that's been nice too i think one thing to point out is that this has hemp oil in it and not cbd so i had to do a little bit of research on the difference and it's just basically the part of the plant that is being utilized essentially in the cbd and the hemp oil but you're getting a lot of the same benefits from it all right next up is kind of like a treat yo self kind of product this is the prima bath gem i got this off of sephora i bought a couple of these because i don't really take baths as much as i used to anymore mostly because my children have taken over my bathtub so you know when i when i use this i have to essentially like clean out all the bath toys and everything and then you know actually take a bath for myself and it's got to be after the kids have fallen asleep it's a whole deal so i want to make my baths nice when i'm going to take a bath so i got a couple of these i've only used one so far and then i've got this one left but i really enjoyed the experience it's effervescent so you pop it in basically to the water once your tub is filled very similar to a bath bomb but it has cbd in it so again it's anti-inflammatory it's very hydrating and moisturizing for the skin so at the very least we know i'm getting those benefits from it but this also has magnesium in it and i think magnesium is one of those underrated ingredients that people don't focus on for skin and skin healing a lot the best way to get magnesium in our bodies as well which people don't realize is actually through our skin it's not actually taking it as a supplement and i think that's how most people try to get their magnesium but truly the best way to get it is through your skin magnesium is great for so many of our bodily functions it helps to calm us it helps us sleep it helps even our bowel movements and things like that it's just good for your body in general and it's very soothing for your muscles so again because i hurt my ankle i've been looking for products that will just help soothe my pain and like the issues i've been dealing with and this is one of those products that i got so it's not cheap considering that it's just a one-time use little tablet but it is really nice it makes your bath feel like an experience and i'm really excited to use the second one that i got next up i have two moisturizers and by the way i would consider the the hemp cream to be a pain relief cream and not a moisturizer because you don't want that menthol feeling all over your body maybe you do but i don't so i keep it only to my feet and my ankle but the next two products i have are the josie marin skin dope this is a cbd body butter and then i have this by lord jones it is the cbd body lotion so first let's talk about this this is just a nice rich moisturizer it feels good it reminds me of like a really fancy version of my old school favorite like when i was a teenager i was into the body shops mango body butter this feels like this amazing updated elevated adult version of that so i just started using this because it feels so luxurious and like i said i also got this laura jones cbd body lotion this you don't get a lot of product in i feel like i'm going through it so quickly but i really enjoy this lotion again you know i said at the beginning of the video that i have been a skeptic of cbd just because it does feel like so many brands throw cbd onto their products just to claim that they're using cbd because it's trendy and not necessarily to give you any real benefits you know lord jones has created their brand around cbd so it feels like it's a different approach in the sense of you know like they're focusing on cbd and building a whole line around cbd whereas brands that are you know established and then just like kind of including cbd in a couple of their products this one really focuses on cbd as their entire brand this is the signature fragrance by the way it's a very fragrant lotion which i personally enjoy i do feel like i'm going through this pretty quickly especially for the price of a body lotion but it has felt very nice it feels very refreshing to the skin the josie marin i've been using more on like my body after the shower and stuff and this has been a lotion that i've been just kind of like keeping at my desk and using like all my hands on my elbows on my arms like those types of areas when i'm not out of the shower it feels nice and refreshing it almost gives you kind of like a pick-me-up and because it smells pretty it's it takes a place of perfume for me too i can't really say that these products have done more than other lotions for my body but they have felt very nice i only have psoriasis on my scalp right now hopefully it doesn't go to my body but i haven't been dealing with any skin issues on my body so i'm not needing you know cbd for my body besides my ankle obviously because i'm looking for anti-inflammatory products there but they have been very nice body lotions and creams to use and like i said this feels very refreshing and it has this beautiful scent to it i'm just very interested in them i'm telling you i'm using these i like them do i recommend them as cbd products i'm not sure yet but i do like them as moisturizers next up i have these two products from milk makeup one of them is the kush fiber brow gel and then the other is the kush lip balm this is actually just their green dragon lip balm this is not the one that has color to it again we know that cbd is very hydrating moisturizing for the skin so i have enjoyed this lip balm a lot just as just a plain lip balm i've been wearing it before my lipstick you know i've seen people comment you know i was showing off like some really matte lipsticks on instagram the other day and somebody bought it and messaged me and was like this felt really dry and cracky on my lips but it looked really creamy on your lips are you using a lip gloss and stuff and i was trying to think like what is it that makes my lips different like why did that matte lipstick look different on me and i think the difference is that i tend to prep my lips with something like this i've been really enjoying this as a lip prep for my lipsticks because it's not one of those like lip balms that's super shiny and that makes it hard to you know like put a lipstick on top of this feels more like a mix of a lip balm with like a chapstick i know that doesn't sound very elegant but that's kind of what this is it's not shiny i guess is the whole point so it really helps to prep your lips it feels nice and moisturizing and i'm not sure if it's a cbd per se but i know that this is just a really nice lip balm and i've really enjoyed it and also it's got this green tone to it but it doesn't actually leave a color on your lips it just feels really nice but it's clear and then the other kush product that i've liked is the fiber brow gel one i just like fiber brow gel so i was interested in it just solely for that because on the weekends when i'm not really wearing much makeup i'll just swipe this into my brows so that i look a little bit more groomed and pulled together and i also just like that it has color to it because when i'm not actually using a brow pencil to fill in my brows this is usually what i find is all i need if it's just a day like at home or i'm going to be you know like running some errands or something and i'm not wearing a lot of makeup this is all that i need for my brows and the reason why i was interested in this having cbd in is because we know that cbd is conditioning at the very least so i assume that it does that for my brows it conditions them a little bit i've seen a difference in my brows in the sense of you know they feel like they're fuller i've also been using a lash and brow serum so it could be the combination of both or it could be just the serum or it could be this uh nikki uses this on me when she does my makeup just like today and we've really enjoyed this and then last of all my cbd products is this this brand is called recess it's a sparkling water that has hemp extract and adaptogens in it i'm not one that's into these types of drinks they usually taste terrible to me i'm one of those people that has like two to three drinks sitting on my desk almost at all times it's like i have my water a tea and some type of other drink so i thought that these would be nice because they don't have a lot of sugar in them i think like this one has four grams of sugar in it all together and it actually tastes really good there are lots of different flavors to it essentially it's like tea mixed with your sparkling water so it's kind of a nice refreshing drink at the very least it does have the help the hemp extract which i you know hope is helping to calm me down i don't know if it's working but i enjoy it it also has ginseng in it and i i've also been a fan of ginseng for a very long time i don't know if it's because it's like in my blood as an asian or something i've always liked seen my grandma and stuff use ginseng in a lot of products and in her you know like in the things that she would take for wellness so i'm a believer in ginseng and then it has l-theanine and it has lemon balm in it so both of those are just really good for like boosting your mood and stuff basically it's like a mood boosting sparkling water and whether i see a difference or not i've just enjoyed it i guess like that's the best way to explain it it's so hard to tell you guys if i've seen a huge difference in using any of these cbd products because of the cbd but what i can tell you is i've enjoyed the products that i'm talking about period right so that's like the biggest thing that i can tell you is that these are all products that have cbd in them that i really have enjoyed and this drink is one of those drinks it tastes delicious it's a very light refreshing drink i hope it's helping calm anxiety and help me sleep i did you know get like a sleep pillow that has cbd infused in it and it was the stupidest thing i've ever gotten i went back to my regular pillow and just put a silk pillowcase back on it it seemed like it did absolutely nothing for me so there are definitely still things out there that i think are just marketing gimmicks but these have all been products that i i've just thoroughly enjoyed and they happen to have cbd in them so i hope that the cbd is just doing more for me so those are cbd skincare products and wellness products that i have been enjoying tell me in the comments below if there are any products that you're going to try from my list or if you've been using any of these or if there are cbd products that you think i should take a look at i'm very interested in cbd i know that we're only going to see more and more of it on the market another reason why i've been interested in it because you know gotta pay attention see what's happening out there uh tell me why you use cbd or why you don't use cbd because i'm also curious about that find me on instagram i'm at susan yara and i'll talk to you guys soon bye [Music]", "9hcJiK4-T5w": "hey guys hello welcome back to life above the clouds my name is Lauren gah and I have my friend came back here with me I love

the vital cannabinoids found in cannabis CBD is a non psychoactive component that can hold a wide variety of potential benefits and it doesn't induce the highs that THC does the human body actually has a system known as the endocannabinoid system and thus utilizes cannabinoids in a variety of ways in the body see beady oil is the purest form of cannabidiol extract from the hemp or marijuana

doctor as you would with any daily health supplement the key features of these products are that they are organically grown provide proper servings they are non-gmo they contain cannabinoids and terpenoids d sides are used and they are farmed in Colorado so I recommend that you try CBD oil for yourself this is a safe product that will elevate your life to a higher level be healthy and be happy", "7Hmr1_bfBhc": "Willie Mays once said for all its gentility it's almost leisurely pace baseball is violence under wraps baseball is not considered a contact sport but it is a repetitive one one that can take a toll on your body and your mind many players carry those wounds into retirement one such player is former all-star pitcher David Wells wells invited us to a San Diego home to discuss baseball injuries and how this product extracted from this plant helped cure him from the demons of the diamond 21 seasons 3560 four innings pitched 687 games 249 wins 2 World Series championships when you think back on your prolific career what's the first thing that comes to your mind how the hell did I get here I was plagued with injuries early on Tommy John and 80 I think 84 586 rotator cuff labrum and just go through all those rehabilitations to get better to get to you know the ultimate goal to the big leagues and there was times where I wanted to quit because it was so grueling going through these rehab assignments with all these physical therapists and you know but once you got that opportunity and he saw what it was like the money was good all you had to do is just maintain and be productive and and that's what it did and it led me on to a 21-year journey how many surgeries do you think you sustained over the course of your career point to them on your body I had Tommy John which is covered up now with the zipper with the key so I did that before I even made the big leagues that was you know two-year a couple years after high school on the minor leagues I had Tommy John so a year later actually two years later I compensated for my elbow for my shoulder so in 1986 after the season I had I had rotator and labrum so that happened before the big leagues and through the course of my of my career I've had two back surgeries I've had two knee surgeries and then I had elbow 94 I just had some loose chips taken out of the back of my elbow just from pitching I mean pitching is an unnatural motion as you would expect all those innings all those surgeries led to a lot of pain and just like so many Americans Wells was introduced to painkillers can you tell me the first time you thought about heard about we're inclined to even inquire about painkillers early in my career you know they would give you a smile profane or something like that hair go get them kid as you go through these seasons and as you graduate more and more and more understanding then you have your first surgery okay then when you come out of the operating table to the recovery room and you wake up and then when that wears off you're like wow and I recall that and in what year was at 1986 when I had my first shoulder surgery and I was screaming at the top of my lungs give me morphine and the nurses wouldn't do it dr. Andrews comes in and says give him some morphine and talk about instant relief it was it was awesome I went back to sleep woke up felt better got on a plane and came back to San Diego were you taking them when you were pitching the night before you were pitching I didn't want to come out of game so I would pop a couple before the game in pitch on and I did that for a long time I would take one or two depending you know the severity of the pain and you know I would pitch on them because it took the pain away and I was able to get through because let me tell you something in 2000 I went 20 games and between the percocets and the cortisone shots that I took that year to keep me on the mound you know 20 is the mecca that's the goal you get 120 games you're doing something and that's like a pitchers dream to win 20 games because normally you're in the hunt for siyoung and that's basically what I did so I started doing that and you know because it just became a part of my life taking these painkillers so when you were taking the percocets how was the feeling the sensation when you were on that drug I felt pretty damn good I mean it got me through pain free when it wears off you just blah you feel your aches and pains so that temptation is there do I take another one I'm pitching at 7:05 and it lasts till you know 10:30 11 o'clock do I need another one you know I've just done my job well after a game usually go out pop another one it wasn't a habit of doing it but I did it quite a bit through my career I'd say probably from 99 on probably 75 80 percent of the time I was on it and then recreational you know depending on we did that week or that weekend I just took the painkillers as needed and then got off of him and that was it until later on in my career 99 when I was you know I had you know just a lot of pains and you know black market stuff you can get because you can't just go to your doctor hey man give me a couple hundred percocets so you know through through friends and all that you you you know where to get them and and that's I'm like wow these are very these are awesome I started taking them as needed you know because I had I can get them touch of a dial boom how many you need I got and then that's that was it for 16 years wells had a steady regimen of vicodin percocet and toradol even continuing use of prescription painkillers after retiring from baseball in 2007 until he was introduced to something that would change his life forever well saw a 60 minute special about something called CBD oil and how it helped a four year old girl overcome chronic seizures his eyes were opened I watched it and I was just really I was like amazed how nobody wants to sell to a four-year-old you know but finally they got her on there these five brothers in Colorado and they got him on so I I called my talked to my buddy Steve I said Steve I said do you know how to get the CBD and he just let them any laughs and he goes I grow it I grow it I said no you don't he goes oh yeah I do I said well I want to try it because I'm tired of the percocets tired of the way I feel feel like crap when I take them Wells began using CBD oil on a regular basis and became such a believer in the therapeutic benefits of the product that he invested in a company called green sticks there are many misconceptions about CBD oil even among the medical community to gain clarity I sat down with dr. Alan Frankel an la-based internist who has spent much of his 37-year career studying the effects of cannabis so what are the facts about CBD one that it's probably over a hundred thousand years old as well as THC this was for sure a medicinal plant it doesn't have the it's not like an opium plant or a coca plant where people get tremendous psychoactivity the natural cannabis plant as it came before the 50s and now we're breeding all those strains back which is a huge part of my work which I love people don't get high they feel good that helps with pain it helps protect the brain the heart it was one of the most protective plants on the planet a lot of athletes get injured have surgeries all the time it's a part of the game what are your thoughts on the traditionally prescribed medicine that these guys get the opioids versus the cannabis that they're not allowed to take and what the benefits would be for an athlete first I'm not saying that opiates are always bad and never indicated in in acute situations they for pain relief they're they're effective the problem is the chronic use so chronic pain or preventing pain or dealing with preventing inflammation is more rational I would argue for CBD on a regular basis frankly for everybody in this room everybody in this building if you're a professional sports person and you're injured I mean it's your family it's money it's your career it's it's everything and once you start down the narcotic path it is never a healthy path because if you get tolerance with narcotics you do not get tolerance with CBD according to dr. Frankel CBD oil can be beneficial in many ways including treating certain cancers seizures anxiety and mood disorders lowering blood glucose and diabetics and pain relief so doctor forgive me if I sound a little crass here but it sounds like the miracle medicine it sounds perfect what's the negative side where's the abuse that can happen with something like this I think the biggest issues with abuse that people talk about all the time are the high schoolers and my personal view is I'm sure there are a very small percentage the US federal government says it's 5% of people who become addicted to cannabis I don't know how many of those people truly become addicted as far as physical addiction because that's difficult with cannabis but if you're not motivated and you're not sure what you want to do and you want to hang around cannabis makes it really easy to do it but every morning you wake up you're totally sober you're not going through withdrawal tell us about the sensation you had when he took the CBD for the first time it was amazing I said am I going to get high because I'm a coach I coach high school baseball so I don't want to go to the park high as a kite I said I need something you know because I'm on my feet all day you know or at least for four or five hours during practice he goes try this twenty minutes later after I did he goes your ID I'm like no I'm the same I said well he goes well take the other when you go home take the other part of it and see how you feel that I took it I had the best night's sleep I've had in years I don't give a crap what people say what they think of me or whatever all you know you're a drag addict I'm not a drug addict I'm living proof that CBD works I got a torn rotator cuff I've been blowing off for three and a half years because I golf every day I go fly fish and I go hunting I'm an outdoorsman and I'm able to get full range of motion by taking CBD just a few times a day Wells recently had a serious rotator cuff surgery and instead of using painkillers is in the past he only used CBD oil to manage his pain after surgery and through the entire rehabilitation process and Wells isn't the only athlete who is pushing for a change and how professional sports handle pain management how do you feel about some professional athletes currently playing today lobbying their leagues to make this legal Eugene Monroe the Baltimore Ravens wrote a letter recently saying that this should be a legal substance to help with pain tolerance and pain management for NFL players for example I'll go on the bandwagon with them because I mean I'm retired athlete I wish I knew about it back when I played because I would have been all over it and I would have took those risks if they tested me in here you got you got marijuana in your system and I'll bring it to them this is what it is dissect it go take it into a lab and see what it's about our government is not given in other countries are there testing it they're doing all this kind of stuff you know our government's not doing anything about it because you know why because they're making almost a billion dollars a year on pharmaceutical you know pills what do you think sports leagues should do with respect to cannabis I think the first thing they should do is stop testing for it I think we have way bigger problems than cannabis number two I would seriously consider putting these athletes typically the ones that have potential head traumas on CBD you don't have to use very much to protect the brain against hits I think sports and cannabis has a very wonderful future and safety I mean we can't knock our brains around and not try something so at the CBD as it's been patented for neural protection and we know it helps healing concussions and so many other disorders why in the world would we not give CBD to our professional athletes a lot of people say if you want to avoid heart disease and heart attacks take aspirin daily is this something that people should be taking on a regular basis the short answer is absolutely yes currently if you're a soldier in Israel and you have a head injury in the battlefield you get CBD on the battlefield if you have a heart attack and you go into emergency room in Jerusalem you get CBD on the way up to the floor if you have a stroke you get CBD up on the way to the floor what did that shown they is a 50% reduction either brain or heart damage I believe 10 years from now coaches and managers will be handing out CBD capsules to their players do you think that the major sports leagues in this country are going to change their drug policy to allow CBD I say no but I hope they research this and understand the value that it can be instead of you know quick fixes which are there they need to open their eyes like I said and and understand what this can do I mean I would rather see a guide take the CVD or take medical marijuana then see a guy taking a painkiller why not do something natural try something different I'm living proof right now that CBD has made a major change in my and I'm you know I'm 53 years old I just turned 53 and I don't want to take those things like I said I'm three and a half years painkiller free that's pretty good", "HYMd4rhjF0A": "it's another beautiful day to watch another video and for me to be here with you right now I just want to talk about full-spectrum hemp oil what it is and what the difference is between it and regular CBD oil so full-spectrum refers to when the pure oil extracted from the hemp plant contains all the same cannabinoids and compounds found in the original plant cannabidiol is actually very very beneficial it makes up over 90% of the cannabinoid content in a plant it's non psychoactive and it's the main focus of the benefits of hemp oil full-spectrum hemp oil contains cannabidiol as well as everything else that's included with it so in addition to all the other different cannabinoids in a hemp plant full-spectrum hemp oil also has a great variety of essential vitamins minerals omega fatty acids flavonoids chlorophyll and terpenes health benefits of a full spectrum hemp oil go beyond just the therapeutic benefits of CBD itself the array of cannabinoids and other natural constituents and compounds that are in the entire hemp oil like the whole oil work together in what's known as the entourage effect and together these compounds all work harmoniously to magnify their therapeutic properties this mix of cannabinoids essential nutrients proteins essential fatty acids they'll work together synergistically to encourage homeostasis and balance in our health full spectrum hemp oil comes in tinctures edibles they also have like lotions and capsules available you guys might want to know like does it show up in drug tests did hemp THC is a very minor constituent and only appears in under 0.3% by dry weight so this extremely low level of THC in hemp makes the hemp oil the full spectrum hemp oil non psychoactive and safe to use for all ages and today we're gonna be checking out this brand called Veritas Farms which is a farm-to-table full spectrum hemp oil company located in Colorado they also have capsules and gummies as you guys know I have been going through a lot of anxiety lately I do have CBD oil but I'm also you know trying out different brands just to see what's different and what I like and so far various farms has been really great transparency and sustainability is really important to them they use organic ingredients as much as possible they grow extract formulate bottle label and ship all from their farm locally they are third-party tested and they also emphasize so much that they're not a CBD company they're not a THC company they offer full spectrum hemp oil which offers the benefits of the entourage effect this one is strawberry flavored but they also have a salted caramel flavor that I was interested in trying out but I wanted to go simple first so I got strawberry I just placed dropper like straight under my tongue I like using the oil tincture for immediate effects for anxiety and stress the gummies and capsules would be the best for sleep because they set in a little bit later and one more item from various farms that I really really have been loving is this full-spectrum Fido cannabinoid rich lotion and we're talking about full spectrum but CBD for sure is really really good for inflammation stress also like joint pain I've been using this on my face lately my skin has been breaking out my like bumps on my chin have been going away had these little things go on they've gotten better this has been really really good for my skin anyway that's my little talk about CBD oil versus full spectrum hemp oil if you want to learn more about full spectrum hemp oil make sure you look in the description below but now I'm going to go I need to take some of this because it's time to go wake my grandma up so I can get her all ready for the day my parents out of town I'm her caregiver for the day which stresses me out a little bit because being a caregiver is very it's really stressful and also when it's somebody that you are related to can also be I don't know it's caused me a lot of anxiety lately so I've definitely been taking advantage of this full spectrum take some of this [Music] [Music] so I really wanted to go to yoga class today at the studio but my brother I guess wouldn't be home until later so no one could take care of my grandma and it kind of life are shaded me a little that I had these plans that was really excited about because it's by a teacher that I've been wanting to go to but that like it didn't fall through and I'm really really rigid with my schedule and I get really frustrated when things don't go my way because I'm like a control freak I especially like when it's things that I'm planning for and then I'm excited for and then it just like doesn't happen for some reason and it's harder for me to be flexible which is really interesting because this morning I was reading a little excerpt from this book called don't sweat the small stuff it just lies around the house they're just simple ways to keep the little things from taking over your life so before I knew that my brother would be coming late and I wouldn't be able to go to this yoga class that I was excited about I read this excerpt said that says be flexible changes in your plans like once we get something into our mind a plan it can be tricky to let go of it and just go with the flow and it's hard for me to go with the flow is it more important to stick to my original set my rigid schedule or to go with what I planned them to be available for my grandmother is missing that yoga class worth getting upset over just because plans didn't fall through the way that they were meant to be the more general question is what's more important getting what I want and keeping my plans or learning to go with the flow clearly to become a more peaceful person you must prioritize being flexible over rigidity most of the time it's also helpful to expect that a certain percentage of plans will change if you make allowances in your mind for this inevitability then whatever happens you can say here's one of those inevitabilities in this little expert you said like you'll feel more relaxed yet you won't sacrifice any productivity you may even become more productive because you won't need to expend so much energy being upset and worried and I think that's a big thing it's like okay I need to just relax accept the fact that I missed a plan that I wanted to make today well rather than worrying about it and rather than be upset over it I could just make more plans and now I have space and room in my life in my head to just clear it out just relax and plan something better and do something else in that time I feel like this little rigidity that I have is what makes it hard for people around me to to like ask me for things or talk to me about things because I'm so rigid with my plan and I'm like me I don't want to change anything and that's what he says - it's like it'll make the people around you feel more peaceful and relaxed around you that they won't be walking on eggshells to ask about different things my mom definitely tiptoes around me because I'm just really rigid with my plans and I'm like very set in my ways and I get like upset over small things that change those plans so I don't know just a little a little tidbit instead of going to that yoga class I'm just going to do yoga outside in the Sun and enjoy it and also be present over here compromise being flexible me and although this might seem like a normal thing to most of you guys to me it's not and this is something that I personally struggle with and I hope I'm not alone on this but some of you might just be like what the heck Amanda it's just like a change in plans just go and do something else like it's not a big deal to most people but it's a big deal to me [Music]", "wPMptF7CaPs": "welcome everyone thank you for joining us for today's webinar the efficacy of high CBD low THC for better

turn the presentation over to her hello and thank you for attending my webinar on the efficacy of high CBD low THC for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana treatment programs at the end of this presentation there is a YouTube video for you to watch on CBD THC just click on the far left of your screen today's learning objectives are understanding CBD THC ratios in medical marijuana and using high CBD low THC cannabis products to treat disease processes there are at least a hundred and thirteen cannabinoids and this webinar is going to address two of them that work together to provide our bodies with synergy that's high CBD low THC strains of marijuana and how they help patients who use them CBD and THC interact with each other and by using them together patients may find that the effects of THC are lessened but prolonged there are many patients who just cannot tolerate the effects of THC while there are many others who smoke THC in order to relax another factor to consider is the way in which marijuana is consumed such as smoking tinctures edibles and topicals cannabinoids are better absorbed by the body when ingested on a full stomach CBD is intrinsically safe and there is no way to tell if you have had enough as with THC you would just be too high combining CBD and THC causes a reduction in the psychoactive effects of THC CBD will also help to lessen the sedative and appetite appetite inducing effects this is known as the entourage effect where both compounds work best when they're used together these two molecules are a perfect complement to each other in January of this year the medical value of cannabis was recognized by the world who health organization the therapeutic potentials of cannabis and cannabinoids has been acknowledged for the first time since 1954 by this group they have proposed new international scheduling moving towards efforts to increase the potential for countries to provide legal safe access for medical use of cannabis and its research the organization accepted the public's comments on the scheduling of marijuana until March 14th of this year I of course posted my thoughts on the website and implored them to seriously consider removing marijuana as a schedule 1 drug cannabidiol or CBD is a component of the anibus plant that may have enormous therapeutic potential although it doesn't make people feel high like THC CBD is causing quite a buzz among scientists health professionals and medical marijuana patients who are using CBD products to treat a wide variety of conditions including chronic pain cancer Crohn's diabetes rheumatoid arthritis PTSD cardiovascular disease anxiety and antibiotic resistant infections multiple sclerosis schizophrenia and more academic research centers around the world are currently studying effects of CBD on these and other ailments scientists refer to CBD as a promiscuous compound because it confers therapeutic benefits in many different ways while tapping into how we function physiologically and biologically on a deep level extensive preclinical research and some clinical studies have shown that CBD have strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant antidepressant antipsychotic antitumoral and neuro protective qualities cannabidiol appears to change gene expression and may be helpful in removing beta amyloid plaque which is the hallmark of Alzheimer's from brain cells what is THC CBD and THC are the power couple of cannabis therapeutics they appear to work best together for example CBD is believed to boost th C's pain-killing and anti-cancer properties CBD can also lessen the side effects of too much THC including anxiety and rapid heartbeat relaxing but not intoxicating is how some people describe CBD rich cannabis products CBD and THC both appear to stimulate neurogenesis the creation of new brain cells and adult mammals which may prove helpful for stroke and Parkinson's patients products made from industrial hemp that contain little or no THC are currently being market widely but recent scientific studies suggest that the products made from hemp or synthetic CBD maybe less effective therapeutically than cannabis based medicines because they lack critically secondary cannabinoids and other medicinal compounds that interact with CBD and THC to enhance their therapeutic benefits scientists call this the entourage effect numerous cannabis compounds have medicinal attributes but the therapeutic impact of the whole plant cannabis seems to be greater than the sum of its parts it still seems that patients are looking for the most part the high THC low CBD products but I feel as a nurse that they would be better suited to choose the high CBD low THC products for medicinal purposes it just seems like the high CBD has more benefits for most medical patients CBD binds with CBD receptors in the body and helps to regulate appetite pain management and immune system function such as inflammation Harlequin sweet and sour widow Stephen Hawking Kush ac/dc canna tonic and Pennywise are some of the most popular and common strains of high CBD flour it is not so much that CBD makes you feel good but that it makes you not feel bad and since it's a cap cannabinoid coming from the cannabis plant it is often confused with THC which is a psychoactive compound and people expect to feel high from it it's imperative that we educate patients as well as the public to the fact that being high as they say on cannabis cannot be compared to being intoxicated on alcohol or to the ill effects of most pharmaceuticals such as opiates benzodiazepines antipsychotics and antidepressants with a CBD high you won't feel sedated or groggy for most people it takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of CBD when taken on an empty stomach if taking on a full stomach it's about an hour there are many studies that find inflammation as the main contributing factor in problems of the brain such as anxiety brain fog depression autism a DD and ADHD CBD oil is proving to be an effective treatment for social anxiety and is naturally calming side effects from cannabis are dose dependent high CBD low THC therapy should always start with low doses increasing slowly so that the patient can find their individual dose and unwanted effects can be avoided CBD also interacts with THC by taking CBD and THC together individuals may find that the effects of THC are tempered but prolonged slightly some people can hardly tolerate any THC the wide range of reaction to THC rich cannabis may be influenced by genetic factors that may be one of the reasons why some people find THC rich cannabis to be unpleasant while hundreds of millions smoked it to relax this genetic variant exists among 20% of people in the European and Middle Eastern population of Caucasians meaning one in five or THC averse less than 10 percent of Africans have this genetic variant and among Asians it's less than 5% how does CBD benefit the human body CBD shows promise for helping to subdue the symptoms of anxiety which most of us about 30% suffer from it produces effects via molecular molecular pathways CBD enhances activation of serotonin to impede disorders such as anxiety it has been found to be a natural anxiety calmer and works very well in the treatment of social anxiety in addition to fighting inflammation in the body CBD oil may reduce anxiety by directly affecting the brain studies have found that CBD actually lowers activity in the amygdala and increases prefrontal cortex activation to parts of the brain involved in anxiety is also evidence that CBD is able to activate new neurons in the hippocampus this accent activates CBD 1 receptors which has a positive balancing impact on gaba and glutamate levels associated with reducing anxiety doctors often advise people with chronic anxiety to avoid cannabis as THC can trigger or amplify feelings of anxiousness and paranoia which is true I think for a lot of people that paranoia is definitely a side effect of a high THC product however authors of a review from neuro therapeutics found that CBD may help to reduce anxiety in people with certain related disorders according to the review CBD may reduce anxiety related behaviors and people with conditions such as PTSD general anxiety disorder panic disorder social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder the authors noted that current treatments for these disorders can lead to additional symptoms and side effects which can cause some people to stop taking them no further definitive evidence currently leaked CBD to adverse effects and the authors called for further studies of the compound as a treatment for anxiety anxiety and depression or pathologies affect human beings and may aspects of life including social life productivity and health CBD is a compound of the cannabis plant with great psychiatric potential including use as an antidepressant studies involving animal models performing a variety of experiments on the above-mentioned disorder such as the forced swimming test the elevated plus maze and the global conflict test suggest the CBD exhibited an anti-anxiety and antidepressant effect in the animal models discussed experiments with CBD demonstrated non activation of neuroreceptor cb1 and cb2 PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological ailment that is beginning to gain the attention of CBD research PTSD exhibits and individuals who have experienced trauma and/or abuse in their lifetime the disorder is most noteworthy and military veterans and accident survivors CBD has proven beneficial in relation to PTSD as it reportedly helps curb manifestations of both depression and anxiety without the debilitating side effects of pharmaceuticals CBDs effectiveness concerning PTSD is evident in the fact that states like Arizona are now recognizing PTSD as an ailment that warrants legal access to medical marijuana CBD has the ability to lower cortisol levels at slow down muscle growth the reason body builders need to work regularly to maintain continued growing their form is because our bodies do not grow muscles naturally in fact our endocrine system produces catabolic hormones such as cortisol which break down muscle mass in order to use the amino acids for other functions to counter this dilemma someone who wishes to build muscle would have to take catabolic supplements and this is where CBD comes into play studies show that cannabidiol can lower the number of catabolic hormones in the human body meaning that muscle game won't be lost so quickly and it makes it easier to gain muscle mass quicker keep in mind that CBD should not be taken with caffeine at least not for this purpose caffeine promotes the production of catabolic hormone so it would only counter the effects of CBD many medical patients tell us that marijuana helps their pain neuropathic pain also known as nerve pain is a unique type of pain that is caused by injured dysfunction or irritated nerves the pain tends to be chronic and severe with no known cure or remedy the individual is left to try numerous strategies to try to find something that works some of the most common sources of neuropathy include diabetes injury cancer infections alcoholism and autoimmune disorders have been human clinical trials that support benefits of THC and CBD for nerve pain there have been fewer studies examining just CBD in an animal study researchers found that oral supplementation of CBD led to improvements in neuropathic pain in rats back pain is one of the most common forms of both acute and chronic pain acute back pain tends to call be caused by an injury such as a fall or by lifting something heavy chronic back pain is that which lasts more than three months and is often caused by a ruptured or bulging disc author itis osteoporosis scoliosis or nerve pain some back pain is partly caused by inflammation and numerous preclinical animal studies have found benefits of CBD for inflammation three possible reduction in both nerve and inflammatory pain CBD may help relieve back pain the main mechanism by which CBD is thought to help mediate pain is by reducing inflammation largely by blocking inflammatory mediators it is also believed to potentiate glycan receptors which help to regulate pain at the spinal level this suppresses both neuropathic and inflammatory pain CBD has been found to exhibit enhancements in treating pain both when used on its own and when used in combination with THC when used alone CBD is largely best for inflammatory pain such as that caused by arthritis or injuries in one animal study on arthritis pain it was found that the topical application of CVD led to a reduction in inflammation and pain another animal study found that CBD helps to reduce neuropathic pain through the suppression of chronic inflammation CBD does not directly bind to the receptors found in the endocannabinoid system so rather works to modulate the effects of endocannabinoids found naturally in our bodies as well as working as a cb-one antagonist when searching for the best cannabis strains for pain relief you will first want to consider how much THC and CBD is found in the stream generally you will find most relief from a string that has large quantities of both CBD and THC with a high CBD THC ratio this is because CBD can help to mediate the side effects of THC while also providing additional anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties some researchers have found that CBD may prove to combat cancer authors of a review published in the British Journal of clinical pharmacology found evidence that CBD significantly helped to prevent the spread of cancer the researchers also noted that the compound tends to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their destruction they pointed out that CBD has low levels of toxicity and they called for further research in its potential as an accompaniment to standard cancer treatments type 1 diabetes results from inflammation that occurs when the immune system attacks cells in the pancreas research published in 2016 found that CBD may ease this inflammation in the pancreas this may be the first step in finding a CBD based treatment for type 1 diabetes a paper presented the same year in Lisbon Portugal suggests that CBD may reduce inflammation and protect against the delay or development of type 1 diabetes initial research published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease found CBD was able to prevent the development of social recognition deficit in its participants this means that CBD could help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's keep the ability to recognize the faces of the people that they know this is the first evidence that CBD may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease across the board it would appear as though CBD is a natural wakefulness promoting compound because of this it seems smart to recommend to take your CBD supplement or full-spectrum hep extract supplement in the morning so as to keep you alert all day and not to interfere with falling asleep interesting enough when subjects do this it appears that not only do they stay alert and awake throughout the day but they also fall asleep at night more quickly without any additional sleep aid and stay asleep longer this would appear to be because CBD is known to modulate the microglia activation of the inflammatory cycle keeping your body in a less inflamed state and lowering your stress in a review of studies done on chronic pain patients the reviewer found adequate evidence to correlate CBD oil consumption with improving multiple sleep biomarkers including sleep onset which is basically how quickly someone falls asleep the study also saw repeating incidents of lower dream recall and CBD subjects which is very interesting it's difficult to point to a mechanism here since very little is known about the nature of dreams in the field of neuroscience however this does point to the idea that dream recall may be regulated by the endocannabinoid system to some degree the same study also saw a decrease in insomnia symptoms among subjects it appears as though CBD is positively correlated with improving sleep patterns but funny enough not actually by making you sleepy as it is a wakefulness promoting agent and not a sedative like THC in fact it appears to promote sleep improvement due to the fact that it can lower stress levels as a powerful antioxidant where it benefits controlling free radicals in induced inflammation are well-documented this is great news as you can consume your CBD supplements in the morning to keep you stress-free and relaxed but focused throughout the day and then you may fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep longer throughout the night using high CB low THC to help quitting smoking some promising evidence suggests that CBD may help people quit smoking cigarettes a pilot study published in addictive behaviors found that smokers who used inhalers containing CBD smoked fewer cigarettes than usual and had no further cravings for nicotine a similar review published in neuro therapeutics found that CBD may be a promising treatment for people with opioid addiction disorders the researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders these included anxiety related symptoms pain and insomnia more research is necessary but these findings suggest that CBD may help to prevent or even reduce withdrawal symptoms children with autism spectrum disorder seek significant improvement in symptoms and less reliance on other medications after treatment with tecum ohlins ever deagle medical cannabis as confirmed by a new study published in scientific reports the two-year study followed 188 children with an average age of 13 diagnosed with ASD the patients were treated with tecum \u00f6hlins high CBD low THC medical cannabis strains which have been specifically cultivated and shown to provide symptom relief for ASD and related conditions with minimal psychoactive effect at the study's outset the most common patient symptoms were restlessness rage attacks and agitation after six months of daily cannabis treatment with at tecum olan's clinics in israel 80 point 1 percent of the patients reported improvement of their symptoms with only with 30 point one percent reporting significant improvements other key findings included of the 27 patients who had epilepsy 24 reported improved or disappearance of symptoms 34 point four percent of patients decreased other medications and 20 percent of patients stop using anti-psychotic medication autism is a leading condition of concern worldwide so this study couldn't have come at a better time says dr. Annabelle manola PhD who is tecum olam scientific director this data showed that autism patients can improve their overall quality of life utilizing a high CBD low THC strain and most importantly that young users can safely and effectively benefit from medical cannabis with the study cannabis is shown to be an effective choice for parents looking for the safest and most neuroprotective treatment the side-effects to cannabis treatment were minimal the FDA recently approved epidemics as a medication for children with refractory Caeser disorders and the DEA classified at the dialects sched as a Schedule v substance on September of 2018 epidemics would surely command a lot of off-label attention if not for the potent price tag and just as surely a huge unregulated market for hemp derived CBD isolate will continue to flourish in a tenuous legal environment an already massive consumer demand for CB products has far outpaced the gathering of clinical data on cannabinoid interactions with pharmaceuticals for pain cancer autism heart disease and many other chronic ailments concerning the product that the fda approved to treat two types of epilepsy researchers noticed the following adverse effects in clinical trials liver problems symptoms related to central nervous system such as irritability and lethargy reduced appetite gastrointestinal problems infections rashes and other sensitivity reactions reduce urination and breathing problems the patient information leaflet notes that there is a risk of worsening depression or suicidal thoughts it is important to monitor anyone who is using this drugs for signs of mood changes research suggests that a person taking the product is unlikely to form a dependency the long-standing Berry to research is a Schedule one status of cannabis a category reserved for dangerous substances with no medical value according to federal law but the paucity of federally sanctioned clinical research a consequence of cannabis prohibition should not be an excuse for physicians or patients to shun non-lethal cannabinoid therapies which show promise for a wide range of conditions when drugs do not have FDA approval it can be difficult to know whether a product contains a safe or effective level of CBD unapproved products may not have the properties or content stated on the package it is important to note that researchers have linked marijuana use during pregnancy to impairments in the fetal development of neurons regular use among teens is also associated with concerning memory behavior and intelligence CBD is just one of the many cannabinoids found in marijuana and it is not psychoactive smoking cannabis is not the same as using CBD oil and using CBD oil was not the same as smoking cannabis a person can use CBD oil in different ways to relieve various symptoms if a doctor prescribes it it's important to follow their instructions CBD products come in many forms some can be mixed into different foods or drinks and taken with a pipette or dropper others are available in capsules or as a thick paste to be massaged into the skin some products are available as sprays to be administered under the tongue recommended dosages vary between individuals and depend on factors such as body weight the concentration of the products and the health issue the studies done on CBD oil have a pretty wide dose range anywhere from a few milligrams to hundreds of milligrams it's suggested to start at the lower end around 10 milligrams and slowly increase over a few weeks or months to see what works for you some people also do well with splitting the dosage throughout the day instead of taking the dose all at once it is always a good idea to talk with your prescribing doctor if you are on any medications CBD is generally very safe but there are some pharmaceutical medications it could potentially interact with an increase or decrease the pharmaceutical drugs effectiveness some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild and defensible claims such as that CBD is a cure-all for cancer we need more research but CBD may prove to be an option for managing anxiety insomnia and chronic pain without sufficient high quality evidence in human studies we can't pinpoint effective doses and because CBD is currently mostly available as an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting if you decide to try CBD check with your doctor if for no other reason than to make sure it won't affect other medications that you're taking using CBD THC compounds in concert has been shown to help mitigate side-effects and enhance efficacy with CBD + THC showing more benefit for some conditions and THC alone studies have confirmed that CBD helps to counteract some of the sedative high feeling anxiety and rapid heartbeat that's associated with THC consumption it also has been found to extend the half-life of the THC which may help to extend the pain relieving benefits this has allowed the use of higher doses of THC in clinical trials for the treatment of pain caused by multiple sclerosis peripheral neuropathy intractable cancer pain and rheumatoid arthritis when used in concert a greater efficacy in treating these types of pain has been observed you may be wondering what is the ideal balance a ratio of CBD and THC every strain of Bud that you purchased at a dispensary will be labeled with its THC and CBD content and that's helpful when choosing a strain for pain relief thus far based on the observations regarding the ride spread use of cannabis flour and full spectrum cannabis oil it does not appear that there have been many problems because of cannabinoid drug reactions to the extent that there have been problematic drug interactions with cannabinoids these have involved high doses of CBD isolates not cannabis in general even though THC is an intoxicant and CBD is not the fact that people tend to use much higher doses of pure CBD makes it much riskier player in the metabolic drug interactions 10 milligrams of THC in a cannabis product is a hefty dose for a naive patient and sufficiently psychoactive for the occasional recreational user 10 milligrams of THC combined with equal amounts of CBD in a sativex tincture hits the energies exploit spot in clinical trials there are moderate doses compared to the amount of single molecule CBD administer to epileptic children in clinical trials up to 50 milligrams per kilogram with CBD doses as high as 2,000 milligrams not uncommon among patients who obtain CBD isolates from internet storefronts and other unregulated sources THC has its own built in guardrails consume too much and you'll know you've hit your limit with CBD there are no guardrails no dysphoric feedback loop that says you've had enough CBD is intrinsically safe but when extracting from the plant and concentrated as an isolate high doses are necessary for therapeutic efficacy unlike whole plant CBD rich extracts which have a broader therapeutic window and are effective at lower doses in a single molecule CBD drug interactions are much more likely with high dose CBD therapy than other forms of cannabis consumption physicians and patients should be concerned about this given the current regulatory regime with privileges CBD isolates over artisanal plant-derived multi-component formulations the legality CBD is a cannabinoid derived from the cannabis plant cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational use in use in some American states other states have approved the use of CBD oil as a hemp product but not the general use of medical marijuana some state and federal laws differ and current marijuana and CBD legislation in the United States can be confusing even in states where marijuana is legal there is an ever-changing number of states that do not necessarily consider marijuana to be legal but have laws directly related to CBD oil the following information is accurate as as of May 2018 but the laws change frequently however state legislators usually approve the use of CBD oil at various concentrations to treat a range of epileptic conditions a full list of states that have CBD specific laws is available different states also require different levels of prescriptions to possess and use CBD oil in Missouri for example a person can use CBD of a particular composition if they can show that three other treatment options have failed to treat their epilepsy they can provide information about safe CBD sausage sources and local laws surrounding uses anyone considering CBD oil should speak with a local healthcare provider it's also research your local state laws most states require a prescription my own state of Delaware has a medical marijuana program that currently has close to 7,000 patients thank you so much for watching my webinar on high CBD low THC product efficacy for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana programs I'm Ruth betrayin from Wyoming Delaware I have worked as a nurse for the past 13 years where I come face-to-face with various disease processes daily I'm a member of the American cannabis Nurses Association Delaware normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network I have been an advocate for marijuana since 1975 and I've lobbied at state and national levels for the past couple of years we hope to legalize recreational cannabis here in Delaware this year the legislators in my state decide the fate of marijuana so the only way to make change is to speak to them personally 61% of Delaware again support legalization of recreational cannabis I am by no means an expert on this topic but I recently worked in one of the medical marijuana dispensaries here in Delaware and I know of the pain and suffering the patient's endure for years before they finally get their doctor to agree that marijuana could help it's my hope that patients everywhere are able to utilize marijuana as a first line of defense in their medical treatment instead of it being a last resort I'd like to give a shout out to Jay and Riley mendler of Riley sunshine and thank them for all the hard work and dedication and their continued support of pediatric medical cannabis worldwide I'd also like to thank Delaware Normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network for the continued work towards legalization I'm going to close with the video done by a friend of mine Tommy Lyons he is a veteran who lives in Maryland and he's a medical marijuana patient thank you for watching hey everybody my name is Tommy Lyons and I'm a good friend of Ruth wanted to come on here today and talk to you about why I use CBD products from the cannabis plant specifically I'd like to state that I'm not representing any industry and I'm a registered and approved msec patient which means I have safe access to cannabis in Maryland I'm a service-connected disabled veteran and I use cannabis to offset various symptoms that come along with that I find that the CBD really helps target the symptoms from PTSD major depressive disorder and it helps me just kind of regain my calm I enjoy ac/dc I'm smoker and ac/dc is great it is very high in CBD and almost next to nothing in THC what that does for me is just give me a clear slate just makes me feel alright no high really but I'm not it's hard to say the word high anymore because it does different things for everybody but what we're finding is that the one thing it's doing across the board is providing an increase in quality of life and that's why I like cannabis and CBD it is important to use THC with the CBD to create what's called the entourage effect that was explained to me by a good friend of mine the old buddy old pal bill that CBD Rides and THC drives so you're in the car you've got THC and CBD working together CBD is kind of navigating telling the THC where to go and then the THC is like mmm just kind of takes off and then it's like a little bit too much so the CBD is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa come back here come back here get back to the speed limit so if you ever have too much THC for any reason use some CBD the CBD teamsters the drops that you put under your tongue that's a great way to medicate people are finding that to be very effective as a source to get the CBD into their system I usually recommend a ten to one texture which is ten part CBD and one part THC when it comes to THC and CBD in regard to dosing they're called Colorado doses ten milligrams of THC is one Colorado dose one milligram of CBD is one Colorado dose you can have as much CBD as you can intake you can't have too much CBD which is great you can't have too much THC or any other cannabinoid for that fact but the more you intake of certain cannabinoids the more potential you have for psychotropic psychedelic effects that you might not be looking for if you're looking for medicinal relief in regard to anxiety stress depression cancer looking for tumor reduction looking for symptom relief with HIV ADEs gastrointestinal issues post reconstructive surgery or any kind of surgery for that matter there are bombs THC and CBD bombs that are great for spot application for example if you're having elbow pain rub it right on the elbow there are compounds that are transdermally ingested so those are same things bomb and if you're having spot pain then you rub it on that and then you always rub it on your wrist where the skin is really thin and Venus because the compounds can either be spot application by themselves for spot application with transdermal properties so when it's transdermal and you rub it on the thin part of the skin it's gonna go full bloodstream which is going to give you a better chance for relief and fighting symptoms I've had a great opportunity to learn about cannabis I work as a dispensary technician at nature's care and wellness I'm also a patient consultant so I've worked with I have 3,000 patients that come into the store and I've gotten an opportunity to work with most of them and what we do is come up with plans in regard to how we can help figure this out come together get on a med excuse me get on a medical regimen and then find relief and it's working people keep coming back I've been working with people for over a year now and it works so it's really great to see people coming back people getting relief people's scams coming back clear people are kicking opiates I mean from going going from 280 milligrams a day down to nothing cannabis it's not just about the THC and CBD either there are many cannabinoids there are over 200 identified cannabinoids there are also terpenes which is the flavor and scent there's tart beans and everything stripping's and oranges tomatoes it's all over the place it's plant-based wellness and bringing these things together in an effort to find wellness as possible so it's great there are our CBD vapes CBD heavy vapes that are cannabis for example some strains that are really good are penny wise hardly sue tsunami harley quinn ac/dc shark shock blue dream blue dream is my favorite I've been using blue dream as my meds when I smoke they're the prettiest CBD buds I've ever seen and I mention that because I get relief when I open the bag smell it you know I take the milk out or break it open and just looking at it just makes me go I love that that's one thing about cannabis that you're not gonna get from any kind of prescription medication you're never gonna open up a bottle of pills and be like no it's just it's not like that there are capsules that you can ingest to get CBD and THC into your system there's also RS o which is Rick Simpson oil another good strain what CBD is a ray of sunshine and I've seen that in RSO tubes with a thousand milligrams total cannabinoids 600 milligrams CBD and 200 milligrams THC which is an amazing ratio because that's not going to get you too high but it is gonna get you some serious medicinal relief especially during the day the best way to consume that is called front lining it's a term that I coined basically dry out the inside of your gum with a paper towel have your meds ready pull the paper towel out so it's dry line the gums with the oil it's viscous and then let it sit there before you know it it's full blood streams called sublingual ingestion and it's really helping people alright everybody thank you so much for watching my video if there's anything I can do to help please let Ruth know and I'd be happy to follow up again my name is Tommy cannabis saves lives and that's what it's all about have a great day Thank You Ruth for that informative presentation I'd also like immigrants for making today's educational webcast possible as a final reminder our speaker will follow up with any questions you've submitted via email that's all for now thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time", "C-jwTrX4KSM": "you know hemp is known as one of the best plants for pulling up both minerals and toxins from deep down in the soil these minerals and toxins are then concentrated the CBD oil in the plant as why is so incredibly important to know your farmer when using CBD products [Music] [Music] hello I'm Benjamin at the Asher and I'm here in one of Asher's our own fields where are your farmer Zephaniah has been growing a beautiful crop of CBD hemp Zephaniah is a fourth-generation farmer on this exact field so it's kind of in his DNA to know what the plants need ganic farming has definitely been a passion of our family for a long time my grandfather started farming nearly 50 years ago organically well in the early 70s out of conviction that it was that Hearst family's health and after a few years of organic farming health issues started preparing up this really began our multi-generational passion for helping women now raising my own family I'm so grateful for healthy living soil that they can play in free from chemicals or harsh fertilizers someplace that's building their immune system [Music] and farming this way has been a family project there's often 20 or more family members aunts uncles cousins and their children all out in the field planting and making big projects you know hemp is known as one of the best plants for pulling up wolf minerals and toxin from deep down in the soil these minerals and toxins are then concentrated the CBD oil and planter as why is so incredibly important to know your farmer when using CBD products being certified organic is an absolute but even that doesn't keep the plant from pulling up heavy metals and other toxins that are deep in the soil from years of chemical use this is what makes your hemp crop so special for CBD hemp it is probably the oldest organic chemical free farm in the country growing in a volcanic rich soil and fed all year with fresh spring water from Mount Hood so instead of pulling up garbage from deep in the soil these plants are pulling up more minerals and nutrients which are converted into a deeper and wider spectrum of healthy oils the farm is also processing a portion of the cropland 'south and teachers right on site first the plants are hang dried and cured at low temperatures for a couple weeks in order to preserve as much of the fitness of the plant as possible this is far superior to sending the crop to mechanical heated fryers for an hour 99% of the CBD products are extracted at sophisticated labs using harsh chemical solvents extreme pressures temperatures multiple fractionation steps designed to pull certain components out and putting others back in then what is left they dilute back in a carrier oil like coconut oil but there's a simpler method one that you can easily do at home by just gently soaking the flours in organic coconut oil until all the natural oils and goodness is pulled out of the plant this easy tried-and-true extraction method has been used for thousands of years to pull all the goodness out of the plant and one simple step so whether you choose to buy the whole plant and make your own CBD product or by Asher's pre-made you can feel good knowing the farmer that grew it and how it was made using the purest wholesome certified organic product available anywhere sure check out the links below for details on how to make your own CBD oil right in your kitchen hey hi everybody David from Azure and hey today I want to talk once again a little bit about organic hemp him kind of used to scare me I always kind of thought hey it's a bit of a fad it's edge people are just saying things about it because it's not legal everywhere but after I began to become more knowledgeable when our customers begin to request this over and over again can you get CBD products we really want this pain creamer these great CBD products and I said so I began to research it and I researched it in a big way and I realized that there is something to that there is something amazing about some of these CBD type products so I asked our customers in Facebook and that would have been this last spring I asked the customers hey would you like a journey carried CBD products is that important and overwhelmingly everybody said it was very important so I began to research but to find the very best our customers expect the best we want to get them the best so I begin to research and I could have had a horrible time finding the best very little of the product was really organic certainly not certified organic much of it was weak much of it was not respect to the label it was very disheartening to to go through that and a lot of it grown on land that was not properly organically grown for many years that pasture or something else where chemicals or heavy metals could have leached into the product so I came to the conclusion that hey Roger has farm ground will grow it will grow some for our customers and because that's what we do Asher's had been organic since 1973 one of the oldest organic pieces of ground in the state this will be a great piece of ground to put this hemp on so we planted this spring a crop of hemp out here in the fields and it grew beautifully so today we have the hemp harvested it's dried down it's ready to go and I want to be able to offer to sell you just plain dried him why is this important most the time people are selling CBD products and we will - however you can do it yourself you can make the CBD products out of this dried raw here and control the process completely don't have to put any chemicals and you don't want to you can put all the other you can make

clean him to do your own products with when we went to to sell the hip we came across a little glitch credit card processors at this point and most banks don't allow you to sell fresh hem or hemp

cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "rIPTxn7FNak": "[Music] what's up thank you for tuning into the canon guide today we got a really cool review for you make sure you like this video and subscribe so we can get more content to more people we got a really cool review we're gonna do a CVD topical self review cell boards artisanal self now we've been carrying this salad for a long time I my collective here you can see that product right there it is a coconut oil base pure CBD derived from 100% cannabis flowers now this is a very high dose CBD product especially for topical in the entire tin I believe is about 400 milligrams of CBD that they list there on the top and they do come in different strains mainly ACDC and Charlotte's Web I wish I had the you know original full tin it usually comes in a kind of the large silver tin and that can run I think it usually runs around $40 in the dispensary depending on the area of coverage that you need to cover can be less or more you know of a value for you oh it's kind of nice system support a small business it's not one of a you know very large conglomerate yeah so when you smell this it is essentially is unscented there's no aromatherapy oils or anything else in here to you know make it very fragrant it is just raw like smells like coconut oil really just really smell like cannabis at all but when you you know it is filled with cannabis when you use it the past couple of days my knee has just been totally inflamed I hadn't been able to walk on it properly and it was seriously just thrown pain just sitting here you know most most people would just take an Advil or Tylenol but this stuff's really bad for your liver so I opted to try out the topical CBD you see how that you know really helped my my knee injury the coconut oil is a little bit thicker sometimes you can almost seem like a solid at first but when you touch it it actually just kind of melts into a liquid oil right there and your finger yeah look at it just melts right into an oil just with the heat of your your skin aren't there a little bit does go a long way with this but I found you know for males so you might actually need more than if you're a female just because have a bunch of hair the hair end up absorbing a bunch of it so I kind of had to use more than I you know I think someone less like hair we'd have to use so I just kind of got a solid glob on there now almost my my top part of my knee was hurting like right above the kneecap so I went ahead got it on both sides of that as well as on top and around the kneecap and just rubbed it in nice and gently now rub me I didn't was a little bit you know sore if you have a really sort area it's again I heard two rubbed in so just you know you can be gentle with it and I believe it is best to do this at night now I use it throughout the day you can use it throughout the day it doesn't actually get you high or medicated but at night when you're sleeping your skin temperature increases and that's when you're gonna be doing most your healing so it's gonna really be most beneficial and you know be a little bit more receptive I feel at nighttime or early morning or maybe even after a shower when you're you know nice and warm then I would take a little bit more I would actually just essentially just coat the entire area and sometimes if you can find like a source or you know find where the paint's traveling from I've actually hit that area with a little bit as well and what I found although I was very skeptical at first because you don't think you know topical is gonna work because it seems like just a lotion but it really really took the edge off now it didn't completely take the pain away when I was active and trying to move on it and you know not doing good things probably but you know when I was just sitting here you know trying to be comfortable and rest it very very very much helped the just ambient pain and just you know just the pain that's radiating and pulsating when you're just trying to relax you know conditions vary and it's really hard to say this will work for you this will work for your condition but I would definitely give it a try there's a lot of different brands out there make sure you find cvd that's derived from marijuana flower not CBD isolate from hemp it has anecdotally been found to be much less effective the have CBD isolate why that is you know a lot of people can just say it's entourage effect or it's the terpenes and the cannabis plant maybe it's the miniscule amounts of THC or the other cannabinoids we don't really know for sure I found that I much prefer those products I found them to be much more effective and if I'm to be just more reputable their testing results tend to come from reputable sources within the state and they tend to have testing sources man I can do a whole video and that you know what I will I'm gonna do a whole video on CBD just misinformation because it's seriously my pet peeve CBD isolates that are just found in a wellness store that's advertising CBD is not going to be a quality CBD product yeah people might might hate that but just be very aware when you're looking for CBD online be very skeptical until you have you know less reasons to be just be skeptical of CBT online especially from dispensaries still be skeptical just make sure you do your research look into it know what your product contains yeah supports been some great people lab test is 100% flower bud ACDC CBD topical great stuff alright so sub Ward's artisan South find them in a dispensary near you thank you for tuning ken guy please like and subscribe to the channel", "nO7vlAP5Mc0": "hey there Jeffrey here Sephora beauty director and Myesha also beauty director and we're so excited to bring you this video because we're here to talk to you about a topic that's definitely been buzz worthy for sure mm-hmm for sure so CBD is something that you have definitely heard about it's used in many different ways but we're here to talk about six very new very exciting products that we have at Sephora that offer this really great ingredient now we've talked about hemp derived products in the past but it's really important to know that this is the first video that we're actually going to be talking about products that actually contain CBD in them and this is full-spectrum CBD so you get maximum benefit and higher quality of the ingredient so you can rest assured that whichever CBD product that you choose because we have many different formulas and we've picked our favorite for sure that you're gonna get the best most soothing calming ingredients mm-hmm now at Sephora we've definitely put together this is kind of our stance on what CBD actually means and basically this is our curated assortment so when you're watching this video keep that in mind hmm so our first product that we have is something that our boss actually really loves is the first time I heard it was from her showed us a Blakely hi so this is the Lord Jones high CBD formula body lotion it's very very potent and it's very targeted so I would suggest putting your normal moisturizer on I love a good josie maran body butter after the shower that works really well for me and then put it on the areas where you feel like you need that targeted sort of soothing calming this also has shea butter in it so it's gonna go on really nicely it's gonna penetrate really deeply and also has a sort of minty feeling to it as well so it kind of helps with the feeling of just kind of like relaxing the skin so body lotion she's deceivingly small but she packs a punch for sure and remember targeted yes great for after a long day you know especially those of us that work on our feet all day and want to just a nice way to relax of my body like scrubbing and lotions and things like that but this is really going to amp it up for sure definitely take it to the next level first up for facial skincare we have from flora and bath this is a new skincare brand to Sephora this is their age adapting CBD serum now this is a beautiful product and I have to say a gorgeous texture I'm obsessed already this sort of very moisturizing like almost like a dry oil texture a wood additional oil because it's not heavy it dissipates in the skin very quickly exact like a truth serum yeah and a long time ago I would say that oil 's were definitely kind of nature's first serum anyway yeah so even though it feels like an oil it definitely has that that serum effect on the skin it's gonna dissipate really quickly and you'll be able to apply other products right on top of me say if your oily probably like I Oh probably just uses by itself but I could totally or something else on top so one of the key benefits of using this product is it's really gonna help to reduce the appearance of redness it helps to clear blemishes so it's really easy to apply you're gonna want to use five to ten drops and you can use this morning and night okay and it's really important for you again to warm it up in the hands and then press it with your fingertips along the face right just softly where you just along the high plains really working it yeah yeah and it's nice like if you want to maybe touch up your makeup cuz they're just going over you have a very very light complexion on it it looks really nice it's more satiny it doesn't look Whaley it's not breaking up anything No so our next one like I said is more of a traditional sort of oil feeling which is really nice this is the herbivore emerald CBD 100 milligram deep moisture glow oil I would say if you hear the words deep moisture it's still for all skin types it's very very lightweight I feel like it's maybe just like slightly more moisturizing than the last one we talked about with a very lightweight serum oil texture it's really really nice just to kind of put on under your makeup over your makeup it's just a really beautiful texture with a nice scent mm-hmm and I love the color I think it's just gonna look a beautiful thing on anybody's fan wait I do my products according to like what looks cute yeah I do hear that Brad you better make it look me over the weekend or company I'm late so definitely really beautiful to have on your vanity it has a nice calming like very light scent it's Jeffrey was saying kind of grounding and I love the way that it smells yeah so if you're maybe an incense person at night or you know you spritz a little perfume or something on this will kind of help you and it won't be overly distracting at all of a scent either so next up we have another powerhouse product and this one's infused with 20 different botanicals which is amazing this is from Saint Jane and this is the luxury beauty serum now this is another kind of lightweight serum oil and another one where we can talk about the packaging for like three years like this is so beautiful DUP now this one's a beautiful kind of golden color so you know that it's gonna be really great for boosting glow and giving that really nice radiance to the skin which we really really like so and this one's also gonna be really great for some age-defy in there because again like what we talked about there's a lot of antioxidant potential behind CBD so having it infused in the product is really going to help to protect your skin from environmental aggressors and stress throughout the day it has a really nice sort of I don't want to say minty but like what is that scent it's really nice it almost wakes you up I think this would be something really nice to wear in the morning or maybe on those days where you just like have had it you just want something to sort of perk you up a little bit but it's really really nice whatever blend is in there with a twenty different botanicals is really working mm-hmm you got the purest of the pure air which is great so our next one is something that's definitely a favorite of mine I'm not he was quite a bit of josie maran products and when I received this in the mail a few weeks ago I literally at my little mail opening station opened it and put it all over me so excited to use this so this is the Josie Maran skin dope argan oil plus 100 milligrams of CBD so argan oil is probably the most popular oil we have it's important has been for a long time like everybody kind of has tried it in one way or another so same benefits as her original argan oil with the omegas and the argan oil kind of giving you that like nice lipid layer it's very very important it comes in many different varieties but this has the CBD added into it so maybe if you're using that but maybe you're using maybe in anti redness serum or something to calm your skin as well and maybe you want to kind of want to use something that's multi-purpose this would be a really great transition for you and I just I find as someone who's very oily I can actually wear this during the day which I only usually wear oils at night and I was just like all for it as soon as I literally laid eyes on it yeah huge man I've been using it with the Jade roller I really yeah I enjoy it you need an automatic Jade roller that you just stick your face and that'd be cool it's a last step I have a product that I'm super excited to try this is from pharmacy and it's called better days ahead now this is gonna be a restorative kind of cushy cream now this texture is ultra addictive because it's ultra lightweight but gives you a deep hydration without a like greasy residue yes yeah it's really great for makeup prep I could see it used before oil would be really nice now this is gonna be infused with CBD as well but then you've also got an adaptogen blend of reishi mushroom you've got purple ginseng in there which are really gonna help to calm environmental stress but I like about it too if maybe you don't want to go the oil route I felt like this was a pretty good assortment of different kinds of weights of moisture too so this is something that you could use if you just like all for it or live in a very dry climate you could layer one of the oils we talked about on top of this one and you'd like to but it's very like cushiony clouds yeah nice like so so nice okay so that's pretty much it hopefully that was a healthy introduction into CBD as an ingredient for you for sure I feel like really experiencing the parts in person is really gonna solidify what you like and what you need to get I find that the consistency really sells me on you know if I'm looking for something for nighttime or daytime and the reason why we said soothing and calming quite a bit is because it's really gonna do something different for everybody so experiencing it is really the only

gives my skin proper autism boost my and CBD help me finally get a good night's sleep every Wednesday this month we are investigating the 99 CBD questions you've been asking we'll be digging into the latest research and conducting our own surveys to bring you the answers that clear up your CBD confusion today we dive into one of the biggest claims that I keep hearing about can CBD help your pain investigative journalist mark Ebner Comfort was here with the results the marijuana has been prescribed for pain to the cancer lots of things actually and now CBD which is a compound of cannabis is being touted for pain as well so walk us through these claims because they're all over the place yeah there are a lot of claims that CVD is very effective in treating all kinds of pain from muscle soreness to joint pain to inflammation to all kinds of chronic pain some even take it a step further and say this can help you recover from injury faster and see meeting is described as having certain compounds that will interrupt those pain signals walk through some of these CBD products and there's a lot of opportunities here to help but these CBD products are interestingly diverse we've got ones that you ingest that start with those what's the glory so there are a wide variety of CBD products that you would take orally from tea to candy to good old-fashioned pills but there's also a wide variety of doses so it goes from as low as five milligrams to as high as thirty milligrams and this is a big gray area it's not like acetaminophen where you know exactly how much to take if you have a headache but this you are just guessing and sometimes that with the tinctures I mean they have a drop-off and your demand dramatically changing the dose there's one drop but what does that mean the whole dropper a big drop a little drop it's very confusing all right over here we've got the ones that you apply topical products yeah topical products big segment of the industry and that ranges from creams to bombs to cooling sticks they even have bath bombs that you can throw in the tub and soak in but just like with the oral products there's really a lot of variety in the doses so like the doses the prices are all over the place we have found some projects as low as $8 we found some as much as 150 bucks how can the same products range in that much of but if footballs cost 850 bucks in some cases it is very very expensive here's the thing CBD is not subject to federal regulations remember this is a supplement not a drug so the companies can really charge anything they want that can be marketing it can be hype now in some cases the price does reflect higher quality a company that's using much stricter production standards but not always well this thing's confusing me the most of them of course people want to get the lower priced item because it's more affordable yeah and they're actually often wasting their money so you wanted to test some of the products out so we had this brainstorming we decided we'll just use Mara to test it out well I have a third-party do it we got the kitty pigment right here so what kinds of aches and pains are we gonna cheat on you yeah I was happy to do it because I do have things that bother me so I have lower back pain that's been recurring for years it's from an old sports injury and my knee now has also started bothering me so with my back it's generally after I've been laying or sleeping for too long it's very tense and sometimes after certain workouts join the club I've got both of those BOCES he thought he probably does as well so where I decided to try CBD products for 3 days to see if they would help her with her pain here's her video diary I wanted to find out which CBD products would best help me with my lower back pain I decided to try three products over the course of three days a balm capsules and mouth drops day is day one and I did wake up with some soreness on my lower back which is actually pretty typical I've been laying all night and it just tends to get sore my knee is not bothering me yet that tends to get worse as the day goes on but I'm gonna get started and we'll see how cuz so it's been about an hour and I will say I was super skeptical I didn't expect it to do anything but my back really just feel better it feels really loose it just doesn't have that like tightness and that pain that it had when I woke up it's day two and today I'm trying the capsules I actually do have quite a bit of back pain today because of a workout I did yesterday so it says take one to two capsules twice a day so it's been a few hours since I took the capsules and I'm really glad that it is a weekend because I am definitely feeling a little bit loopy a little bit lightheaded just it feels like I've just had a glass of wine or two classes so I'm getting ready to go to sleep and I'm definitely still feeling a little bit out of it but I just realized I haven't thought about my pain all night state three and today I am trying the drops so these are water soluble and I'm gonna put into my shape this morning as I'm getting ready to mix this I'm realizing the dosing is a little bit of an issue the bottle says use three drops but that's not very scientific the other thing is does not smell good to see how it tastes it tastes like my normal shape so that's a good thing so it's been a few hours since I had my shake and I don't feel anything up next what Maura things worked and what didn't we're gonna explore the latest science about CBD and pain relief [Music] be sure you subscribe to my channel so

150 grams so this is the jar right here that it comes in so yeah i'm gonna open this up oh [ __ ] i forgot so yeah this is the the cream right here or topical uh i don't know what to call it really like i never use anything like this but you know what i just came back from vacation and i was working out and swimming and stuff like that and um i was having like a really bad pain on my leg i don't know if i pulled a muscle or something i'm not sure exactly like what it was like it was in pain where like every time i stretch i'm putting some on my leg right now um no it feels a little better

muscles right here um but uh yeah i guess my first time actually using this type of a cream what do they want to call it a salve that's the main thing what it's called a salve never like i said i think i've heard some stuff about it never used it never really thought about buying it but um like i said it might be like icy hot don't quote me on that but um you know when you have like muscles and you put that on your skin this other company cbdology had something where you put you put like it's like a lotion and or cream and you put it on your area and it has like a little bit of menthol kind of like i guess it mimics like icy hot so it was my first time trying this i put on some and you do feel like a not like i see how but it feels like like a like a cool you know your my leg feels

smell doesn't really have a smell it just smells like uh like a very light sense of like lotion type of smell and i rub it into my muscle right here because i did have some issues with my left upper leg so i'm hoping that it helps out um i know it's not going to cure and cure anything you know cbd you can't really um say that it cures or you know because it's not fda approved yet but um hopefully they do some research on the cbd um all the different you know benefits that it has whatever like because i don't see why not whatever like it's legal now so might as well study it and you know get the best out of it but um so far my leg it feels a little bit better like honestly like it really my leg was bothering me a lot or like i i really didn't want to feel like doing these reviews because

"q4maAFJSWAA": "[Music] I'd like to welcome everybody today's presentation on CBD in the treatment of Alzheimer's addictions and mood disorders I'm your host dr. Donnelly Snipes in this class we're going to talk about how we can use CBD in the treatment of addiction CBD and its impact on mental health issues CBD and its impact on neurodegenerative issues like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as hit a real high-level overview of CBD adverse events toxicity and drug interactions that is going to be really important because a lot of our clients may decide to try to self-medicate with CBD in addition to other medications and I'll just foreshadow for you CBD oil or CBD interacts with just about every medication out there so we do want to make sure that they're aware of that and hopefully agree to if they're going to try to start taking CBD do it in a physician supervised capacity all right cannabidiol is promise for treatment of substance use disorder CBD is short for cannabidiol and recent models implicate major brain circuits involved in reward salient C so how were warding something is motivation and memory and learned associations in substance abuse we call those triggers in maintaining addiction which may be largely modulated by the endocannabinoid system or the receptors in our brain that respond to cannabinoids and that includes THC as well as cannabidiol the endocannabinoid system or ECS modulates dopamine that's really important to recognize it also has an effect on noradrenaline and Sarah but we'll get there when we talk about addiction though one of the things that we have seen with addiction and try to avoid saying we know because we don't really know a whole lot for a hundred percent certain but one of the things that we've seen repeatedly with addiction is that addictive substances and addictive behaviors cause a dopamine surge the endocannabinoid system is there to try to modulate that dopamine so you don't get those surges quite so much alcohol nicotine and THC which is not CBD it is another cannabinoid that's in marijuana but alcohol nicotine and THC all increased dopamine levels via nerve terminals modulated by the in endocannabinoid system important to recognize that when people are using these addictive substances they are activating that endocannabinoid system the endocannabinoid system including receptors cb1 are which you don't need to know that for the test or anything but there is a particular receptor in there that represents a necessary contributor towards cellular adaptations in the transition from recreational substance use to a use disorder so when this CB 1 R is activated it causes changes or it facilitates changes in the brain cells in the system that facilitate the move from recreational use to dependence and and tolerance and all those other things the ECS mediated synaptic plasticity may facilitate emotional learning and memory processes in increasing emotional responses to substance related cues basically what that's saying is the enactment endocannabinoid system encourages the brain cells to be a little bit more flexible to be a little bit more receptive and responsive and which facilitates learning when though systems are activated that kind of primes the brain for learning based on memory so now they're in this wide-open situation think about a classroom you know when you create a classroom you want it to create an environment that's conducive to learning so you do certain things in the classroom and you don't do other things in order to make it so most people are comfortable there they have the materials they need to learn they are not distracted the same sort of thing goes on in our brain when our brain has the right environment to learn it is much more receptive to things and the endocannabinoid system facilitates that condition in the brain antagonism which means shutting down locking off turning off whatever you want to say antagonism of that cb1 are receptor reduces alcohol induced sensitization and nicotine relapse so they're finding that CBD may reduce the people from developing tolerance and sensitization to ethanol and it tends to make them less likely to relapse on nicotine CBD is non rewarding it doesn't have the psychogenic properties of THC that is super important to remember especially for people who are in recovery because CBD is not going to get them high it had acts on other receptors in order to facilitate other processes it acts on a number of receptor systems including the opioid system the serotonin system and the cannabinoid system so when people take CBD they are modulating those symptoms systemically administered CBD which means orally or intravenously by a doctor I guess but generally we're talking about oral systemic lis administered CBD regulates mesolimbic dopamine act that's important to know and potentially reduces substance-induced dysregulation so when people take CBD orally it keeps them from having that dopamine spike that may occur when they take substances because when we take substances that dopamine system gets dysregulated it just goes wide open and CBD seems to modulate that a little bit treatment with CBD blocked the rewarding effects of morphine and heroin and prevented drug and stress induced reinstatement of condition place preference lasting up to two weeks post administration so that's really interesting now conditioned place preference why do we care about this when somebody receives a reward receives a stimulus gets that dopamine rush in a particular place that place becomes associated with pleasure in substance abuse counseling we talk about this as you know a trigger being in that place being in a bar or if you you know use heroin when you're at home you know being at home could be a trigger and when people were given to CBD it seemed to block those memories and reduce the preference for certain places that are associated with use which is really awesome so it kind of reduces those urges a little bit and it lasted up to two weeks post administration CBD reduces a lot of different things and as always in this presentation all of the hyperlinks will take you to the Articles that I got this information from just to keep it clean I do the hyperlinks but CBD reduces in most people the overall level of alcohol intake the motivation for ethanol it's keeping them from becoming tolerant to it but it also kind of takes some of the rewarding effects out of it since its modulating that dopamine release it reduces anxiety and impulse which is helpful not only in alcoholism but a whole host of other mood mental health and even neurodegenerative disorders alcohol related to ptosis and fibrosis in the liver is also reduced because CBD reduces lipid accumulation so reduces that fatty liver it stimulates Auto Fei Jie so the liver the body starts eating consuming getting rid of whatever you want to say bad cells and it modulates inflammation we know that alcoholism causes inflammation in the liver and CBD helps modulate or reduce some of that inflammation now this isn't a pass where somebody can take CBD and then drink all they want I don't want them to start thinking that way because the addicted brain will go there but it is interesting to notice that CBD may be able to help reverse a little bit some of the liver damage done by the intake of alcohol CBD also reduces oxidative stress by inducing death of activated hepatic stellate cells this is again something you're seeing that autophagy oxidative stress is when you have byproducts and residual residues of things that have processes that have happened in your body and they can build up and be toxic which is why the stress part and CBD actually causes some of these cells that have gone a little wonky to be consumed to be gotten rid of it also reduces alcohol-related brain damage preventing neuronal loss by it's antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties okay when people drink one cause of brain damage is due to lack of enough thiamine because alcohol blocks thiamine uptake and results in where Nicky korzak or Korsakoff syndrome CBD doesn't seem to help with that so that's one issue but the other issue is that the ingestion of alcohol leads to systemic inflammation and CBD because of its anti-inflammatory properties does seem to reduce the inflammation and reduce the damage to the brain cells because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes CBD in stimulant disorders CBD has reversed toxicity and seizures induced by cocaine not saying again this is not like taking naltrexone or something that with opioids that is an automatic reversal but they have found that it has helped heal the body some when somebody has used cocaine and had had toxicity or seizures it reverses behavioral sensitization induced by M FET amines and it reduces motivation to self administer cocaine and meth we're speculating again that CBDs function in modulating that dopamine and keeping it from you know going wide open is what reduces motivation to self-administer because the high is just not so good it's just like CBD also increased the extinction of cocaine and amphetamine induced conditioned place preference just like I said on the last slide or the slide before because it is reducing the rewarding say reward salience of those places and of those things then what when it's administered then by administering that you're also reducing the trigger salience you're reducing the urges to go there mechanisms involved in the protective effects of CBD on addiction to psycho stimulant drugs include prevention of drug-induced neuro adaptation hopefully it's preventing by addressing that that receptor it's preventing that neuroplasticity that encourages people to move to problematic use it encourages somehow they don't know how exactly but it does encourage the eraser of aberrant drug memories so it helps with some of those for some people they say it helps with their drug dreams that they have elimination of cognitive deficits induced by psycho stimulant drugs so it helps the brain become a little bit healthier an alleviation of mental disorders that are comorbid with psychostimulant abuse you'll learn in a little while that CBD interacts on opioid serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine systems so it is impactful for just about everything in the DSM for not everything but just about cannabis and mental health disorders anxiety social anxiety depression especially depression related to anxiety when somebody's just stressed out for so long they start to develop this sense of hopelessness and helplessness all of those have shown extreme promise for treatment with CBD CBD has many additional targets within and beyond the an endocannabinoid system it's not just that one system it also activates 5ht which you remember our serotonin receptors adrenal receptors so that's your norepinephrine system and your mu opioid receptors those are your pain receptors your heroin opioid related receptors CBD interestingly has the opposite effect of THC in the prefrontal cortex which is where we have our higher-order thinking and our impulse control and in the amygdala when people take THC a lot of times it increases their respiration it increases their heart rate and it activates their amygdala it activates their stress response system CBD seems to have the opposite effect which is interesting when we get down in a few minutes to talking about the implications of treatment of PTSD with CBD CBD either as a mono therapy or added to regular antipsychotic medication improved symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with promising effects especially in early stages of the illness in terms of garden grown marijuana again it's really important to recognize that THC is a major component of your garden grown cannabis it's really there are special seeds special plants special whatever you call them hybrids that you get theoretically to produce hemp which is where the CBD oil is extracted from so garden grown cannabis may not have the same effects because it does have those higher levels of THC now remember some illnesses some conditions actually respond better to THC but we weren't talking about that in this particular presentation so I left those out but do think about the fact that CBD and THC have some opposing psychological effects in one study I didn't find a whole lot of studies on CBD and PTSD but in one study 91% of patients experienced a decrease in PTSD symptom severity as low as evidenced by lower scores on the pcl5 at 8 weeks post treatment as opposed to their initial baseline well that's pretty encouraging again we want to look at where is this coming from since the PT up since PTSD does involve hyper activation of that amay d'leh and it does involve a lot of those other the serotonin system and other things it seems like the endocannabinoid system specifically CBD helps modulate that and kind of get it back to normal I've used the analogy repeatedly of a warm bath and when people are really anxious angry stressed-out hyper vigilant it's running like running hot water wide open and when they're super calm it's like running cold water wide open and it seems like the CBD gets in there and kind of monkeys with it so it's an adequate not too much as getting through but enough is getting through Alzheimer's and dementia cannabidiol or CBD is a phyto cannabinoid which is helpful as an antioxidant to reduce oxidative stress an anti-inflammatory and an agonist of dopamine and serotonin remember antioxidants we talk about all the time we want antioxidants to prevent aging we want antioxidants to help help fight cancer we want antioxidants to help prevent the degeneration of neural pathways and development of Alzheimer's and dementia so antioxidants not only in food but also in CBD are really helpful at reducing oxidative stress Aunty means getting rid of and oxidant means those ox that oxidative stress we already talked some about CBDs anti-inflammatory properties and then remember agonist means increasing dopamine and serotonin so it increases the dopamine and serotonin systems Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are both characterized by inflammation systemically and oxidative stress CBD is also helpful in patients with epilepsy restless legs and multiple sclerosis now with restless legs that has a a lot to do with dopamine imbalances with epilepsy and multiple sclerosis the CBD generally is used in epilepsy for seizures and in multiple sclerosis for tremors CBD as opposed to THC did not negatively alter cardiovascular parameters body temperature psychomotor or psychological functions nor did it induce a catalepsy or a trance-like or seizure like state like THC does in some people it doesn't put them into this zone it really doesn't have much of a psychogenic effect at all based on his pharmacology CBD may be useful not only in Alzheimer's and dementia but also in other mental health and behavioral conditions that have symptoms such as agitation self-injury anxiety aggression like autism spectrum disorders for example so based on its pharmacology CBD may be useful for reducing agitation anxiety psychosis aggression depression pain plaque formation in the brain and oxidative stress all of those things we work with to some level everyday now CBD is not typically strong enough if you want to use that word to really help a lot with sleep unless the person is having difficulty sleeping because of their anxiety or agitation it may help there now I didn't specifically research CBT and you know sleep or CBD and insomnia but it may be helpful as an adjunctive to what the person is currently doing again CBD interacts as does THC cannabinoids interact with a whole host of medications so it's really important to with your patients if they are going to try it because some are just determined that they want to try that and get off prescriptions or whatever that they do need medical consultation other things that CBD does it helps with pain obviously inflammation is an underlying cause for pain in a lot of people autoimmune to see diseases cause systemic inflammation in the body so when people have something like Crohn's disease or fibromyalgia or you know even diabetes is associated with systemic inflammation depression interestingly enough is correlated with systemic inflammation and I have a video on the YouTube channel on leaky gut and gut health that helps explain you know how depression and stress actually can lead to systemic inflammation and vice versa how systemic inflammation can lead to depression and stress asthma now that's not typically associated with mental health issues so to speak but when people are asthmatic some people have anxiety I know my daughter when she was little she had breathing problems and she was terrified to go very far away from home she was terrified to go out hiking and do fun things because she was afraid she would have an asthma attack so there is a certain amount of agoraphobia or anxiety that can be associated with asthma especially bad asthma but that aside if somebody has asthma they found that CBD is an exceptionally potent bronchodilator so it does help open up those bronchioles so people can breathe easier and osteoporosis interestingly enough that's not really associated with inflammation but I didn't have another slide to put it on as people get older especially women as we get older and our estrogen levels change we become more susceptible to osteoporosis cannabidiol CBD as well as some other cannabinoids stimulate bone growth and may be able to help prevent osteoporosis so that's something to look at again why do we care for a mental health from a mental health perspective well because osteoporosis can be painful bone broken bones broken hips from osteoporosis can be painful and debilitating and as we if we feel ourselves getting more fragile it tends to impair our self-efficacy and impair our our mood and our outlook to answer your question Robert all CBD mixtures are not created equal CBD is not regulated by the FDA with the exception there is one drug that is used to treat seizures in epilepsy that has been fda-approved but anything you get over-the-counter is not regulated by the FDA it is also not supposed to make any claims about being able to cure or treat any diseases additionally if you get your CBD oil from acme calm and you get get it on in June and then you order again in August from Acme com same manufacturer same place same even same size jar you may not get the same potency of CBD there's also a lot of variation between producers in the actual potency of the CBD in the tincture that you're getting or the oil or whatever method you're getting it in so no all CBD products are definitely not created equal and you can't even guarantee that you're getting the same dosage even if you get it from the same supplier every single time do be aware of that it's just like all of the workout supplements and stuff that are on the market there's a lot of loosey goosey nests which is it's very frustrating and it can be very scary additionally the dosage for CBD when you go to one manufacturer they may recommend XYZ dosage you go to another manufacturer they may recommend something you know five ten times higher so the recommended dosage is all over the place or the recommended serving size they can't call it a dosage is all over the place which also means you don't know what potency in many of these studies they were very careful to either not say or give a range of the dosage that they used because you know we don't really know yet since cannabic an avid aisle is so new on the market we don't really know what the appropriate and helpful and therapeutic dosage is yet which is again why you need to get a naturopath or somebody who is very familiar with CBD involved in the process if somebody is going to be taking it so what are some of the adverse effects in toxicity and I note here that all of these symptoms can be seen in people when they take CBD at doses higher than recommended for human consumption but like I said the potency is a little bit loosey-goosey you know between suppliers and the recommended serving size varies dramatically between suppliers so the dose that is quote recommended for human consumption really hasn't been all that well established yet but the FDA has weighed in a little bit but when people take too much they can have developmental toxicity so it can impair physical and cycle development if they are still growing embryo fetal mortality and we're going to talk about that a little bit more in a minute but it actually prevents or inhibit implantation of the embryo and it can cause birth defects central nervous system inhibition so and that's the same as a lot of your depressants it can cause slow to reaction times slow breathing slower heart rate to a very bad place neurotoxicity you're too much of a good thing even though it Fioretti helps regulate a lot of different systems in the brain if you take too much just like anything else it can be toxic hepatocellular which means liver injuries and abnormalities we need to be aware that yes it can't help heal the liver but in doses that are too big it can also overwhelm the lip liver and cause problems itself spermatogenesis reduction so the development or creation of sperm is reduced so that sperm count is gonna go down male reproductive system alterations and it goes into you know the size and weight of testes and other things if you want to read about it the articles in your class hypotension so low blood pressure diarrhea vomiting and fatigue however you know I'm putting that out there so you know that CBD yes it's natural but it also can be harmful just like a lot of other natural things that are out there there are a lot of positive effects if used appropriately and it's important to just be aware and and be cognizant of this and yes Logan the seizure medicine is epidemics CBD adverse effects cannabis and CBD use is rising among pregnant women in one study an estimated 4 to 20 percent of 18 to 24 year old pregnant women were using some form of cannabis products now that included THC as well as CBD but that's a that's a lot of pregnant women CBD inhibits embryo implantation and placenta development remember they need the placenta to get the nutrients in order to develop appropriately and prenatal cannabinoid exposure not just CBD but to any of the cannabinoids potentiates the harmful effects of alcohol increasing the risk of the development of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and craniofacial malformations and eye defects really important to recognize that not only is CBD potentially harmful to a fetus and cannabinoids potentially harmful to a fetus we know that alcohol is potentially very harmful to a fetus when you put them together they potentiate each other so it's I mean it's even more powerful than like one plus one is two it's like one plus one is six really important that pregnant women are not drinking definitely not drinking and using CBD or cannabinoids or cannabis marijuana concurrently and preferably not using cannabinoids either so let's go down to drug reactions and there's a lot of them remember I told you that CBD interacts with just about every drug on the market hmmm well here you go let's go through this laundry list and talk about why we care the first one is sort of a easy go by guide but it doesn't cover all of them however any of your clients who are taking drugs that have a grapefruit warning on them like boosts per\u00f3n or a lot of the antipsychotics those drugs are metabolized by cyp2d6 which is inhibited by CBD so if they're taking that medication then the metabolization of those drugs may not go the way it's supposed to which means in most cases the drug levels are going to bill up to toxic levels in the system way too quickly so it's really important if there's a grapefruit warning on their drugs not to take CBD that's you know just one of those rules but that warning is not on a lot of medications steroids and corticosteroids are used for things like asthma arthritis and other inflammatory conditions we need to ask people are they taking steroids or corticosteroids when my daughter used to get sick she had she was born with lung problems and so every time she would get sick it would go to her chest and she would either develop bronchitis or pneumonia just like that and she would have to be on a nebulizer in order to reduce the inflammation in her in her lungs sometimes she would even have to take oral steroids if it got that bad why do I bring that up because some of our clients may be you know not taking any drugs at all you know any medications at all taking CBD and then they get sick and they get prescribed steroids or corticosteroids it's important for them to recognize that oh this new medication I'm taking might interact with the CBD that I'm already taking they need to let their prescribing physician or physicians know if they're taking it statins these are the drugs that people take for cholesterol most people I know unfortunately who are over the age of about 50 are on some level of statins and you know we could argue whether they need to be or not statins also have some interesting effects on mood just as a side a side effect but if somebody is taking statins CBD will interact with those CBD interacts with calcium channel blockers those are the medications you take for high blood pressure certainly don't want to be monkeying around with that remember CBD can in high enough doses can cause hypotension so if you're taking medication for your blood pressure to reduce it and then you take CBD with it guess what your blood pressure may go through the floor antihistamines interestingly enough HIV antivirals and immune modulators because the CBD is it's in and of itself a immune system modulator sometimes it works with sometimes it works against the HIV drugs and you know depending on what cocktail the person is on is really important to know the interactions I'll put all three of these together benzodiazepines which are your anti-anxiety medications antipsychotics which is like your seroquel and your house all and antidepressant medications and herbs including things like st. John's wort all interact with the gaba system the serotonin system and/or the dopamine system your antipsychotics typically are responsible for reducing dopamine levels so if somebody is taking CBD which increases dopamine you're kind of working against yourself here antidepressant medications increase serotonin and potentially dopamine and or norepinephrine CBD potentially also increases all three of those and so you may put people into a position where they are at risk of things like serotonin syndrome serotonin syndrome is deadly if people get too much serotonin it spikes their body temperature and results in tremors vomiting potentially loss of consciousness a lot of really bad stuff and it can happen after just one dose it's not something that has to do that they have to do you know for a week or two weeks or months at a time sometimes we see when we talk about serotonin syndrome a lot of times we're talking about when we're talking about serotonin and serotonin syndrome we're also talking about when people take it with antidepressants when they take two different antidepressants together or they take antidepressants and opioids which actually both increase serotonin or they take antidepressants and this is a favorite one of the teenagers dextromethorphan which is a cough suppressant a lot of teenagers for a while don't know if they're still doing it we're taking mega doses of dextromethorphan rectally in order to increase the rate of absorption and the dextromethorphan actually increases serotonin levels and they were some of them were getting so much they were developing serotonin syndrome so serotonin is really nothing to monkey around with if you don't know what you're doing like I said herbs were looking at 5ht as well 5htp as well as st. John's wort anticonvulsant like klonopin or clonazepam beta blockers another thing that is used for blood pressure proton pump inhibitors which are things like zantac and there's one that begins with a P and I can't think of it right now but you take it for stomach acid and even oral diabetic medications any of these all of these interact with CBD and it will affect the amount of circulate that certain amount of that medication circulating in your system or the absorbability or availability of it in some cases it reduces and in other cases it increases the point is to know what what the interactions are now one interesting place you can go is to drugs calm and they have an interaction checker see if I can get it to come up okay so to answer somebody else's question as well as to show you how the drug interaction thing works you put in the medication or medications that the person is taking and then it'll tell you drug interactions for this one it says statins and cannabidiol cannabidiol may cause liver problems and using it with other medications that also affect the liver such as statins may increase the risk of liver damage so that's what that's all about so that you just go to drugs calm or search for drugs calm drug interaction checker and I've used it with a lot of my clients to help them understand the side effects of some of the medications they're taking as well as to check for side effects of the medications they're taking with other things like herbs over-the-counter drugs even alcohol CBD is showing promise as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for a variety of things ranging from Alzheimer's and addiction to Parkinson's and schizophrenia I mean if you go to PubMed and I'll go there in a minute you're gonna find tons of articles in your classroom I think I have in the additional resources section I think I have about 17 articles that I cited in in this presentation there's just a plethora of information and I'm really excited that this is coming out but right now they still don't have good recommendations for dosing and even if they did if you're getting the CBD over-the-counter you can't guarantee that you're actually getting that dosage of CBD in that formulation CBD does not have the psychogenic effects that THC does however THC has been found to be more effective at addressing certain issues over-the-counter CBD is non standardized so dosages even from the same manufacturer but in different Lots may have different potency CBD interacts with most medications so it's vital to consult a physician prior to using it the dosages like I said of CBD in the literature varied widely currently there are a couple of CBD based medications that are FDA approved for the treatment of seizure disorder finally remember that CBD oils may also have traces of THC generally not over 0.3% y'all know one of my favorite things is pubmed and I can never remember the long address for it you just type in pubmed cannabidiol and we'll just do an PTSD and i guess i stumped it because it took a long time you can go over here and you can shorten the window so you only see stuff from the last two years I always have free full text checked because I like to read the actual article not just the abstract and you can set additional filters like species I always have mine checked on humans because I'm not as interested in what it did to the rats but then all of these you can you can look at of somebody asked about cannabidiol and insomnia so let's see proof of concept there so then going with just the abstract that one hasn't been done yet they're talking about what they will do result 72 adults had primary concerns of anxiety and poor sleep anxiety scores decreased in 57 patients and sleep scores improved within the first month in 48 patients but fluctuated over time and CBD was well tolerated in all but three patients so theoretically this may be something that comes out as a newer intervention that is less harmful to the brain than Anna histamines and some of the barbiturates that are currently available for insomnia something to keep your eye on now all right let's look at let's look for that see if I can find anything on the FDA on CBD yeah yeah potential harm of CBD the FDA really doesn't like CBD they want to tell you about all the scary stuff so right now like I said in the research the dosage a lot of times wasn't even noted but other times it was there was a very wide spectrum of what they were offering for it no the research studies that we looked at or that I looked at did not talk about CBD isolate full-spectrum or broad spectrum we can look at those real quick let's see it appears all of those have THC removed but in the full spectrum and broad spectrum they have some of the other cannabinoids that exist in the marijuana plant in there and you know THC is the psychoactive one so if that's what a lot of the drug tests measure for but each one of the cannabinoids has its own independent properties and usefulness and things so I can see why some people would look for a broad spectrum CBD in order to get as much benefit an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as possible without the THC but you notice neither NIDA nor stomps I had anything about that on them what isn't interestingly it appears this article on the National Institute of drug abuse is quite positive about the potential promise of cannabidiol for therapeutic use so I'll put that in here for you guys to read in-depth let me answer your question Logan let's see yes I would say Logan the I mean anything with dextromethorphan that is being taken in addition to a CBD can't have a potentiation effect and the triple triple sees themselves or dextromethorphan alone can cause can in high enough doses can lead to serotonin syndrome so it is that is one of those things that can be really scary oops No oh hush here is a video I did do on serotonin syndrome if you're in Florida and you need medical error prevention you can get CEUs for it but if you don't care about that then you know just watch the video if you're interested in learning more about serotonin syndrome and what the symptoms are are there any other questions I've really enjoyed all your questions about CBD I am still learning about it obviously along with you guys but I was I really enjoyed going through the research and yes I saw somebody else commenting I'm not sure where you're seeing the ads at there shouldn't be any ads during the during the class but unfortunately Google is creepy aware of what you do I swear sometimes they just hear what I'm saying and I'm not even looking online and I start getting fed ads about it so you probably will start seeing some ads about CBD oil one thing you can do if you want to there are some free open-source ad blocker programs my husband has them on his computer because he really hates ads to no end but you can also install those if ads bother you I usually

Rachel Knox and this is my sister dr. Jessica Knox and we're two of four physicians in our family who make up the Knox docks and we are a team of physicians who specialize in cannabinoid medicine which is with a specialization in the endocannabinoid system so we do consider ourselves endocannabinoids i know that is a mouthful but we are here because we believe in the power of the endocannabinoid system to harness health and wellness and we focus on helping people achieve that using Kanab MO medic products like CBD so a lot of people wonder how can I best get the benefit from CBD when should I take it how should I take it how much should I take yeah a lot of it lots of questions about how to maximize benefit from it and part of that depends on what are you using it for so we actually really like CBD as part of your wellness routine and if that's why you're using CBD then really you can take it at any time of the day and whether that's morning noon night as long as it's something that's working into your routine so that it becomes part of that routine so you can benefit from it on a daily basis yeah and you know a good general serving size for wellness is around 20 to 50 milligrams of CBD the whole idea is to start at low doses and increase slowly over time I think another important thing to know is that CBD is lipophilic meeting it likes fats so it actually dissolves better and sort of more Libby's dinner yeah in a fat based product like in oil as opposed to an alcohol alcohol based product where it was sort of like clump it will clump and then you have to like really shake your your products really well to make sure you're getting CBD but if it's in an oil-based product it'll be distributed nicely in there and you can just sort of take that and feel confident that you're getting CBD in the serving size that you're using yeah so certainly there aren't any restrictions to taking CBD on an empty stomach or on a full stomach you can take it when it makes sense for you but keep in mind that that CBD like dr. Jessica said it's lipophilic it likes fat so if you consume it with fat you'll probably increase the bioavailability meaning the absorption into your body another really important thing to know about CBD is there is sort of like a maximum like point of benefit where we call it a biphasic effect where there's this curve and as you start at sort of like a low dose or low yeah serving and you add on you can get more benefit incremental benefit as you increase that serving size our dosage but there's a point at which beyond this little sweet spot if you keep adding more you're starting to lose the benefit you're going down this other side of the curve where it's just sort of like why why shoot pass this sweet spot because now you're sort of wasting resources and and your body's not getting any additional benefit from going over that serving size for some people we actually see that once they get past this sort of sweet spot there they're sort of losing some of the benefit and what that tells us is hey you need to back off on that serving size a little bit and go back to that sweet spot yeah and we we see that a lot less on our full spectrum fully extracted products and we see that effect a lot more on more isolate CBD products something else that we often don't talk about and you know users and patients don't quite ask enough is are there any drug drug interactions so for consumers or patients who are on a lot of pharmaceuticals we call that public pharmaceutical you do have to consider any CBD drug interactions so CBD is metabolized by the liver along with 25% of our pharmaceutical drugs that's hundreds of drugs and so for folks who might be might be consuming laundry lists of prescription drugs I actually really advise you to talk with a health care professional about using CBD and how much you use because CBD as an inhibitor of certain enzymes in the system that metabolized all of these drugs can cause an increase of the pharmaceutical drugs that we take so I can't stress it enough if you're on a lot of prescription drugs please please please talk to a health care provider about your CV to use yeah because you might need to adjust the dosage of some of those other medications very important yeah and I'm glad you said that because in our in our clinic we see patients on tons of pharmaceutical drugs and it's not that shouldn't take CBD it's exactly like you said we have to sort of adjust the doses of those prescription drugs while we're titrating up or dropping down that CBD dose we hope this information was helpful as you start to look at CBD products and start working them into your routine if you do have more questions drop them below we are looking forward to providing more information on these topics so we'll see you again in the future", "pG34NT3bw60": "what's up guys it's your girl a Paris here and as you can see by the title down below I'm gonna be telling you what cannabis oil has done to my dry brittle disgustingly cracky skin especially with Canadian weather we get like minus 13 degrees up in here it's super super cold and my dry skin is dry in the summer winter fall spring all season long but wintertime my skin is crazy crazy dry so I always look for new products that can help me add moisture back into my skin during these dry winter months so I've been using cannabis oil aka weed oil aka marijuana oil spread past two weeks now and I just want you guys I want to tell you guys all the dramatic changes that I've seen with my skin and before I even continue I am NOT sponsored by this brand I'm not getting paid to do this video this is all like I bought this product with my money nobody said this to me for free this is for real my dead ass feelings about cannabis oil and the benefits that it does for my super dry skin okay like anyone watching this if you think of dry skin you really don't you don't mean my dry skin is redonkulous okay my face be ashy for no reason and no warning no heads-up no nothing it's just dry it's dry and if your returning viewer of my beauty channel Slade parents this one right here you guys know that I rant and raved about how much I love this right here this is the Tony moly hundred hour cream and this stuff is amazing for my skin like I have no complaints about it but I feel like it works best when I'm going to bed because then when I wake up my skin still hasn't wish'd you're in it because it is a hundred hour cream so it's moisturizing my skin for a literally a hundred hours it feels like so I'm not knocking this whatsoever I just personally in my skin regimen I like to use this before I go to sleep and when I wake up sometimes if I forget to put it on before I go to bed now I love this stuff but it's a cream and I am NOT hugest is hugest a word I don't know I'm not a huge fan of face creams I tried this one out because well I bought it because it said maschino and it's like really cute packaging but I bought this one because I wanted it to like just sit on my vanity look cuter whatever and then one day I was like let me just try it and they loved it but normally I use face oils for everything because my skin is super dry and oil absorbs better into my skin rather than creams although like I said before this cream is amazing but I'm the type of girl that I like to try new things I get bored of products really easily I like to try new methods of things like if I have a cream I want to try the oil if I boil or try and miss like that's just who I am I like to mix things around until I find like something that I'm completely in love with and I want to repurchase for the rest of my life and I think I may have found it in this cannabis oil once again not sponsored I went to Sephora and I was looking through a bunch of cannabis oils that I thought would match my skin and this is the one that I just liked the most like the description of it was very appealing to my skin type because my skin type maybe even dry my skin type is action you know I mean and I said it adds moisture to your skin it has omega-3 fatty acids in it actually omega-3 six and nine fatty acids in it it's organic there's just a lot of beneficial ingredients in this product that made me feel like this is the one that I want to try rather than because there are a lot of other cannabis oils out there that do the same thing but this one just appeal to me a little bit more so I decided to pick this one up for around 48 to 60 dollars something like that and it is the before emerald cannabis sativa have deep moisture glow oil and as you guys can see I'm glowing it's not to believe that I have super dry skin I'm glowing hey so even though it's cannabis oil it's actually made from the hemp of cannabis which does not give you like a THC like you're not gonna get hot you ain't gonna put this on your face and be high as a kite you ain't gonna feel no type of psychedelic effect this is purely the beneficial ingredients for your skin from cannabis that is in this bottle here it's in a beautiful green color as you can see here have to do this because anyone who uses face oils often knows that this is important because if I do this and it's not moving as fast as this is and it's going a little bit slow and muggy that means that it's gonna take forever to absorb in your skin you know what I'm saying it's like a thick consistency you don't like it that's well me anyways firstly I don't like thick consistencies when it comes to well it has to move like water when it moves like water you just know that it's gonna absorb to your skin really quickly so it comes with this dropper applicator and let me just show you really quickly gonna do three drops I want to show you guys how quickly this absorbs into your skin first of all look at it drip look at that it's like water again my face oil lovers understand why I have to show that but if I rub it in for you guys you're gonna see how quickly it absorbs into my skin look at that quick and it's not sticky at all there's no type of stickiness whatsoever it's literally fast absorbing and leaves your skin looking like silk let's do a comparison of this dry ass hand and the ones that I just put the whale on oiled hand regular hand do you guys see that now you know camera trick guys realized look at that crazy and I know a lot of people are curious about the smell it doesn't smell like weed it smells very um fresh it's very smells like lavender almost like it's a very fresh floral scent and the instructions actually tells you to breathe heavily in to help you relax and I truly believe that when I put this oil on and I breathe in I feel like a very relaxing feeling throughout my body not like I'm high but like I'm at a spa and I'm breathing in incense or something it's just a very relaxing calming feeling it's really really nice it feels luxurious and for the money and the way it makes my skin look it's worth it's worth every penny so after using this oil for the past two weeks I have to say I will never go to another face oil ever for the rest of my life and I know I've only been using it for two weeks but within two weeks I can always tell if I like a product because normally if I try a skin product and I've never tried it before I will break out within the next 48 hours I haven't broken out my skin is gleaming it's an amazing base for your makeup before your primer I use this as my moisturizer before my primer it's amazing my skin complexion has been so much more clear and it's like every day that I use it as I wake up I see my skin getting so much more healthier and I haven't changed anything in my skin routine except for this so this is the answer this is the reason why my skin is gleaming the way it's gleaming glowing the way it's glowing look in the way it's looking you know I'm saying I just have to share it with you guys and let you guys know how amazing this product is again not sponsored so you can pick this up at Sephora or you can pick it up at the herbivore website as well I believe fun fact I wanted to bring this to New York with me but I was scared that I was gonna get in trouble cuz it said cannabis sativa on it but I don't think I would have back trouble but yeah the pros of this product is it is not sticky whatsoever it's quickly absorbed into your skin it definitely moisturizes your skin for hours on end it has a relaxing soothing scent to it that really like makes you just feel very calm it has evened out my skin tone you get a good amount of product for the amount of money that you pay and you literally look like you're glowing hello the cons about this product I honestly cannot find not even one corner whatsoever I was sitting here I was thinking I was trying to like figure out what could I possibly say because there has to be something wrong with the product nothing the scent is amazing the dropper is amazing the size is perfect like everything is great I have nothing bad to say about this product whatsoever so if you have super dry brittle skin I would definitely recommend you try out the herbivore emerald cannabis teeth I have deep moisture glow oil at your local Sephora you could always go to Sephora just in case you guys didn't know you could always go to Sephora and ask them for a sample of this they'll give it to you in a little container try it out for about three days you're gonna see a huge difference and you're definitely gonna want to buy the full bottle of this because I'm not going back to anything else anything else this stuff is absolutely amazing so in two weeks cannabis oil has definitely restored my skin's moisture made a my skin complexion way more even and has me glow into the dog okay we've kind of navalore let me know if you'd ever tried cannabis oil on your skin let me know what kind of skin type you have let me know if you've even heard of this product or even knew that you could put cannabis oil on your skin if you have dry skin everybody sure works for like combination skin as well I wouldn't recommend for oily although you do need oil for oily skin I feel like this has a little bit too much too many oils are in this they have omega fatty acids they have a whole bunch of different whales than they I feel like there's too much oil in this for someone with Whaley skin what combination you should be okay so definitely check out the spore website to see if this matches your skin type let me know in the comment section down below but make sure you find me on Saturn in Israel all that doesn't description box down below for your convenience thank you guys so much for watch this video I'll see you in the next one poodels", "_knJDER3PkE": "True or false. CBD is the same as marijuana. [Rachel} That's Correct.\nIt's false, Yes. Cannabis is the genus of a plant it's the category of plant. Under cannabis you have marijuana and hemp plants. Okay? The difference, they look the same by the way they smell the same. Right. But the difference between these two plants is the amount of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol now this is the active ingredient in marijuana that's what is the psychoactive ingredient. But you typically know when you think of marijuana you think that people are getting high that's the psychoactive ingredient. The difference is that if a plant has 0.3% or less by dry weight, it is considered to be hemp plant. Correct. If it has more than 0.3% by dry weight it is considered to be marijuana. So that's, right away, the definition. CBD is a cannabinoid. There are lots of cannabinoids that have a lot of active properties in our body. Our body produces endo-cannabinoids which are naturally occurring. Here on the screen you see two different things. To the left is THC. These have the same number of atoms. The same type of atoms, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But, the reason why we highlighted this structure is different. And this is what makes the big difference between THC which is psychoactive and CBD, which is not psychoactive. When the chemical binds to the receptor that structural difference will make something happen different in the body. Right. So that is the difference between THC and CBD. And CBD. Very important, okay? CBD, if it is taken exclusively solely from the hemp plant, it is legal. It is allowed in all 50 states. However, if the CBD is taken from the marijuana plant or it's partially taken from the marijuana plant it depends on the state. As to whether or not they allow it to be legal. As to whether or not it's legal, right. CBD comes in all types of products. When you go to the store, you're gonna see it in all different ways. And I want to kind of guide you through how to choose what you want. Here are some examples of things that you might find. And there are more than this, by the way. But this is a bath powder. So people put these into their bath they dissolve it into their bath.\nI've actually never seen it in bath powder. But I think that that makes sense.\nYeah. Because people soak to relieve pain and inflammation as well.\n100% Right. So it gets into your skin and it give you that soft tissue relief that you're looking for. Lots of lotions out there. So you go to a lot of these beauty stores and cosmetic stores, they have it in the lotions or some of the pharmacies.\nI use a balm. It's like a very thick.\nRight. Dense balm. That's right, so it's thick sometimes, like a salve or it's like a nice thin lotions so they're all different types depending on what you want to get out of it. There are capsules that you can take. Yup. Then you mentioned earlier for Isabu they're tinctures. You have the little dropper and it tells you how much to take and you put on your tongue, boom that's it. And then, this is what I wanted to talk to you about. A pain rub. So this is a freeze right here. This is not about the CBD, by the way that is a primary ingredient but it's about other components. So, the question is, you need to be able to get the CBD and the pain relief chemical into your skin. Right. So it depends on else the manufacturer puts in there to help it seep into the skin. The first thing, is you want to be very clear that it actually says CBD. CBD.\nPeriod. Because, that's right. CBD, it's gotta say that, number one. Number two. So you want to look to see what it says about THC. THC free.\nThis is THC free, very good. The other thing is, you want to make sure it tells you what type of CBD it is. This is very important, pay attention. So here, it says pure isolate. What that means is that the product is 99.9% CBD. It's as pure as you can get it. So it doesn't have any THC. But there's also something called broad spectrum. Broad spectrum means that not only does it have CBD, it has the other cannabinoids I mentioned before. Right. Other good chemicals for you. It's broad spectrum. And lastly, there's something that's called full spectrum. This is where you have to pay attention. Full spectrum means it actually has THC. Okay? So, when you see isolate, that's pure CBD. When you see broad spectrum it's other cannabinoids but still no THC. When you see full spectrum It includes the THC.\nIt includes the THC. Please look at the ingredient list. Because you want to know actually what's in there. So make sure you do that. And lastly, make sure it tells you how many milligrams are on here. Right?\nAnd that's where you get that huge price discrepancy. Ah, there you go.\nThat's right. There you go. So, if the price looks too good to be true. It is.\nIt is. (laughs)\nIt ain't true. Because CBD cost money and so if you want high quality I'm not saying you have to break the bank on it. And it's buyer beware. Yes.\nLike, you really do have to study up on this. You can't just dive in. Please. And the last thing I want to say. (crowd claps) The last thing I want to say is this. A lot of these products have a QR code on it. And you can take your phone and put it up and look at the certificate of analysis. Make sure that the product has been third party tested. Which means they've sent it out to a third party lab to test to make sure it has what is says it has and doesn't have, which you don't want. That's so true of every supplement and vitamin. (crowd cheers) (crowd claps) (bells chime)", "kptr6yrH37E": "hi friends I'm Whitney welcome back to another episode of the sitch today we're talking about CBD who knew that's something I thought I had the left behind in my wild college days would become so popular in the health and fitness world Oh what it's not the same thing as never mind cv d stands for cannabidiol which is one of the two major compounds found in the marijuana plant unlike THC though CBD doesn't produce a euphoric high and it was legalized as a supplement in 2018 under the farm bill however CBD regulation is a little murky and foods and beverages containing CBD are still technically illegal in some states CBD belongs to a class of compounds known as cannabinoids there are a hundred and twenty of them and they exist in many plants not just cannabis this non-intoxicating compound has become majorly popular in the past year or so and it can be found in everything from sunscreen to cocktails to coffee I took like ten shots of espresso today but I'm totally joking service DVD in it some of the more outstanding CBD claims include that it can help fix leaky gut syndrome can be used to treat multiple cirrhosis and can cure cancer as there are no human studies supporting those assertions we're gonna move right along to the more plausible and clinically tested claims about CBD as always remember I stick to clinical research that means it was performed on humans animal studies don't rise to the level of evidence-based practice first off there's solid research supporting the use of CBD for at least one condition intractable epilepsy a condition where drugs are ineffective one study showed a 42% reduction in seizure frequency and children and adults taking twenty milligrams of CBD per kilogram of body weight per day for 28 days in fact CBD is the key ingredient in the only cannabis based drug approved by the FDA at the dialects many studies have also looked at the effects of CBD on neurocognitive disorders such as anxiety and depression in one small study on adults with social anxiety disorder a single 600 milligram dose of CBD reduced anxiety and cognitive impairment on a simulated public speaking test in another study a single 300 milligram dose of CBD also reduce symptoms of anxiety during public speaking but not a 100 or 900 milligram dose suggesting that too much or too little effect CBDs efficacy against anxiety several studies have also shown that CBD may possess antipsychotic properties in one study CBD was as effective at reducing psychotic symptoms as the most commonly prescribed drug used to treat schizophrenia another common claim about CBD is that it has the ability to reduce pain whether due to diseases like cancer and arthritis or under normal conditions like post exercise muscle soreness unfortunately according to a recent review of eleven systematic reviews and observational studies there's insufficient evidence to suggest that CBD is effective at reducing pain related to cancer or GI and rheumatic conditions and only limited evidence to suggest efficacy for neuropathic pain studies have shown that while cannabinoids may increase one's pain threshold they don't decrease pain intensity another understandably believable claim that I've heard about CBD is that it can help improve sleep now I have a lot of trouble sleeping so I wish this were true but unfortunately research doesn't entirely support this claim some studies show that CBD has a mildly stimulating effect other research indicates that the dose determines the effect and suggests that while low-dose CBD promotes arousal high dose CBD may increase total sleep time and decrease the number of nighttime wake up's more research in this area is clearly needed so now let's talk about safety a World Health Organization report found that CBD is safe and non addictive up to 1500 milligrams per day has been shown to be well tolerated but it's not without potential side effects some studies have noted nausea vomiting dry mouth decreased appetite and diarrhea and CBD users drug interactions may also be concerned as CBD can behave like grapefruit and may increase the amount of certain drugs in the bloodstream talk to your doctor if you're taking any medications before trying CBD I found like an infomercial now don't I finally because CBD is an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you're getting one study showed that out of 84 CBD supplements 68 percent contained a different amount of CBD than was listed on the label and 21 percent contained detectable levels of THC the psychoactive component marijuana's now this is especially important to consider for athletes as THC is a prohibited substance and consuming it violates anti-doping rules CBD has not been tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women or children and therefore should not be used by these groups and that's this edge what do you think about CBD have you tried it would you try it now after learning more about it let me know your thoughts in the comments below and if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel for more evidence-based nutrition information and healthy plant-based recipes I'm Whitney thanks so much for watching", "3H3u7vwoszM": "hi welcome back to reveal cannabis today we're going to talk about how to make our cannabis oil which we made last week on the video link that down below we're gonna talk about how to make this into an awesome healing hopefully pain relieving salve so or a cream or a balm it's super easy to do at home and I'm going to show you how to do it right now my name is Andrea I'm a cannabis wellness coach for moms I help moms who are really struggling with just how tough life can be sometimes after you have kids and you had no idea it was gonna be that rough and you know that there's a better life but you're not like entirely sure how to get there that's where I come in I help you use cannabis exactly the way that you need to for your day in your life and I walk you through a bunch of other wellness practices that you can implement so that when you graduate my program you're living a much much better life than you are now that's the point so if that sounds like it would float your boat reach out to me at Rubio cannabis calm alright so I didn't talk about what we need today so first of all we have our half cup of cannabis oil that we did last time you can see that it's not liquid it's our live in Canada and it's cold here already so it solidifies so 1/2 a cup of your infused oil and then these are the basics you can go nuts on scythes and add like a whole bunch of different oils and combinations of things I went to my cannabis coach colleague who is the bomb making this stuff I he doesn't like 9,000 times a day and then we also have somebody in our group who makes this stuff for a living so I asked them how to do it like this most simple and easy way to say you and me all the googling so here we go this is cacao butter or cocoa butter I think people say it both ways it's basically the oil that they get from the cocoa bean and it feels amazing I was just playing around with that this is beeswax and this is shea butter so you can get those just out of your local health food store I'm sure amazon also sells them you're also need a tablespoon or if you're fancy then I prefer to use a scale because it's really actually hard to get a table actually gonna add it to my income I stopped today because this is for somebody else and I don't know if you want to smell like peppermint but you can add all those oils as well and then you're gonna need a double boiler or I think I'm just gonna do it right in here so I'm gonna get set up in the kitchen and we'll see you there all right so we're ready to go I have my infused oil the coconut oil that I just warmed up in the microwave I'm just gonna try to infuse it right in here but it's not gonna work and then I've created a double boiler here so that just means that you have a little bit of water in the bottom so that it reaches the bottom of the second pan and you put the second pin in and then pour your ingredients in and the reason that we do a double boiler is so that you don't you don't want to burn your oil you don't wanna get your oil to the point where it's smoking because that's bad so I'm just gonna add in my infuse my cannabis infused oil and then I ended up really having to shave the beeswax because it was so hard so this is beeswax here on top and then the shea butter and the cocoa butter the cacao butter so you put this all together this takes a little while you want to put it over like don't put a rolling boil on it or anything and when this all combines together then you're done so I'm gonna let this melt away and I'll show you what it's like at the end and just so you know I'll have all the instructions for this as well in a link down below not sure if I remember to tell you but there's an ounce or two tablespoons of each of the three other ingredients that we added in here so but that links down below so make sure you grab that so that you don't need to watch the video every time you want to make this okay so everything has melted all together you can see that the liquid like you can see through the liquid now so I'm just gonna pour it back into my mason jar I happen to have one of these for canning which makes this a whole bunch easier there we go this takes about a half an hour to set up so obviously we wait because it's gonna be quite warm and then you can apply this topically which means apply it to your skin so if you had sore hands or a sore back or sore knees this would be perfect for it there's absolutely no way for the THC in here to get you high at all so there's no worry about that and because this is a one-to-one straight it has CBD and THC in it then it will help with pain on both friends and inflammation so yeah this is gonna set up and I'm gonna send it off to the client and see what he thinks and we'll go from there thanks so much for watching this week's video I post new videos every Saturday I'd love if you subscribed and hit like if you liked it and if there's anything else that you would like to learn about please let me know and I just wanted to show you the final product it's quite creamy as you can see and when you wrap it on it takes a little bit to rub into your skin but it feels fantastic because of all the great additives that we added into it and then it absorbs quite well so I'm excited to pass this on to my client and see if it will help with his back pain if you have any questions please just reach out and I can answer them in the chat Thanks", "VfLW9TnHTRc": "hi everybody it's broken Sierra here love happy Monday it is a gorgeous day it's very nice I had lunch and chatted all about what we're talking about today which is topicals but anyway I hope you guys get a chance to outside and enjoy this lovely day and we are going to dive into our recipe that we made today but first we're gonna talk about obviously the skin which is like goes hand in hand with topicals the skin is so important because it is the largest organ of our body so clearly it's important yes and it's important to take care of your skin but it's interesting because our skin is a huge indicator of what is going on internally yes it is so Brooke tell me about what inspired you to make your own balm so as you guys know we do carry a mary's medicinal freeze which is a nice topical and we have our great synergy balm which is awesome I actually broke my foot and I use this around my foot it got great relief from it yeah it's really really nice so one thing that I noticed is that these are our Mary's medicinal CBD and our synergy really relief is a one to one THC CBD I was looking for something that was strictly THC so a high THC bomb so I took it into my own hands to take one of the grassroot RSO syringes and recreate my own bomb so that's what I did oh creative but we thought we would talk about this because we used products that we have here yes to make something that's a little bit more customized you used essential oils used coconut oil the only thing that we don't have which we were talking about you can just get at Whole Foods is beeswax yes and there's no difference between whether you get the pellet fees wax or the chunks of beeswax so either one so let's show the final product tell us how you so I'm give a smell it smells so good I did any tree oil tree yeah cuz so one reason that my bomb is strictly well not strictly but mainly made out of coconut oil and tea tree oil is for its antifungal properties so I suffer from Candida I get it on my back and I get it but it normally flare up in the spring but it's never really something that's to astronomical but I did just have a birthday and went on a sugar overload ship curry whenever a sugar overlays like me for a day weekend it was so fabulous yeah this is one I haven't used yet so you guys it's amazing this won't ruin your clothes no it doesn't ruin my sheets I put it on after the shower or before bed and it doesn't ruin my pajamas doesn't get on my sheets it absorbs really really nicely into the skin so it's because of sort of like how you made it you make sure that it emulsifies properly yeah let it cool yes okay so tell us like step by step so you combined half well this all kind of comes out to half a cup is what you were saying yeah so I feel like it came out to a total all my oils mixed together came out to a half a cup so I did about 1/3 a cup of coconut oil if you have a problem with coconut oil you can always do olive oil or avocado oil we do but we have in the dispensary which is fabulous so I did that I did an ounce of tea tree oil not only for the scent but I also an regime one oh yes I really wanted the antifungal from the tea tree oil so some of the tea tree or I'm sorry some of these scented oils that we have here in the shop are the blood orange the lavender and the peppermint these ones are great for mood boosting and to reduce anxiety so these are fabulous so it depends on what you need like yeah I have to make they don't have to make there's a tea tree nope if you prefer a certain scent if you want to use this before bedtime because we know lavender is a great one to help relax yeah then throw some lavender in there exactly so what's great about this is I had my oils I took everything I did a double boil put everything in there I had my total one ml syringe I did an ounce which is I think half a bottle of one of these guys of my essential oil right and then I did my coconut oil once that all emulsified and became one or I'm sorry that all became one pretty easily because it's all a waste I started to add my beeswax so slowly right yeah do all at one out all at once because you want it to slowly emulsify and become one so beeswax normally it's a one-to-one ratio so if you have a cup of all your oil concoction and then an ounce of beeswax what I had done was because I wanted mine to be more of a balm than like a petroleum jelly right I did double the amount of beeswax so I did two ounces of beeswax for my no no I did one else beeswax for my half a cup of mixture so you can see it's super nice it comes out really nice and it's like a true bomb and it just rubs on nice and there is no psychoactive reaction to this is strictly a topical it's a non edible you put your essential oil in it's it smells really nice and you feel it's not sticky it's just like I love it so it's super simple did it home nice little DIY but along with that yes we're still doing our accessory sales so we're just saying if you don't want to do this process you can really make a tincture in your levo with some clues flour and just make sure to add some essential oils because it's not going to be an ingestible tincture really right so you wouldn't miss for a topic Lori yep you would get your oil all out of this it would take make it a lot easier you're gonna have to DIY everything once your oil comes out you would add yours oh you would add your fees wax find the consistency that you like right let it cool I let this cool for two hours for this guy because it wasn't full all the way but this one I gave a solid sex just to cool all the way before I started using it and I just stored it in the bathroom it's cool Oh dark and yeah it's really good it's really great for Sienna so so this is good for and Brooke talked about how she suffers with Candida but bug bites well yeah but mosquito bites this time higher because you both are those yeah people we are those people here are those people the bugs love us so that's you know obviously uncomfortable you're inflamed when you want to keep eating this will help cool and soothe and reduce that inflammation but eczema athletes yes yes any of those topical you know like dermatitis conditions and I was gonna say that I've been using my balm for a week now and my breakouts on my back have significantly reduced in redness and size and I'm gonna give it a month and see how much balm I have left and see my spots so and keep us posted yeah and those are those Omega six is reacting to the inflammation in my body which is coming out through the skinny it's amazing yeah anything

getting 600 milligrams of cbd that's actually great let's take a peek peek at the gram breakdown there is 57 grams in this 2 ounce bottle about 12 grams of cbd per gram a gram is about a milliliter and i see your eyes glazing over you american this little bottle here 57 squeezes that's what you need to know so you get 57 squeezes of 12 milligrams of cbd out of this it's not bad it's potent it's full spectrum but the trace levels of other cannabinoids are pretty low i'm uh i'm not sure if the 0.3 milligrams of thc per little gram serving if that's a serving will have any effect it may help the cbd a bit because thc is considered powerful however cbd absorbs 10 times better into the skin than thc so don't expect too much out of the thc according to one research paper or study you don't need to worry about thc and drug tests here because thc does not pass the skin into the blood according to current research but look it up because uh i'm uh just your cbd guinea pig and i'm not your doctor or your probation officer as always i talk about the lab results and not my individual reactions to the product which can be misleading everyone has a different reaction to cbd due to your individual and the cannabinoid system your health conditions so look at the cannabinoid levels and remember those when you find a product that works for you for me this works as well as a cbd cream with the 12 milligrams of cbd per gram but you really need to try cbd lotion yourself to know if it works for you or for whatever you're using it for i do use it for muscle recovery okay the cost here's what i like 4.5 cents which is great mini lotions are priced way too high 10 cents is now about average for tinctures you know the ones the drops you put in your mouth per milligram of cbd that is so this at 4.5 cents for the cream is cheap i don't know why cream is cheaper than the tinctures you put in your mouth but it seems to be here the smell oh damn it all over my beard the smell it's got a bunch of ingredients but it is unscented the one thing about all these ingredients here they are considered safe for use in cosmetics but there are a few safety concerns especially if you look at those uh food babe type of blogs these will kill you if you look at those rest you get a respiratory toxin irritant environmental toxin i'm sure these are all considered uh toxins in very large quantities and safe uh what they use it here they're common when i was a firefighter i once worked a wildland fire all night no respirator it turned out to be a meth dump in the morning when we could see among other things that i will not mention here because i am a gentleman yet i wasn't very concerned but uh if that would concern you and you subscribe to food babe type of blogs maybe you won't like this product maybe i should care more or be more concerned about these ingredients you're right but they're all common ingredients not that that's a good thing okay back to the smell it is a full spectrum and has a very light smell of hemp maybe something else in it it has uh the clean smell of cream i can't say which of those ingredients makes it so maybe it's that good old peg 100 steroid the sweet smell of environmental toxins i like that but it smells like a lotion i know i'm very specific on that lotion smell the hemp smell is not too strong it dies down after a minute or two of putting it on and after about 10 minutes it's hard to smell anything at all which is good if you like going out in public and not smelling like hem i've uh tried some potent hemp creams that are really nasty and they stay nasty for a long time but i don't want to get it twisted with this natural hem it has a little bit of that as light as it is doesn't really smell good it smells okay it smells good for what it is but hemp doesn't really smell good they also make a cream in minted lavender i bet that one actually smells really good based on their tinctures and gummies which taste exceptional the look veritas farms does a great job of packaging and branding it looks very professional the color here let me put a little on my skin again i got a bunch color is a little brown somewhere in between cream color and the color of my beautiful palm color maybe slightly dirty cream and you can uh you can smell it a bit when you put it on now overall it's good the the price is great it's trustworthy the company is trustworthy if you don't like the smell of hemp well you avoid this and maybe buy their minted lavender cream or really avoid full spectrum hemp products most of them and go with a pure cbd cbd isolate because pure cbd itself has no smell so those pure cbd ones can smell great also maybe you won't like this if you read every ingredient in your cosmetics personally i don't i use old spice deodorant which i'm sure will kill me before this product will and i say that without even knowing what's in my old spice because i didn't read the ingredients that and when i used to hang out in meth fields as a firefighter of course disclaimer this is not medical advice this is a good unscented full spectrum cbd at an excellent price see you next time hit that subscribe and notification bell because i've got more coming and you need to know if you're getting fake cbd or real cbd or what it smells like see you next time", "NfEOumo2q5g": "well we've shown you how CBD or hemp oil is changing the lives of children with epilepsy now channel twos Tom Riggins discovered how this non-intoxicating chemical from the marijuana plant is being hailed as a miracle for dogs this is six year old Cosmo he's been taking hemp derived CBD oil once a day to help him with his arthritis and anxiety and new groundbreaking research reveals it can also treat brain disorders and dogs and potentially save their lives few things are more heart-wrenching than watching a beloved dog gripped by a seizure most pass quickly without lasting harm but multiple seizures in a short period of time can damage a dog's brain Alexa Ram Ford told me her dog jigsaw has suffered seizures for two years he will fall over on his side and start convulsing is a very violent thing that they go through about five percent of dogs have epilepsy it's usually an inherited condition but the exact cause is unknown left untreated it can limit a dog's life even cause death they will either be euthanized early because of the seizures or because of the medication side effects I traveled to Colorado State University to meet with dr. Stephanie McGrath she's doing a groundbreaking study to assess the use of cannabis oil or CBD for dogs with epilepsy for many years now people have used CBD in Colorado a state where recreational marijuana use is legal people were using it for themselves for you know their their various different ailments and so they felt that potentially it would be something that they could use with their dog dr. McGrath launched her CBD pilot study was 16 dogs nine of the dogs were given CBD which has a trace amount of THC the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana the results were remarkable about 90 percent of the dogs in the treatment group had a reduction in seizure activity as compared to 43 percent in the control group like humans CBD works on brain receptors and dogs it's somehow alters brain chemistry to reduce the chance of a seizure but exactly how and why it works remains a mystery there's some theories but we don't know how it works but Alexa knows it's helped jigsaw he's now part of a larger study of cbdu sundogs with epilepsy he hasn't had a seizure for a month and a half that's a record for him back here in Atlanta Chelsey Murch has done her own research of CBD with her dog Piper she's been giving her edibles for severe anxiety and it's doing the trick the 4th of July she can deal with the fireworks now the thunderstorms she sleeps through I can take her to a dog park

"W-zK3B5Vi-w": "[Music] today I'm going to show you a 12 awesome different ways that you can use DVD small [Music] if you're like me and you work at a desk or you're out and about on your feet for a lot of the day tend to store a lot of tension in your neck your shoulder it can get really irritated if this is a case for you one thing you can do is take a little bit of the bomb comes off really lightly onto your finger tip and just rub onto the sore area give yourself rub it in you know as well as you can give yourself a nice little massage within a couple minutes you should start to feel some relief another thing you can do with the CBD balm is if you or a loved one is able to kind of give yourself full-body massage or you know maybe you your back irritates you a lot and you can get somebody to give you a massage or you see a massage therapist add a little bit of this bomb into the oil that you're using to do the massage I tend to do this actually with my legs after a hard day's work if I've been on my feet or if I've done exercise and overdone it a little bit too much just working like maybe a dime to a quarter-sized amount of that into your hand along with any type of massage oil is just really going to enhance the benefits of you know soothing and comforting your tired sore muscle so that's another great way to use it a lot of folks that come in and see us here at the store have a lot of foot peds whether it's just age wear and tear if you've had an injury in your foot a lot of times that can be very irritating and disruptive to your daily life because everyone uses their feet you know most of us walk and are bearing all of our weight on our feet and so the soreness of that can really become unbearable to some folks so at the end of the day I suggest taking about a dime to a quarter-sized amount of the CBD balm and just giving yourself a nice foot massage rubbing and concentrating on the areas that really need the attention and some you know relief from that discomfort another really great way to use CBD oil fall if you're like me year-round you have dry lips it's crazy but it's something that I always struggle with it's worse in wintertime and when the weather is colder but cvd balm is a great way to moisten your lips Phoebe is full of great omega-3 fatty acids so it's a wonderful oil that is really going to heal and feel chapped lips it's as easy as just taking it to your finger like you would any other type of you know moist lip moisturizer [Music] it actually smells minty fresh and really I think gives as much of a nice glossy glow to your lip as a cosmetic product with a high-end cosmetic product so this is another great way to use CBD oil now if you're headed outside into some really cold weather or you're stuck inside with the heat on you might be noticing that the air is really really dry and that can become super irritating to your sinuses one thing I suggest with the CBD oil balm is to simply take a small amount of it in your finger and rub just underneath your nasal passage this way when you're breathing in the air has a chance to hit the oil and go up into your nasal cavity so if your nasal passages are even more dry and you need some more therapeutic effect on the CBD oil another thing you can do is actually use a cotton swab to scoop up just a small amount less than a pea-sized amount I would say pea-sized at most this is gonna seem kind of gross to you but really it's well worth it if the inside of your nose is really dried out and irritated and discomfort you're experiencing a lot of discomfort you're going to want to try this yes I am totally picking my nose on down but it seriously feels so good after you're able to moisten the inside of your nose definitely throw this cotton swab out when you're done is you don't want to be spreading all those nice germs but doing this is really going to give you a lot of relief and there's another great way to ensure that all the air that you're breathing is really moisturized and beneficial for you if you're in the kitchen a lot and your clock sometimes burns happen well fortunately or unfortunately I don't have any fresh burns to show you here today but I've never heard of an old one that's been lingering on my hands here from a hot pan I was cooking with a couple of weeks ago one great use for CBD oil is actually after this burn happens apply directly to the area very gently you don't want to use this on any exposed skin so skin that's been broken leading anything like that you don't want to use on exposed skin but for any other skin especially burns this works so wonderfully because the omega-3 oils in here are so beneficial at really healing your skin and it feels so good using our hands on the keyboard all day long can result in a lot of discomfort and our fingertips of stiffness sometimes even swelling you may have seen a doctor about this and told you you had a type of condition that we're all pretty familiar with but if the discomfort is really getting to you you may want to consider keeping a bottle of the CBD balm at your desk and just taking a bit of that you can combine it with a hand cream that you may have or a hand oil of some sort or you simply on its own and you just want to apply to the area's focusing on especially we join and areas of discomfort and basically work it into your whole hand as you would a hand cream and let it sit for just a few moments so that the oils have a chance to soak in before you go and use your hands again I promise you you will feel some type of relief from this discomfort most of us at some point in our lives or we may know somebody has suffered from acne and I'm talking about big cystic painful acne those giant bumps that come out out of nowhere and believe me they're not just teenagers that get them it can be really painful and sometimes we can even feel them coming up out of there out of our skin before they even start revealing themselves if that's the case like combat this with CBD oil CBD oil is naturally anti-inflammatory the cystic acne is inflammatory in nature so you want to fight that with good fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids and CBD oil is so rich in them it just takes a tiny little bit of the bomb and you want to just apply directly to the areas on your face that are breaking out and then try this at night when you wake up the next day see what happens so many of us also suffer from migraine settings or just tension headaches these are really common at the end of a long day especially if you've been staring at a screen of some sort your computer a lot of times we feel the tension at our temples over here what you want to do is take just a bit of the CBD balm it doesn't take much and rub into your temple it goes on really nicely it does not feel overly greasy and it will absorb very easily if you just focus inward and use a few minutes of your time to concentrate on addressing the discomfort you can massage the oil in wherever it is on your face even in your scalp if it goes into your scalp that's perfectly fine to get this into where your hair is you may also know somebody that suffers from skin rashes Gailey itchy dry skin again they may have seen a doctor for this condition and that's great to be under a doctor's care but something you can do very easily for yourself if you use some CBD oil directly on those areas of irritation on your skin again as long as there's no exposed skin or you know bleeding areas cuts you don't want to apply the CBD to those areas but others extremely dry itchy scaly flaking skin the CBD oil is incredibly moisturizing and beneficial for skin it's just a matter of rubbing it into the area that's affected last but certainly not least if you or someone you know experiences joint discomfort CBD oil is great for taking or relieving some of that discomfort you want to focus on the areas that you're experiencing this elbows knees knuckles and just give it a good rub in sometimes you know you can benefit from a little bit of massage in that area to really make sure the oil is kind of treating the skin and absorbing and just give it a few moments let it absorb see how you feel okay I just do that again I'm feeling very good now I'm covered in CVD we could do the helical little thing I do", "red1M6CV614": "[background music] Cody: Hey, ya'll, it's Cody from Sleepopolis. Today, we're taking a look at the 2500 milligram\nCBD oil from American Hemp. The Internet's been buzzing about CBD's positive\nhealth benefits for years now. I was curious? Could it improve my sleep? To find out, I tested American Hemp's oil\nfor two weeks. Ya'll, I thought I knew what it was going\nto feel like, but I was genuinely surprised by the results. Curious to know what they are? Well, then you'd better keep watching. [background music] Cody: American Hemp was founded in 2016 by\na group of CBD enthusiasts who wanted to share the benefits of cannabidiol with the world. Nowadays, the Florida-based company sells\na ton of different CBD products including oils, creams, gel capsules, and even CBD oil\nfor pets. Since I work for a sleep website, I asked\nthe folks at American Hemp to hook me up with the product they thought would lull me to\nsleep the fastest, which is why they hooked me up with the 2500 milligram CBD oil. First things first, what the [beep] is CBD? Well, CBD or cannabidiol is one of 100 different\ncompounds of phytocannabinoids contained within the flower of the cannabis plant, the most\npopular of which is tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Unlike its trippy-dippy sister THC, CBD is\nnot psychoactive. I repeat, CBD does not trigger hallucinations,\nintoxication, or any other stereotypically stony side-effects. Instead, CBD is often contained in oils, creams,\nand lotions to treat everything from joint pain to anxiety, loss of appetite -- and yes,\neven poor sleep. I should also mention that hemp-derived CBD\nis totally legal to buy and consume in all 50 states. Though the studies done into the side-effects\nof CBD are scarce, the research that does exist supports it as a totally safe and well-tolerated\ncompound. A comprehensive study from 2010, which aggregated\ndata from numerous studies, found CBD to be non-toxic and safe up to doses of 1500 milligrams\nper day. A 2017 study, which sought to add information\nto that survey, further found that CBD was not only safe for chronic long-term use, but\nactually had a better side effect profile than other drugs when treating certain medical\nconditions, such as epilepsy and psychotic disorders. American Hemp uses 100 percent natural CBD\nderived from industrial hemp to create its oil. I should also add that all of its products\nare third-party tested, which means that scientists unaffiliated with American Hemp have approved\nthe products for sale and consumption. Now that I've gone over the brand and dug\ninto the ingredients, it's time to talk about my experience with this product. The 2500 milligram CBD oil from American Hemp\nis the brand's highest quality oil and it retails for $140. According to the company, one dropper of this\noil contains about 15 drops or 83 milligrams of active CBD. To use, all you have to do is place the drops\nunder your tongue, hold for 15 seconds, and then swallow. [background music] Cody: If you're familiar with CBD, the number\n83 may have stuck out to you because that is a really high dosage of CBD. Most CBD products on the market, be it gummies\nor cream, usually have between 20 to 40 milligrams per serving. This is a really high dosage. Remember, that if you're less tolerant, or\njust trying CBD out for the first time, you can take half a dropper, or you can take a\nquarter dropper. You don't have to take the full thing. In fact, I encourage you to experiment around\nto find the dosage that's going to right for you. I'm 6 feet tall, 165 pounds and already pretty\nfamiliar with CBD. I went ahead and took the entire dropper each\nnight for two weeks before bed. When I talk about my experience, I'm going\nto break it down into three sections -- falling asleep, staying asleep and the morning after. Before I get into that, I do have one last\nthing to say, which is though my pronunciation of tetrahydrocannabinol [ring sound] is flawless,\nI'm not a doctor. All my thoughts are personal and specific\nto me, and may differ from your own experiences. That being said, if you're trying out CBD\nfor the first time or just looking for a new sleep regime, I highly recommend that you\nconsult with a medical professional before you do so. Let's get into my experience starting with\nwhat it felt like to fall asleep using the American Hemp CBD oil. Falling asleep is a huge problem for me, because\nas soon as my head hits the pillow my mind is racing with a ton of competing thoughts. Whenever, I'm looking at sleep supplements,\nor CBD oil, a really important factor for me is how well does it quiet those thoughts\nand allow me to fall asleep. I've got to say that this oil was fantastic\nat helping me to fall asleep. When I took the drops, I took it as recommended. I put 15 drops under my tongue, held it for\n15 seconds, and then swallowed. Within 10 minutes, I felt totally relaxed. My shoulders were relaxing. My mind was quieting down. The world was in a sort of... [background music] Cody: ...beautiful rosy fuzziness. I felt totally zenned out. I wouldn't say that the oil knocked me out,\nper se, but it got me into a really nice state of relaxation which made it totally easy to\nfall asleep. Staying asleep is another huge problem for\nme. Typically, I'm up every night at 2:00 AM or\n3:00 AM, throwing myself a private dance party in my room, pacing the floors and thinking\nabout all my past regrets. When I'm looking at a supplement, I'm also\nreally curious to see if it's going to help me stay asleep all night long. While the American Hemp oil helped me fall\nasleep, I can't really say that it helped me stay asleep. The effects wore off in about an hour or two. I still found that I was waking up in the\nmiddle of the night. If you're like me, and you have a lot issues\nstaying asleep, I'm not sure I would totally recommend this CBD oil for that. Normally, when I take sleep supplements or\nCBD oil, I feel super groggy the next day. I'm really happy to report that the CBD oil\nfrom American Hemp didn't make me feel groggy at all. I woke up feeling clear-eyed and ready to\ngo, which I think is a huge plus for this product. [background music] Cody: Now that we've gone over my entire experience,\nlet's break it down into a few general pros and cons for this product, starting with the\npros. First things first, I love that this is all\nnatural, which makes me feel really good about taking it. I also love that the oil helped me to fall\nasleep super-fast. Within 10 minutes of taking it, my body felt\nreally relaxed. I felt totally zen and ready to sleep. Thirdly, I didn't experience any morning hangovers. I was able to get up and get started with\nmy day. Unfortunately, there are a couple of cons. Number one, the CBD oil is quite expensive. Again, one vial of this costs $140, which\nis a pretty penny. Keep in mind that most CBD oils do cost between\n$140 and $240. It's really more about CBD oil in general\nand not necessarily about this specific product. Number two, it didn't really help me to stay\nasleep at night. The effects wore off in about an hour or two. I found that I was waking up in the middle\nof the night most nights. All right, folks, that does it for my review\nof the 2500 milligram CBD oil from American Hemp.

Kate Chandler from cornerstone clinic for women is here to talk about whether they are safe to use while pregnant good morning to you and what I mean this is a topic that I think we have talked about before but some new studies have come out and so if you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant you'll want to listen up yes so yeah there was a study that was presented last week and medical meeting and it was printed in the journal American Medical Association so that of course marijuana used in pregnant women is on the rise so you know 10 15 years ago was about 3% now it's about 7% and this was a study done about half a million women so one in 14 reported using it but few of them were saying that their doctors say they should use it but they've used it thinking would help with sleep or nausea things like this so are you surprised now when you have a patient come in that says I use CBD oil or medical or marijuana in general well I mean I guess I say it's hard to be surprised about many things that we see but but I am surprised a lot of women may not know that's not a good idea there's just not enough evidence to say it's safe I think what happens when people know oh it's medical it's approved for medical use now or it's recreation approved for recreational use what is because it's been used for medical things like chronic pain or motor OSes or spasticity doesn't mean it's safe just like you know just because alcohol is legal doesn't mean pregnant women should be drinking alcohol when it's just there's some evidence that it might affect the babies IQ later in life their attention span it does it doesn't allow their brain to develop normally because these THC could be hitting the receptors in the brain that are meant for something else to be hitting them now what about CBD oil a lot of people say well that that's safe right I can use that yeah well in CBD I think it can be a great option because see buddy has a lot of the benefits that marijuana could have like affecting decrease inflammation decreasing pain maybe even maybe decreasing there's some studies studies looking at improving immune system decreasing cancer however it's not been proven to be safe in pregnancy either not with pregnancy or breastfeeding because again we don't know how to expecting the brain development and so we shouldn't be using it in pregnancy or with breastfeeding and there's been to that THC definitely crosses the into the breast milk so yeah I want to do that plus here's the other thing is that CBD is not well regulated so you're very careful of where you pick this up because it might have more THC than you know and the other thing I just this isn't a side note but if somebody is using CBD which again I think there's some positives to it you if you're somebody who might be tested like you have to go through if you are in work that you don't need to be doing anything that might be level in their you yeah you can have very strong issues even though they may say there's none in it there's a lot of don't back up claims that you know but we're gonna back you up if your job says it's been found because well plus you never know if there has been some other uses there anyway I just be very cautious yeah err on the side of caution because these studies are still new but we're seeing an increase in women which surprises me as well yeah I think decimal just want to get the word out that even though it has been approved medical use and it's in some states recreational it's not quite in pregnancy breastfeeding alright thank you doctor Chandler we appreciate you we look forward to your next topic okay", "dBjFJRXboI8": "Marten Carlson: Hey guys, Marten here from\nMattress Clarity.

I want to talk about the Populum here, my\nexperience with it, the benefits I felt, and some other things to consider. Let's get started. [music] Marten: I want to talk about the science behind\nCBD. First I want to say, if you want to see a\nlist of my top picks for CBD oil, Google Mattress Clarity best CBD oil. What exactly is CBD? It stands for Cannabidiol. It is a phytocannabinoid, a compound found\nin Cannabis sativa. One of the other phytocannabinoids which we're\ngoing to find in Cannabis sativa is THC. While THC is going to have some stony properties,\nit's going to give you that more of that high feeling, you're not going to get that feeling\nwith CBD taken from hemp plant. While THC is illegal in many states, CBD oil\ntaken from hemp plants is legal in all 50 states. Definitely keep that in mind. In terms of what exactly CBD can help you\nwith, while it's not going to give you that stony feeling, it can help with anxiety, nausea,\nand inflammation. Last but not least, it can help with sleep. As a person who deals with anxiety and that\nhas sleep issues, that's why I want to try out CBD oil. I want to know why you're interested in CBD\noil? Is it to help with your sleep, help with your\nanxiety, or for some other reason? Leave your answer in the comments section\nbelow. I want to see what everyone has to say. Now let's look at the Populum. Before I talk about the Populum, I do want\nto say I am not a doctor. If you're considering adding CBD to your medical\nregimen, or your sleep regimen, do talk to a medical professional. With the Populum here, you're going to have\nthree options -- 250 milligrams, 500 milligrams, and 1,000 milligrams. For the potency I went with a 500-milligram,\ntheir most popular potency. What exactly is in here? First off, you're going to have your CBD oil. This is a full-spectrum hemp oil. While some are going to be CBD isolates, some\nof those competitors are going to get only CBD oil, this is full spectrum. It's also going to have some other phytocannabinoids\nthat naturally occur in hemp plants. In here as well, you're going to have some\nphytocannabinoids such as CBG, which is also going to help with nausea and have anti-inflammatory\nproperties. In addition to that, you're going to have\nsome terpenes. Terpenes are essential oils found in the hemp\nplant, and those are going to have properties. They're going to help with the flavoring,\nalso give you some more sense of well-being. In here, you're also going to have hemp seed\noil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, and cold-pressed orange oil. There's a lot in this bottle. These extra elements are going to help with\nflavoring, also going to have some amino acids, help with your metabolism and your immune\nsystem. There's a lot in here. If you want to know exactly what's in this\nmodel, don't worry. Every bottle is going to come with your lab\nresults. You're going to know exactly what is in this\nbatch of CBD oil. It's also a third-party tested. While it's not FDA approved, you know exactly\nit's in this bottle. It's tested for quality and effectiveness. How do you use the Populum? It's very, very simple. You first, unscrew the top here, and it's\ngoing to be a dropper. In terms of how much you want to fill it with,\nit does depend on how long you've used CBD oil for. If you're just getting started, Populum recommends\nusing 8 milligrams to 8.5 milligrams. This is the 500-milligram potency so it's\ngoing to be about a half a dropper. Once I have that, I put it under my tongue\nand then squirt the liquid under my tongue. I'll leave it in my mouth for 30 seconds. They also recommend you can work the liquid\non your cheeks with your tongue. After the 30 seconds, take two deep breaths. You can drink down the liquid and you're good\nto go. Let's talk about my experience with the Populum. I'm going to break that down into three sections\n-- falling asleep, staying asleep, and then the morning after. In terms of falling asleep, this worked very,\nvery well for me. I took it for a few weeks. Every night before bed when I'm watching TV,\nI would take this about 30 minutes before bed, and it definitely calmed me down. My anxiety was less and I deal with anxiety. Before bed sometimes it was hard for me to\nfall asleep. With the Populum, I definitely fell asleep\nmuch more quickly. In terms of staying asleep, I slept through\nthe night with no problem. However, that's not usually a big issue for\nme, staying asleep, so take that into account. But it did not negatively affect my sleep. The morning after, that's where I had some\nissues with the Populum. Waking up, I did feel a little bit groggy,\na little bit washy as I'm started out my day at work, out of it a little bit, having trouble\nfocusing. I will note this is my first time using CBD\noil. I lowered my dose over the next couple days. It did seem to work itself out. But keep that in mind, if you're just starting\nto use the CBD for yourself. Let's talk about some of the pros and some\nof the benefits I experienced using the Populum. First off, it made it easier to fall asleep. If you're looking for a CBD oil to help you\nfall asleep more quickly, definitely ease you down into a nice state of relaxation before\nyou sleep, take a look at the Populum. Also, if you want something to help you stay\nasleep all night, the Populum worked for me in that respect. If you want to sleep throughout the night,\nthe Populum could also work for you. I'm also a big fan the fact the Populum is\nfull spectrum. You're not just getting a CBD isolate, you're\nalso getting other phytocannabinoids. You get the full effect of the hemp plant\nwith this full-spectrum hemp oil. Lastly, speaking about the third-party testing,\nI like the fact they bring in outside scientists to come in and test this product to make sure\nyou get the best quality, the best effectiveness with the CBD oil. Let's talk about the cons. Some of the things you might want to consider\nif you're looking at the Populum. First off, I experience some morning grogginess\nthe next day. If you want someone's going to help you wake\nup clear-eyed and refreshed, the Populum might not be the best match for you. Keep this in mind. If you're looking for something with a lot\nof potency options there are only three with the Populum -- the 250, the 500, and the 1,000-milligram. Some other companies are going to have five\nor six options, so more options for you in terms of potency. Also, this CBD oil is not FDA approved. That's not necessarily a con for the Populum\nbecause most CBD oils are not FDA approved. But keep this in mind if you're going to add\nthis to your medical regimen. Lastly, in terms of price, right now it's\n$99 for a bottle for the 500 milligrams. That is very affordable for a CBD oil, but\nif you're comparing this to other sleep supplements, it might be on the pricier side. In the end, I enjoyed my experience with the\nPopulum. It helped me fall asleep more quickly, stay\nasleep, very much a nice experience overall. I will just note, if you're looking for something\nto have you waking up feeling more refreshed, you might want to look elsewhere. That's about it.

mentions the word cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "WqbAYLQiHcw": "hi I'm dr. Joe Namath I'm a periodontist in Southfield Michigan and I want to talk a little bit today about CBD or CBD oil cannabidiol CBD CBD oil can be derived from the marijuana plant or it can be derived from the hemp plant it does not have THC in it THC is the ingredient that causes one to get high so this does not have that in it so it doesn't cause you to get high but it is used for pain control and many people it can be used as a as a rub to help control pain in children it may help control seizures it may help reduce anxiety but today I want to talk about the possible role of CBD in the mouth in oral health and specifically on your gum tissue so there was a study using rats what they did was they induce gum disease or periodontal disease in these rats by using certain kinds of wires that irritate the gum tissue and these rats were given CBD actually there were two groups of rats a control group that did not receive the CBD and the experimental group that did receive the CBD now the CBD was given in the form of injection and of course when you brush your teeth you're not going to be injecting CBD they found that at the end of the trial period the rats that had been given the CBD had much less bone destruction they healed much faster and their gums were much healthier relative to the rats in the control group that did not receive the CBD so CBD by the way CBD is now a buzzword you could hear it everywhere and you're gonna hear even more about it because a lot of people think it's the holy grail well it's not the Holy Grail but it may be helpful in certain situations and maybe it's even helpful in the mouth it does tend to reduce inflammation it doesn't kill bacteria so there are some toothpaste some very strong toothpastes that have ant bacterial agents in them and those antibacterial agents kill most or all of the bacteria in the mouth even the good ones on the other hand there are now toothpastes that have CBD incorporated in the toothpaste and these do not destroy the good bacteria but they enable the good bacteria to to proliferate and continue to grow and minimize the harm of the bad bacteria also a great role for CBD is it does reduce anxiety and so it might be very helpful for patients to take some CBD CBD oil something with CBD before a dental appointment to reduce their anxiety of course in our dental office there's no anxiety because we never cause any patients any pain but basically if one has anxiety it does tend to help reduce anxiety and it's very effective for that in a future video I want to talk more about CBD and specifically I want to talk about marijuana and actually smoking marijuana because as opposed to CBD or CBD oil which could have a therapeutic role I think the jury is still out a bit on it marijuana and the smoke actually is probably and is harmful to the gum tissue because the smoke tends to dry out the gum tissue and may reduce the blood supply to the gum tissue so there's a big difference between smoking marijuana which has THC typically and CBD which doesn't so I'm going to talk more about these subjects marijuana CBD in the future but I just wanted to give you a glimpse of potentially what may be going on now and I want to remind you to keep your mouth healthy because if your mouth is healthy I guarantee your body will be healthier subscribe to our YouTube channel we'd love to hear from you and have a great day restore your smile and your health visit dr.

soothing Lian bomb now I'm going to say a few words about recipes I am going to do another video just about recipes in my soapy business uh series but for now I just want to talk about recipes I have three types of recipes I have recipes that a basic that I basically give away and I most likely have taken them from someplace else someplace like nature's garden or bramble berry and there's a few very generous suppers on the internet who give away recipes and so I learned from other people I believe we've all have a duty to give back to new people who are coming on and so I have those that I give away freely the other one is I've tweaked the basic one and I usually tell you what my tweak is I might not give you exact measurements and the reason why I do that is because sometimes my tweaks and my modifications don't work out for other people depending on where you live what your customers are like what you know what supplies you're using so I don't give it because I'm trying to keep it to myself I give it because I can't troubleshoot it if it doesn't work for you the third one is something like I'm going to do today it's like I took me a lot of months to come up with it of course I put all of my ingredients on the label so all you have is wearing my label and know how it goes there's a few different steps that you should be aware of when you're making um a muscle balm like this and I'm going to tell you what those are and you know but basically I'm not going to give you the exact recipe it took me months to come up with this and you don't need everything that I put into it this is my sort of super-duper muscle balm this is the the top of the line you could use only some of these ingredients I'll tell you which ones are necessary which ones are not and and have a perfectly fine bomb you could also I don't use any petroleum products you could also use petroleum jelly in place of the salve that I make myself at the beginning of this and I will you know I mean it's perfectly fine if that's what you want to do if you don't if you don't do your own herbal infusions like I do if you don't want to make your own SAP you can use petroleum jelly I don't use drilling products but you can't so what I want to do is tell you what's absolutely necessary ah this is a mask when you're working with menthol which is absolutely necessary you want to be wearing a mask it can get it makes me nauseous some people have trouble when they breathe it in some people it makes them nauseous for me it makes me nauseous that's why I wear a mask please wear a mask whenever you're you're messing around with menthol the other thing is I'm going to make a salve that's going to be the basis of that so if you don't have a SAP you need to have petroleum jelly and this is my recipe pads here I wonder where it went to um so for the SAP I mean these wax that I use local locally sourced organic beeswax so in order to make the salve I need that I need my fuse oils which I'm going to use my own comfrey and my own calendula infused oils do not use any comfrey and few soils on and open on a deep open wound you can use up on superficial wounds but this is a muscle bomb so it really should just go on muscles where there's no deep wound comfrey is so healing that it heals the surface so fast that the skin does not have time to regenerate underneath if it's a deep wound and actually can cause an infection so don't ever use any comfrey based product on a deep wound you could use it on superficial wounds you could use it on rashes you can even use it on broken bones it's great but don't use it on deep wounds I use vitamin E I put vitamin E and all of my bombs all of my self it's just about every product I make has vitamin E in it you need the mental and you need a camphor this is camphor essential oil and basically that's all you need you need the basic salve which in my case I'm going to make myself and I'll show you some of that you need the menthol you need the camphor that and that's it that's all you really need if you use the petroleum jelly instead of the the SAP I also put in cajuput essential oil lavender essential oil frankincense essential oil eucalyptus central oil wintergreen essential oil peppermint essential oil and clove bud essential oil so that's what I use in my top-of-the-line muscle balm you don't have to use all these essential oils you really just need the mental the camphor and the the base to put it in either salve or petroleum jelly but this is my top of the line I make ones that are less potent and they don't have all of these in so I'm going to get started and I also have my jars they are boiling in water so that they're sterilized and I'm going to clean up a bit and then we'll get started now the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to make the salve now the basic recipe for the salve is an ounce of beeswax to a cup of oil so I'm going to take my calendula and my Humphrey oil and I'm going to do half a cup of each one I just did these so that is the comfrey very dark very successful infusion it's very happy with it if you saw the video oh this is Michelangelo this is chamomile which is which is fine and I do make this with a with calendula and I do make it with chamomile today we're going to do chamomile and come a you don't even have to make a salve you can use a petroleum jelly or you can just use a carrier oil with the beeswax you don't you don't have to have infused oil that's just something that I like to do so I have my cup of of oil and now I'm going to slice off an ounce of beeswax oh I know what I was missing I was missing shea butter I put shea butter in my my balm as well and that's because I really wanted to have a nice consistency when all is said and done so I knew there was something else that I was missing so it's the shea butter okay so I have chopped off an ounce of beeswax and I'm going to put this away and I'm going to melt the beeswax and a double boiler so I'm going to do now is I'm going to put the melted beeswax into the oil and it's going to solidify like almost immediately there we go there we go have nice solid and what you can do at this point is you can put this back into the water so that it it melts again or you could heat up the oil before so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put this back in here and get all that these wax out and then I'm going to put the this back in the water now it's all melted and now it's going to cool down and it's going to create a salve if you keep scraping the sides down everything will become a salve now it's a dark green because of the comfrey if it was not if the comfrey was not involved in this it would not be so dark green it would be more like a pale yellow or even a beige but because the comfrey is so dark it's so you see it it's getting very gelatinous and you just mix it around now if you wanted this to be the extent of your product this would be a great great healing salve chamomile and comfrey like I said it's good on everything bruises rashes superficial cuts not deep cuts because the comfrey is so healing it's one of the only things as you can say don't use this because it's too good but it really heals so quickly that it doesn't give the bottom layers enough time to to really do its job so this is mixed up fairly well it looks great so there's a little piece it looks like a little piece of comfrey with them in the oil so anyway this is the South that we're going to use is the basis and I'm going to prepare the menthol and show you what we do so it's important to weigh out exactly how much salve you're going to have when you're finished so this is 5.8 so then I'm going to put in probably half that for a for shea butter and I'm probably going to put around half of that for menthol so I have put the shea butter and the menthol chips in together and I'm going to put them in the double boiler and let them melt and like I said this is where you definitely want to put your mask on now while that is melting what I'm going to do is I'm going to weigh out my oh the menthol is already trying to get to me uh-huh I'm going to weigh out my oils my essential oils and I can tell you that a lot of times it's so light when you when you're dealing with something like this it doesn't really measure out so know how many drops is in you know an ounce or whatever the thing that's the most important is the camphor oil so try to make sure you have at least an ounce of the camphor and you can you know take it from there and try to figure out how many drops are are in it but I'm not going to make you sit through that but I'm just telling you that's how I came up with it because sometimes the scale just doesn't pick up on measuring the essential oils until you've got more than you need ok this is 2 ounces of camphor oil and the next thing that I'm going to need is an ounce of of clove and then cajuput and then everything else I usually put in you know from a few drops to half an ounce okay so our shea butter and our our Ben Thal is nicely melted we have our essential oils and vitamin E right here and like I said the only thing you absolutely need for for muscle balm is the menthol the camphor and some sort of base you know which we made our own comfrey chamomile staff everything else is is optional and I put peppermint eucalyptus and wintergreen in there you really only need one of those I just like this really strong this is for me and I have a lot of really really difficult muscle issues and you know I have lupus so I have a lot of aches and pains and this stuff is just magic the frankincense is also very expensive you don't need that I find that it works better for me you don't need the lavender that works better for me I find the clove to be something that you do need an essential essential oil for this but you could get away without it if you want something very light you know just go with the menthol the camphor and you know add some cajuput a little bit of the clove and you're good to go you know with your base either petroleum jelly or making your own Saveur liniment so anyway I'm going to wait for this to cool down to 120 before I add my essential oils and now mix it all together in the meantime I am sterilizing my jars if this is going to go into and I also have Saint John's wort um which I just got today and so I'm going to be making and infused oil with that so so I have a bigger mason jar in there but I have the smaller jason mason jars in there for this SAP okay so we're almost ready to get going again my this is the shea butter and the mental chips they're almost down to 120 which is where I want them so that I can put the essential oils the vitamin E in and then we'll add the salve as well I have my my little jars have come out of the boiling water where they boiled forever and ever in seen and this is for me so I am OCD and I do um really take a lot of precautions that might seem like overkill to some people and it probably is but that's the way I do it so you know I'm going to make sure that you know these are absolutely dry so that we're not introducing any water into this because we all know that water breeds bacteria and fungus so one of the things that I was saying before about recipes is you know I have basic recipes that I freely give away because people gave to me when I first started making products like this I have other ones that I usually give you the tweaks I might not give you the exact amounts but it get is because your supplies my different than mine where you live might be different then you know how things behave where I live etc etc and then there's ones that you know it's like this you're going to read all of this on the label this recipe took me a very long time to come up with and to get it right now I gave you a sort of an idea of the Rhett you know the recipe and and the amounts but I didn't give you the exact ones because you don't need everything that I put in here you can make a perfectly nice one you know by yourself with it with different things I showed you what was necessary what was not necessary if I go onto somebody's video and they say I never give out recipes I turn it off I never go back there again I will not give them views there are some techniques that people use that yes you do want to see but if somebody's just sitting there making a soap I'm not going to sit there and watch them hand blend some some oils and lye together when they're not showing me anything that I don't already know how to do I don't care and if you're so selfish like you're not curing cancer you should have I believe you can have your proprietary recipes you don't want to give to other people but everybody should have some recipes that they give to new Sopris because people gave to us we didn't learn this in a vacuum we didn't wake up one day know how to do this stuff so if you're you know think that you're so magnificent now you can't share any recipe with anyone ever I will not give you the views on your videos I just won't and I believe that everybody should have some basic recipes that they share with others that they let people know where they've gone from they can point them to the resources you know things like that then there's the other ones where you say you know I took this basic recipe from so-and-so and I put this twist on it you know and then there's ones like this where it's like yeah this is what you absolutely need to make a muscle balm but all these other ingredients you could put in make make it you know really good but you don't have to so I encourage people if you go to somebody's site and they say I don't give out any of my recipes ever shut them off don't give them views it's ridiculous if they have some great technique that you really want to learn you know be a piping or making layers of soap or something like that fine but if it's just them putting some oils and lye together and and dumping it in a mold a big deal who cares like just don't go back there that's what I say so I think that everybody should give back to new Soper's like people gave to me because I didn't know what I was doing and I watched it's videos before I ever started this the other thing that I wanted to say is if when you use in menthol if you don't wear glasses like I do or even if you do and your your eyes are particularly sensitive you might want to put on goggles because the mental affects your your eyes as well and you know it's great if you have a cold or something clear everything up but if you don't you definitely want to cover your your nose your mouth and your eyes so anyway this is 121 we're almost there so like I've shown all my videos you know I alcohol things down especially just gonna be for sale this isn't for sale this is just for me but I do it anyway so this is the spoon that I'm going to use to mix and you know I will alcohol this down I just need a paper towel to do that so I have my alcohol spoon and I'm going to check my temperature should be down below 120 and then I'm just going to mix the essential oils and it is 119 ok here we go let's see I'm just going to this is the essential oils and a vitamin E and if you're going to use vitamin E and let's make sure it's a real vitamin E not you know some crap that they're you know if you look closely it says you know 2% vitamin E or something like that because there's a lot of people out there I would do it ok so that is very strong between the menthol and now all I'm going to do is I'm going to mix in my fabulous fabulous salve this is all going to mix together if you give us what petroleum jelly I don't know how comes out because I've never used it but I assumed that it would be the same thing I can smell the menthol I could smell the camphor now all I got to just get this mixed really well I think I'm actually going to use my hand blender for a minute me trusty stick bag where I'd be without it obviously this is from two different I just grabbed the first bottom and the first top that I saw so it's a little liquidy but I definitely will great so it is liquidy you can see that and you know because the shea butter will firm up and the beeswax the liniment will firm up this will all firm up I'm going to pour this into the jars and let you see see it it pours and this will all this will all firm up and this is one reason why you don't always give out recipes because if for some reason this didn't firm up which I'm sure it well because I've done this just people gonna come to you and say oh I'm one didn't firm up what happened and if this if that happened if this didn't firm up but you stay like this I would just make another salve base and then I would just put it all together until you know was the point that it did but I'm just going to give this a little bit and I'll bring you back while I was waiting for this to set up I did my uh st. John's wort infusion and I want to show you this Saint John's wort is one of the few herbs that I would suggest putting a little bit of oil in the bottom because it's so dense that sometimes it can take a long time for the oil to go all the way through so I just put a little bit at the bottom I probably should have showed you that but anyway this is the st. John's wort it's in sunflower that I have rosemary only arisen in apricot oil and extra virgin olive oil some people have asked me why don't you I'm an oil and you can absolutely use sweet I'm an oil to do infusions it's a great oil to do infusions but I don't use it for people that have allergies because I figure people with nut allergies have enough problem sometimes finding products so I try to make you know my healing balms my healing salve you know very you know nut allergy friendly so anyway so see this is setting up and it will continue to set up as as it firms up okay this has firmed up look at it it looks and smells amazing this is you can see it it's just lovely I'm going to take a little bit I'm going to put it on my very icky shoulders amazing amazing it's creamy it's wonderful so this is our top of the line lion balm if you want it you can order it you you", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for my guide the best CBD products for

sleeping at night you have plenty of company nearly 80% of people say they have trouble sleeping at least once a week well now some people are turning to CBD a compound in cannabis that won't get you high to get some Z's but is it safe does it work here's consumer reporter Marilyn Moritz Steph Davis is a professional mountain climber so she really needs a good night's sleep but like a lot of people Steph was tossing and turning I was just in this phase where I wouldn't fall asleep right away and then I would wake up at like 3:00 in the morning I feel like why am i awake so a friend recommended she try CBD I took him for a couple weeks and then said hey wow you know I've had really good sleeps in this time period CBD or cannabidiol is a compound that is found in both hemp and marijuana and it doesn't make you high it's recently exploded in popularity because of its potential to treat health problems like pain anxiety and perhaps sleep we don't have a ton of research on CBD and insomnia but the research that we have suggests that CBD may reduce a person's anxiety and possibly reduce pain relieving one or both of those could help a person get to sleep and stay as but how do you know if CBD is right for you do you suffer from chronic insomnia before you turn into CBD it's actually time to make an appointment with your physician he or she can help you with a more proven therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy which helps focus on behaviors that can improve your sleep if you still want to try CBD be sure to ask to see the product certificate of analysis that shows how that product performed on Tess and talk to your doctor especially if you take other meds because CBD could interact with them Marylyn more its case at 12 News", "sjqhtoh7xLQ": "so you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "HBhMEAED2ro": "[Music] [Applause] so we hear a lot of terms there's cannabis cbd thc and hemp is it all marijuana or is there a difference our next insider explains what we have to differentiate is between cannabis or marijuana and hemp as well as cbd and thc so those are the the big ones to differentiate so cannabis is actually a plant that has all these different cannabinoids and it produces two of the most prominent thc and cbd hemp on the other hand it comes from the cannabis species but it does also have the cbd molecule which is cannabidiol and so what's legal in the united states in all 50 states would be cbd from a hemp plant and that would mean it would have also 0.3 percent thc or less and so that's really important because the thc is a psychoactive molecule so hemp is legal you can buy it online many people sell it and it contains cbd which has a lot of medicinal properties however cbd from hemp may be similar to the effect you would get from cbd from cannabis however it does have less than 0.3 percent thc so there's no chance of any psychoactivity there so cbd is cannabidiol cbd thc stands for what for tetrahydrocannabinol and what exactly is that again so that's one of the cannabinoids that causes the psychoactive effect and that's because it binds to that cb1 receptor in our brain but it has a lot of medicinal benefits also so people who are going through chemotherapy for example and suffering from nausea and vomiting or need to increase their appetite thc can be very effective it's also great for pain all different types of pain pain from neuropathy or you know the typical sciatic type of pain muscle spasticity patients with ms or a lot of other chronic musculoskeletal issues and uh very beneficial for insomnia as well what is hemp oil and is there any medicinal benefit there too so so hemp oil does contain cbd the problem with hemp oil is that it's not regulated strict enough and now actually i think today trump may sign the farm bill and the farm bill actually would make hemp completely legal so that it's no longer part of that definition where it's part of that schedule one and so you can get cbd from hemp and it would be very exciting if the farm bill does pass and trump signs that because now they'll be able to regulate what happens because the industry similar to supplements there's not a lot of strict enforcement so people are producing hemp oil selling it and it may not have the proper cannabinoid profile it may have things like mold pesticides lead different things that can be taken up from the soil so it has a lot of benefit and it can be bought online or you know in physicians offices however it should be regulated so that we know that the patients are getting accurate amount of what they need and i was hearing in the news that it looked like it was gonna pass but he was going to sign it it seems like it's going to happen today hopefully i think so today exactly uh let's go over cbd hemp oil we have a graphic if you could walk us through this doctor so in order to be considered hemp oil the cbd has to have the the oil has to have less than 0.3 thc which would mean there wouldn't be any chance of any feeling of being high or psychoactivity it should be third party lab tested which means that you can send it to a lab to check the cannabinoid profile and for any other contaminants and then how it's extracted is important there's ethanol extractions there's co2 extractions and the way i look at cbd is it really is more of a wellness type of supplement and i always tell people it's going to be in our multivitamin because we make a molecule in our body that is very similar to that molecule and as we age we make less and so it's really one of the reasons why we get chronic disease because we're not able to regulate and maintain homeostasis so it's something that people should be taking on a daily basis and then if they have specific symptoms like anxiety or pain or insomnia they can take it in specific doses or specific routes of administration and is cpd hemp or illegal in all 50 states it is it is it is legal okay i want to go over some reasons why you would prescribe cbd and thc we have a few examples that we can show our viewers right now and that would be anti-inflammatory i actually will let you take them because there's a few of them so cbd is a great anti-inflammatory so when dealing with joint inflammation or any type of inflammation in our body cbd can be used instead of things like ibuprofen meloxicam different anti-inflammatories it's also great for anxiety so it's a lot of patients are able to get off their xanax their valium their klonopin by using cbd it's helpful for pain and it's a good analgesic as well as an antioxidant to help with the immune system thc on the other hand actually the united states has a patent saying that it can help with apoptosis which is programmed cell death which means that it can help to shrink tumors it can help decrease metastasis so it has this anti-cancer property and also anti-spasmodic patients who are suffering from spasticity or muscle spasms it will help with that as well it's also effective for pain and again it can help with nausea vomiting stimulating people's appetite and if cbd is not sufficient for sleep thc can be used to help patients suffering from insomnia look at that more than i even dreamed of are patients surprised when they see that so they they just come in and go really they are surprised but what happens is a lot of patients actually come to me because i've had success with their friends or their family and so they are understanding the benefits and they're feeling they're seeing people feel better and so they want to know is this an option for me and by the way president trump did sign the farm bill which legalizes hemp you can find out more on cbd just download the health channel app", "x1vI0t4GgsE": "so Jami is going to make homemade him sad this is one pound so I melt beeswax coconut oil aloe vera okay right okay so we added a whole package of wax which is about yet and a half pound okay so we do four parts coconut four part temp usually but I go a little bit more than him and we should do an equal amount of aloe vera so this is a 16 ounces and there's so we'll use about less than half of that all right we'll add that in right after we do the coconut then we're going to turn the heat off your skin when it starts to develop a little bit of a skin on it and look for the hemp oil in there mix it up real good then we let it settle down and then right after that I guess well I've never had I've always added the vanilla beads but we'll just add the vanilla oil skew drops maybe even let's drop it around and it'll smell good yeah watch so we used a half pound with beeswax we're gonna use two pounds of because [Music] unless so you like to seeing what you make your M Sava I guess there is coconut on that something was in we try to get a couple bite game what which drive-by and I'm the villain I'll be like is the rendition of seven gold and the Visigoths [Music] how long did let that go this for hotel becomes clear clear what can't do it [Music] yeah so we're either a mercy wait [Music] that's a libero there was a liquid when he mixed it into the hot wax and it does do a solid welcome Kim the in there has to be coming back has become heterogeneous a stateless release its bonding and make you want and that tear we almost qualifies for medicine man but it all together as a loader no it was all the heat it breaks down form to you but it shocked Misha Lee to explain how can I does the same thing separates not a liquid when you pour it in as a liquid at guitar now what we'll do is we'll turn this off then when it starts to develop the skin will put the hemp oil in then we'll add the vanilla variant [Music] four parts in oil hipsters make this ad you'll have to give me a recipe Jeremy okay he's our Peduto my jaw she can still do that I'll give you the oil and then you put the vanilla no it's one part beeswax which goes in first one part beeps what then four parts coconut which goes in second and you wait for it to become homogeneous one part or a little bit more aloe vera and they'd add that after the coconut and again you got to wait for it to become homogeneous and you let it cool down develop that skin and you put four types ham little more if you want and thin yes that's right and then I use it and I become homogeneous I use it in Munster almost kind of proven hair sucker you homeboy idea radius militia mark guy who's gay gay gay this is Ruben lol [ __ ] what he said it's probably mess under shoot from the hip that's just purely for the system yeah well the know has you know people like the vanilla scent on energy pleasant for a man or alone yeah and there's good for you you don't add it what does it smell like just nothing there's coconut oh yeah don't get a big smell out of it it's really gonna be what I'm real definitely add it you can add anything up so where do you purchase this coconut oil and refined I got that off the internet on at the bread route and get a staple and spice you get up in probably good non organic coconut oil at I did it health record Google this is here yeah okay so the part doesn't know there's some part ears as long as they're all equal parts I mean do you use the same measurement part yeah whatever whatever you happen to do so I use I used to have a pound of beeswax approximately so I want to use two pounds of fat that's approximately two months all right here baby cheese type stuff and say just different stuff that's not liquid how many boards over one part or mark depending on what you want and then you add hemp oil once it's cooled down to the point where it develops skin so that's for putter Templar then you can add other essential oils at that time you could also add vitamin E at that time add vitamin E once it's cooled down to him and I will put this in the freezer and we'll let it yeah if you want that's just another idea or any kind of essential oils that you think are good for you by virgin olive oil or the label like some people have certain affiliations for where I use vanilla just because it's it works for both genders and everybody likes signals alright gender friendly amount for parts coconut let it become homogenous one part or more LOV rapid fridge to develop a skin or parts hemp oil add vitamin E or any essential oil right need to stir it to mix it all up and put in the fridge and let it become thick that's what it mr. James who makes my Mineola which opinion I would you don't need a ton of vitamin E usually when things have I mean we've been boiling the string about two hours we're going to rinse it out and I'll take it out maybe we've boiled a lot of the lignin out now we're going to rinse the lignin off it and then we're going to boil it for two more hours to get more the lignin out of it okay and then we'll beat it in the Hollander beater okay not waiting up here oh you got feet print on there really oh look at the feet print on my car there's Laramie get Laramie Laramie oh hey doggy don't let me

right here we go we've got salve we're going to still having punk wouldn't a table knife be the thing to use to put with those blow containers I don't know I just wanted janna waffles here we go what saint [Music] how stiff I think we should let it I get a little bar okay it doesn't matter once you get in there in there [Music] it's easy son Jeremy good day goodbye to your own creation they say it's edible I'm going to use that night for [Music] right Table nine what does that mean like a platter nine ice cream that'll work better than the school's problem yeah here we go ladies and gentlemen first time hip TV those bodies Yatta Yatta pour it through a funnel once running I break you dude I don't have a fun no you know maybe if you blow it Thank You Roscoe put your lids on and blow let go in there thanks for everything all right we have smashed down where's the ham platter [Music]", "FymCTaaSMDY": "my name is Willie Christie and we're in the kitchen at civilized HQ down here in Venice Beach California we're in the kitchen today because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "_jeNJE8Rh28": ">> [Inaudible]. Thanks, Chad. So yes, today I'll talk\na bit about the use of cannabinoids to treat pain. And I have no financial\ndisclosures that relate to this. And before I get into\nthe scientific background of how we actually use\ncannabinoids to treat pain, I think we just need to acknowledge what a\nmess this situation is; so [laughter] we have\nfairly few states with legal medical cannabis. This slide as of a couple\ndays ago is outdated because Illinois just passed\nadult use recreational law, so we now have 11 states\nwith adult use cannabis. And this is despite\nit being schedule one so under the Controlled\nSubstances Act, it has no accepted medical use,\nand a high potential for abuse. So this has created such a\nmismatch for so many clinicians who want to know how to\nadjust the use of cannabis in their patients,\nand how to do this in a safe and effective way. And so to this point\na little bit -- we just published a paper little\nwhile ago, we see the conditions for which people are\nactually using cannabis. Far and away, the most\nprevalent qualifying condition for your cannabis\nlicense is chronic pain. It's about two-thirds\nof the total number of qualifying conditions, and\nabout 80% of the total patients. So what does this look\nlike then in Michigan? We're one of the biggest\nstates in terms of the number of medical cannabis patients. We have about 270,000\npatients as of 2017. And we've had medical\ncannabis -- a medical cannabis\nlaw since 2008. But because of this mismatch,\nwe have a lot of uncertainty about how to actually\ninterface with patients. A lot of physicians are\nuncomfortable regarding certifications for\ntheir patients. They're not actually saying,\n\"This is the prescription, and this is how you\nshould go use cannabis.\" Instead, what they're doing\nwhen they sign an application for your medical cannabis\nlicense is they're saying, \"Yes, you have a condition\nthat qualifies you under the state law to\npossess cannabis up to two and a half ounces and 12 plants, and go and figure it\nout for yourself.\" And so because so many\nphysicians are uncomfortable with this, there's also a lot\nof clinics that have popped up where all they do is\nmedical cannabis certifications. You can go in, get a five-minute\nappointment, pay 100 bucks or something, and voila,\nyou have a license, but still no idea of\nwhat necessarily to do. So we have that mess\non that side. And then of course, as\neverybody's been talking about today, we're in the\nmidst of an opioid crisis. And there's a lot of interest in\nusing cannabis or cannabinoids, the active compounds\nin the cannabis plant, to treat both opioid\naddiction, but then some of the undergoing chronic pain that has driven this\nopioid crisis. And there is some support\nof this being plausible. So we know from a lot\nof preclinical studies, as well as like there\nare some clinical trial that there does seem to be\nsome synergism between THC, one of the compounds in\ncannabis, and opioids. So in this recent\nclinical trial, they gave people Oxycodone, as\nwell as [inaudible]cannabis. And they found with\nsub-threshold dose of the cannabis and\nOxycodone together, they got the same\npain relief with -- as they saw with a\nhigher dose of the opioid. So there's some interest\nthere, and might be a way that people are able to reduce\ntheir opioid consumption when they start using cannabis. But then we also see statewide\nanalyses where people have shown that states with medical\ncannabis legislation have lower rates of opioid overdose,\nlower opioid prescribing than the states without. And having active operating\ndispensaries is really important for these effects. We then also see numerous --\ndozens of studies at this point in the US, in Israel, in\nCanada, where people say, \"Yes, I've substituted\ncannabis for opioids, and I do so for better\nsymptom management, and I do so because there's\nfewer adverse side effects.\" So, again, schedule\none substance, not much clinical guidance,\nwidespread availability. You can see why we're\nin quite a mess. So I think that what we need\nto do next is then figure out where the evidence\nlies for chronic pain, how we can use this in a\nsafe of a way as possible, and how to conceptualize\ncannabis in the correct way, which, at least in my view,\nis rather than thinking of it as a panacea or a poison, which\nare really the extended -- the dichotomist use that are\nreally out there at this point, and think of it, \"Well, this is\npotentially one pain medication that people could use,\nand this is the way in which they could do so.\" So with that, let's drum\ninto some of the science, so in terms of definition\nand background, then I'll go into some of the risks that\nare known about cannabinoids, their role in pain\nmanagement, looking at some of the clinical trials, and\nthen some practical tips and guidelines on how\nof use these compounds. So and much of this comes\nfrom the National Academies of Sciences 27 through --\nreport on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids. There is some stuff that's\nbeen updated since this time, but this is a really\ngood place to start. It's available to\nanybody online, so I would suggest looking\ninto it if you would like. In terms of definitions, so I'm\ngoing to use \"cannabis\" instead of \"marijuana\", just because \"cannabis\" is the botanical\nname, and \"marijuana\" has, you know, [inaudible]\nxenophobic history to the word, so I'll just avoid\nusing that for now. And so there's subspecies\n[inaudible]. And then we also\nhave cannabinoids, which is active compounds,\nboth in the cannabis plant, but also we -- our\nbody makes its own endo or endogenous cannabinoids. And then there's also\nsynthetic cannabinoids, which either are replicas\nof the phytocannabinoids that are synthesized\nin the labs, or novel cannabinoid\ncompounds that we think of as having potential\ntherapeutic uses. These compounds all\ninterface with the endogenous or endocannabinoid system,\nwhich is the set of receptors from your naturally\nrecurring ligands and enzymes regulating control. And this system is so ancient,\nso widespread, and involved in so many functions including\nmemory, analgesia, stress, appetite, sleep that\nthere's a lot of excitement about targeting it for\nclinical applications. I guess I can't tell\nif it shows up nicely. The two most common\nreceptors in this system, the ones that are the\nmost widely studied, are cannabinoid receptors\none and two. CB1 is one of the\nmost common receptors in the central nervous system. And it is -- when\nit's activated, it tends to be more involved in the sleep memory analgesia\nappetite, those responses. By contrast, CBQ is found\nmore in the immune system. And when it's activated, it\ndoesn't seem to have any kind of psychoactive effects in the\nsame way as the CB1 receptor, so there's a lot of\ninterest in targeting that immune system-related\nconditions. So next let's go into\nsome of these cannabinoids and what we know about them. At this point, I'm just\ngoing to touch on two, even though there's over 100\nwhich have been discovered. But the most commonly studied\nis THC or tetrahydrocannabinol. It's analgesic, it's\nmood-altering, and appetite-stimulating, and it partially binds\nto both CB1 and CB2. I will note that even though\nthere's a lot of concern about the psychoactive\neffects and all of that of THC when in smoked cannabis,\nthat synthetic THC as dronabinol has\nbeen legal for decades for treating chemotherapy\ninduced nausea and vomiting, and AIDS-related anorexia. So there is a known\ntherapeutic use. It's FDA-approved. It's a schedule-free substance, while herbal cannabis\nis schedule one, further muddying\nconfusion in the waters about what's going on with this. Hot on the scene is\nCBD or cannabidiol. We've known about this\ncompound as long as we've known about THC, but there's so\nmuch more excitement about it at this point because\nit is non-intoxicating. It seems to protect against some of the psychoactive\neffects of THC. And then in a lot of\npreclinical studies, it has anti-inflammatory\neffects, it has effects on pain, and most excitedly, is a\nvery potent anticonvulsant. In fact, the FDA just approved\na CBD-based drug last -- I think it was last June\nin 2018 called \"Epidiolex\" for childhood epileptic\ndisorders. And it is schedule five, so\nvery low abuse potential. I would be remiss if I didn't\nmention the other cannabinoids. I'm not going to go into\nthem much, except to say that there's over 100 of them. And there's a big dispute in the\nmedical and scientific community at this point about how\nto account for them, because classically\npharmaceuticals will try to find the active ingredient\nand synthesize that and give that in isolation and say,\n\"Okay, that's a good -- that's the effect that we want.\" But because there are so many\nterpenes responsible for aroma and taste, et cetera, as well\nas these other cannabinoids and herbal [inaudible],\npeople want to know, \"Should we use a\nfull spectrum product or should we use an isolate?\" So I'm not going to\ngo anymore into that, but just to say that\nit's out there. In terms of photos, you\ncan see that there -- it's a close-up of\na cannabis bud, and then a cannabis\noil [inaudible]. And you can -- now that\nCBD is so exciting and hot on the scene, you\ncan buy it anywhere. You can buy it on Amazon, you\ncan buy it at gas stations, you can but it at CVS. And to the frustration\nof scientists who want to actually do studies on\nthis stuff, but you have to get a scheduling license\nto do so, you can buy it for your dog [laughter] in\ncase your buddy has anxiety or joint pain, or\nsomething like that. You can get this in BarkBox\ndelivered to your house. [Laughter] So we also see that this situation is\nevolving quite quickly. So in 2018 -- at\nthe end of 2018, President Trump signed\nthe 2018 Farm Bill that legalized industrial\nhemp, and thus opened the door for the availability for many\nhemp derived CBD products; so they have less\nthan .3% THC in them. But there's not a\nlot of uncertainty about how the FDA is\ngoing to regulate that, so there are concerns about\nproducts that have heavy metals because hemp is a\nbioaccumulator. There's also a lot of shady,\nyou know, companies out there who don't have good processes in\nplace that remove the solvents that are used to extract these\ncompounds, or they use a lot of pesticides and then\ndon't do anything about that when they're actually\ndoing the extraction. So it's really important\nto go to -- ideally to go to a place that has third-party\nindependent testing for metals, for solvents, for\npesticides, and then also so you'll actually know\nwhat is in the product that your patients\nmight be using. One such place, there's a\nnonprofit called [inaudible] that has collaborated\nwith places like Johns Hopkins University. And they've done much of this\nsafety and potency testing, and have a list of product\nthat they verify as being safe and actually accurately labeled. And then lastly,\nin this definitions and background section,\nI just want to talk about how these compounds\nwork a little bit in the body, because this will come in later\nwhen we're talking about how to use them and the\neffectiveness. So pharmacokinetically, you\ncan see from this slide the way that THC shows up in\nthe blood [inaudible] administration groups. If anybody knows of anybody\nwho's injected cannabinoids, please let me know so that,\none, that injection one, it looks almost the\nsame as smoking. So you can just go with that. But if you [laughter] actually\ningest the compounds orally, you have less of a spike of\nTHC in the bloodstream and less of a fast taper, and instead\nyou have an extended -- it takes a while to hit\nand then an extended taper. So you can think about slow and fast release\nadministration groups for using these compounds,\nespecially knowing that the feeling of high maps onto those pharmakinetics\nreally nicely. And then lastly, about how\nthese interact in the body; we do seem to see a\nu-shaped curve for cannabis and cannabinoid effects. So with that in mind, what\nthis means is there's a kind of sweet spot above which if\nyou go above a certain point, you can end up overshooting\nyour medical dose, and then just get higher, in\nfact maybe even get worse pain. So if you look at the Y axis, you see a green plus\nand a red minus. The curve shows where\nsomebody's pain relief is. So maybe you have a low dose\nand you get a little bit of pain relief, you'd\nfind that sweet spot up at the top of that curve. But if you go past that, people\ncould have increased anxiety, they could have increased pain. So trying to figure\nout how to do that safely is something\nthat's really important when using these compounds. All right; so next let's\nmove into cannabinoid risks. I feel like this is\nreally important to go into because there's so\nmuch concern about this, just given that cannabis is\nstill a schedule one drug. And actually, this is where the\nbulk of the research funding from the National Institutes\nof Health has gone in the past. And we don't have that much info\non the medical risks of cannabis and cannabinoids because these\nstudies have typically looked at recreational users. But because many of these folks who are using it recreationally\nwould be considered the chronic heavy users, they're\nsmoking a lot daily, and tend to be younger,\nwe can say, \"Well, these are probably -- this\nis the worst case scenario of what this might look like, at\nleast as a surrogate right now.\" We know that smoking,\nnot really good. So the respiratory effects\nof that, those are some of most widely known\nrisks of cannabinoids, but there's also risk of\ndependence and addiction. About nine percent of people who use cannabis develop some\nkind of dependency issue. There's also increased rates\nof psychotic illness developed by people, especially using\ncannabis under the age of 25. I also need to addend the point\non dependence and addiction. People who use cannabis at a\nyounger age have about a double of that risk of addiction, so\nimportant to note that as well. And that's a particularly\nvulnerable population. And we see some long-term\neffects on memory and brain structure in\ncannabis users as well. In terms of in the acute phase,\nwe see dizziness, somnolence, euphoria, although some\npeople might not say that that is a risk, lightheadedness,\nanxiety, and others. Less commonly, but\nespecially seen in people who take way too much in\nterms of an edible dose, you'll see some vomiting,\nparanoia, occasionally seizures and hallucinations, although\nthose are more associated with the synthetic cannabinoids\nlike spice that people can buy on the street, not typically\ncannabis itself; and then, vehicle accidents, of\ncourse, and then lastly, as with the CBD products\nthat you can buy on Amazon, there's an uncertain\nquality of many of the herbal [inaudible]\nas well. So in states that don't have\ngood regulatory statutes in place about testing\nfor safety and potency, you can end up with things with\nbud mold on them like you see in that -- in the upper picture. And if somebody's\nimmunocompromised and smoking that, it can be\nreally serious and problematic if they get some kind of\nsystemic fungal infection. So in terms of the risks\nof medical cannabinoid use, as I said, we have much\nfewer data on this. The best study that I've\nseen came out of Canada on McGill called\nthe \"COMPASS Study\" and what they did was they\nfollowed folks using 12.5% THC smokable cannabis for a\nyear, and what they -- and compared to people\nwho were not using it in a chronic pain setting. And what they found is about\na double direct increase in minor adverse effects in\npeople who were using cannabis, compared to those who were\nnot, but also increases -- or improvements in pain\nand quality of life. So definitely a mixed\nprofile there, but in a place, excuse me, that needs a lot more\nwork, especially given that, you know, there are so many\npeople using cannabis medically and we just don't really\nhave a good sense of what that looks like risk wise. A couple studies that\ndid come out of Israel where they have more regimented\ntitration regimes have found that there's a pretty low risk\nprofile in elderly adults. They would be looking\nin a population of mixed cancer patients\nand they found with this titration regimen that they saw very\nfew adverse events. Okay; so going into the\nrole of cannabinoids and pain management,\nwe've talked a lot today about the mechanisms of\npain so I'm going to skip over this a little bit,\nexcept to remind you that there's the\nperipheral neuropathic and centralized pain states,\nand that people can have any of these in combination. In terms of preclinical models\nof pain, we know that CB1 and CB2 agonists are quite\neffective in many of these types of pain, but people\nare really concerned about the CB1 acting compounds because of the off-target\ncentral nervous system activity, the types of effects\nthat we'd associate with the cannabis high. While CB2 agonists\nthere's a lot of excitement about at this point because as\nI said, they don't really seem to produce that effect. And there's actually a company\nmaking a compound called [inaudible] that\nthey're testing in a lot of inflammatory disorders that doesn't really\nappear to bind to CB1. And so there's some\npotential there to maybe in the future see some\nCB2-specific compounds on the market. In terms of clinical\ntrials with chronic pain, the most recent meta-analysis\nthat looked at all of the clinical trials noted,\nas with all the other studies that have done this, that\nthese are short-length studies, they have small sample size, they have unrepresentative\ndosing of what people actually use. And they typically find a\nmodest decrease in pain, compared to placebo\nacross pain states. But most of this effect\nsize is driven by the data in neuropathic pain, using the\ncombination of THC plus CBT -- CBD excuse me, called \"sativex\", which is a sublingual\n[inaudible], it's a one-to-one\nratio of the two. It would be really nice, if\nI could give you more data about how CBD alone is effective\nin different types of pain, but unfortunately, I've only\nseen one study that has looked at that in any kind\nof long-term setting, and that has just been\npublished as an abstract, as opposed to a published paper. They did find decreases in pain\nand improvement in function, but mostly in men with\nknee osteoarthritis. I will say also that there's\na pretty clear mismatch between these clinical trials\nand the observational studies in which many people using\ncannabis who have been followed over time they say that they've\ngreat success, they've been able to taper off opioids,\nwhatever it might be. But that uncontrolled nature of their dosing makes\nit really unclear about how exactly they're doing\nthat, and how to translate that into a more\nclinical setting. Because we've talked\nabout -- oops, excuse me; because we've talked about\nsurgical pain a little bit as well, I'll just\ntouch on that briefly. There's only been about seven\nstudies that have been done in the acute or surgical\npain setting, and unlike in the\nchronic pain space, there's pretty much no\nevidence that cannabinoids that have been tested thus far\nare effective in this setting. But similarly to the\nchronic pain studies, fairly limited in length. Many of them actually use\nnovel cannabinoid compounds that have CB1 intoxication\npsychoactive effects. And none of these\nstudies used CBD. And given that there's actually\na CBD clinical trial that came out in the last week, that there\nwas a lot of excitement about it because it seemed to decrease\n-- what am I trying to say, it seemed to decrease\ncravings and anxiety related to heroin addiction\nand recovery in people who were ex-heroin users. There's a lot of excitement\nabout using it potentially as an opioid sparing medication,\npotentially in a surgical space, or as an opioid substitute,\nagain just CBD alone. Okay. So in summary, then,\nwe know that cannabinoids and chronic pain, that\nthey do that plausibility for therapeutic value. We know that dosing\nis really important, and we know that using them in the right people\nis also important. We need to consider how much to\nuse, because we want to figure out that sweet spot\non that u-shaped curve so we don't overshoot\nan effective dose. We want to know about\ncannabinoid content, THC versus CBD, and then the\nadministration groups as well, because smoking all day\nevery day probably is not an effective strategy. But it's possible\nthat you could think of using a long-acting\nform of a cannabis compound like an edible, and then have -- or a capsule, and\nthen having something for short-term great\nfor pain relief. So actually I was just talking to Evan Latinas [assumed\nspelling], my colleague at [inaudible] Medicine,\nand something that they do is they give people\nCBD alone for the daytime, and if people have\nissues with sleeping, they give them a little bit\nof THC with CBD at nighttime to help with that, as well\nas the CBD [inaudible] for your pain, starting\nat very low doses so that people can avoid\ngetting too high, incidentally, by taking a product that they\ndon't know what's in it or one that has too much THC. So I guess along\nthose lines, then, some practical tips would then\nbe to start low and go slow; so again, those low doses\nso you don't overshoot, using a verifiable source with\ncredible third-party testing so you know what you're getting and you're avoiding heavy\nmetals, pesticides, et cetera. And then because we know that smoking is really\nnot probably a good way to ingest medicine\nif you can avoid it, using other administration\ngroups that are available, tinctures, capsules, vaporizing\nif somebody absolutely feels that they have to inhale,\nthings of that nature. And using a combination\nof CBD and THC, because using just\nTHC alone seems to have a much lower toxic\nthreshold for psychosis and potentially other\nadverse events, than using that combination\ntogether. And actually, Dan and I\npublished a paper in \"Annals of Internal Medicine\"\nwith a commentary of how we think people should be\nusing these compounds from more of a harm reduction standpoint\nand on a safety standpoint. And if anybody's\ninterested in that, I'm happy to send it your way. So with that, I know I'm at the\nend of my time, I'd be happy to take any questions. \"And thanks so much for\nyour kind attention. [ Applause ]", "W8eOkNvE9Gg": "[Music] hi everybody dr. mark here in this video I want to talk a little bit about cannabis but more specifically talk about one of its chemical components that we term CBD also known as cannabidiol now the reason why I'm doing this video is because there's a lot of talk at the moment mainly online about the potential therapeutic benefits of certain components of cannabis such as CBD so what I've done is I've evaluated the evidence within the scientific literature and I'm going to talk about what it may be beneficial for and what the evidence does not suggest it's beneficial for at all so first thing is that cannabis also known as marijuana has around about 400 different chemicals inside of it and of these 400 chemicals 120 or what we term cannabinoids now the term cannabinoids because they bind to specific receptors in our body that are termed cannabinoid receptors and this endocannabinoid system that we have within our body plays a number of a multitude of different roles such as involved in sleep-wake cycles mood appetite pain memory a whole bunch of different things okay and so a hundred twenty chemicals within cannabis has been shown to bind to these receptors and have a variety of effects depending on what subtype of receptor it's bound to now of these 120 cannabinoids you've probably heard of these two THC and CBD they're the two most abundant and you'll find that THC is tetrahydrocannabinol and that is the psychoactive component and CBD which is cannabidiol is the non psychoactive component probably to be more specific you would say that THC gives you that high and is intoxicating and that CBD does not give you that high and is not intoxicating alright you've probably heard a CBD being taken as an oil that's probably the most common way that individuals take CBD but what I want to talk about is what does the literature state about its therapeutic use alright first thing is this the evidence demonstrates this again I'm just talking about CBD I'm not talking about cannabis as a whole whether it be smoked or vaporized or whatever it may be I'm just talking CBD as a chemical first line of evidence suggests within the literature that it is beneficial for childhood seizures not just any childhood seizures but severe childhood seizures that often fit under these two categories of gervais syndrome and lennox-gastaut syndrome now these two types of seizures disorders are severe and are within children and CBD has been shown to be beneficial for these seizures so they've actually turned CBD into a drug a medication that can be taken and therefore there is a therapeutic benefit for these particular syndromes it's also been shown to be beneficial for chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting and also for anorexia associated with HIV so there's a tick there that CBD has been beneficial for those particular disorders now the range of effects downstream that a lot of other people are talking about is that for pain and inflammation neurodegeneration cancer and anxiety and depression let's talk about these firstly chronic pain so we know that cannabinoids or cannabinoid receptors when stimulated can play a role in pain and pain management however what we find is that the current studies looking at the role of CBD and chronic pain the evidence is quite poor that it's beneficial okay so it's not strong at all there's animal models and what we call in vitro in dish models which show that there's some benefit and influencing or mitigating pain but unfortunately the evidence for humans is not that strong for its use in chronic pain we need more human studies more clinical trials what about for anti-inflammation well again the animal models and the in vitro work is promising that it does play a role in anti-inflammation as an anti-inflammatory agent but again we need more human clinical trials to state where the CBD is actually beneficial for inflammation what about neuro degeneration here I'm talking about Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease again the models are promised thing that it may have some benefit but again more human studies are required you may be sitting there thinking oh god what are you on about this is what we need when you take a drug that helps you it only helps you because it's been proven multiple times within clinical trials okay required cancer in actual fact there's no evidence to support that it's beneficial in the treatment of cancers okay and the last one which I haven't popped down here is that for anxiety and depression there is some evidence out there some tentative evidence to suggest that it may be beneficial for treating anxiety and sleep disorders potentially depression but again we need more controlled clinical trials so at the moment the evidence suggests that CBD is beneficial for severe childhood seizures specifically of these particular types of syndromes and chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting but the evidence is poor for everything else that is the current evidence for CBD", "aG7CRdTARLM": "hey everybody thanks for following our channel this is Catherine from French Broad cannabis we're a formulator and manufacturer of CBD and herbal products in Brevard North Carolina today I want to talk to you about something that I am really passionate about and that is CBD selves I use selves every day I would say that they are my favorite CBD product I like them because they work where you put them so whether you just worked out or maybe you're just sore or just anytime you've got something that's targeted maybe like you know just one area that's something you can point to you and touch there's a lot of different kinds of selves on the market I really like some ones that have hello but oil in them the reason for that is that jojoba oil really mimics the skin and the oils in the skin so it passes the skin barrier very well which means that it's a great carrier oil for selves and for CBD which is oil soluble so there's a lot of different stuff on the market you can get stuff that's like hot coals like something you know that kind of cools your skin and then there's ones that are for sensitive skin those are the ones that I like the most there's ones that are just kind of regular selves that hit a larger market maybe if if you don't like hot cold or have sensitive skin you can just go with it selves that you just want to make sure that it doesn't contain any month all if you don't like that hot cold feeling but there's not a lot of research out there to prove or have any real understanding of efficacy of selves that being said the empirical data and the data from folks actually using it like subjective data is huge the selves are one of the best sellers here they're the best sellers and a lot of shops that I and the reason for that is that they work really quickly they're often also combined with other ingredients like arnica oil or camphor and these sorts of things that are also used in herbalism for the same type of stuff that you use a CBD or cannabis cell for so this only creates a more complex and efficacious product so just make sure that when you're using salves you find something that's been tested and you want to find something that's batch traced so something that's got some sort of batch number on the bottom a good company will have a website that you can go to that has full testing panels on their selves so you'll see that it's got heavy metals testing pesticide testing microbial testing that sort of thing microbial testing is very important in salves because a Staphylococcus or ecoli contamination equal I can happen in cannabis and then as far as Staphylococcus you can introduce that during the formulation stage let's say somebody has a cut on their hand or something like that that's the way that Staphylococcus would get into a finished product and it does stick around so if there is contamination with Staphylococcus it's going to stay in the product so you want to make sure that it's been tested for micro because if you put something that's contaminated on an open area or even an area that you know gets caught later or has a little bit of a you know rash enos to it you could infect your your body through a contaminated product you also want to make sure that it has no pesticides or metals that are above the limit set by the EPA and the Food and Safety Administration's that we have so you aren't putting harmful chemicals on your skin like I said something like I solve especially something that's got jojoba oil as a carrier is going to absorb through your skin so just think about your skin as a big organ and you'll be pulling whatever is in the south into your skin you also want to make sure that they're testing for potency and all of this should be batch traceable so you want to make sure that whatever you're getting is what it says it is and has the documentation to prove it because it's very important what selves I'm just going to give you a little peek of what selves look like this is one of the sobs that we make when you put it on you don't need a lot so it's a you know I'm gonna put on just this much here onto my arm when you apply yourself you're gonna want to kind of gently massage the area to rub it in and also to make sure that you're getting good coverage and that you're not um like leaving any chunks on the skin and then also it'll spread further so that amount just spread from here all the way to here so kind of everywhere that you can see this pink flower and blue on my arm um so you want to make sure that it's kind of a thin layer and then I just like to do like a little bit extra you know massaging the area just to make sure that I'm getting good absorption not everyone likes to do this but I like to kind of try to rest the area after I apply itself that way I can make sure that it's getting some good absorption time rather than you know going out and going for a run right afterwards so I like to apply myself in a time that I'm gonna you know have a little bit of rest maybe like a five-minute sit maybe a lunch break or something like that um salves are really convenient because you can just toss a little salt in your purse that's what I do I've also got a bigger jar you know we have bigger jars and often other companies will have bigger jars as well that you can keep by the bed or something like that at home and it's a lot cheaper to have a bigger jar and a smaller jar that you're pulling from the bigger jar into the smaller jar so I like to get one of each to start and then pull from the bigger jar that way I've got like a little container to put in my purse or maybe you have a little contain from you know a sample of some sort but the bigger jars are always gonna have better price points per milligram and per gram of material so using that to your advantage while still being able hot some thing that's cute and convenient to take with you throughout the day can be really good about storage of sobs you want to be careful how you store yourselves when it's too cold you're not gonna have too much of an issue but when it's too hot you're gonna have a big issue you'll start to get melting you might get onto solution where your cells are so separate from itself so you just want to be careful to store yourselves in a location that isn't gonna have big temperature variation and you want to make sure that the solve you're using stays solid at room temperature there's a lot of solves out on the market that aren't solid at room temperature they're almost kind of like creamy I don't like those selves because when I carry them in my purse if there is a natural temperature variation like throughout the day which there always is in my life because I'm in and out and and you know active so those can melt in my purse and create a big mess or mountain in my car or whatever whenever I am going from place to place and leave my purse in my car or something so you just want to be careful about the selves that you've got when you go into a CBD short shop which I believe is the best place to always buy your CBD you want to ask to try it out and they should have like an open sample of the selves that they're selling so that you can see how it applies and and get to know it make sure it doesn't burn your skin I've had plenty of self starts to irritate my skin so you just kind of want to try it out talk to them for a little while you know dilly-dally in the store and just see how it feels you know give it a couple minutes before you purchase that way you're getting to know your product if you're buying online you know that's the best way that you have available to you that's fine I would just start with a smaller amount to make sure that that solves going to work for you before buying a bigger bottle and then purchase the bigger bottle once you know all is good for you because there are a lot of stuff out there is a lot of products out on the market I would also say stay away from anything that's got chemicals in it if you can't pronounce or know the word that's on the ingredient list chances are it's unnatural and that there aren't there isn't a reason for it in your product so you can make a really good CVD solve with no chemicals at all with only natural ingredients so chemicals um companies that are using chemicals and ourselves are putting unnecessary ingredients and a lot of them are purchasing a base like a lotion base or south base from a company and then using that by adding just CBD in it I don't suggest going with those companies first of all that's not like an artisan brand there's not a lot of love in that and secondly there's just no reason for those chemicals so you're you know you're putting things on your skin that you really don't need to be and a natural product in my opinion is always gonna be better for me and just aligns with my morals better and and in with who I support and and what industries I support so if you've got any questions about selves you want to choose a solve you don't know what the best one is or maybe you don't know if a solve is right for you just go ahead and reach out to us we're happy to talk to you about that and you know maybe it's just worth a try like I said if you can point to an issue on your body and say you know that's the problem right here then a solve is probably good for that it's really worth a try people find that anything that's a targeted issue responds really well to a sell when you're using solves you're going to have to reapply it throughout the day it's not going to work as long as like a capsule or something like that um so you are gonna want to have it with you maybe apply like every two hours or something that's what I normally find but for me some days I don't need it at all in some days I need it five times a day on average I used to solve about three times a day one time you know maybe around 11:00 one time around 2:00 and then one time around 5:00 or at that time so to help me sleep and I really liked it for this area the the neck and shoulders just because that area tends to just give me trouble so I like to put it kind of on my back but you can get somebody to help you apply it or just put it wherever you think fit make sure that you're only using salves on external surfaces and don't put it on open areas like cuts or wounds all right give us a reach out to us give us a follow and let me know if you have any questions about selves we've got a great team on board that can answer your questions and is passionate about product and they're happy to answer any questions you have all right see you soon", "_cto3i1mVkk": "STATEHOUSE HEARD EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY ON A BILL THAT

with a little CBD that's the non psychoactive component of marijuana for a few extra bucks they'll actually add 4 drops of water soluble non psychoactive CBD we have seen you write it samples here how far have we come in 10 years the rules pretty great well now morning pick-me-up like this is yeah I know right make it very clear he's not teaching and CBD and interestingly enough the first medication has been approved with CBD in it and so this is something that medicinally speaking may have a a future as far as in your coffee is this a buzzer but taste health faith a little lavender in there it has a little bit of a taste like oregano a little bit I call it the marijuana taste have you ever hear if you ever smells the one either there's mocha marijuana there's a definitive smell really look I'm gonna give this a bust and for one reason only it's it's give me a minute $7.25 and I will say that regardless of where you stand on marijuana the one concern I have is they are now adding it to everything so this is going to become one of those things where everything will have it added to it and I am just a believer in you have your coffee for a little pick-me-up where you enjoy the coffee boil your if you want your CPD go ahead and have that but and I guess the the idea is that the CBD is sort of going to a little bit of a yin and yang for some people that coffee they like the taste they like a little pick-me-up but they get a little too jittery for example the CBD cuts that and starting the morning with a little steamy I mean if you're just drink water for zero bucks this is like two coffees so for the next day why not but and then CBD relaxes you so in the morning when you wake up do you really you drink coffee because you want a stimulant not to be relaxed

story of a young boy who is now seizure free because of the oil for some patients who experience multiple seizures a day CBD oil appears to be helping that's what we're seeing in families like the Eagles of Lockhart we do want to warn you though some of the video in the story may be difficult to watch ready oh good try it's always a full house over at the Eagles we are all cnames we are Chad CJ Clark Kellen and Conway and the dogs are chaos and crypto this is Kalin he's the middle child he makes everybody else smile taking a closer look around the house you'll notice things that may seem out of place my life is full of gates and walls and and barriers a lot of locks and latches were through like TV number three now because of a throne milk Cup most of our self is screwed into the walls or screwed to the floor the family even installed this sensory room just for Kalin here and when you have an 8 year old body with a 2 year old mentality he can reach a lot of things that a 2 year old can't and this happy energetic boy you see here Mama's right here mommy's right here Kalin has a rare genetic condition called KC and b1 and he's one of about 65 kids in the world diagnosed with us they don't fully understand the ramifications Helen but it is epilepsy is a huge component of the disorder Kalin his mother says he started having seizures at about 17 months old and mom was right here from there began having seventy to a hundred of them each day also causing him to become nonverbal those would also knock him down and kind of he would sleep the rest of the day things began to change though once the family got their first dose of CBD oil back in June and has been seizure-free since starting that medication and this past Christmas we went to see Santa what did Santa say

cultivation for their CBD oil doses the dispensary has now been open for one year and Manchaca delivering across the state 2018 was a transformational year for us for for our business and frankly for the cannabis industry in Texas a compassionate cultivation the plant is grown cultivated harvested and the crude oil is extracted refined and tested until ready to go to patients suffering from in chargeable epilepsy rarely in your career do you get a chance to participate I just witness but participate something that's truly transformational with the passing of the recent federal farm bill industrial hemp production will be made not only legal but cheaper it will also be managed by the Department of Agriculture as a crop Denton says compassionate cultivation goes through a very thorough process to make sure patients get nothing less than the best form of CBD oil and hopes there are steps done to make sure all organizations are doing the same and he's not alone will that make regulation so we'll have to inspect test make sure that it's not you know contaminated with too much THC Commissioner Miller was very outspoken about the farm bills passing but solely for the sake of helping Texas farmers and families like the Hegel's let me just make this very plain this is not backdoor you know to grow in weed or marijuana that's not what this is this is about producing a lot of products over 2,500 products made from him the one that that's the hottest right now and people are most interested in is medicinal uses like CBD or but while the Eagles have been met with challenges

nerve pain in my feet that happened about eight years ago and because of that I was prescribed a medicine called gabapentin which is a nerve pain medication and ever since that happened to me I really wanted to find a more herbal and natural way of relieving my nerve pain so I did a little bit of research online looked over hundreds and hundreds of pages and I found out about CBD oil so I went and tried to find the nearest place I could find it and then my friend tagged me in a video a green Lotus hip video actually online and I went to their website they had tons and tons of information more than any other CBD oil I had researched before and I decided to order both the cap gels and the hemp heat cream I use the hip heat cream to deep penetrate into my feet and it's great for a long long day of work while I'm on my feet and running out and then I'll take the cap gels before I go to bed and it kind of it helps me sleep through the pain with me being a type one diabetic it really affects pretty much every aspect of my life wake up I I try to be more than that going through life being more than just a diabetic and persevering through everything that life throws at me and music has been the number one thing that's helped me be more than just a diabetic that might be a part of my life but with with music and being able to get up every day and write it's given me purpose and

I will leave how to make cannabutter in the description box below so you can go look at that video after or before and Super simple to make it's really nice for inflammation, pain it's a lotion it's not a salve there's a lot of videos out there in that say lotion but it's a salve so a lotion is 75% water and 25% oil so it goes on nice and That goes on like a lotion it absorbs nicely and yeah, so we'll get into the video right now So here is the infused coconut oil. I will leave a Description of that in the box below and so what you'll need is 2 x 8 ounce containers. It does make 16 ounces And you'll need two heat safe measuring cups. Preferably larger ones at least one large one you want to be mixing in that one and you'll need two thermometers and a hand blender Rubbing alcohol is super important when you're making a lotion because of contamination. So you want to just Sanitize anything that comes in contact with your lotion including your thermometers forks of the blender The bowl itself, spoons just cover ground so you avoid any sort of bacterial growth And so here is the oil things. We will be using the cannabutter (cannabis butter) I'm setting it to ounces So you'll want to keep the temperature to 70 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, and this just ensures that The oils have properly melted, it reduces contamination and it helps to emulsify. So keep track of the time and a temperature I'm just pouring the oil into the water, but you could pour the water into the oil I'll be using the blender here Just follow the instructions on that and it will be mixing here for a good two minutes on two minutes off two minutes on For a good like 10 minutes and here the consistency has turned into a lotion it is really nice and creamy and So at this point you could try using a funnel. I tried just I sort of mix it a bit too much in a way and not thick so Here, I'm just using my own piping bag. Well a makeshift one and I will be squeezing it into the containers And so the squeeze bottles are the way to go because it reduces contamination That is it on how to make your own cannabis lotion. It's really easy to make it is a two-step process So I will link the video in the description box below and I will link it here As well if you want to learn how to make that I'm pretty good for different types of things I mean, it's just a generally a nice moisturizer for your body, but you can use it on inflammation If you have like any sort of eczema or psoriasis, I personally have psoriasis Scalp psoriasis and it's going on my forearm, but I've noticed that it actually helps with the itchiness. It seems to tame down the inflammation It's good for pain neuropathy pain sore muscle so really broad spectrum use Yeah, it absorbs really nicely the lotion There we go it doesn't go on really greasy it absorbs really nicely The last lotion that I made was specifically for dry hands. So if you do have dry hands like me Check that out really nice video for that. So I hope you guys have a good day And I will see you guys in the next video. Okay.

pepper turmeric I'm using coconut oil as my carrier oil my own beeswax that I cleaned and filtered myself so and I'm going to be using the stove top method the double boiler method so let me get this see so it's gonna here to use one cup of carrier oil which is the I'm using coconut oil you can even use olive oil so let me get this started to put in the pan here okay and I'm going to so you're only going to put in the double boiler the carrier oil and the spices you're not going to add the beeswax until the end so I'm gonna be doing one tablespoon are these the cutest I have a teaspoon convection heat so one teaspoon of cayenne pepper I mean one tablespoon I'm sorry one tablespoon fix this [Music] so one tablespoon of cayenne one tablespoon of ginger root powder one tablespoon of turmeric and then you're gonna put this over a double boiler and you're gonna let it go for about a half hour 30 minutes to 40 minutes about a half hour or so okay so I have everything in the pan I'm gonna put it over the double boiler um you can let this go up to an hour the lower and the slower it brings out more of the wonderful medicinals in the spices so I'm gonna let this sit here and i'ma let it melt and we'll be back okay so this has been going about 45 minutes see that that's the part you're gonna want to get out in the cheesecloth I don't have a cheesecloth but what I do use is a white cotton flour sack you put this down put some clips on here to hold it [Music] then you're gonna rinse this pan out because this is the pan you're gonna now put it up on the stove and you're going to put the beeswax in it [Music] okay so let's see here so this is this is dripping pretty well so I'm gonna just squeeze this out carefully sorry about that sorry sorry sorry ok so I got it all out sorry about the camera falling over so all the spices are inside this now you also can make a second batch with these same spices if you want to set that over there how clear that is now so now I'm going to be adding actually I didn't need to clean that pan out I used another one oh I wasn't thinking okay so this is gonna go on the stove in the double boiler and add the quarter cup of beeswax now you don't have to add the beeswax you can just keep this in a jar and decide what you want to do with it later it's alright it's fine you know you know you're just adding the beeswax to make your bone your hands okay so after you cut it all out you just put that you don't have to put the beeswax in if you don't want to just keep it as massage oil if you want to if it works very good as a on the spot treatment and you can even put it in a roll-on so then in the double boiler they're going to put the beeswax and the infused oil and you're gonna let it melt and you can even add essential oils to it but then after it melts then you're going to be putting it in your jars your right back okay so I wanted to show you what the spices look like I guess I did squeeze all the water out see how powdery it is that's what you're gonna straight yeah wring out of the cheesecloth or your rag or whatever you use okay all the beasts wax is melted I [Music] brought an extra jar out just in case now this doesn't have to be at the you can fill it to the top or pay close to the top if you want perfect okay that's it so this is my ginger cayenne salve you use this when you have aches and pains let me tell you the recipe again really quick actually let me show it to you well you can't see that I'll hold it up here that's all you need right there you first have to make the infusion and that's the part where I use the coconut oil and I did the double boiler method so if you didn't get all this I'm going to also put it in the comment section of the video so all you do I don't need that now we just let it cool it's kind of hardened you'll just be able to dig it out and rub it on your hands if you if you have arthritis if you have a pulled muscle anything like that so we'll let it cool before put the lid on and we will be back when it's harden okay there it is beautiful beautiful beautiful and the reason I put them in the matching size jars I'm taking these to the fair so I'll be looking for a blue ribbon on this one so when you go to use it say you strained your knee you have a backache you have arthritis in your hands you're just gonna you know get some out and you're gonna put it on your hand just like you would your regular lotion make sure you label your jar date it and put what it is and these make awesome Christmas gifts or you know Get Well gifts anything like that people that you know in your life and have arthritis or you know aches and pains that's just perfect for them so I'm gonna put the recipe in the comment section you can also google the cayenne SAFF there's different variations of it you can also add essential oil with this I don't do that I just let the cayenne and the turmeric and the ginger do what they're supposed to do so anyway any questions put them in the comments prep em out have a cool day", "V-_945QVfU0": "THAT'S WHEN MARCOS AND TWO OFFICERS WENT TUMBLING DOWN SEVERAL ROWS OF SEATS NO ONE WAS HURT.

we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "sjITVewsEy4": "hi everyone its Meg Nordmann with household hemp your trusted source for all things CBD where I will be giving you reviews every week on a new product we've got about 30 products slated right now to start giving you reviews on and the first one I want to talk about is indica this is their wrong and boil it was the first oil that I tried and it's what started me down the rabbit hole of starting household him actually I loved it so much I had my first drop of CBD oil and my best sleep that it had in two and a half years and so I reached out to the company with my idea for household ham we made some great friends and they sent me some more products to try and first here's the robbing of oil and this is about just so that how much I personally take and I started off with even smaller amount than that and eventually increased and lock down my sweet spot and that's about how much I need four really great nicely it's my anxiety which we know all the moms need help with and then my second favorite thing which was probably tied as a first favorite if you have the money just getting both of them and you'll thank me is their South here and all of their ingredients are natural you can recognize them all it's the CBD coconut oil beeswax lemon oil citral vanilla and buy money nothing with red flags there you can see hopefully here you can see where I've just been dipping my finger into the same spot and I treat this thing like medicine for myself it is 750 milligrams and it is just an oily nough swen you rub it it's just an opening this on your finger my neck always has tension I don't wanna waste it and since it doesn't spread very far I mean the willingness just is like right where your finger rubs I just put it on the most acute spot and then what I like to do is pair it up there whipped body butter so this one has more it's very very faint lemon / vanilla ingredients and this one is a little bit more like cocoa and it spreads much easier as you can see I just got a whole dollop on mine and it's a little bit more firm if you keep it in the frigerator but it is literally 82 degrees in my house right now cuz i live in florida and i like to keep the windows open so anyway this I liked on top of whatever location I've put the South cuz it just spreads so much easier and so in about 20 minutes the tension in my neck is going to be gone I put this on joint pains muscle pains and it's been clinically proven CBD to be really great for skin and that's what they market face-forward is actually a foreskin and I have used it for my child's eczema my toddler had horrible eczema from four months old until two and a half years old but yeah so I put this out on the worst spots of her eczema and then rubbed body butter on top within 24 hours it was gone after spending probably hundreds of dollars on steroid creams and every kind of eczema cream you could imagine my friends made essential oil creams nothing really worked some things would like reduce the flare but not like what this DVD did it's completely gone so I have before and after pictures of that on my blog and household and the ingredients here very similar let's see shea butter palm oil cocoa seed butter the CBD coconut oil tapioca vanilla beeswax and find me again all very natural and trusted ingredients and then you've got the lip balm which is very similar ingredients to this almost identical and so it's really just that's in this convenient format you can drop it in your makeup bag oh here's a little fara she was tired of being alone in her Walker so yeah so talking about the lip balm here and with CBD being so amazing for your skin you can imagine you're just like it was just amazing how supple and soft your lips are after that the next thing is the chewing gum here let me open that up for you so let's see what that looks like paper and it's made with real gum like from the tree in the rainforest Chiclets gum from the rainforest xylitol from birch trees wild peppermint mint sunflower seeds and hemp oil so again all natural ingredients and everything is organic they they grow their own hemp on organic certified land their whole facility is organic certified I hope I'm saying that correctly and their third party lab tested and they have their certificates on their website call all the labs and actually talk to them about it and so I just this is one of the brands that I just trust the most and that's for the gum it is like what our grandparents probably chewed it's not like the kind of gum that you would pick up in fancy wild colors at the gas station or at the checkout line it is real gum so after about 20 to 30 minutes of chewing it it kind of starts to break down and just and spit that out if you try to take it out with your fingers it's gonna stick to your fingers again and that's not a bad thing I'm just setting up your expectations and because it is real gum and the reason for putting CBD and a gum is because of that bioavailability so you know I talked about putting this beneath your tongue because it's so thin on the sides of your cheeks and underneath your tongue the CBD can just soak right in and so this is just the gum while you're chewing I'm not gonna chew on one video that's gross but oh you're chewing that CBD is just in all of the right places and so it's just going to soak into you immediately and that would be a great way to get the effects that you're looking for the therapeutic effects as quick as possible so I've had a couple of very anxious days we're here I've never been very glad to have this sitting on my bookshelf yeah chewed my gum the last thing is the CBD crystals this is the one thing I have not actually tried yet I plan on doing a separate video I'm gonna try it because it's just pure CBD it's 99% CBD isolate a bit and show you this package here can't really reach with the baby in my arm looks like makeup it's very pretty packaging and if you could see in the bottom then it's like kind of like white salt anyway so anyway you can make anything with this and uni CBD thing that you want to make you make your own salad your own oil your own bombs you can just get really creative with that fine so excited about it I am planning on doing gummy bears I want to that makes me becoming bears at home so stay tuned for that video 5 stars Holocaust for this one everything has worked and exceeded my expectations truly I'm so glad that I was introduced to CVD through indica first I think it's set up quite a good bar to compare other brands to and if you want to see the floor of you head over to my blog about before and after pictures for everything I've used it for from scalp issues to eczema issues to stuff on my face on my dog diaper rash oops and so it's been pretty amazing and I have got a very lengthy detailed blog about it if you have any

to tell you about so I hope to see you again next week and we'll talk soon", "Dncnf1mNTpA": "so what exactly is in these cbd products mimit uh and i met up at a lab here in los angeles a few weeks ago because we wanted to find out take a look our teams managed to obtain some vials of cbd being sold by several different companies claiming to have our endorsement we send them to dr pedram sullenpoor to be tested at a lab we want to know exactly what is in this alleged cbd it's time to get to the bottom of this dr salampur how are you how are you thank you very much for coming can i show you around we'll follow you fantastic quite a large operation thank you so this is where the testing is done for thc cbd all of the cannabinoids all of the pesticides there are 66 of them that we test for and all of the heavy metals what's really important to remember is that cbd is regulated by the fda for only one drug epidiolex and that's for two rare childhood seizure disorders for everything else it's the wild wild west so you test these things here that aren't regulated and you're looking for what over here so over here we're looking for heavy metals right cadmium arsenic mercury lead pesticides and those things show up in a lot of the cbd products that come through here unfortunately they do because remember hemp is a bioaccumulator so whatever is in the ground gets sucked up into that plant if there's lead in the ground it's going to get sucked up into the plant and whatever gets sucked up into the plant is going to end up in the final product unless it's intentionally taken out what have you found in general we have found pesticides in general we have found heavy metals we have found mycotoxins aspergillus causes aspergilloma in patients that are immune compromised that can wreak havoc some of the people that are seeking this out are already immune compromised then they're especially vulnerable to the heavy metals the pesticides in particular to the fungus that you just mentioned because it grows like these big moth balls in your lungs takes over your breathing ability it can kill you it can burn its weight in the arteries it means horrible death i had no idea you were finding those kinds of elements as well it's just sloppy they're not bothering because they don't care about the people they're just a checkbook they're a credit card yeah they just want their money they don't care about the consequences and when if a consequence arises they're gone i mean they're like trying to sack fog you can't find them they just poof remember testing for this stuff isn't cheap one of these things costs half a million dollars this is the same kind of equipment that tests baby formula so what you're describing costs money and there's a financial incentive if you don't have to to not do it and then they're using our names to validate it fraudulently it doesn't cost them anything to steal our names they don't have to pay you money to test it appropriately it's cash cash cash which is all they're seeing dollar signs when they're talking to people that ask us for advice well when you skip steps and steal names it's easy it's all profit that's right so was there actually cbd at the level that's supposed to be in these products there often is not as much cbd as they purport to put in there because cbd can be very expensive it can cost close to ten thousand dollars a pound for the cbd so you can imagine there's a pretty significant economic disincentive not to put cbd in the product if you don't have to and no one's going to check could you take us through the actual products that we said absolutely sure so we tested a product that came to us from someone that was purporting to have you be their spokesperson but the test that we did on this failed it failed because it is not safe for human consumption under any circumstance it failed because it was too high in its lead content in lead in lead 15 times higher than safe levels 500 times higher than our level of detection okay 15 times higher than safe so this isn't a close call this is highly toxic highly toxic and very dangerous because lead accumulates and again because nobody takes just one of these pills or one droplet this is stuff that people use continuously it's interesting that one of the products that we brought here that tested positive for lead 15 times above acceptable level is called verified verified like we've checked this but we did verify yeah do you have a story or a question for me click the link in the description and tell me what in the world is going on you", "xsg-LbxlGao": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to talk about can CBD oil help with depression now full disclosure we sell CBD oil on our website a cure botanicals calm that we make from hemp that we grow on our farm so I guess it's a little bit like asking a barber if you need a haircut but all I'm gonna do here is share my story and what's worked for me I also want to say that none of this is medical advice this is just my experience and what's worked for me in my life with that being said let's get into it so I think I first started noticing feelings of being down when I was probably 9 or 10 and I didn't even know what it was at the time and it wasn't until I was maybe 12 years old I started getting these really sharp shooting pain headaches like I called them lightening headaches B couldn't know what was going on and so I remember 12 years old and I started researching on the internet what this was and I finally found a website that said that it could be related to depression and before then I had never even considered myself to be depressed I'd never even never even crossed my mind started talking to somebody and then they said yeah I think you should go on some medication so they prescribed me Zoloft and they had to keep upping the the medication dosage and they said if this doesn't work for you we're gonna have to put you on antipsychotics luckily that dosage of zola off actually worked enough to where we didn't need to take that route however you know the depression didn't go away it was always sort of there and just maybe wasn't as deeply felt and as I got into high school I discovered cannabis and that actually really helped with with depression and insomnia fast forward I go to college I begin drinking I begin experimenting with pills like benzodiazepines which is an anti-anxiety med things like klonopin which changes your brain chemistry to where your brain is then dependent on these drugs it can't really function without them you know that kind of led me down this path of of substance abuse and dependence and and felt no joy and felt no hope and was just at about his rock bottom as I think I could give where I just realized that something needed to change and I'd say that's probably the first step is determining that you want to change and I know people are gonna say it's not that easy look I know it's not that easy that's just the first step it's just creating that intention in your life to say but I want to take steps to try to get better the first action the simplest action that you can take is start eating healthy I cannot stress how important that is and and I didn't realize it for so long it I was eating crap I was I mean in college I was living off of things like hot dogs and pasta and beer and that was like my diet I mean it was just putting crap food I mean 25 cent burritos just the worst food you could buy just putting it into my body and always wondered why I had no energy and why I was always depressed again this all comes down to brain chemistry and your brain chemistry is very dependent on what you're putting in your body if you eat like crap you're gonna feel like crap so the first and simplest thing you can do is change your diet and eat something I eat a diet that is rich in fresh fruits and vegetables lean protein just overall healthy food limit the junk food limit the alcohol intake and you will notice a big difference right off a bat that's the first thing easiest thing you can do step number two konna ties into that and that's to get active to exercise and if you can if you can do that exercise outside I think there's an added benefit to being outdoors breathing in fresh air and and being under the Sun the Sun is good for endorphins and I want to say when I was getting off of all my medication like you can't just cut it off cold turkey so this was a battle for me I had to go down sliver by sliver and the way I did that was I worked out like a maniac I mean I would go to the gym and I would just go hardcore for about two hours completely exhaust myself but what I was doing and I didn't even know it at the time but what I was doing was rebuilding my brain chemistry I was releasing those those chemicals naturally so that I didn't need to get them from a he'll third thing I would recommend is to develop some sort of a spiritual practice now this could be prayer meditation this could be sitting quietly in the woods this could be finding a way to just serve others I believe serving others is a form of spiritual practice and what that does is it gives us a sense of purpose it gives us a sense of meaning it gives us a sense of community and you know it kind of helps tape the focus off yourself which when you're in that state can really be useful because when you're in it it's like a negative loop pattern you've got these negative thoughts that just keep on circulating and they wear you down I mean it's just non-stop all day from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep and a lot of times you can't even sleep because they keep on going around and around I've been there I understand I mean just trying to do random acts of kindness if helping people at this point is a little overwhelming I get it that's why I would suggest develop some sort of a meditation you know there's so many guided meditation practices out there which I think really help until you can kind of get into the flow yourself and and just trying to establish that sort of calm that peace that quietness fourth thing that I would recommend doing is surround yourself with good people you need to surround yourself with positive influences and you need to cut out all the negative influences in your life now that might sound really harsh these could be people that have been friends or even family members that are maybe just constant negativity and you know they say misery loves company but all that company does is keep both people miserable so you know it almost becomes a codependent relationship with two miserable people keeping each other miserable and that's not good for anybody focus on the people that bring positivity encouragement and love into your life you know find people with common interests join a meetup group volunteer your time we as humans need that we are tribal people and we need support from other humans especially in times of hardship and that's why I would say definitely find a group of people that can encourage you and kind of pick you up when you get down now the fifth thing I want to touch on is supplements now I left this one for last and this guy's back to our original question can CBD oil help with depression CBD oil is a supplement right and so I feel like yes it can absolutely it can but it's not a magic bullet what CBD oil does for me now personally when I take it is I typically feel within about five to ten minutes and it's sort of just this like it'll kind of just bring things a little bit more into focus calm my mind down enough to where I can think clearly and that's the thing we go back to these negative loop patterns when you're just in that you can't see any way out of it and you can't even begin to uncover what's really bothering you so none of this is a magic bullet none of this is easy but what I believe supplements like CBD oil could do is just maybe give you the tools to begin unpacking some of that baggage and getting in there and and really trying to figure out what is actually going on and it's really hard to do when your mind is just in these constant negative loop patterns a lot of times people from the outside might look and say what's what's the matter what's what's so bad and the thing is is they can't see it because they're not in it and you can't see any way out of it because you're so stuck in it you have no other perspective I want to make this very clear that if you are suffering from depression it is not a sign of weakness in fact it's oftentimes a sign of greatness and I believe that once you do overcome it you have a tremendous amount of power from having gone through it so keep that in mind you know I am the person I am today because I went through these things and I wouldn't change it because to be honest I never thought I could be this happy I mean I really didn't and so for me I'm incredibly grateful for everything in my life because I've gone through it because I've seen the other side and know that things do get better and I want to encourage you if you know somebody who is currently suffering with depression please share this video with them and I'm gonna put my email in the cop in the description down below and and anybody out there who's watching this who's suffering with depression shoot I want to help I want to help other people get through this because I feel so incredibly fortunate to have come out on the other side and I want to do whatever I can again if you're interested in CBD oil you can check out our website at Caribou tanika's com I don't care if you buy it from us or even if you take it at all I think you can get through this without it but I do believe that it is an extra tool that can help kind of get things moving in the right direction find a trusted source make sure that they're doing testing make sure that it's a pure product and and just kind of go from there because there's a lot of snake oil out there and I wouldn't want you to to try it and then say oh this doesn't work and you've wasted your money I know that it works but you got to be getting it from a good source anyway thank you guys for watching I'll see y'all next time if you guys like this video and you'd like to see more like it leave us a comment down below and don't forget to hit the subscribe

Gabrielle did you eat [ __ ] Oh", "pMMfp7lEyB0": "CBD is taking over the wellness industry the Center for medicinal cannabis says the UK is home to six million CBD users who take it in supplements cosmetics and vape liquids and with some of the best known pharmacies and health shops stocking up UK sales alone are expected to exceed 1 billion a year by 2025 advocates claim CBD can help with a seemingly endless list of conditions from anxiety to acne but what exactly is CBD does it make you high and most importantly to the bold claims behind these wellness products actually stand up to science CBD more formally known as cannabidiol is the cannabis extract but no that doesn't mean it can get you high so that's THC THC is the primary psychoactive component in in cannabis THC and CBD are both cannabinoids in the cannabis plant they differ because THC is intoxicating and CBD isn't and it has produces very little side effects to better understand health claims it's useful to split CBD into two categories wellness CBD and medical CBD wellness CBD products are available off the shelf in health shops and pharmacies CBD oil is one of the more popular ones but it's also made its way into shower gels bottled water gummies and even tampons people claim that the wellness DVD helps with general aches and pains anxiety daily stresses and sleep but there's little evidence to say that it actually does help with this and now the NSA is cracking down on the sale of wellness CBD products under a law they're classified as normal foods this means the claims that they make and how safe they are need to stand up to testing before they can be authorized for sale there have been a few studies now where they've taken bottles of CBD from health food shops and looked at what's inside them and sometimes they found that there's actually teach seeing them little or no CV some of them have alcohol in them to the level which they could be considered sort of an alcoholic beverage if companies don't adhere to these regulations by March 2021 then their products could be taken off the market the second type of CBD available is medical CBD there are a small number of approved medicines currently available on the NHS that contain much higher doses of CBD and there is some evidence to show that they may be effective at treating certain conditions that's epidural X which is approved for two very rare childhood epilepsies and then there Sativex which is licensed for like pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis only doctors on the specialist registrar can prescribe these on a named patient basis with very little scientific evidence about the effects of wellness CBD and what the shorts or long-term risks are the Food Standards Agency says healthy adults should think carefully before using it and if you're pregnant breastfeeding or taking medication you shouldn't take it at all I also think that when it comes to CBD there's probably a really big placebo effect out there sort of global placebo effect because people are looking for something in their life that can really help them and they're not getting that from their general medications so then they're turning to sort of herbal medications and those having medications should be a quality standard that we all agree upon [Music]", "yRRRaF_BKy8": "today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD based self by Christy wood from by the bay farms [Music] this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compound smells really really good she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not ena constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really important with any product like this we're really any cannabis product I'm going to move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat panic self massage it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the SAP itself I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life [Music] how's it going everybody its Freddie back here today and I'm bringing you a another product review and this time it is not from a dispensary and it is also not a flower or smokeable product so today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD base South by Christie wood from by the bay farms now Christy's located in Buzzards Bay and she was actually kind enough to reach out to me on Instagram and tell me about her products a little bit and she actually sent me some so this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compounds but I'm super interested in stuff like this because I have very little experience actually no experience with topicals so super exciting really something new for me and hopefully seeing as I get a lot of questions about CBD and the different uses for it this can help me and you both learn a little bit more about this really cool cannabinoid that is getting a lot of attention but people don't seem to have as much hands-on experience with as they'd like including me so firstly thank you thank you very much to Christy I really appreciate the generosity and you reaching out to me anybody who reaches out to me you kind of hold a special place in my heart because I put a lot of work into these videos into these reviews and it's a lot of passion as well and I don't mind doing it but whenever anybody shows appreciation that means a lot to me so you Christie and let's get into it so the South a basic basically the ingredients in here are organic coconut oil beeswax cannabis extracts in essential oils so this is a CBD only product as I mentioned before and the directions are essentially to Chris you suggest that you test a small bit of this SAP on your skin before applying it to a larger area just to make sure there's no reactions or interactions with your skin so essentially it's just like a bomb or something that you rub on your skin she recommends Christie does using a spoon to avoid cross-contamination or bacterial growth within the salad self and the recommendation on this page says that you cannot put too much on so there's no overdoing it with this I've used it a little bit the one thing I would say is it can be a little bit oily if you take too much at once so you might have a little bit of that coconut oily residue on your hands if you grab a little too much for a certain area but honestly what I do with it is if I have a little extra on my hands I know this sounds a little weird but I just like run it through my hair I really can you see this stuff being used for almost any use is kind of a skin facial topical sort of healing ointment type menthol icy hot almost type applicator or application would be a good use for this and I I believe that the coconut oils and stuff like that are really good for hair as well this is just a personal thing for me um I have kind of long hair I put products in it and if I have a little extra of this Salib on my hands just run it right through there some people might think that's weird too gross or greasy but I don't know I think it's natural smells really really good I have to say maybe the aroma the aroma therapy qualities of this stuff might be one of its strongest uses for me or the aroma therapy aromatherapy qualities if that's even a word are some of my favorite parts of the self so when I have it in my hands or on the spoon I just kind of inhale it or just hold up my hands and kind of breathe deeply and that just seems to be a really nice kind of calming effect for me that could be in my head but whatever works for you works for you right so I'm not here to judge and hopefully you aren't either so yeah this stuff is awesome I've been using it pretty much daily Christie recommends using it about 6 to 10 times a day for the first few weeks constant application seems to be the method to the madness with this stuff so getting a baseline of just like any medication really you know getting a baseline of it in your system or on your skin will help you get used to it and will help you reap the benefits from it a little bit faster and more holy so 6 - time 6 to 10 times a day apply it to whichever areas you feel you need it the most and after that you can start to decrease the dosage that you put on according to Christie so she mentions specifically at the end of this little blurb she's written me that she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not enough so if you want to purchase this stuff from Christie or you're thinking about checking it out be wary you're not going to you know put it on one time like some snake oil and immediately be cured of all your ailments it's not how any medicine really works so constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really is really important with any product like this notice how you feel before during and after an experience with something like this or really any cannabis product because that's how you really can you know see the effects because they're not always immediate they're not always super extravagant at first but when you implement cannabis and cannabis infused products into your life daily the little steps it makes over a long period of time make a huge difference so that's what I try to tell people is you know don't expect a one-time care because those don't exist in life but kind of weaving these natural and organic and well done products into your lifestyle will really just make your quality of life so much better in my opinion okay so now I'm gonna give you guys a little breakdown of how I apply this stuff and yeah we'll go from there so I'm going to actually turn and move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat oh okay so as you can see summer has not yet hit in Massachusetts I am pale as a ghost but I like to put this stuff on my shoulders I get a lot of tension in my neck and in my upper shoulders so I find that an early morning application of this South especially after sleeping on my neck weird if by the way if you don't notice if you haven't noticed by now I have a [ __ ] long neck so this thing's always hurting me actually I had to put an extra little book on my tripod because my neck was too long for the Headroom anyway I digress so what I do per the instructions I open this up if that is really cool-looking I'll actually bring it over to you you can see it so you can see the way my fingertips are ready it's smells reminiscent of a mix vapor rub kind of which is one of my all-time favorite scents mixed with cannabis it's got a really strong cannabis smell but it's not overwhelming it's not skunky it's kind of a sweet natural organic smell of cannabis if that makes sense it's so so so medicinal just as an aroma therapy medicine for me I could literally sit here and sniff this stuff all day and it's just calmed me right down I think that's kind of the essential oils that are in here I'm sure that those have a lot to do with it alright so basically what I do is I get a little bit on the spoon and now I don't want it to be too much I don't know if you can see very well here but I don't have a lot have a little bit and then I just put that in my hands and so one thing that Christie talks about in here which i think is really wise and smart is the fact that a lot of times pain or inflammation or symptoms you're experiencing might be localized in one spot that not that may not be the cause of the of the ailment itself or the root cause so you might be feeling pain in one place as you see him rubbing this together you might be feeling pain in one place but the cause might be in another spot next to it so make sure you apply this in a large swath of skin or area because you don't just want to focus on the one localized acute pain point you kind of want to get all around it to loosen everything up so hands super oily right now it's all this stuff so what I like to do is just rub it on my neck and shoulders so right on my upper back kinda massaging it in this would make a really good massage oil too and that's not a necessarily written use for it on here but I'm sure it would be perfect for that so if you are a masseuse you like to give yourself self massage or if you've got a significant other you bless this out give them a little back and booty rub you're gonna have a healthy happy relationship oh man yeah so I just rub it all in and then with the excess I just gotta you know throw it in the hair I got a headband in now so probably to mess it up a little bit but I know that might might be gross to some people you might think it's greasy and weird but I don't care so immediately upon applying this stuff I'll tell you I also put my shirt back on immediately upon applying this stuff I feel a menthol like quality and the CBD seems to take effect and root in right after this menthol like feeling kind of wears off so it's immediately it's not an icy hot it's not intense like you know hot to relax it away or cold anything it's more so just a very not a numbing feeling but a slight kind of anesthetic numbing agent feeling it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to and this could be you know placebo effect but it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the south-- itself so take that for what it's worth that's a personal anecdote of mine I have a nose pick evidence to back that but yeah you put the stuff on you take a take a bowl or a nice bong rip it might have increased efficacy for you and that's something I believe in so definitely something to keep in mind if you do plan on getting some of this South which I do highly recommend like I said overall as a lifestyle choice I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life because we use a lot of oils rubs creams and stuff but to be able to have access to something that's derived from cannabis and has those essential oils and common pounds in them is really cool and nice and I can't thank Christie enough once again I'll say it again Christie would by the bay farm her phone number five zero eight six eight five oh seven seven nine and you can also see her website on cannabis pain SOUTHCOM that is cannabis pain South one word.com south is sa l ve alright so that's about all I have for you today I feel great my muscles are definitely more relaxed after all of this and since I've implemented this as a daily kind of regimen I honestly do feel less or less tight in the morning and overall great experience so I can't recommend it enough Thank You Christy and thank you for watching I really appreciate it have a good one guys you", "qth69ri7URY": "tonight the debate over veterinary marijuana cannabis to treat health problems in your as Denver sevens Molly Hendrickson shows us this industry is so new there have been no scientific studies to know if it's safe for even works until now meet Tucker the nine-year-old ental booker is well known at CSU for his enthusiastic greetings and affinity for treats there we go he's also one of the dogs dr. Felix Durr and his team hope will give them a better understanding of how effective CBD the non psychoactive cannabis compound found in marijuana plants is in treating arthritis and epilepsy our question is does CBD help with this problem and is there an improvement and all the outcome measures that we use the budding industry promises to treat everything from anxiety to pain management but like anything involving cannabis the legal waters of how the drug is being used remain murky it is to some degree a federal crime right now to prescribe this no there's there's lots of gray zones still many vets already prescribed CBD with a very low THC dose screwing any potential legal consequences regardless pet owners are coming to this Center at CSU hoping to get treatment for their bestfriends the discussion of CBD use in pets is nothing new testimonials from vets appear on the American Veterinary Medical Association website claiming success in treating pain but also the need for Responsible dosing and more research and that's where dr. Drew comes in we need to make sure that there is no problems that can happen when you give this to your dog in Tucker's case so he has right elbow arthritis it went really quickly from limping one day to two months later not wanting to go on any more walks or anything his owner Jackie Tchaikovsky watched arthritis steal parts of his life for the last two years we gave him some Roma dough and some glucosamine and things like that but nothing really worked desperate for a fix she turned to doctor during his team thought it would be worth a try since nothing was working for him he's been treating for three months giving him an oil containing CBD and an oil without it Jackie doesn't know the results of the study yet but already she's a believer yes I'm convinced 100% convinced for him it's working so much so she's continued him on CBD treatment it's a different strength of what he was getting here for the study but he stolen the CBD it's from the same company and and he gets it twice a day every day dr. Dewar and his team are hopeful but say pet owners should remain cautious if considering CBD for their dogs there's not enough information for us to feel confident and say yes that that's great you should give this to your dog Molly hundreds in Denver seven and CSU researchers are also looking at the effects of CBD in treating epilepsy now CBD oil doesn't get your pet high because it ain't contains such a small amount of THC no teeth see it's actually toxic to pets the study's findings will be out in about a year", "s-0pg9n7FsA": "my last question which is probably on many people's minds can you file a drug test for taking CBD it's a practical one that depends right so if you if you're extracting from a plant so in the plant even if you say him right that's not just see me Dean there's always a ratio twenty to one thirty to one naturally occurring in that plant so a hemp plant so hemp and marijuana are legal definitions cannabis is scientific right so we've put limits we said not more than 0.3% THC that's what qualifies a hemp plant if you remove the plant material if I remove ninety five percent of the material and I've got five percent cannabinoids left in some ratio that's no different than if I remove 70% of plant and I have 30 percent cannabinoids but you know it's higher THC but the ratio is still the same so you know I think some nuance around what that term means and if you're taking a whole plant extract and then as THC you will probably fail the drug test and if they isolate the CBD then you probably won't but that depends on what analytical standards are we talking dipstick or is their cross reactivity or whatever so I would say it's certainly feasible definitely with plant extracts full-spectrum broad-spectrum and less likely with Islip it's still possible and I think this is a really important point because especially now that hemp derived CBD is legal I think most folks don't realize that it can still contain up to 0.3 percent THC and that yes especially if you're dosing chronically absolutely that could lead to a positive drug test and we have data we actually you know did this and you know tested folks that are just taking hemp extract and they're popping positive left and right in pretty decent quantities because it's storing in your fat and again point three percent you're like that's so teeny no it's by volume right so actually 0.3% when you think about a milliliter of CBD or something like that and an extract it's up to what two point eight point seven to seven milligrams so ten will get you high so four milliliters will get you high there's forty four milliliters in a shot glass so if it's at point three percent you know that's that's what a teaspoon so a teaspoon at point three percent would get you eye", "JRqt7DCQnIs": "when you sort of create a robust healthy human then you know you can tolerate more of these things that doesn't mean you should holler you should force yourself to tolerate them but right you know in many of the people that we work with you know cutting out alcohol altogether to begin with is very important but then adding some of that back in can certainly have benefits for multiple reasons can we talk about CBD and THC we both live in states where that's legal now yeah and I can tell you I first started doing CBD oil last year and just to help out with with sleep I've heard people talk about you know it's good for back pain and all this other stuff and I found the curcumin is actually way way better for back pain than the CBD oil was for me although I haven't tried the lotions and stuff like that but then also THC and edibles especially like the OL spray or like a vape pen before going to bed I found that that helps me out a little bit with sleep if I'm if I'm struggling with sleep so I know there are obvious upsides and downsides I like to get some opinions on this we asked some data we don't even need it and we were we were actually talking about this over breakfast that's the kind of guys that we are yeah so the interesting thing is that CBD on its own based on the data that's available should not help with sleep so basically when they've looked at it and they've given people CBD alone or CBD plus THC the CBD alone can actually cause alertness and it may be to do with how CBD and THC affect cortisol metabolism there's some other stuff of it you know the the signal the ways they signal you know so some people may sleep worse if they take CBD and but when you add THC then people seem to sleep better so there's like a there's a synergism there however I can say for personal experience that I've tried CBD alone before bed and it certainly seems to help it certainly does seem to help me sleep and why that is I actually I actually don't know I don't have a study to say this is why I think there's the you know there's gonna be an interaction with all the other things that are going on in the gut CBD has certainly been shown or you know to improve got information got health I don't think that's an issue for me but that's particularly animal studies and now it's been translated CBD is now being used for in cancer therapies and for epileptics and they're starting to use it in people with inflammatory bowel disease so can certainly have a number of benefits I haven't tried the CBD plus THD THC was more of a thing I did in my teenage years but but have both been shown potentially to help with sleep the the potential downsides are obviously then can interfere with cool summers harbors and all this other stuff so if it's not causing it if it's not causing you benefit then you know there's no there's potential downsides for taking it so I mean we do think you know particularly for people you know heavy marijuana users there is some risk of mental health issues if that's coming from THC or other things you know of is obviously the the strength the concentration of THC in marijuana has increased dramatically over the last few decades so there's there's multiple factors that play there if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC with 30 milligrams of CBD before bed you know you're probably well under that that risk first hold but there are studies that show that it interferes with hormone metabolism called slow metabolism so it's just it's at the moment is kind of a try it out and see if it benefits you but equally you know we roll back to our continuous message which is why aren't you sleeping in the first place right you don't want to medicate yourself to sleep you want to find out what it is it's causing your poor sleep in the first place similar to the melatonin in the apple meadow that can help but but that is a band-aid off the band-aid that you not having enough melatonin because you're exposing yourself to bright lights at night all you know it's something like that right and so I think the micro dose with are the few times where I've done edibles where I get a like oh I can't do anything else besides eat potato chips today I just I don't like the feeling and so I I tend to I tend to avoid avoid that but I also have found that the mental health thing so I have the mental health problems running my family my dad was schizophrenic my brother was schizophrenic killed himself and so I know like that's the reason I won't do psilocybin and other things because there's a potential for you know even though I think I'm well past the age at this point where those symptoms would present themselves I do notice that the couple times where I've tried that an edible that is like Oh like this is too much the next day I it's like the roller coaster there you can't have the high without the low sort of thing and the entire next day I'm just like oh wait I should be happy right now but I cannot be happy this is a thing this is a story for anything that you take to try and change the way your brain functions but what we usually say is there's no biological free lunch right you can't ask your brain to do something which you wouldn't normally do and then expect it to be completely normal after so nootropics are a classic example you know you take these compounds are supposed to increase brain cognitive function various brain functions but it might increase function in one area but it makes you less good in another area and then so maybe well I will do I'll take a nootropic usually book the only time I do is before a podcast yeah and I know in afternoons I all I have this brush yeah yeah there is a nootropic crash for me I thought maybe I was unique in that because I've never heard anyone else talk about it but no I'm certain if experience the same and there are some some nootropics that are basically just like the kitchen sink everything's in there and this sort of light switches everything on you definitely notice a difference but then you gotta come down later so I often liken it to taking MDMA where your lights switch everything on you feel great and then you know a few hours later you have this you have this big come down and it's not the same for everybody again it's something that you have to experiment with yourself but but you know again we go back to why isn't your brain functioning as you would like it to why do you feel the need to take something to enhance your brain function are there other things you could be fixing and therefore you don't need to take that it's propak in the first place you know that's always where we're gonna go back to and then if you know occasionally you need to try something like that you just need to be aware they're asking your body or brain to do something you wouldn't normally do you might gonna you're gonna pay for it later yeah from either the THC thing is not to a point where it's or at least that I feel there's any sort of psychoactive effect it it's it's like micro dosing that's like one or two milligram sort of thing and the thing that helps me with is with the sleep is it prolongs the the period where I stay asleep another thing that has really helped me and I I've had to get really sort of diligent about it and I screw up still all the time water I drink a lot of water during the day but I stop at 5:00 p.m. I stop drinking liquids of 5:00 and that way I don't feel compelled to get up at 3:30 a.m. to pee which but sometimes when that happens I get up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm like I'm up I can't get back to sleep now and so I found those two things for me in the water is probably way more helpful than the THC to be honest with you so just something to think about any other words about THC no it's not something that really interested me on the c-word site about the stuff that's free like sunshine I'm very excited about where as yeah sunshine deficiency can definitely cause insomnia so like you can fix that first before having to buy a supplement we so we the one reason why we talk about CBD is because again it might help with people with inflamed guts and we see a lot of those so we know a lot of people who feel they've benefitted from taking you for some see yeah so that's an interesting thing that you bought up recently is that maybe you have some problem that's stopping you from sleeping and then you take another thing that makes that first problem worse and maybe introduces another problem but the net effect is still positive and so your sleep does get better yeah you", "Tp6rk2xMcnA": "tell me first of all about what you know about CBD is it cannabidiol is that how I pronounce it okay so there's a lot all these products that claim CBD does things to help your body lift your spirits improve your performance but all kinds of claims are is there any research to back this up very very little so CBD is one of the components of the cannabis plant cannabidiol and society has jumped very far ahead of the science CBD is still classified as a schedule 1 drug because it's part of the cannabis plant so that we're very restricted in our ability to study it in a carefully controlled way and we desperately need to catch up with the public because they're using it for absolutely everything should be clear the CBD does not have the brain effects that THC does when you think about people smoking pot it doesn't you don't get high using that at all so it acts very differently in the brain it doesn't produce any of the intoxication that THC does that's the active component to the cannabis plan and there's some intriguing preclinical studies showing that it could have potential health benefits but again the science has not caught up with everything Americans are using it for at the moment if you go into a drug store or if you go into a standalone pop pharmacy and buy something with CBD in it is it safe well the problem is we don't exactly know what it really contains so CBD alone does not seem to have a lot of side effects which is a which is a plus even a pretty high doses I've given in the laboratory at high doses and we don't see a lot of side effects however because it's not regulated appropriately we don't know what you're buying it might have THC in it it might have active form pharmacological ingredients we don't know because it's not regulated so you know marketers are selling these products they say about 30 percent of the products you buy on the internet that say they contain CBD do not contain CBD at the levels they say so you don't know what you're getting acutely we're not worried about its side effects but what is distressing to me is the fact that the FDA and the DEA are still unclear about is it a supplement is it a medication and the rulings have not come down from the higher level of government about what it is well then why and why isn't there more research I mean why this to this plant has been around successfully right European settlers got here what why don't why don't we know more so for 25 years I've had all the regulatory pieces in place to study cannabis and its components but I have to give it because it's schedule one by the DEA I have to only study it in very carefully controlled ways in the laboratory I collect the butts that people smoke from the cigarettes and store them in a safe permanently because they're considered Schedule one which is the one like heroin exactly in case people are still interested in CBD is it more effective to swallow it or is it more effective to rub it on your hand it's an excellent point because whatever that's the other thing that that I think the public isn't informed about so smoking vaping rubbing it on your body taking a pill I'll give very different pharmacological effects extremely different so you buy something that just says CBD if you rubbed on your skin you're gonna get a totally different effect then swallowing it are smoking it so that just something stamp CBD is is not meaningful is there anything that CBD has been clinically proven effective yes so the only thing that has made it through the careful placebo controlled studies is the use of CBD for severe forms of childhood epilepsy and so that's called epidemics and there the data demonstrate you know in a way that makes scientists happy that it does help for that that's the only thing it's been approved for and tested for so we're still in the early stage so waiting Congress okay dr.

use CBD and answer some of the common questions about making it part of your daily routine [Applause] [Music] let's start with the easy stuff how to use CBD to use one of our CBD oils you'll want to apply one full dropper to the desired area if you're using our CBD muscle rub you can apply it generously to your joints or muscle and massage it in well if you're using our calm CBD roll-on you apply it to your neck and chest as desired pretty simple right of course it's not just important to know how to use CBD knowing how to make it part of your daily routine is just as crucial you see a lot of people use CBD once or twice and when they don't experience instant results decide that it just doesn't work for them but before you decide CBD doesn't work for you be sure to give it a chance we recommend using it daily for 30 days that will give you the opportunity to really see how CBD can work for you the idea is to make it a consistent habit if you're using calm CBD roll-on make it part of your bedtime routine if you exercise regularly make CBD muscle rub part of your post-workout routine it's combination of pure essential oils and CBD offers a cooling sensation and can help soothe sore muscles use CBD oils it may help to use it around the same time every day to establish a routine you can always use that at different times as desired but it's a good idea to try to use it regularly so it becomes a habit as you create a routine around CBD it's important to remember that everyone is different we all have our own unique circumstances and things affect us in different ways your experience with CBD may not be identical to other people who have used it don't get caught up thinking that your own experience is a failure just because it's different than somebody else's try writing down why you chose to start using CBD then jot down a few notes about how you feel every day so you can track your well-being over time and at the end of 30 days you'll be able to look back and reflect you may also experience more result by using a higher strength product nature's ultra each of the products is available in two concentrations of CBD some people achieve the results start looking for at a lower strength and others will achieve them at a higher strength we recommend starting at a lower concentration and working your way up to a higher concentration if desired over time you'll find the perfect routine and strength for you thank you for joining us on this episode of CBD 101 be sure to LIKE and subscribe so you don't miss an episode see you next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "QH1GEuMw8Dc": "hey this is jeremy orozco and today we are going to go on a magical journey to see if varritus farms is real faritas means truth in latin as all of us remember from latin classes during boarding school or if you didn't go to public school in the united states like me maybe you know some latin well veritas we are gonna see the truth about your cbd farm i sent veritas farms to two independent labs to see if it's real how about the product paid for the lab test you're welcome i do use affiliate links on my website disclosure but if you look at my reviews i give some of the most critical honest cbd reviews on the internet and that's because i'm really bad at business and i would rather give you the truth veritas also known as the roman goddess of truth okay let's see the lab test the price breakdown taste test strength and the good the bad and the ugly on veritas farms subscribe because uh i have more coming and you don't want to miss out on this first problem is they claim 500 milligrams but they only say full spectrum hemp and we don't know if it's milligrams of cannabinoids or cbd who are you for a truth goddess we're off to a rough start what did the labs find both labs found that they are real b scores they give a little bit more cannabinoids than suggested links below to this page to see the official lab test dive into this now they are extremely accurate if you go by cbd 500 milligrams of cbd and they are right on the money within three percent accuracy very accurate and it's full spectrum with a good amount of other cannabinoids i used to berate cbd companies for not claiming cbd amounts specific amounts but now every market place is forcing these companies to be vague and not mention the actual words cbd or cannabinoids so i guess they're okay 10 cents per milligram it's good for a fancy little farm in colorado i should note that there is no discount as you go for the bigger bottles the price per milligram stays the same so there's not much point in that there are a lot of cbd companies charging over 15 cents per milligram so 10 cents is okay you can get cbd for as low as 2 cents per milligram but just pretend i didn't say that if you like this brand the taste was excellent one of the best i've tried and i tried the watermelon it kind of tastes like between a watermelon jolly rancher or maybe a watermelon bubble gum sweet but not too sweet and no harsh taste of hemp it's amazing how far cbd companies have come they also make a peppermint which would appeal to more people and non-flavored i think i'd go for the peppermint because i'm not the candy watermelon guy but it does taste great if you're into that sort of thing i don't judge the strength 17 milligrams is a good starting point 0.6 milligrams of thc won't have side effects for most people i would say but may provide some additional benefits to the cbd see the entourage effect for that i would go as far as to say that you can take this and still jump over a moving vehicle if that's your hobby without delayed reactions from thc but always check with your your doctor first before jumping over moving vehicles while using cbd with thc just remember i said that when you end up in the hospital specifically so you don't sue me i have a disclaimer this is a full spectrum and has good amounts of cbc and cbg it actually has more cbg than the majority of full spectrums that i test that's pretty good i know a lot of people want to know how i feel from cbd from this cbd personally but you should never pay attention too much attention to the experience of just one person and a cbd product the effect of cbd and other cannabinoids is very very individualized on your endocannabinoid system and it can be very misleading to listen to one person so i focus on the actual data the lab test so you can find one you like and actually know what's in it veritas farms is a real farm small farm in colorado they have 140 acres they focus on sustainable farming and avoid pesticides surprisingly this little farm made it into major retailers like kroger and cvs nationwide from what i've seen this adds a lot of credibility to a cbd company and it's much more likely that they'll test well and that's what my lab tests have confirmed i didn't find anything concerning about veritas a plus better business bureau score with no negative reports in my in-depth internet search overall i think this is great for new cbd users occasional users gifs this would be a fantastic gift and i promise you that this is going to taste better than 90 percent of cbd companies out there this looks like something you would get at a spa it has a professional luxury look that still says hey i'm a natural little farm here but i keep my barn clean clean packaging and logo small farms are great because they have full control over their products the consistency the same strain and cannabinoids they're not just buying cheap cbd from thousands of different farms growing with questionable methods and pesticides and whatnot if you met some cannabis farmers you know what i'm talking about they are not however going to compete with the giant companies they can offer super super cheap cbd if you didn't know hemp is becoming very cheap right now so a lot of small farms like this one are struggling so if you want to support a small business and get a luxury cbd product for you or a great gift i think this is great they also make gummies capsules topicals skin care and cbd for pets that is it check the links below for more info i will see you next time", "SyO0Yy3usP0": "today is all about CBD one of the hottest topics in skincare today is the use of CBD and skincare products but what does it do for you is it worthwhile for you to look for CBD in your skincare products we're gonna get the answers from me dr. Anthony you know America's holistic Beauty doc right here [Music] [Music] recent legislation both national and state have legalized the use of CBD and so it's being used now in all sorts of skincare products from cleansers to moisturizers to anti-aging creams so it truly is the hot ingredient of the day and for those of you who are skincare enthusiasts typically we want the newest hottest thing and CBD is it CBD does not have a long history of being used in skincare products probably because of the legality and potential legalities of it now it has been used in topical pain relievers and a lot of people have had great results with it well now with the laws changing it's being used more and more in skin care products and there are a lot of skincare companies who are putting it in their formulations promising anything from the Fountain of Youth to the best moisturizer to improving even acne CBD has a few known traits that can be very helpful if you're looking at skincare so the first thing is that CBD is anti-inflammatory and we know that there are a lot of skin conditions that are due to inflammation acne rosacea a lot of people get these types of breakouts even aging is an inflammatory condition so it makes sense that if you want to turn back the clock if you want to reduce the inflammation in your skin CBD is a reasonable way to do it well we also know that CBD is a potent antioxidant and you may have heard me talk before about vitamin C vitamin C is an antioxidant that's used by pretty much all the different skincare companies well CBD is also a potent antacid it fights free radicals and so that is something that you can use in a serum or a moisturizer to protect your skin and finally if CBD is quite soothing to the skin it's moisturizing to the skin and so you can apply it to the skin in moisturizers as a way to help your skin to be more hydrated and to feel better but the question is is does it do the CBD do this better than maybe some of the other things is CBD a better an talent than let's say vitamin C well we don't know because we haven't had the chance to test it very much because it hasn't been legal for that long and so the jury is still out so people ask me doctor Yoon if I apply a CBD oil to my skin or if I apply CBD and fuse skincare to my skin can I get high from it and the answer is no so THC and CBD are very very similar when you look at them they both come from the cannabis plant and they both have very similar chemical structures but THC has psychoactive properties you can get high from it and CBD does not so if you have an inflammatory skin condition like let's say you've got adult acne and you've tried different things it's not getting much better to consider trying a CBD infused skincare product may be worth worthwhile because we do know it has anti-inflammatory properties if you want to use it as an antioxidant by all means do it but what I would caution you is I wouldn't use it in place of other known and proven options so we do know that combining vitamin C and vitamin E both very potent antioxidants they can work synergistically together to get an even better effect I wouldn't necessarily use CBD instead of those two I'd use those two instead because we know that they work but if you want to add CBD as a something additional if you've got like I said inflammatory skin condition and you want to try it then by all means try it but at this point the jury is still out with CBD and skin care products there's an exciting time but I wouldn't necessarily say that I would bank all my skincare on CBD just yet", "zqRNCSX_uJQ": "hey what's going on everybody hope you have a healthy day and if you see what's going on out there you know CBD is extremely popular there's so many companies so many different options it could make your head spin well it was a couple years ago I actually tried a CBD brand didn't really do anything for me I tried a liquid I tried a cream just it just didn't work and I do see this where people say some it will work some don't and it was just a few weeks ago I connected with a company called calm by wellness and had the opportunity to have a conversation what I really impress or what really impressed me was that the company wanted to spend time to introduce themselves what they do what they stand for and then talk about one of their products which they sent to me to try and review it's called sleep and again I've had the opportunity now for a good couple weeks to try it I really wanted to make sure and see how it worked for me before I shared with you now I'm gonna put a link in the description where you could learn more about the company and if you really dive in and learn about the company I think you're gonna be impressed as was I so they thought we'd try sleep before we try some of the other products this is a 17 milligrams per serving blueberry lavender and as far as the ingredients well a couple other things its THC free which was really important to know and when you go onto their website you'll see they've got lab information lab reporting so you'll be able to get that there as well it's a broad spectrum hemp extract sleep turban blend and it's made in the USA so it's all-natural non-gmo organically grown gluten free and again it's processed and made here in the USA as far as the the different blend that it has in there it's got lavender flower chamomile it's got hops lemongrass hoe wood which is leaf orange and pine and jasmine so it's got a really nice combination it's kind of got a fruity combination and as far as taking it you take it about an hour or where there abouts an hour before going to sleep and the recommended is just to take a drop put it under your tongue and then let it dissolve in under your tongue I let it dissolve there about for a met a minute and then I swallow so as far as the product and how it worked for me I tried it both actually with one full dropper and two full droppers just to see the difference so initially the one dropper I felt like it worked okay for me then it went to two droppers and I felt I was getting a bit groggy when I was getting up so then I went back to one but as I started using it over the several days and over a couple weeks what I found is that it does kick in for me where I start getting more relaxed and I then really start getting very tired when I'm laying on my bed and I used before I go to sleep I use I use an acupressure mat and I and I found that when I started using this I really started getting tired now during the night I'm still waking up I'm going to the bathroom so that's not changing a lot but I do find that it is helping me get a bit more relaxed and definitely feeling more tired to fall asleep quicker so that's the results for me so I will say that I do feel like it is working for me when you are looking at the CBD companies it's so important to really know what's behind the company and when you go to the website and they really have a nice website there's a ton of testimonials as well you'll find that they you know they just talk about that they have an in-house farmers in how scientists they also do third-party testing and also as as far as what they do versus other company so other companies outsource their farmers they outsource their science labs and they're not quality tested and this company does do their testing again you can also scroll down and then here is the certificate of analysis and when I actually was talking to some my friends and sharing on Facebook about it they were asking me do you have that and they do have that there and to me that is impressive so you definitely wanted to check out the website so there you go that's my experience they have a number of other products that you can try as well but if you are in need of sleep you know again it's worked for me it's worked for me some and will definitely continue taking it and look forward to trying other products so I'll try and answer any questions you have but please click on the link where you can get more information greatly appreciated if you find this video helped I definitely appreciate also a thumbs up and hope this will work for you as well if you are taking this product I'd love if you would leave your comments that would be really helpful and you know again if you have any questions I'll try and answer those harde everybody have a very healthy day thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video take care", "bgf_xhQV_ok": "get smoking marijuana or eating pot edibles you probably won't even notice the newest way people are getting high 7 News reporter Jacqueline Alan found more and more are turning to a pot patch even though the patch on his wrist may look like something familiar I think it maybe it's a nicotine patch or something Alain Tonkin isn't trying to quit smoking in fact instead of nicotine this 2x2 square is delivering THC I've been using medical marijuana for about the past 11 years ever since a skydiving accident broke his back Allen's pain reliever of choice is weed but smoking breaks at work well I really don't like smelling like marijuana around my customers and so this allows me a way to do be more discreet about being able to take my medicines this is basically where all the magic happens the magic is happening here at Mary's medicinals in Denver CEO Nicole Smith gives us a tour saying unlike smoking pot which wears off fast or edibles that can take time to kick in it's effective in about 10 to 15 minutes and it can last up to 12 hours they start with cannabis extract the oil isolate certain cannabinoids like CBD or THC spread that on sheets and you have the newest way to get high about 80% of Mary's products don't have psychoactive effects they're being used to treat everything from epilepsy to chronic pain to insomnia you know what it's something that we are continuing to strive towards the patches are not FDA approved and while mary's is funding its own clinical trials pot science is still young for people like Allen though it's been I mean it's just been a lifesaver he's been night and day the proof is in being pain-free with a simple patch the biggest side-effect he says has been sometimes having the munchies Jacqueline Allen Seven News the CEO says her company's not regulated by the FDA because they fall under the same category as companies that make vitamins or supplements and if people feel any negative effect from the patch she suggests just taking it off and claims you'll feel better in just about 15 minutes", "1iuA5wDv3Jo": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "T_i1OFrRSaw": ">>> >>> CBD. >>> CBD.\nIT >>> CBD.\nIT IS >>> CBD.\nIT IS ALL >>> CBD.\nIT IS ALL THE >>> CBD.\nIT IS ALL THE RAGE

the channel in today's video I'm gonna be making a very much anticipated and requested video from our subscribers today I'm going to be making CBD hand cream or body butter whatever you'd like to call it an oil based cream but first if you wouldn't mind if you are new here to channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you very much for your support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to continue that support so folks I have received so many emails friends requests and just direct messages about can we make a CBD cream how to make a CBD cream and will you make a video for youtube and the answer to all those questions is yes today I will be showing you how to make a CBD hand cream or body butter now this is not a lotion lotions are water-based for those of you that do not know the difference lotions are a completely water-based and are a totally different recipe and we'll be making that later on so look for that video on our channel but today we are doing an oil based cream or body butter and I'm going to go over the ingredients to be able be able to make it so first and foremost you are going to need sweet almond oil now for those of you that are allergic to nuts you can use avocado oil and I have for this recipe now you're not going to get the same results as we will with the sweet almond oil but for those of you that nut allergy this is a great substitute second you're gonna need cocoa butter this is not the same as shea butter it's a harder texture smells like chocolate so you're gonna need this then next you are gonna need shea butter this is different not the same as coconut butter some people will get them confused and I want to make it clear that these are two separate butters and here we go here is the shea butter it's more malleable definitely have that softer butter texture and then last but not least as far as the cents greediest go for this recipe you will need infuse coconut oil now for those of you that do not have the infused coconut oil you could add CBD pollen or Keef to this recipe however if you want to make the CBD coconut oil that's infused go ahead and check out our video right here on our channel then come on back and after you've made your coconut oil and you start making this recipe so folks that is the essential ingredients to making this hand cream over body butter whatever you'd like to call it the next two ingredients are not essential to this but I will be adding one of the two of them today first is vitamin E oil now it's not necessary but this is a great way to rejuvenate skin it just helps the skin a lot whether it's recovering from damage or just being nice and smooth now you don't need to add it because shea butter has vitamin E in it but this really adds a lot more vitamin E to it to really give you that rejuvenating skin feel the other thing that we are not adding today is an essential oil now if you don't like the smell of chocolate which is what this will come out to smell like because the cocoa butter is very strong you can dampen it and the two I recommend are lavender and mint but today we're not going to be doing that we're cool with the the chocolate smell so let's get right into how I make this CBD hand cream or body butter alright folks before we get started you're going to need a couple things from your kitchen first and foremost a probably a really small spatula to be able to get the oils out of your 1/3 cup measuring cup you'll also need a double boiler or in this case I set it up as a double boiler glass bowl and you have water in the pot we're going ahead and turn that on right now while we're doing all this all right folks now that you've gathered all your kitchen equipment you're just going to need 1/3 cup of every oil and butter so 1/3 cup of cocoa butter 1/3 cup of sweet almond oil and for those of you that using avocado oil it's the same thing 1/3 cup of infused coconut oil and 1/3 cup of shea butter so I'm gonna measure all those out get them into our double boiler and start making our CBD hand cream or body butter so let's get right into it we have measured everything out and we have put it on the stove and as you can see everything's starting to become liquid already now this is the time where you would start thinking about adding your essential oils for us we're just going to do a few drops of the vitamin E so we'll do that you don't need anything crazy maybe five six drops max nothing nothing nuts really just depends on what you like I wouldn't go overboard with the vitamin E though you know ten drops really maximum and so we're just gonna start stirring this around for a little while so we're gonna cut to that so once this all melts down I'll see you in a few minutes okay folks you can see that everything is melted so now we're going to take it off the heat now it's very important this step is that you do not throw it right into the refrigerator you take it off the double boiler and you set it down on the counter get rid of this steam here real quick okay folks so now what you're gonna do is you're going to stir this gently for a little while for about ten minutes you really want it to come down in temperature because first glass can crack and we just put it right into the refrigerator you also want to give the oil some time to rest before you go ahead and cool them down so that's what I'm gonna do for the next ten mathema throw it in the fridge for about an hour and then we'll take it out and we'll whip it so I'll see you in about an hour folks the oil was in the fridge for approximately an hour and a half so a little bit more than an hour and it is now solidified and you really want to get it when it's not totally solid it just transferred over to a solid so it's got that you know loose texture to it and that's important because now what we're going to do is we're gonna whip the oil and this is important because in order to make it a body cream do our hand cream you call a weapon we do this for quite a while and I'll see you okay so we're about halfway done with the whipping here and so what I'm doing is I'm just getting it off the edges and I'm putting it in the middle of the glass bowl here so that we can start whipping it again and I'm going to do this process for a probably about another one to two minutes so I'm going to jump to that next to that alright so now I've lifted for about three minutes and you can tell that it's starting to get that like nice whipped kind of texture to it so what I'm gonna do now is this is the final leg scraped with a bowl because I want to make sure I get everything I can so you can have as much of this body cream as possible but you can tell see it's getting that very whipped type of texture that's what you're gonna look for and you want it to be very fluffy very fluffy and you know kind of Airy just like whipped cream you really want this to have that whipped cream type texture so we're gonna give it one more run through with the blender here and then we'll have the final product alright folks so now we're just gonna store it up and all you need is a mason jar go ahead and just put it right into the mason jar now the great thing about this stuff is it is all ready to be stored it's all oiled so it should be okay on the Shelf you may have to read it if if it deflates for whatever reason but it shouldn't and this should last you quite a while this is a lot of butter or lotion you can use it on your hands use it whatever now it does have a bit of a greasy feel to it and that's typical for body creams and lotions but yeah that's it for today folks I really hope you enjoyed this video I hope you can make this at home and if you guys have any questions comments concerns leave them in the comments below I'll answer them to the best I can if you guys are interested in any kind of flower all my information is down in the description below go ahead and reach out to me and I can give you some price quotes but that's all I have for you today folks I hope you enjoyed today's video I know it was much anticipated and a lot of people were looking forward to it so I hope it doesn't disappoint but yeah that's it for today I hope you enjoy it and I'll see you in another video take care [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "2rDTmvp1Bmc": "is used widely in textiles medicine and food but what is the difference between it and marijuana here to answer that question please welcome medical doctor and health coach dr. Elaine chin and naturopathic doctor and I mean my goodness we're hearing CBD THC we're hearing it all the time so it's nice for us to just sit down and get a definition of the difference between hemp and marijuana so I'll start with you doc what's the difference well definitely it's all confusing because you've got common names and then you've got scientific names so cannabis is a scientific name and marijuana and hemp is what we call common names okay so I think let's just leave it that because we're not doing biology 101 today okay and both of these plants or all these cannabis plants produce a combination of THC or CBD and they're the active ingredients that we get the stimulation or the relaxation effects okay so there's a difference though between the CBD and the THC and what would that difference be well one is what we call psychoactive such as the tea tea and one would say CBD is generally the one that's not addictive and is calming and you'd never get really high on that you wouldn't okay but you might from the THC you technically you do let's talk about how hemp impacts our bodies and I'm gonna throw this one to you Elizabeth great so as Elaine mentioned both the hemp and the cannabis the marijuana they all contain cannabinoids so you've got your THC and hemp it's very low less than 0.3% so there's none of the psychoactive effects your body also makes its own set of cannabinoids to bind to your brain and to different receptors in your body so they have the effect of regulating hormones and of maintaining overall body balance or homeostasis okay so if people are concerned with things like nausea inflammation chronic pain then hemp can be a really great solution that doesn't have any other psychoactive effects okay interesting so I actually I got you took a swab from me dr. Chynn just the cheek swab and it was you know it was very easy in order to give me an exam and to test me to see what the impact would be of CBD right CBD and THC okay so we got my exam results everybody and they were incredibly boring what did it say and we're being truthful here yeah I've got the right here she's boring because she's normal yeah yeah it's like cannot be normal metabolizer normal metabolizer average average and average this would have killed me in grade six what that fundamentally means is that if I gave you a dose regardless of it's a THC CBD combination or one or just the other for different reasons I would give you the normal standard dose and I would expect a normal metabolism rate and a normal effect rate of how you break down your THC or CBD okay and then we also looked at the psychoactive our anxiety side effect risk factors for you yeah you don't have it yeah and equally important you don't have the effects of a THC dependency risk factor the reason why you would administer or take part in an exam like that would be in order to see how you're going to take on and metabolize it something like CBD or th there's a lot of patients are wondering this is right for me so now we're gonna bring slides into this conversation to say if you're not sure let's look at your genetic predispositions and we also in our office measures something called neurotransmitters which are your brain chemicals okay is the impact of THC and CBD so we'll know what to give you more or less of okay do you have is there such thing as like an average dose that you would start out with if someone had average results yes so most prescribing physicians will start at the lowest dose and titrate you up just to be careful another thing worth mentioning is the the form that you take it in so if you're taking it sublingually under your tongue or in your mouth you're absorbing up to up to a hundred percent more than if you're taking it orally and you're actually ingesting or eating it the potency in eating something is vastly reduced so the four makes it each difference so what are the main benefits do you think Elizabeth like why would people turn to a CBD or a THC or hemp products yeah the main benefits are I mean all the cannabinoids have different profiles and so the product that you're getting is dependent upon the cannabinoid and also another class of molecules called terpenes upon the profile of those but the main benefits are they're anti-inflammatory they could help with sleep with mood with brain conditions those are the big ones and also gut health nausea you know cachexia or difficulty with weight loss around cancer there's all kinds of benefits and more being released as the data comes out any warnings that people should be aware of before they decide that they want to go pursue this as a you know as a remedy i would say go to a physician that prescribes cannabis rather than just go to a recreational snoring like wing it right make sure you with a doctor they know what they're doing they've done this before yeah and I understand a lot of people are saying well my family doctor is dismissing it it's only because I think they haven't got that time yet to kind of do the research do the information so but some of it is prescribing anything else we should know give it a go if traditional medical drugs aren't working for you okay good that's good information thank you for clarifying a lot of that for us both of you", "zaFs3Cmx3Ds": "-You've probably started\nseeing CBD products popping up\nin a lot of places -- pharmacies, health-food stores,\nfarmers' markets. One place it's not\nsupposed to show up -- Amazon. But the e-commerce giant\nhas become an outlet for CBD supplements, despite Amazon's policy\nbarring those items. That's because\nthe vast retail site, where consumers search through\n500 million items on any given day, is too large for even the tech\ngiant to thoroughly police. Sellers use alternative terms, like \"hemp oil\"\nor \"hemp extract,\" to avoid Amazon's\ndetection algorithms that would likely sniff out\nthose listings and remove them. So, to see if third-party\nmerchants were violating Amazon's policy,\nwe decided to buy 13 products that had high likelihood\nof containing CBD and have them tested at EVIO\nLabs in Berkeley, California. We should note that Amazon\nfounder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns\nThe Washington Post. David Egerton is\nthe lab director at EVIO and tested each\nof the products to determine\nif they include CBD. Okay, so, let's look\nat the Select CBD products. Does this product\nhave CBD in it? -It does. There's close to 900 milligrams\nin the container. -And maybe another giveaway --\nit says \"CBD\" on the label. -It does, indeed. -If I were to go to a\nnatural-food store in Berkeley, and purchase a CBD product\nfrom them, would it have a similar profile? Would it have about 30%, milligrams to milliliter,\nof CBD in it? -It's very difficult to say\nthat for sure, because a lot of these products have a wide range\nof concentrations that we see. Even in what we see\nin front of us here, you know, we can see,\nthere's some products that claim to have\n5 milligrams per serving, others that claim to have 100. -Let's look at\nRestorative Botanicals. Does this have CBD in it?\n-It does, indeed. In comparison to\nthe other sample that we just looked at,\nthere was, say -- where there was only\nCBD detected, here we see\na variety of cannabinoids, including THC,\nat a very low level. But this variety of cannabinoids\nindicates that it was likely manufactured using what they referred to\nas a full-spectrum hemp oil. -Okay, let's go to\nthe Lazarus Naturals. Does this product\nhave CBD in it? -It absolutely does.\n-And again, dead giveaway, it says \"CBD tincture.\" So, now,\nlet's talk about this one. This is a tincture made\nby a company called Tranquilo. What was interesting to me\nabout this company is, its Twitter\nhandle is AmazonBestCBD. Is there any CBD in this one? -There was no CBD detected\nin this sample. [chuckles]\n-This also says on its label \"hemp oil, 500 milligrams.\" Is there 500 milligrams of anything in this\nthat you detected? -Uh, none of the cannabinoids\nthat we report. -Today we asked you\nto check 13 products. We have them all lined up here. Of these 13 products, how\nmany actually had CBD in them? -11 out of the 13 contained CBD. -And the two that didn't is\nthis one oil from Tranquilo -- -Mm-hmm.\n-And the other, the Hemp Gummies\nhere from Mix Rx. -Correct.\n-So, even though Amazon prohibits\nthe sale of CBD products on its website, we found 11 out\nof our 13 products purchased contained\nthe substance. After informing Amazon of\nour purchases and testing, the company removed some, but not all,\nof the product listings. Amazon said the company\nrequires merchants to follow selling guidelines and that it has teams\nthat use machine-learning tools to keep prohibited products\nout of its marketplace. But the company declined to say\nit believed that no CBD products\nwere available on its site.", "og8Rkkkwa7c": "[Music] thank you very much what a great pleasure it is to be here in Zoomers Studios I'm actually a Zoomer so it's kind of fun to be here with some boomers I think as well so welcome I'm gonna talk a little bit about medical cannabis edibles topicals and oils oh my right eye there's a lot of information there so much information so that actually as of today's date there are over 360,000 people that have accessed medical cannabis in Canada 360,000 have applied for medical documents so very exciting times in terms of research in this area so I do speak at engagements in the industry and I'm compensated for that but today I'm also compensated for my talk I'm going to talk a little bit about the view from here so I'm a student of cannabis I learned from my patients that as well as the the sheer volume of patients that I do see my background is really actually an addiction and mental health I've kind of fallen into the track of prescribing medical cannabis to my patients and I've done this for about just over six years so from addiction to mental health the face of my patients have changed primarily to a 55-plus because people are seeking medical cannabis to help manage their pain what I do believe is that addiction is not a moral failure I believe that stigma is a barrier to care for not only for people living with addiction but also for people trying to seek care for medical cannabis I'm wondering from a number of you here and online audience may have had difficulty accessing cannabis through their physicians not really understanding or not knowing how to prescribe we always look at the risk versus benefit of all the medicines we prescribe in cannabis being one of those and then always clinical research is hugely important in innovation and improving care for patients and this is something that I'm very interested in so we're gonna talk a little bit about the medical cannabis basics and I understand that there was some talk prior to about actually delving into endocannabinoids system and I'll talk very briefly about that obviously questions of safety I'm always grilled by my colleagues all the time what the heck are you doing there's no not enough evidence and I say fight me we have lots of evidence that supports what we do in our practice we look at every case by case and again research and innovation and looking forward to to future research so this is a very brief diagram here on really the timeline of medical cannabis this is not a new drug would you agree this is not a new drug this has been around for millennia and quoting dr. Zach Walsh who is a psychologist out in BC who works a lot with substance use PTSD he calls this an ancient and gentle medication so when we start to look at the history we can look back to 1000 BC where there was a pharmacopoeia on on the list of different types of different ways of using medical cannabis over a hundred written recipes for before particular ailment we look at a Chinese physician who operated on his patients using a cannabis and wine now we call that a saturday-night and Gimli but no we don't but it's it's really I'm very thankful for research and anesthesia in in this 21st century but we fast-forward to 1964 where dr. Ravi McCollum who is still practicing as a bench scientist he discovered that actually there was a molecule called THC and then fast forward to the 90s where we discovered that we actually have receptors in our body for cannabis and we make our own endocannabinoids so the basics as I've alluded to the endocannabinoids system is always within us all we are born with the system that helps us maintain balance as we modulate pain mood sleep as well as our immune system so when we look at the receptors in our body cb1 receptors are for THC those are primarily on our nervous system cb2 receptors are pretty much everywhere else but heavily involved within our immune system so I always say the dose is the poison when legalization happened how many people's hair started on fire oh my god legal cannabis what are we going to do people are gonna be running down the streets intoxicated well that hasn't really happened actually when we start to look at the stats and I actually just pulled them up today age groups that we were really concerned about youth actually has gone down in numbers the numbers have not changed to our 18 to 25 years so but who's using more cannabis ice guys what's great here right so when we talk about the THC it is intoxicating but again the dose is the poison generally most of my patients are using less than 20 milligrams a day in a 24-hour period dependent on what their what I see them for in my patients that are trying to describe from opiates we have the ability to use cannabis as a substitution it's not it doesn't work a hundred percent for everybody but again I always say my patients fall into a bell curve the people in the middle generally are doing well we do prescribe all kinds of medications over-the-counter but this it's the tails it's the people that may be too sensitive to THC or the people that it doesn't really work very well so those are the people that I'm very interested in and then of course CBD so cannabidiol which is the non intoxicating form of cannabis I don't say it's not psychoactive in the sense that it doesn't make you high it does work in your brain but it doesn't cause intoxication and it activates many systems especially our immune system so what's the difference between medical and recreational consumers so most of the medical patients that I see are generally cannabis naive and we we educate them they generally are consuming medicine cannabis to help them reduce harmful medicines or medicines that they're really that they're taking too much of primarily around opiates and benzodiazepines and as dr. Khan was alluding to we worry about our elder population using benzodiazepines and I've had a lot of success actually tapering people off so most patients that are using medically are over the age of 50 the challenge with many patients my oldest patient is 98 years old her 72 year old friend brought her to my health center rolled her in on her wheelchair and she was very excited to try this new medicine the challenges she doesn't have internet access you cannot access medical cannabis at your local pharmacy and most of my patients have a relationship with their pharmacist of course there's limited access and of course that medicine is taxed recreationally patients generally when you look when you look at our rec market so in Manitoba we have I think 30 recreational stores I cannot tell you how many times I've had patients come in and they bring in their bottles that their grandkids have bought them and say I don't know about this stuff I need to learn about it 7 out of 10 people that are showing up at a recreational market in Manitoba are looking for medical so we don't track them the average age is generally 19 plus patients or people can access it easily same-day access it's definitely taxed but the challenges for patients that are actually trying to access something same-day you're looking at a 50% markup so always it's really about safety so and that's where I get pushed a lot so I really look at the whole patient what a novel approach right we look at substances that are used in the in in populations of people and as dr. Khan was talking we worry about substance use misuse in our elder population but when we look at really this really look at the stats alcohol is actually the biggest bad actor when we look at addiction rates 76% of the population over the age of 18 is using alcohol but 20% addiction rate you look at opiates while we know we're in an opiate crisis we are losing people left right and center one person every two hours in Canada dies of an opioid overdose I don't want to take part in that in terms of over prescribing and prescribing appropriately and then we look at cannabis cannabis really you're looking at a nine percent risk for addiction but I always look at those patients that come to me that are overusing cannabis they're medicating something and with my addictions hat it's generally trauma pain pain comes in all kinds of packages we can have bone pain we can have arthritis pain we can also have emotional pain existential pain and then of course tobacco we know that that's not good to use and obviously in patients that are smoking cannabis some patients will actually or some people will actually mix tobacco and cannabis and shouldn't do that so driving we always want to look at harms and benefits obviously of cannabis so in terms of inhalation if you're going to inhale cannabis we recommend vaporization and I know there's people's again here starts on fire when we talk about vaping but I'll talk about that very quickly obviously patients that are you have underlying cardiac history we worry about patients that are using high THC in that population so people that have arrhythmias afib people that are on blood thinners that can sometimes work in the same pathway as cannabis and as well one I always say I have nine pay nine patients and 6,500 patients that I've provided access to cannabis nine have had side-effects seven oh it's diarrhea is the is the main one so two actually had underlying mental health issues and we're overusing THC and then of course dry mouth of course we all know benefits for CBD primarily in terms of the anti-inflammatory effects as well as an antispasmodic and then we talked about substitution potential for opiates other considerations we talked about vaping vaping is we talk about vitamin e acetate that's been added to a lot of these liquid carts cannabis vapes and those have been done in the illicit market that is not in in the illicit market so in your legal market vaporization generally refers to those vape carts as well as dried flower in a little machine that you can vaporize we worry about the illicit market as well in terms of pesticides cannabinoid contact most people that are in the illicit market are using only high THC and then as well education for patients is really important because patients a lot of patients are cannabis naive and they're they they just don't have a hot clue as to how they should dose and I've had a couple of patients come in and say well my granddaughter brought me these these oils and I took too much of this and I ended up sleeping for 12 hours so you have to worry you have to worry about them so case by case what is the best way for cannabis to use cannabis for me so as I said the patients may be accessing the illicit market patients that have chronic non-cancer pain primarily my arthritis patients are using it as substitution in Manitoba they're accessing it through the recreational markets and it's mostly people over 50 that are that are trying to access for medical most patients are looking for high CBD and they don't want to get high there's a lot of negotiation as to using THC in those populations and a lot of people have misinformation dr. Google is not my friend so and obviously be worried about adverse events so so many variety of cannabis products out there dry flower oils soft gels gel caps vape pens edibles infused beverages what do you know how are you gonna take all this stuff so it's really a very stepwise approach pardon me so for topicals anybody recognize those chubby fingers they're out chain so topicals work very nicely for patients we know that we've got this skin and we've got three layers we need to get through pardon me so we have to have a good understanding of what type of topical will actually permeate the skin this is a model of inflammation pardon me so this is a very complex diagram of inflammation and how our endocannabinoid system works to help reduce that inflammation it works in a very complex manner initially that inflammation is acute but as you go forward with that inflammation if it's not arrested at that point it develops into a chronic inflammatory process thank you so we worry about people developing chronic inflammatory issues especially with skin rashes as it relates to people living with psoriatic arthritis any of the autoimmune arthritis we we don't want to get into a chronic situation and I've had very good success with topicals for patients living with psoriasis so allergies with topicals so out in the market in the legal market there's various forms of topicals and they're just starting to come out in the market but I have many patients that come in with some very nasty smelling tubs of stuff they have made themselves and there could be an active component of cannabis this is a topical cannabis that's not been cooked or activated and that is the rash so it's always good to do a test site when you're using topicals so as I said the absorption rate it does not cross the blood-brain barrier so you're not gonna get high if you apply a topical using caution with open areas especially if there's THC it takes about 30 to 60 minutes for that to take effect and it can last anywhere from 4 to 12 hours I have many patients that will use this on joints on their back and have had very good success so these aren't your COCOMs brownies so if your granny okay I don't know how many times I've had patients come in and talk about somebody made them inedible and then they had a bad experience I actually had one patient go to the hospital emergency department because he had taken in edibles somebody had made and he thought oh this isn't working right so he's like 45 minutes this is not working it takes another one and then at about an hour yeah he was on that ride for about eight hours and didn't couldn't get off right so you have to be very careful we worry about that for the simple fact that I could drop your blood pressure so this is why I worry in in populations of people they're living with high blood pressure and they take their medication this medicine can affect your blood pressure and I have patients that have actually come off their blood pressure medications because of cannabis right so you have to be cautious if you are taking medications you should talk to your doctor about if cannabis is good for you but again the formulations are endless oil based generally is is the go-to in terms of cannabis oils they come in many formulations high THC THC and CBD and and primarily CBD there's different ratios there's there are some strain specific oils available however few and far between there's a few companies that are doing that so far capsules are another option for patients that don't like to take oil the oil can be very messy and difficult to dose for patients that have arthritis in their hands you're gonna start to see more in the recreational market I know that a number of the license holders are not kind of going down the candies chocolate Mart route but for patients that may not want to take a full dose they could have a candy and use maybe half of it wrap it up put it away chocolate again can you only have one piece of chocolate so you have to really watch the dosing the dosing I think will be anywhere from 1 to 10 milligrams of THC and there will be many formulations with CBD if ever you're in a recreational situation and you're thinking about using cannabis please use both together always have CBD with it because that quite often will help push the THC off the receptors so you're not getting as much of an effect so again with absorption and ingestion as I kind of alluded to please wait please wait if you haven't had any effect after 90 minutes then of course by all means go ahead and try another dose but it can affect dosing especially in patients living with perhaps diabetes that may have a really slow gut or gastroparesis it can take somewhere to 2 to 4 hours my friends that are on the Sheik and Facebook website they're there a group of women that are supporting each other I think there's 4,000 of them out there they always talk about having a small fatty snack so cannabis likes fat it works best in our bodies if patients are having difficulty they're saying it's and really not working I always say have a little have something like a small fatty snack to help that absorb faster for you so this is just an overview this is a table that I give all my patients and it's just an overview of what's of how can how you can use cannabis what I'm actually missing on this one and we're not going to talk about that today is suppositories for our patients that are not able to take anything by mouth that that don't want to smoke and especially for our patients living with GI problems so ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease women living with endometriosis can use that as well but really this is just an overview of what I've just spoken about and then dosing so high CBD is generally my rule of thumb I go from 20 to 60 milligrams a day for patients to start them and then add in THC as needed it is really dose dependent on affordability and for all of you that are on whoever is on medical cannabis we have to really look at the price point for patients a lot of patients say oh my gosh I wish I could take more but they can't afford it cannabis naive patients on opiate opioids so I can speak to a particular case two gentlemen that I'm caring for now one is on both are on high-dose opiates this gentleman was on I think 120 equivalents morphine and in six weeks he's come off all of that using medical cannabis and so high CBD 200 milligrams a day plus about 40 milligrams of THC and I think within the next so he's still having withdrawal from that but he said he can't believe it because he actually doesn't have pain he's just really going through withdrawal so he's done really well and he has degenerative disc disease and arthritis in his back so again looking at anxiety versus depression I have a lot of patients that will come in and say oh my gosh I'm so anxious and I'm smoking so much cannabis they're taking way too much THC THC can actually be it's counterintuitive too much THC can actually make your anxiety worse so I generally will encourage those patients to use high CBD and lower low percentage THC as well in depression patients will have a little bit more THC for activation and always with anybody that you're considering cannabis or trying it even recreationally please go low and slow if you take away anything from today low low low and increase your dose every one to three days so research and innovation so this is kind of where I'm very excited and I'm so impressed with the Arthritis society and the support they've given to research and innovation we have evidence on the horizon so we know the there's shortage of reso research as well because of restrictions through Health Canada I think to date there's 200 research licenses out there I would love to be able to do research in my practice but I can't because we can't dispense cannabis on our site so you have to get a special dispensation to do that there's thousands of papers out there that really support cannabis as an antispasmodic as an anti-inflammatory and an analgesic we start to look at anti-cancer and sedate of effects as well which again is very exciting patients perspectives are key so when I say I'm a student I learn everyday from my patients that come to see me about using medical cannabis we learn together and patients become allies in our research so we know that 63% this is a paper from 2014 over 290 patients were they had a questionnaire done and 63% were using cannabis to substitute for prescription drug 30% for opiates 16% for benzodiazepines 25% for alcohol and tobacco at 12% which is fascinating because in my practice we see patients stop especially with high high CBD patients actually will lose the craving for alcohol and other substances which is fascinating and very interesting especially for patients that are living with crystal meth and cocaine addiction this lady is a very cool lady I don't know if you've anybody read the Newark Times this was just this pot six months ago one of the researchers associated with this study is actually from Calgary this lady is a very happy lady she has a genetic deletion that deletes her brakes for making her own THC pretty cool eh so she's really happy they call her blissed-out but interestingly she's covered in scars she's 71 years old she's probably 72 now she lives in Scotland covered in scars she she feels no pain so she had a baby she said it felt like it was tickling her she broke her wrist she had surgery didn't require any medication postoperatively in in her family there are people that have similar genetic deletions but not to the extent that she has so when you start thinking about that as development and this is within her endocannabinoid system that she has that deletion so we start thinking about that hmm could we create a medicine that will not be harmful that will not cause us to have addiction and could we do that so she's a very exciting person and she's very happy so this is great the other thing when we talk about topicals and again this is not really arthritis base but cannabis compound could be a weapon to fight against superbugs we worry about antibiotic we antibiotics and overuse and antibiotic stewardship is something that we as physicians have undertaken after we've written tons of prescriptions for it now we have to kind of hold back so this was actually in a mouse model where they applied topical cannabidiol and mrs a so methicillin-resistant Staph aureus gone we have two patients in our practice right now that have had topical cannabidiol and especially in a lady that had a below knee amputation and had a wound that would not heal it's completely healed applying cannabidiol and then in another gentleman that had peripheral vascular disease so he had lots of swelling in his feet and subsequent callus his legs are clearing up as well so topical cannabidiol is something that we're very interested in and so going forward patients and physicians are learning together this is so important and so we appreciate I appreciate when patients can be honest and forthright and tell me what they're doing to manage their pain as dr. Khan was talking about substance use and elder population it's really quite interesting when we do a drug screen in those populations about what people are actually using so I'm in a very privileged place when we talk about addiction and mental health because people tell me things and now with this I actually have something that can help them I have another tool in my belt it's not the panacea it's not the the unicorn it is another tool that we must do more research with so today what I'd like you to think about is really about if you're using cannabis and how how you would like to take that obviously ingestion is the best when you're looking at more than one affected joint particularly with arthritis topical may be the best for a localized area again start low and go slow we don't want you to run into trouble or running down the street without any clothes on we don't want that to happen either and the biggest issue really is accessibility and affordability accessibility and affordability I cannot stress enough so in terms of lobbying Health Canada to provide safe access for patients to have relationships with their pharmacy to have medication reviews with their pharmacist as it relates to using cannabis as well insurance companies to be able to cover it document your successes and your challenges when you're using cannabis I want to hear about it your physician will want to hear about it it's important because we're all doing research we're all students as it as it relates to medical cannabis and we're learning so much about this amazing plant and that is it okay we have some online questions and I think you've actually touched on some of the things that that people want to know sure more about so the first question can CBD cause liver problems is it safe to take with methotrexate hmm okay so you have to really look at the pathways so we talked about pathways let go through our liver we have many of them methotrexate generally has been safe but we always want to follow that patient obviously closely we talked about there's been just a paper released on the possibility that CBD may cause liver toxicity it really some people will have elevated liver enzymes but the people that I've seen I haven't seen that happen so it may be something that is a one-off but it's not something that I've seen okay here's something you did touch on cannabis is so expensive are there more affordable ways to access medical cannabis well I don't want you to go to jail so that would be stealing it so no no I I think it's so challenging for many patients there is the ability to grow cannabis under the medical regimen but that I always kind of say you know there's challenges with that in itself because patients aren't able to test their cannabis for me as a physician I really want to know what they're taking the license holders will have certificate of analysis and so we look at that certificate we can say is this working for you we can look at the terpene profile the cannabinoid profile where as in in the growing market we don't we don't see that so until our insurance companies get on board until we decide that we're not going to tax this medicine we're kind of stuck with what we have and again something you touched on how do I know what dose to start at right so I always say to my patients we start everybody on the same I generally do will do a group education with four patients and I'll say okay everybody today is gonna start off in the same I start generally at ten milligrams morning and afternoon of CBD and then if patients are having trouble sleeping I'll use a combination of THC and CBD formulations in a one full syringe can be anywhere from 10 milligrams of THC and 15 of CBD I start them off on 0.1 ml so it really is about 1 to 2 milligrams one milligram of THC so everybody starts off in the same when I see them back at their next appointment everybody will be on something different so start low go slow ok is it safe to take cannabis with my arthritis medication well it depends on what arthritis medication you're taking so patients that are taking arthritis medications and those are generally DMARDs so disease modifying agents biologics i generally and over-the-counter so how many patients with arthritis take way more ibuprofen than they should tylenol then they should right so people are taking mid foals so what's worse so when I start prescribing that cannabis to those patients Jen only the first thing to go is over-the-counter and then I let them have that conversation with their rheumatologist about medicines we don't want any damage to happen to people's joints but we just don't have enough evidence to say no problems stop so we get them to continue okay and another question about an interaction with CBD and what about blood thinners so we worry about this that pathway and so patients may be on blood thinners that we monitor on a regular basis like warfarin so it would be just like taking another medication it does follow that similar pathway and I believe it's three a four and two three a six pathway cytochrome p450 we have to really watch the blood counts for those patients on warfarin for the patients that are taking the non monitored again we monitor them and we we tell them there is a possibility that this may be competing and it's really about being being watchful okay can medical cannabis help increase a person's appetite and lead to weight gain so yeah for sure I guess and that's really about how are you using it and so yes there are some patients that may gain weight but actually what I see is the opposite and specific real THC strains so THC v is something that we look at as a potentially novel drug to help people lose weight and we're looking at at that in our patients living with diabetes patients living with diabetes generally I have a number of patients and I'm thinking about one man in particular he reduced he kept having lows I'm here like what the heck is going on this is when I first started and actually he was able to reduce his insulin requirements by 50% because of this HCV as well as the cannabidiol so there's definitely potential in our patients living with diabetes to help drive that sugar back in the cell so one of the things that I always tell my patients if you have diabetes I want you to make sure that you're monitoring your Sugar's Monday Wednesday Friday and to ensure that you're not having lows because we may have to adjust medication okay we may need an accountant for this one can I claim medical cannabis on my taxes like other medications yes you can yes you can so I always tell patients so if they've been accessing the REC store and they're going well it's just easier to do that and I say well you can't write off a case of beer you're not going to write off your cannabis so if you're truly using this medically come into the medical program and then we adjust we adjust them and then they can actually put that towards their taxes oh and here's a good one can I travel to the US with medical cannabis I have to stop my treatment unless you want to go to jail so it's really challenging and actually I'd really love for our Snowbird associations to to really lobby the government for this there's a number of legal markets in this in the States and I have patients that have actually changed their destination to actually go to a place where it's legal so there are ways that we can there's synthetic illegal it's illegal federally they're federally but in this state they can also but traveling with cannot no no no you cannot but patients have changed their destinations so that they can actually buy it they're there and there are synthetic forms of cannabis which can be very challenging for patients because the it's very strong so they sometimes will use that dependent but for the most part they they're kind of stuck what if my doctor won't talk to me about cannabis you can ask them for a referral and if not come and see me yeah it's you have to find a prescribing doctor it's challenging because physicians all physicians across Canada are allowed to write a medical document for cannabis if they tell you that it's not allowed it's just because they're not comfortable to do that so it would be the patient if the physician is not willing to prescribe or refer then it's going to be the patient seeking help themselves yeah and a lot of the licensed producers or the medical cannabis they they have doctors on call yeah they do for sure okay what if CBD and THC have little effect on me that's an excellent question I was just talking about you know the the bell curve so I'm very interested in the people that are very sensitive and the people that you could give them a whole bottle of it and it doesn't work so when I talk about new research we're talking about really precision medicine pharmacogenomics the genetic expression of your endocannabinoid system and all the variants because you guys are all stars in the sky some of you might belong to constellations so it's it's the research is coming and so we're gonna get to the point where we're precisely able to prescribe specifically for you so okay research ok we can now open it up to our studio audience anyone I fans're all the questions and and what's your name please my name is Brenda I'm wondering for example like I'm assuming you shouldn't drive if you're taking this stuff and I'm assuming what if you're looking after grandchildren I'm talking about taking it for a medical reason like are you going to be okay who is doing that and looking after grandchildren well friend it depends on what you're taking right so if you're using high CBD no intoxication if you're adding so I have patients that will take 60 milligrams of CBD and add in maybe 2 milligrams of THC right and so that is the CBD is really buffering the intoxicating effects of the THC you're still get getting the opiate sparing ability from the THC but no intoxication so can you drive yeah if you're not intoxicated the rule of thumb is and again the low-risk use guidelines are available as well but if you feel intoxicated don't drive if you're if you're taking THC and CBD at night for sleep generally you should feel fine in the morning unless you've taken too much and then you need to check yourself you shouldn't say at night so when you were sleeping does it have the effect in the daytime of no pain or you have to be taking it to have the no pain so mostly patients are taking CBD during the day ok most of my patients are retired so they're not having to worry about THC during the day but most that use THC THC during the day are taking such small amounts with such a good CBD buffer that they they're fine okay thank you anyone else okay thank you so much [Applause] [Music] you", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "BLqIYyv6Dck": "[Music] hi there welcome to the canvas kitchen with Christmas coming I thought it might be a nice idea to make some CBD infused booboo balm now this is just kind of a homemade type of polysporin works great on little cuts and bruises and the CBD oil will help with the pain and maybe help with a little bit of information as well so this is a nice easy recipe it's an infusion recipe today we're going to use CBD oil you can use CBD bud as well and you can infuse that with the other flowers that we're going to be infusing today so we've got some calendula flowers here and on the bottom we've got some lavender buds as well so we're gonna be infusing those into our mixture and we should make a really nice balm when it's done and we'll pack them in some nice little tins and give them away for Christmas so let's start out with some of our more wet ingredients so this here is a mixture so this is a quarter cup of olive oil get the purest one extra virgin and the best one you can find and also in here is a quarter cup of hemp seed oil so we're gonna add that into our double boiler we're going to get that warming up a little bit we want to get all these oils nice and warm so that bill in a few is really nicely with the flowers that were using today okay so the next thing we need is a half a cup of coconut oil I've melted this down just a little bit so that I can do the proper measurement so we're gonna pop that in as well so if you want to you can actually use some cannabis infused coconut oil for this recipe as well but I didn't do that in this one just because I want to keep it just a straight seaweedy recipe but if you have some cannabis that has some CBD in it that would be fine to use as well there okay so the next thing we need to do is add in four tablespoons of beeswax pellets so this is actually a little third cup measuring cup so if you did a heaping third of a cup you can do that as your measurement as well so we're just gonna pop those in we want to get that all nice and melted perfect there so we're just going to get this stirred around and make sure it's melted and then we're going to add our flour to it okay so we have here third of a cup of dried lavender buds and a third of a cup of calendula flowers dried so there then the calendula flowers are a little bit funny looking but they have a very nice smell to them almost an earthy kind of smell and of course the lavender buds smell beautiful so we're just gonna pop these right in just like that and then we're going to mix them around and get them nice and soaked here we are okay so the next thing we're gonna head in is our dose of a CBD oil I'm using some aurora CBD oil today try and find the highest concentration that you can because we're going to be making a few little contains with this we want to make sure it was a good dose in each little bit that people are going to be using so I've got my dose here and I'm just gonna pour that in I would say depending on your strength of your CBD oil you can use like a tablespoon I would say up to about two tablespoons without ruining your recipe because you don't want it to be too mushy either so the next thing we're going to add in is this tiny tiny little bit and this is beautiful this is ten drops of tea tree essential oil as well you can add a little bit more a little bit less to your liking for that too and then we're gonna add in five drops of lavender essential oil I put in a few more I put probably about equal ten in ten of the tea tree and lavender oil but you can do it however you like the recipe that I use usually calls for about five five drops so we're gonna go back to stirring this again this is melting quite nicely there you go now I don't know if you can see this mixture but you can see that the beeswax pellets are melting in here as well quite nicely so what we're going to do with this is we're just gonna let it go we're gonna let that simmer together on the double boiler for about two hours and then we can run it through a strainer get all the flowers back out again and then we can get it packaged so you're just going to let that go if you want to stir it now and again just to keep things moving you can certainly do that and again if you're using CBD bud you're probably going to want to grind that up a little bit not too powdery because you don't want it to be too sneak through the strainer later on or just break some butt up into little pieces and that works as well so we're going to let that sit and we're just gonna let that simmer I've got my double boiler on the water right now isn't quite too boiling so this will probably heat up a little bit faster once that water is at a boiling point and then we can actually turn the stove down a little bit just so that it simmers make sure too that you continue to check the bottom of your pan just to make sure that you haven't lost too much water you'll want to fill that up again if you need to but we're going to let that go for two hours and then once that's ready to go we're gonna put it into packaging okay welcome back so what we've done is we've had this mixture infusing in our little double boiler I mean it's been going for about two hours it looks like everything's lovely and melted together all the beeswax pellets are also all melted in here so what we're going to do now is we're just going to turn off our heat and then we're going to take this bowl we're going to just pour it through here so I just have a regular strainer and a measuring cup and we're just gonna put a little bit of cheese cloth on top I think that will really help us to get all those seeds out maybe we can pick it up like a little tea bag and squish them on low the other thing you can do is like I said before if you have made your mix and put your herbs in your flour just into a little sachet like this and just tie it off you makes your job a little bit easier as well so we're just gonna take this mixture right off the stove under there there we go okay try not to burn yourself use some oven mitts if he need to here we go okay so we're just gonna pour this right through this cheesecloth through the strainer there we go beautiful so just make sure you've got everything get all those oils out from the bottom of your pan there we go perfect let's put that right up there again for now so you can see all the herbs or all the flowers that we've got here so we want to definitely get all of that goodness into the bottom of our container here so we're just going to take a grab of it just like that Oh I'm just gonna gather that up yeah and then we're just gonna push down I just keep squeezing it when it's cooled off enough you can actually do this with your hands it does cool down fairly quickly so there's still quite a bit of oil in there that we need to get out so we're just going to keep squeezing that through so oh we were left to do now is just poured into some containers so let me just dry my little area here first there you're gonna move this Cup right out of the way so I've got these little tins very easy to use her couple ounces each you can buy them on Amazon I will put the link down below in the description below for you or actually probably on the Canadian wheat forum website we've got a whole recipe section there on the forum and I put all my recipes that I make on this channel up on to the website so you can get get the links there for that so what we're gonna do now is just give these a little pour you can fill them as much or as little as you like these ones have a little bit of a line around the outside edge so I like to just fill them up to that edge / so what we're gonna do now is we're just gonna let them sit we're gonna let them get a little bit solid you can actually see just by the cup that it does actually come to temperature to room temperature fairly quickly so I'm gonna heat this up a little bit again and we'll put that into another container and save that for another one but it gives you a general idea of what we're doing here so if you want to fill them up a little bit more you can fill them in like I said is fill is you like because they are gonna get a little bit harder perfect all right so we're just gonna let this sit we're going to let it get to room temperature and then we will check them out and see what you think okay so we have our little containers of our boo boo bomb or it's all back up to warm temperature or to room temperature and it's ready to go so you can see here what it looks like the consistency of it is fairly soft if you like run your hands on it you can feel that it's you know moving some stuff around you can probably dig in there if you want to but basically all you need to do is give a little rub on the top and if you got something sore or a little cut or something you just put it right on there so it works really well um it's a very nice alternative to using anything medicinal in terms of like polysporin or something like that or an antibiotic cream what you can do to add a little bit more properties to it in terms of lasting longer or a healing is a little bit of honey so yeah I've had a teas tablespoon of honey to your mixture that's another nice addition so you can start to take away and add and play around with things as you like I've changed this recipe a few times over the years but this one is my favorite I love the addition of the hemp seed oil and I love the the fact that you can do either see medial or you can use straight bud and both ways works wonderfully so I hope you enjoyed this video thank you again for joining us I'm sure the family members that are getting this and they're stocking this year will be very happy to and

most exciting skincare ingredients of our time a beauty game-changer said to help ease dry skin reduce inflammation and alleviate other skin issues with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties but is there any truth to these claims or are cannabis based cosmetics just a new marketing trend first things first CBD does not get you high it's a non psychoactive ingredient found in both cannabis plants marijuana and hemp not to be confused with THC which is the chemicals solely found in marijuana that gets you high so even though this ad for cush mascara looks like it'll get you high it will not there is a common fear about it as soon as you talk about CBD always people think that oh it's you're putting marijuana on your skin so you could get psychoactive chemicals in your system that's not the case the problem is in many cases CBD on labels is being misrepresented a 20-17 study found that nearly 70% of CBD products online or miss labels back to this mascara it actually has no CBD in it instead it contains cannabis sativa seed oil also known as hemp oil and derives from the seeds of the hemp plants which has been around for decades most of the beauty products that actually contain CBD come from industrial hemp you have to note that hemp seed oil or can give us speed or even the same thing as CED oil CBD oil is a different component so it's extracted from the leeks and flowers of the hemp plant at the finer and lighter oil as compared to hemp seed oil that tends to be a greasy ER this type of CBD is usually listed in the ingredients as cannabis oil or full spectrum hemp it has less than 0.3 percent THC and saw a massive bloom in the US after the 2018 farm bill was passed and hemp derived CBD became legal in all 50 states marijuana's derives CBD is illegal in the US except for the states where marijuana is legalized in Canada topicals are legal but can only be bought at federally licensed pot shops but whether it was extracted from hemp or marijuana the CBD is identical on a molecular level outside of the label confusion people really just want to know if these products actually work on your skin I think the thing with skin is it's like a hot topic everybody's jumping on the bandwagon everybody wants to get a piece of pie and the Mart is more marketing than science research has shown CBD can help with some things but there's not enough evidence out there to prove it will clear up your acne or wrinkles I think the most powerful studies I reviewed for this discussion is not in skincare it's actually in pain control and arthritic pain or anti-inflammatory for joints there's there's more studies in that realm and just because it's plant-based she adds doesn't mean it can't have side effects anything that can comes from the earth can give you a rash and as the use of it increases and maybe higher concentrations are put into products like especially in high-risk areas like lips and mascara we might start see allergic reactions so canna Beauty may not be the magic solution it's marketed to be and as the industry continues to grow consumers will need to be extra careful with what's truth and what's trend

oil for pain? If you are looking for\nany type of marijuana, cannabis, or insight\ntied to whether or not CBD oil is legal, I'll explain, the crazy sale coming right up. (upbeat music) CBD oil, medical marijuana, and more. Oh my. Great to be with you, hello. Little bit of, spray of that. Imagine that being able to ease your pain. If you've never seen me before, I'm the YouTube Deal Guy, Matt Granite. You might know me from your CBS, NBC, ABC TV stations, I also host\na show for Amazon Live, and I'm Canadian where the\nlegalities of marijuana have really not been\ndebated to the same extent in different countries or cities and, I don't have any type of\npolitical stance on anything. I hunt down deals. I'm here only to answer the question, does CBD oil for pain\nwork and is it legal? So, first things first,\nI'm just gonna make sure I got all my legal notes\nright up here, a reminder, that CBD oil from hemp\nis legal in the U.S., it is not psychoactive cannabinoid. That does not contain\ntetrahydrocannabinol, THC. Do I sound like an expert? No, I'm not. I'm a deal expert. In fact, I actually asked two experts to assist with today's\ndeal, including a doctor. But before we get to that, I have pain. Imagine, if you've ever\nused Bengay, or Icy Hot. Every time you have that\npain, you put it on, you get your hands covered,\nand then you have your, smell like aromatherapy\nfor the next five years, like peppermint extract. And with this beautiful\nbaby, who I've shown you in some videos, by the\nway, she's getting bigger. She weighs over 20 pounds\nnow at eight months, so just about twenty\npounds, and my back, neck, and shoulders are hurting more\nthan they have in the past. The concept of a spray\nthat could alleviate pain, is something that I wanna\nshow to you right now, in fact, there's a deal link for it, just expand the video\ndescription box right under me, and you will have your\nlink revealed to that. But before we get to why I like it, let's actually hear from two experts. I have Dr. Derek, who you\nmight have seen on TV, he's a USA Today contributor, and then Bruno Roder, who is, I believe, a physical therapist, and\nhe also works with people who live with pain across the country. - Pain relief, many people\nare in need of pain relief, possibly problems in the shoulders, the hips, the knees,\nthe back, or the neck. Now there is many ways\ntraditionally, to handle pain relief, many drug medications\nand surgical treatment could be very invasive,\nor some easier things, something newer more modern\nlike CBD oil is extremely effective and is gaining more credibility. Why? Because it gives you\nthe actual pain relief. On top of the fact, what\nI love about this kind is they mix it with magnesium. Now, magnesium, in case you're wondering, is a natural pain reliever, but also, it's a muscle relaxant,\nso it gets the muscles to relax before we get the\ninflammation and the pain out with the CBD oil. Very effective when used\nin conjunction with ice, and some other treatment as well. Take this, one or two\nsprays at the affected area. I love using it on my knees\nor my hands to get rid of some arthritis pain. Also too, I work with a lot of clients that might have pain in the\nlower back or in the knees. Very effective with that as well. And lastly, it smells delightful. You don't have to worry about\nit smelling like a medicine cabinet coming your way, so try this. One or two sprays to the affected area, and you'll be amazed at how fast it works, and how good you feel. - We all get sore. Whether we work out or not, we get sore. I've been turned on to a muscle\nspray that is so amazing. You spray it on, feels cool\nat first, then it warms up, goes right to the\nmuscles, no mess, no fuss, I even like the odor, it's amazing. - So why do I like it? If you have knee, shoulder, hand, foot, neck,\nor back, and hip pain, this unique spray design allows\nfor that clean application, as opposed to those creams, which I mentioned could get messy, and soil other items that you touch. This is also the only natural\nand safe modern extra strength pain relief, without a prescription. So the CBD, you get that pain relief, and the inflammation\nreducer, the magnesium, which is the muscle relaxant. And keep in mind that\nthis is the only product on the market that has both. Magnesium is a natural mineral salt extracted from the brine of the Dead Sea, which allows your muscles to relax. and then the CBD oil,\nobviously, the concentrations, are a natural yet powerful inflammation and swelling reliever. The peppermint oil will\nrefresh and relax your skin, and then the chamomile is\njust another botanical boost to soothe that tired skin. It really works. I've used Icy Hot, or I think it was usually\ncalled antiphygesia, I know they have different\nthings in different countries, but, I'm telling you right now, this is awesome. And despite all of the arguments about what should be\ntransported and made where, and what's in what product, I'm not here to debate any of that, only to tell you that\nthis really does work. And its legal. So that's great. If you do want to take\nadvantage of this item, obviously the company behind this is not paying me to say nice things about them, I'm not endorsing this, I'm\njust telling you that it works. And if you do talk to a chiropractor, physical therapist, or Doctor\nDerek, or another doctor, they can attest the fact\nthat the formulation of this product is beneficial. That's all I'm here to do, show you a deal on it. Click that video. Click that link below the\nvideo description box, I wonder if they had a spray\nto help you speak properly. That would be awesome. And you'll find what you're looking for. Thank you again for watching. The only reason I knew to hunt this down, was because subscribers\nrequested this product. I was actually getting a\nlot of requests for this. By the way, if you have\nnot yet subscribed to or listened to my Deal Guy podcast which is available to Spotify and iTunes, The Deal Guy podcast,\nfeel free to do that, because a lot of the\nlisteners will also chime in, so its like between YouTube subscribers, and podcast listeners,\nI'm rewarded on both sides by amazing insight because you guys all make me\nmuch better at my job.

is the only thing that I've found that works for my pain especially my hip pain I can take that and within about 20 minutes I'll know whether I've got to reach for the morphine based drug or not and a lot of the time I actually don't have to go for that which is huge to me I'm very passionate about CBD and I'm actually with some friends and that online we've started a support group for other people with chronic pain illnesses I've got friends now who have MS there's so many conditions that can be treated by CBD that it's not just about fibro it's something that the the world needs access to you know it was which is why I got so upset with chronic pain being missed off the at the bill there recently because there's so many others that don't want to use opiates we want to have a natural alternative to that I'm actually convinced that part of my cognitive decline is actually as a result to my and one of the tablets I've been taking so I'm desperate to get off that because I've struggled find my words I'm actually doing quite well quite impressive myself", "3av2klpp-5Q": "[Music] welcome back to primal living my goodness we have such an exciting show for you today okay so why is CBD oil so popular it's a supplement that has been known to help so many people in so many different ways which we're going to explore right right now and today but first of all introduce the fabulous cherry Kapil cherry hey lovely to see you very good now you're the co shows the co-founder of pro-life CBD yes explain a little bit about your company okay so pro-life seaweedy for anybody who doesn't know we've been working with primal for a while now a long time now it has been a long time and we're we feel so privileged to to be here and have pro-life here because our aim pro life's story if you like and what a more goal is to be the best provider of CBD oils and in sounds that were going to talk about later as well in world so we started this company we'll talk about this later but we set up the company quite a long time ago due to some personal issues that rule which we'll go into but we source the best CBD available in the world as far as we are concerned and from start to finish yes and that's what we bring to you today and it's so lovely it's so lovely to have cherry here in the studio as well to answer questions I'm going to be asking lots of questions that you may have at home you may know lots about there and the C video or you may know a little bit but we're really going to be exploring your mania may know nothing about it at all but first of all I've talked about the offers we have today okay so let's just talk through the oils now just be very clear these are oils you ingest these are oils you take will explain the quantities to stress the everything about this so there are three on off the today as well as the South okay so we'll talk again I'm just done so these are all the first way is 10 millimeter ten millimeter sized okay which is 3 that's the 8% the scale 8% in strength another 10 millimeters as well which is 20% and then we've got the bigger volume here as in quantity 300 million 400 milliliters and that sits in between a 10 percent yes okay and of course we've got the self as well where you can read target parts of the body as well yeah okay lots of questions to be home and what I love talking to you cherry because you're so passionate about this this comes off you're a real ambassador for for the oils there's not actually one question you don't know the answer to yeah and it's always fueled with such passion and I've got you know take us on a few journeys as well personal stories and how yeah but let's start right at the beginning yeah what is CBD good question really isn't it it's something that so many of us heard of now and so many people do know about it but also there are people new new customers all the time and so CBD stands for cannabidiol you will hear it pronounced differently especially by the Americans pronunciations but what did it puts as simply as I possibly can put it it is a compound okay so you will hear me talk about and you'll hear other people refer to cannabinoids yeah and this is from the hemp plant so the hemp plant is made up of over a hundred different cannabinoids cannabinoid just means compound right so CBD itself is the most important compound from the hemp plant as simply as I can yeah that's it okay and that is what we're focusing on it'sit's the compound that has the most health benefits that's proving to help people the most through so much research that's going on right now our oils do have other compounds in as well which we can touch on later yeah sure but CBD itself is is what everybody is talking about what everybody wants and it really is proving to be magical really just extreme will come on to how how it's been known to help her along the way but just just really signpost the quality of this pro life it really is different than what I've seen out there again we'll come to this yeah I'm always interested when we have where we have guests on and meet people like yourself cherry is how quite often there's a personal story or a narrative did CBD find you or did you find it and if you don't mind explain how yeah absolutely and Toby made many of you will have seen Toby here because he's done more shows yes and actually he's a here's the reason why we are here today unfortunately Toby last year was diagnosed with cancer okay he's only 30 in fact it was just before 30th birthday and of course that's devastation as it would be for anybody yeah and I'd already heard of CBD because of my own conditions I have epilepsy and diabetes and was told to take it and as I'm sure most people feel I don't know enough about it I didn't look into it enough I trust medicine medicine saved my life I think it's amazing but with cancer Toby having cancer it did find us in a way CBD did find us because we wanted an alternative option of course we were going to do everything possible for Toby in the medic going down the medical route but what if what more can we do to help him and so I thought let's give CBD ago what's the what's the harm it's been known to help reduce tumors it's been known to help with nausea yeah so I saw stem CBD or we sourced it together at the time and actually cutting a long story short we were sold something that wasn't what it said it was on Anton okay and now of course that fills you with doubt and mistrust and I thought well we've just spent a lot of money on something that actually isn't helping him it was that I think it was labeled as 20% in it and we found out it was 2% so you went through the tests to find out yeah yeah because it just we weren't seeing the effect and anyway long story short we ended up going to a company in America yeah that's how long it took us some trialing CBDs in the UK we ended up in America with a fantastic company who they set up because a little girl over there she was having 300 seizures a week and they also needed an option an alternative option because no medication was helping I had epilepsy they set at the CBD company and it's she's now seizure free which blows my mind it's absolutely amazing and of course I thought that works that's amazing oil we need it yeah and as we've we then bought it for what it over for Toby and it wasn't really until a friends and family said why don't you do this is it there is obviously a huge gap in the UK market for for this amazing oil there's lots available you will see it being sold in many many stores yeah but the quality wasn't there not that we could find not that we wanted for a serious condition like cancer yeah and so that's how it was born because our friends and family said why you I mean this is going to help people why don't you why don't you yeah offer it to the world it's not going to DJ I feel this from you and Toby there's an incredible passion I feel and with your pioneer is in many way that the purpose of what you're doing here was a driven from a passion of getting a quality getting the quality product to the people who yeah absolutely it's honestly it's it's strange to sit here and almost talk about it like it's a business because it was a personal help to our family it was just a it was to help to try and improve my brother's health yes to then change into a business and help other people has been amazing it's been one of the most incredible journeys and the feedback we've been getting and we've been getting from here at Prime yeah and that's where the passion comes from because the the feeling every single day yeah that you are helping people improve their lives is one of the best things in the world yes just unbelievable and also we didn't know at the time where the Toby would be how poorly he'd be he would be yeah he travels a lot for work he goes on television we didn't have to do this hair we didn't all these things and we thought you know what this gives him a project it's helping his health let's help other people and we are hugely passionate about it comes across and it comes across in the products well in the oils as well and here at primer living we love learning you are love learning as well we again it's always feel if you if we if we learn empowers as we can make more informed decisions and with the pro life it seems a very same sort of ethos as well about in getting that that knowledge absolutely and we learn all the time as well we're always learning right now as I say the I've just first of all and I just talk about what it can help with or how it's helped people yeah exactly but but just before then is this legal absolutely legal yes you can there's been a lot of debate around see we do yours but it is 100% legal in almost every country now now there are a couple of countries around the world that are yet to change their their laws but is in terms of you buying at home and taking in the UK it is 100% legal there is nothing about our oils that are okay we're really going to explore the ingredients and what's in these fabulous bottles along the way as well now what can now we've had who you've had to help me out as well as what can if I'm actually it's a very loaded question the big question what pan CBD helped with so I printed this off in it because yes it's never ending list almost do you know what this isn't even this doesn't touch the sides right because the list is ridiculous so let me just read for you and Finnick yeah just some of the conditions and this is this policy go online and have a look for yourself because this is just a tenth I mean there isn't anything yet that someone's come to me with where it hasn't I haven't been able to find a way that CBD would help so Justin lists a few addiction they go there on the screen for you as well ADHD Alzheimer's anorexia anxiety anxiety huge arthritis also huge heart disease glue coma depression diabetes my experience with diabetes is amazing epilepsy liver disease kidney disease nausea OCD are super Isis Parkinson's PTSD skin condition sleep disorders stress and stress this huge as well it helps people in stroke recovery anyone with bipolar disorders migraines moods yes I could honestly we could do extraordinary yeah yeah I mean I mean what were your thoughts and feelings here with this one and what I don't know what here at Brown living we have and we want the whole our show which is great but I know sometimes when you got people for five minutes or ten days people dip in and dip out so really championing and signposting the quality of these particular oils that we see I've seen CVD elsewhere for example yeah quality of these prolong it's it's everything I must say it's this is this is where it always boils back to why we are here yeah the reason why we didn't end up with an oil from the UK the reason why I love a soft little question then why are we here talking about this what is in these bottles is in our bodies anyway so cannabinoids all these compounds that you get within these bottles have always been within our body we produce them naturally but that's a whole that's a whole different thing we'll talk about that in a second but no but why pro life exists yeah is it's because it was for our health so we are not messing around on quality we don't try and cook any corners we aren't trying to produce it faster we aren't trying to produce it cheaper because to drop any of our quality standards in the process of the plant to getting it into that bottle yeah it just wouldn't it just wouldn't fit what we're trying to do I think one's across I mean I've been since I was doing this show with you I have research research research and there's all kinds of other extraction procedure which will go into yeah and they're in in a little while with any kind of when we here on probably living with any kind of the vitamins a bit minerals or someone's always have those two questions how where why which and how so how does this work give it a go alright this is a big one this and this will if you haven't heard about this before will fascinate you in terms of in terms of how it works yeah you need to try it then I'm not for yeah absolutely okay so this still today I have talked about CBD for I don't know how many days and hours of my life and it still blows my mind that this is that this works in in the way that it does okay so you get pipette yeah so let me first of all tell you about the endocannabinoid system yes that's everything we have a system in our bodies that they only discovered 30 years ago and you've got basically if Elliot could show us the picture there it is so you've gotta talk us through talk us through that is there you see all those green dots they are receptors uh-huh and that is what your endocannabinoid system is so it's receptors all throughout the body and what they control everything Wow mood appetite stress and anything that send you a body out of balance yeah yeah the endocannabinoid system is there to bring you back to homeostasis which is a word you will hear a lot here at primal a word that you will hear a lot associated with CBD the whole point of this system and there was an article the other day that actually said it is the most important system you've never heard of so should I take - no and you can't explain what if Nick takes them and then I can explain what is happening immediately and this is what's so so unbelievable about CBD yeah so you juice you produce this anyway okay yep so can we have cannabinoids that we produce within our body that naturally happens an endocannabinoid system works very nicely yeah until we become deficient which I'll talk about in a second okay and then you now are about to top up your cannabinoids wonderful okay so good in the bottle you get your pipette yes okay now what I would recommend we'll talk about doses and strengths later on yeah what I would recommend for you now if you just have like a third zapper pet yeah directly under your tongue why under the tongue because it will absorb into your bloodstream okay so the reason we don't do capsules the reason that we focus on oil rather than capsules is because it goes directly in your bloodstream and you don't if you had it at the capsule you would lose the absorption of course okay so under the tongue and you'll have to keep it there for 90 seconds please 96 yeah right okay so okay so how many do tell me cops recommend the my I would say just just for now let's plane drops ace about a third of the pipette I would do just under or just down okay so under your tongue okay so nips now taking it under his tongue in a very glamorous way and if we go back to the endocannabinoid system I'll tell you what's happening so then you don't have to look at Nick just [Laughter] this right now in Nick's body imagine that's Nick on screen now all of these kind of receptors are there what the CBD is doing now is going to the receptors that need it the most so you might I don't know people take it for migraines or I or IBS exactly I've surf a lot from anxiety and yep the nervousness anxiety that's something I you know deal with in managing my own way but I mean everybody does have a way of managing it but this is we're seeing such a huge response in terms of anxiety yes what this will do now is it will bind to your receptors if you were anxious now it would deal with that problem never be anxious with you cherry ever knows what it does it's binds to these receptors and it puts you back in balance right gotcha so unfortunately because of our life today because of other stresses of life because of our diet because of the pollution because of the way that we live yeah our systems are more out of balance more and more unfortunately it's hitting on the head and that's what would you know we talked a lot about here at primer I mean if you meant a technology for example technology's meant to enhance that quality of life and make as more efficient how much does it in which makes me it just makes us more seemingly for me I can speak personally but more stressful but if you look at all the qualities of life absolutely right it's almost like we're again are we built for this amount of sorry I don't know you know that's the thing I think we're stressing our bodies more and more this is where is this is why I think this has become so important recently because as that happens so as you're stressed as you're anxious as you're our diet isn't maybe as good as it should be yeah our bodies basically go out balance and that's where this comes in yes because where your body can't produce enough cannabinoids it enough of its own cannabinoids yeah and where the receptors are starting to slow down and not work as well yeah in comes this yes so CBD does two things yes it encourages your body to produce its own cannabinoids again mm-hmm and what then all these cannabinoids are going to do is work with the receptors in your endocannabinoid system sorry for being so technical that's good it's good but I love this view it is you know love this we love learning it's empowering and it's exciting because you think I won't how do we not know about this until we salute yeah yeah but the bottom line is CBD helps to get your body back in balance right and when you're in balance you're not sick and when you're in balance you fit have more energy and when you're in balance it's just it just makes sense doesn't it when you're at optimum health you feel your best yeah and that is the simplest way I can put it is Brede is there to get you back into balance absolutely okay so just to recap I know we've got I hope you got me for that the whole show but some people depend about five minutes these are the CBD oils on offer today okay let's talk you through so I've got the you've got ten mill are over 8% 8% in strength with the toolbox we will come we're going to come to the Trent's a little I've got the 10 mil off if I put that there 20% and the bigger bottle as in with volume and this is 100 mil at 10% so in between the two and we've also got the solved to come yeah as well well goes to the 20% round just so the cameras can see you can see at home okay so so starting with the strength and who where do people begin who would be so we start with the 8% who would who'd you recommend that for okay so a lot of people come to us that have tried maybe two and a half percent or three percent or five percent from somewhere else right and I understand why people try that because it's more affordable okay because you're getting less CBD yeah yeah the reason why our eight percent is our entry level if you like is because that's where we believe you get benefits but also not everyone necessarily needs higher than that so it's a perfect place to start so we have lots of people coming to a set of tried CBD from elsewhere and that's where they start yeah because I personally think you have to you have to gauge what you need everyone's doing we're all different and we respond differently to so I could easily recommend okay go straight in with 20% but you might not need that it depends on what you're taking it for so my mum for example perfect example doesn't take it for a specific ailment she just takes yep said everyday to give a dose and keep her as a preventative perhaps as a preventative and there's a key thing all my friends and family now that take it yeah I say well why you might not take it for a specific ailment but don't wait to get ill too then say I need CBD or like Toby unfortunately but that's what happened with Tony a lot of people take it as a preventative now yeah because it's keeping you in balance yeah and if you go out of balance yeah then you're more likely to get sick it's what it's difficult to know whether what comes first yes body goes out of balance and you get a disease yeah yeah well you get a disease and it sends you out of balance either way yeah this helps to keep that homeostasis going I mean this I mean I can I know so many people buzzing about this right now the deal is are as in you're stripping you're watching this means the deals still here so the free phone number is on the screen there as well if you have any questions we've got more to bring you as well cherries brain to pick as we go on but you've got the the three different sizes of bottle and strengths as well and exceed the price is flashed up on the on the screen here now cherry just before we came to wear as well with the shelves talking to Terry about the the processes because I've really researched and other brands as I say and the extraction processes you don't downplay it but there's so much work so much passion and so much emphasis on your extraction process and I can I do you mind if I taught you about this because is it quite extraordinary so and and it again we talked about the safety of the quality and the efficiency but the extraction process of your and the pro-life CD can you talk us through yeah absolutely and this applies by the way to all three because the eight percent that we were just talking about is is the same in theory as the twenty percent the ten percent there is no range in quality they're all absolute top quality it's simply how much do you need to take so the eight percent is the entry level is is is something that most people most people would take for the first time and then you might go up to the ten percent or 20 percent but I just wanted to make it clear that every single one is the same quality same extraction yeah yeah it's just how much you want to each bottles but yes extraction it okay so I was reading there are some practice out there or for example using ethanol yeah this is now you can read about this online and there are many different opinions about this okay I guess pro-life approach we co2 extract so I'll try next time explain this sorry I put on this - there's so much - but no there is so much to it and it's very very scientific but the bottom line is everything we do is natural no pesticides no herbicides no alcohol anyway not yeah there is we do not cut a corner most companies now most use ethanol extraction and that basically means simply as I can put it you soak all of the hemp in ethanol mm-hmm yes it will get rid of your pesticides and herbicides you can't then fully extract the ethanol gotcha you don't want to take you don't want to be taking ethanol that's not the idea so we do co2 extraction and not just that it's this is I don't know whether it's too technical but we do supercritical co2 extraction this is this is what my I was being treated by when researching researching earlier before you before and we came to air is they you don't have to do this but the fact is you do because you're so passionate about this I feel like you have you have I feel like you have to do it to say that you were offering quality CBD because you take CBD for your health you can't then say on what on the one hand take it for your health but then oh but you're also taking F and although you've also got okay pesticides everything has to be all gotten and we are certified that's another thing is growing it organically grown organically and it's certified and we don't just certify it in the US where it's come from this is from Colorado by the way it's all from Colorado the best the best base that we know of in the world and our relationship with them is fantastic but they certified in Colorado it's certified in the UK and we certified in Spain which is the best lab in Europe because we want anybody who takes this whether they're buying from the UK Europe America to know that their local lab if you like also supports what we are doing it is the best that we can visit make we cannot do anything better to make it more natural more organic and higher-quality nothing all of these that you are seeing now on the screen are just showing to you yeah that we have full-spectrum oils we have zero THC zero psychoactive hallucinogenic right so that that can I just yeah come to that because so so obviously so can you get high off CBD no why no you mentioned THC can you explain a bit more about THC I don't want THC to be seen as something bad because actually it has phenomenal the reason what they found the Inuk endocannabinoid system 30 years ago is because they were testing the effect of THC on the body and just for our viewers explain what what THC is THC is tetra hydro kind of a doll yeah just it was the HD yeah it's another compound so it's Warner for the 100 and I think 112 maybe more all of these compounds are in the hemp plant THC is the only one that has a psychoactive effect the only one that is illegal okay and it's not found in here right yeah no it's not in here not in family Hitler no nothing it's not found in our CBD oil and actually anyone who's selling legally has to be at it's less than 0.03 percent you have to have less than 0.03 percent for it to be legal okay in the u.s. I think it's less than 0.05 okay we have there we don't have less than we have there and we make sure that it's all tested to prove that there is not less than naught point naught 3 it's just zero there's nothing found no trace when it should and it should say yeah it says th see on the screen there and be determined at all yeah and that's really key for us because there is no doubt in your mind that this has any psychoactive properties at all because we do see I mean children take it so much and my family my relatives my friends clients that come to us ask them that you're giving it to their children it's very important I can say hand on heart there is zero psychoactive element in there not true rather than just oh yeah there's less now yeah we just eliminate it completely yeah okay so go come back to the CBD that we have here again talk about the quality of it talk about the concentration this trains a little bit in a second or so but can you overdose no as far there's been zero reports of overdosing because because this is something you naturally produced in your body cannabinoids that's what's in that bottle cannabinoids yeah and a little bit of a carrier oil whether that's coconut oil or hemp work but that's totally natural as well yeah so everything in there in terms of the compounds that cannabinoids we we are we are known to produce them ourselves yeah so you you can't take too much so we will talk about dosages and how much people take or how many how much people take for different conditions but if you had half a pipette there's a quarter you're fine there there's no problem okay and what about if I'm on medication different kinds of medication what's its relationship with that so everybody is different again I've not had one single report at all of it interfering the medication but always check because because what it is doing is restoring balance in your body right now I can talk to you actually about my own experience with this so I've been on the highest doses of medication for my epilepsy for eight years or so mm-hmm and they kept trying to stop my seizures from happening and nothing worked nothing worked nothing eventually medicine came through and I have been on the highest dose of the medication I can take four for eight years until this came in now I along with my doctor said okay I don't want to be on strong medication for my whole life yeah because it has its own effects on you it's right numbing and I was tired and so what I've slowly done is taken as much CBD as I think I need and reduce my medication now I've done that with the support of my doctor and I would always recommend that you ask the question yeah always that chat with your GP yeah I'm a living and yeah there's nothing to be there's nothing to hide here there yeah absolutely it's encouraged and more and more doctors I mean we've talked about this before doctors are coming through saying we've got actually I'm not sure if Elliott can find it but we had a doctor he was anti all of this right I've been in the medical medical profession for a long time and he is apologize has come out and apologized and said I was so wrong I'm so sorry and he's one of the biggest supporters now there is dr. Sanjay Gupta one of the biggest supporters of CBD right now and please research him because he's he's so famous and he's such a credible person to to tell you all about the amazing benefits but yeah going back to your question it's safe but but ask the question that's so high and that's it about education empowering ourselves pooling our intelligences but yeah do check with you obviously with your with your personal GP or the yeah speak to speak meet two people and get to get that advice as well any side effects have you known off of these we've had we've had no reports of side effects and I thought we can ask something nice we I mean because we're dealing we deal with people daily yes from having anxiety through to cancer through to Parkinson's I mean serious serious serious illnesses like we discussed on that list and you think with the amount of medication they're on mm-hmm with how they're feeling anyway even if they confuse their nausea with taking CBD but we have not had a single person come back to us and say I've had this negative side of us extraordinary is it is extraordin painkillers or you know things that we take some people will have a negative start most people won't but some people will have a negative side effect this we have had zero side effects reported actually now as I say when you can it is available elsewhere well what I'm asking you right now is what makes the pro life CBD different in its quality that's the simplest way that is it a lot of people are selling CBD because it seems on trend at the moment yes same with anything that happens and I look we've seen a lot of people close down in the last in the last year including the company that sold as the dud CBD photo be in the first folks they've gone and will see that more and more its pro-life CBD is going to be the best CBD available well because we make sure we come week that we are up to date with new press and I've seen this area I've seen with you on Toby you're so incredibly power about and also what I'm actually buzzing about that what you've you brought to us are the different strengths so you looked at the 8% yes now the 20% strengths can you talk us to who would you recommend this sauce this is in the the middle bottle here okay so this is 10 millimeters let's use this for that is currently a best seller and it changes all the time but 20% okay this is for people who generally found that 8% is giving them amazing results yeah yeah and that is it is incredible for for that reason because you don't necessarily need more than the 8% but people just love it and want they want they feel like they want to help them as much as they possibly can it doesn't actually necessarily work that way if you if you have the 8% you can still take more of it like I said the quality is the same throughout yeah it's not the 20% it's better quality the quality is the same throughout it's just stronger so you need to take a little bit okay so the strong it's a yes it's quite self-explanatory out of 10 but yes and strongly is the less you need to take perhaps so you can manage it yourself and so if you if you if the 8% is got four I think it's four milligrams a drop uh-huh yeah they're about yeah yeah and and the 20 will be 10 10 milligrams so it's very popular though endure all probably unfortunately it's very popular because we have a lot of people now coming to us with very serious conditions right okay so not everyone needs to 20% but there's a lot of people that have serious serious problems that need the 20% and actually we've got requests for an even higher percentage which we're looking at yeah but that's basically what it supports for more serious conditions but it like we said earlier you can't take too much with anybody so it's just this it's the strongest quality sorry the stronger strength that we strongest percentage yeah and I think we touched upon it earlier when I was doing research and research and research and I know you there's nothing you don't know about this but when I've looked elsewhere and the the a percent is the lowest percent we have here but that seems to be beyond of some people's highest percent that's why we do it you know we truly believe if we're honest we could offer a 20 pound bottle bottle if we did two and a half percent or five percent we don't believe that good enough effects yeah and so for the extra 20 pounds 10 pounds 30 pounds how much value you put on your help this is the thing and we think there's no point in offering a lower percentage because it doesn't do enough that's just our philosophy just what we believe why yes we are stronger than everyone else and maybe a little bit more expensive than other people but at least we're seeing massive benefits from that customers it's just the home of quality CBD it's experience has the highest quality so just to recap so we've been looking at the 20% which is in the hundred mill bottle again with the pipette that looks like a 10 mil forgive me 10 mil so 20 percent all the detail on the screen the Oh 800 number and must stress as well and they're all popular this again for many is there the one of choice by getting it's down to your which one you're liking the look off or or Lottie will subscribe to these as well so yeah the number there are 800 number to get involved and ok so that was a little my taste but I've tasted it it's a very distinctive taste it's not exact it's a how did you find out if you haven't tried these like nothing I think that it's an earthly it's not unpleasant don't get me wrong it's not unpleasant at all but it's not it's I can't sort of compartmentalize it feels I said organic feels it's real come to that yeah so yes we talk about that but we use well we used offer as the carrier oil so it has to go into an oil it has to be in a carrier oil and these three that you're seeing today are in MCT coconut oil okay which has a hole so this is another sch\u00f6nox ane so just very briefly what are the benefits of having it with coconut oh well it's it helps with your metabolism it's bacterial it's it just has so many so many health benefits on its own yeah so it's just good generally for your health people take I mean my mum takes a spoonful of coconut oil every morning just yeah just another supplement well we we love here at problem we love coconut it's always a welcome addition to why we did it because we thought well if we can put it in coconut oil hemp oil is also amazing yeah and we used to offer that that was very earthy yes no I think this coconut oils neutralized it a little bit so it's I I feel more like I'm taking coconut oil than the hemp was a little bit more earthy a little bit stronger in taste but I my preference well in fact not just not just me we followed our feedback and as you know you can pay a premium for quality coconut oil yeah no please yes increase the price here or anything that I so know now I get the benefit of that as well and timeframes there's always intrigued me about things like this and so so so somebody tries lost that with do I feel something straightaway what's the how long should I take it forward ongoing yeah well your sort of thoughts on that it well I kind of touched on it but didn't expand early wrong because it's so much to talk about so yeah it this is what blows me away every single day and I don't get used to it and this is why I can't see it we can't sit here and talk testimonials because I cry last time poppy and I were both in tears you didn't show it just to if you did miss that show I know many many of you will of course it and you did show it poppy yeah it was quite emotional though it is but it's emotional all the time because like I said we started this because Toby was poorly yeah not because we intended to help the world the feeling that you get when you're helping so many people yeah and they are so thankful it's a long talk about right that's it there are just a moment we flush them up they're awesome on the problem living website as well yeah please do have a look and and and have a look at any reviews because they are amazing and we don't shy away from them at all they they fascinate me every day we have a new problem every day we have a new new illness every day we have a new review and it's just incredible to thousands and thousands of people that come to us and thank us will come to us and say please help me it is the most rewarding thing I've ever done and that's why I don't see it as a business I don't sit here as I do sit here is founder of relaxing but you might be so proud and I can see that coming from you and we're very proud to have the partnership as well I'm proud that we found it yeah I mean there are shortcuts we can make it cheaper you can make it quicker we can use other I always think you down pay this is what I'm saying I tell you never put that of the amout the work that goes into say the extraction the safety and he yeah you know I think sorry going back to your question you gone off on a tangent know what what amazes me more than anything else first of all there in the cannabinoid system and the fact that it exists and can do this this oil from a plant can do something so magical yeah but you I've witnessed and please look at this on line because it is one of the most amazing things you will ever see in your life I have witnessed somebody having an epileptic fit or somebody physically shaking with Parkinson's stop within seconds mmm-hmm how how is that it's it's a miracle to me yeah it's very moving it's extraordinary it is so the answer is yes immediate immediate so not everybody don't get so wrong not everybody feels in the median but if you think what I just did the top what moments to be feeling now he said people who are in pain people who have arthritis people who have Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety panic leaf illnesses are sleeps huge so you can take it before sleep and I guarantee if you've never taken CBD before if the first time you take it you will have one of the best night's sleep you've ever had because and the reason I can guarantee that is because every single person has given me that feedback we've talked before about Poppy's nan Tobi with his sleep because he was so anxious when he was poorly sleep was amazing but it does have an immediate effect because we've seen that in the likes of epilepsy Parkinson's and also the lovely lady who was really struggling with panic attacks is adjusting her dose at the moment because she's getting anxious going into busy situations right a shopping mall a meeting yeah somewhere somewhere where she feels that it's gonna be a lot of people that's what she struggles with yeah a lot of people do right you know to some level it's always do different volumes of it absolutely the biggest biggest topics well in the world right now yeah mental health is people talking about it a little bit more willing to talk about it great yeah it's a bit more as you say more people are I don't know is it more open more open more education towards it but as you say people are people sharing and we're coming across something like CVD that's actually giving people an answer which is so amazing not everybody wants to take prescription jokes not everyone wants to admit that they possibly have something that they need help with yeah this is a natural totally organic natural that you're not taking drugs you're not taking anything from from a pharmacy yeah and people are much more comfortable with that yeah I mean we're getting there there's always been this stigma around the the psychoactive side the THC as more and more people are coming to us listening to us there's a lot more education a lot more doctors scientists researchers yes saying this is safe yeah this is changing people's lives we're getting there very slowly and so it's I mean everyone's just going going crazy for it and of course as we say hit primal living always checked with your GP your doctor for advice and again ask those questions about empowering ourselves and again the emphasis of Juno will here at prom living is education learning those facts so you can make the informed decisions as opposed to scrambling in the it's crumbling in the in the dark we've got the big bottle to talk about now okay now this is big I mean we'll talk about them well it'll work what you're getting okay okay say this is the big bottle yeah okay and the strength of this 10% yes so sits between so it's this was the debate at the beginning what do we do what strengths what sizes and there's a constant requests for different things okay can I have a 40% gonna have a 30ml but still kinda happy we're working on it but trust us we're getting there that it's what do we do how do we do it effectively cost-effectively for you if we would see the 20% for example in a big bottle yes I'll be talking a lot money right and so it's we're trying to meet your needs absolutely but we're just deciding on where we take it next so eight percent as an entry level people want to try it yes they don't necessarily want to buy big bottle immediately understandable that's why we have the eight percent in the small bottle twenty percent in a smaller bottle again to help with the price it's the 10% that's where every single member of my family that's what they've got yet so that's there oh yeah the middle ground uh-huh so I find if you ask me I had if I had to pick one bottle that we could only supply one bottle it would be that one because I find most people that's where most people are well families are all temperament family size your question is family size bottle - no you're right actually it's them exactly that for we've had a lot of people who have tried and then said okay I want all my families to take it yeah and exactly that it's on it's there in the kitchen in the morning everyone has their their dose and off they go and so just to put again so you're putting this booklet so if you were taking the recommended dose of you drop's a time how long guesstimate would you say a bottle of the size would last you yeah it's difficult to say because of because you decide how much you take but as a rule I would say six months Wow okay and that that it is the most cost effective way yes terms of price per drop that's your bottle yeah and that is for everybody most people go from the eight percent quite quickly to either the twenty will attend because the ten percent gives you that longevity so you don't have to you don't have to worry about ordering three weeks later yes and of course you have the subscription though so you can do do it however you wish but that does last yeah so I would say my grandma and granddad yeah about six months in there's two of them so that's that's my benchmark for them but it's it's the most popular bottle foot what people say okay I need this in my life yeah I'm gonna take it every day then that's the boss they go for that's acetate okay so you can see the all the oils and the size and the strength on the on the website on the graphics right now you can see the big family bottle or the big bottle if it's just for you which is ten percent and I mean this is extraordinary just again for people just just spin it Victor on Terry and say well I appreciate what you I sit I've seen it elsewhere lower price what's what do you come back to that it's available but the quality is inferior quality yeah it's everything I don't mean to put everybody else am so that's not fair either okay there are good companies out there and CBD bottom line CBD is good the problem is it's how you how its extracted yes so what else is in that bottled it yeah you don't want to be taking ethanol you don't want pesticides you don't want any any nasties in there yeah some people are cutting corners and therefore you have got nasties in them or you will see a more affordable there are still good companies out there offering more affordable yes but it's two and a half cent so you'd have to take so much of that to feel the effect of one drop of well more drops for one drop of irate dissent yeah we sort of asking the questions I believe many people asking at home but I've done so much research on CBD and I'm not seeing anything like anything like the quality you're getting here out there this kind of a price value sorry sorry I've just passed again it's hard not to get passionate when you hear their stories and and and I feel as though we're doing a disservice because we have an hour show which is a long time and but we should be down as far as I just on that note yeah I can sit here very confidently and so I do not believe there is better quality available in the UK America we've basically taken that amazing company in America yeah I bought it here we've we found out where they got it from why they were so good why this little girl was you know went from 300 seizures to nothing so yeah and we wanted that and we said that's what's missing yeah and that's what we are providing is there's nothing we can do better nothing and now you might have called net all-natural ingredients to go yeah you brought an image of the of the farm can you talk us through there we go that little well big him blow that is Colorado a for you so look out look how laughing that looks I like to walk through that wonderful now families we mentioned and can see be CBD with what's the deal with children it's safe to take yeah all well what circumstances would a child be given to a child for example okay so any that's the thing is in what in one respect is no different to adults I mean we started like talk about that little girl it's very very common in children with epilepsy no probably one in the when I first started researching CBD that's probably the biggest thing that came up yeah always check again always check GP yes medication yeah and especially for younger children yeah that can't communicate with you just always check the reason I've grown ups who want to explore this is an avenue obviously getting the advice first questions it's so common yeah like you said it's so common that children take it there was a Elliott we got is an art school just friend of ours Jo sent it to me the other day and I love this because so many people like you are passionate this is the first time we've sat in talks about this and I can know what you tell you're passionate so many of my friends and family are passionate so many of our clients more passionate it just picks people up along the way they're the more people and it's just hard not also people are so excited to tell me things yeah are you mentioned a research team things every day and our friend Te'o sent us an article the other day about how about breast milk actually and how research has found confirmed that cannabinoids occur naturally in human breast milk and look if you just look at that quote it's one line from this article according to the findings of several major scientific extends human breast milk naturally contains the same cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant which are vital for proper human development now what that's basically telling us is from the moment that a child is born they are getting cannabinoids from breast milk it's extraordinary so this is why I say this is what we are providing CBD is they cannabinoid yeah the difference is you might you might hear endo verses fighter and doe cannabinoids are from within us we reduce them 5 towers plant yeah that's it so as far as I'm concerned please look online have a look there's a lot of research and scientists and doctors that support children taking it and the results that children are getting for epilepsy and certain certain diseases incredible again and I don't know many many of our customers become a Pasteur's for in their own in their own yeah there's no impassionate way but of course do check with DPS and doctors before just we've got the South which is a remove is the is new rave and buzzing about just before we get there just something about travel laws Airport when you did touch upon it earlier and watch see what's the deal is could I take it to the airport for example or what you need to do is just check before you go then it's legal in the country you're going to so there is we need it on our website actually but if you've gone on to primal livings website there is a list of countries as to where it's legal might it's not there are a couple that it's travel size in the in the year and in most OB where I've been I've taken him yeah but check check and don't want you to get confiscated at the airport because you wait in trouble that they will confiscate it from you you know you don't want that so just make sure that wherever you're going it they accept it and also do a recent checkers look as things change laws are changing so that it's become legal in so many countries over the last few years which is great but yeah just a couple couple I came behind just double check ok this South and now everybody in the office buzzing everybody again with customers as well so talk us through the stuff so this way of doing a target to local Ike toca target though you talk to be on the skin so it's Lindsay description that's exactly that it's the same way for example you wouldn't necessarily way I can think to describe it this I always think work from the inside out so for any kind of illness take the oil that's what I that's how I yes see it just think it's your best way however you wouldn't graze your arm right take a paracetamol necessarily yeah and I think of it in the same way you puts a blood on it and the brands are available sorry but you'd put a cream on it for example same thing if you've got a spray yeah or you've got something like and psoriasis is a big is a huge thing at the moment yeah in fact one of my lovely clients recently has been I've never seen anyone so excited that her psoriasis has got better from this self that and you apply it topically like you would a cream so it's targeting a specific so I still say take the oil I mean I've every one who buys herself I say take the oil as well because work from the inside out yeah but for something that is more of an external problem and is the anti-inflammatory yes it's got I mean let's just it sorry I'm just checking it has got in here and I always have said because of that much in there we've got the coconut oil we've got the beeswax we've got the argan oil we've got rosehip oil we've got geranium oil we have eucalyptus lavender essential oil and then cannabinoid which him so it has got the there was actually a there is I won't name names but there is a fantastic moisturizer that I use it I think it's the best in the world basically what we've done is taken all the ingredients of the one of the best moisturizers and added in the CBD which is of course what will help the healing process and I'm noticing an absence for example of petroleum and things you know that can crop up everything I mean you could eat that if don't don't but yeah and it's there's nothing harmful in there it's all totally natural absolutely and we know we absolutely adore our essential oils here at prime anything so this is the the Sal and I really in the production before as well be said Nicolas make sure you say it's well stocks last I was gonna say because probably said earlier that the staff is really popular really limited and we are also limited so unfortunately we are behind a little bit in because it's been so popular we're struggling to keep up with demand on well on everything but especially itself just one thing while I remember as well with the self not only for skin conditions enjoyed pain I've never heard so I didn't expect this so many people have reported for things like cold sores and just have spots okay yeah up quickly it's got rid of them yes of course we all know how long spot can hang around for all code so unfortunately and swearing by unfortunately I haven't I haven't had one you know but all my word people are swearing by that yeah I resides as well repetitive strain injuries yeah so this post surgery yeah yeah post-surgery foot recovery alongside physio proposed rain it's everything I mean everything you can think of where you would think to apply for example heat yes all the opposite poles that's what it's gonna do for you yeah but also this equally skin conditioner as a moisturizer people use it as a moisturizer people use it as a lip balm mm-hm because it's natural so everything you're putting on your skin is natural can I use on my face yes yeah so the only thing I would say about that if I'm totally honest you can use it on your face a friend of the family recently had really bad acne and put it all over her face the only thing I would suggest is you do that at night time okay cuz it isn't all it is oily still yeah and so I put it on a night time and then it's on for that period of time wash your face in the morning because yeah I'm not sure how I make it would react with it yeah I haven't tried that but that's what I would suggest is that almost put it on as a night cream if you're gonna put it on your face okay and havoc so we talking it's 50 ml inside yes and how much CBDs in this we have got 300 milligrams in there okay so that's what we have found everything that we do is based on research basic yeah yeah what's what what's needed we don't want to put more than you need in there and that seems to be the the amount that people are really getting benefits far as the optimum yeah of level and concentration the the bomb by the way is very when you open it it looks quite hard once you get going with it it's it becomes more malleable but that is also to make sure that you don't know that happens a lot with natural ingredients anyway he hasn't it you have to study gonna make it more malleable okay so there in a nutshell with the with the cell what can it help with with itself in their self anything external any so grazes and this is where kids come back in as well I mean the amount kids fall over and you just put yeah interestingly because my daughter's knees gets tougher for than white boys days yeah Jesus well you know we scarlet running around so yeah so we absolutely right so so perfect that exactly but of course like you said only arrived after the gym that's popular for that muscle soreness post surgery and anything external that you think Xmas Isis yes and most skin conditions in fact every skin condition that we have helped it has worked with if you're concerned like we keep saying if you're concerned ask your doctor but generally you can apply it like you would a moisturizer or like you would other creams that are available and you just rub it in yeah well it will get to work I'm thinking about after shaving perhaps as well again yeah great so the great thing about it is I also use I use an aloe vera a lot yeah you can't ally beer with Sarah Leon to open skin of course yeah so for things like cuts I had made this mistake with Charlie my stepson and it jellyfish yeah sting yeah I know oh yeah oh my word he went through the roof because it was still actually even though it didn't look like an open yeah weave but it's still so saw so as much as I love aloe vera brilliant and this doesn't have any of that stinging property so you can put it directly on a cut gotcha so whether it's because some people are such bad skin conditions where it's almost that open open wound open sores but actually this is very soothing there's nothing in there that will make it sting mm-hmm so yeah after shaving be great and you've seen the deals here just extraordinary please I mean I'm gonna do it my personal email address out again it's Nick at primarily living Calm it's Nick and I see cap please feedback to what your experiences and enjoying the growing groups of people who are so passionate and that CVD and passionate about this particular quality that we've got here so just go over again the the size of the bottles and the strengths as well and just feel free survive survive was leaving stop with to drop the what you sky was an entry level eight percent that's where everyone starts nearly everybody starts and I would advise it because if you are coming if you are currently taking something from somewhere else yes and it's a lower percentage see the difference I want to experience yeah I want you to experience the difference between a five percents from somewhere else yeah I'm taking our 8% because I want you yeah there it would be yep see the difference yeah and it you can gauge from that whether you need more yes so if you're getting through the 8% ball so quickly you use it you might think okay I want a high strength or people stay at 8% and that's just enough to you know as a daily supplement fantastic so that's the ten mill at 8% yeah and then we've got jump to 20% in strength again with ten mill yep with ten melt so that is our highest strength currently and that is taken by well there's two ways of looking at it it's taken by people with more serious illnesses who need the higher strength or want the higher strength mm-hmm or it's taken by customers who maybe want to take less so of course if there's four milligrams in an eight in the Apes impulse will per job yeah ten milligrams in the 20% bottle per drop you just have to take less so yeah it is premium popular at the moment I think because people want to be taking as much CBD as possible but same quality same quality within both it's just how much you ingest okay gross we've got about a minute left on show so again a perfect forum travel size with these smaller bottles and we described more as the family size now this sits percentage-wise in the mid-water down the middle between a 10% 10% that's what we have found to be the most popular requested suitable yeah presenters that people want and that's a hundred mil and that's hundred bill the reason why it's a hundred mil is because exactly that people want to buy in in a big box and it's in the cell now as and then then finally of course we've got the self 50 mils of selves and and we've really got across marine sale mode now quick how do you get involved how do you get in touch how do you get to own these prized oils for its employees the year Oh 800 number on the screen we've talked lots of questions that you may have please we'll ask the core central or cherry thank you very much for coming pa

will leave a link on the screen and in\nthe description so you guys can get yourselves your very own pair of awesome\nwireless headphones so in this video what they're all look at what is CBD oil\nwhy would you take it and what does it do we're gonna look at the legal status\n surrounding cannabis oils and look at some of the potential side effects or\nside effects from the oils themselves so I'm gonna feature some products in\nthis video I was sent a bunch load of CBD products from a company called\nhealed By Hemp and you get them out there website healedbyhemp.us\nreally nice company they're really nice people and they sent me a bunch of lot\nof stuff that is CBD oil containing so I'm gonna go through some of those\nproducts show you guys all of the products but I'm gonna start off with\nthe CBD oil which I'm used to taking now this oil is a CBD oil which is a 3% CBD\noil and a 0.05 percent THC I'll get into a little bit about that in a minute and\nthis is from a company in Amsterdam and these are the cannabis oil oven if you\nguys can see them but this is let me just hold this up here\nI take on a day-to-day basis it's it's very cool and it comes in this like this\nthere's a little pot that you have a pipette with and you literally take the\noil out and you can prepare it into your mouth\nas so and then you put it under your tongue and it just dissolves under your tongue to your bloodstream so that is how to take the oil and that's what the\noil I've been taking now for about two months or so okay so what is CBD oil and\nwhat is cannabis oil so cannabis oil is the oil extracted from the cannabis\nplant or the hemp plant so THC which is the the more illegal version of the oil\nwhich is taken from the female buds of the plant which is the cannabis plant\nthe marijuana plant which produces THC is highly illegal because of its adverse\neffects on psychological conditions when people take it CBD on the other hand\ncomes from hemp and hemp is I believe the male plant but please correct me if\nI'm wrong here but the male plant and this has non-psychotic effect but it\nhas really good health benefits similar to that of THC but all of the\nall of the oils do actually contain some THC so CBD oil does contain THC but it's\nin such small quantities in volume that it actually doesn't come into the illegal\nside of actually owning the oil so what does CBD oil do so I take CBD oil every\nday and you're supposed to say you know that there's a guide lines of \nhow much you should take your day it says up to 15 drops a day but I\nactually take about five drops in the morning and that's it all day unless I\nfeel like I need any more and what it does is it actually helps with a bunch\nlot of things so if you've got like aches and pains it generally just helps\nrelieve a bit of those aches and pains if you like have maybe arthritis or\nsome other kind of muscular or tension pain issues it can help relieve those\ndepending on the severity of the pain obviously and depending on your body\ntype under pending on the strength of the cannabis so like I said this one I\ntake is a 3% CBD oil but you can get higher ones like a 5% CBD oil also I use\nit mainly for anxiety panic attacks I obviously on the autism\nspectrum but I don't like to take a lot of the medicines that they prescribe\nbecause I feel like they kind of push your personality down they suppress that\nand then you become a bit of a robot but because I don't like to take those\nbecause I don't like the feeling of them I still get super anxious I have on I do\nin time to take diazepam because sometimes I get a panic attack and it's\njust so bad I just need something to kind of calm me down but I'd rather\nsomething a bit more natural now I hear that CBD oil does this and so I've been\ntesting it out so I've been taking CBD oil now for about two or three months or\nmaybe two months and testing out see if it would actually help and it actually\nhelps reduce my anxiety a lot to help me get through the day a bit more less\nanxious and a little less worried and it's really really effective\nI found a highly effective now you can take it in all kinds of ways now this is\nthe stuff I'm going to show you so the awesome company healed by hemp sent me a\nbunch older stuff because like I said I put this oil underneath my tongue every\nsingle day but it tastes a bit weird and it's not everybody's cup of tea now that\nare the ways of ingesting cannabis oil you can take the Elixirs oil which is\nthis type of stuff and you can actually put this into food you can cook with it\nyou can again this like a pipette and you get this oil and you can put it into\nfood or like you can just put it within two drinks or whatever and this will\nhelp you calm down I suppose you could just ingest it directly into the time\nagain like this one does as well but this is the the healed\nby hemp CBD extract and this one is really really nice\nthis one is an orange cream flavour really really nice and they also sent me\nanother one which is a lemon cookie flavor which is awesome try this one yet\nbut both of these can be used with your food or in drink or just under your\ntongue but you can also get a different form of it called an isolate and the\nisolate can go into a vape pen so you can are a vape chamber so you can\nactually like inhale it and smoke it if you really want to because some people\nlike to take like that or you can put it into a capsule you can make capsules out\nof these performers like pills or capsules which is cool\nalso they sent me this beard oil which is a CBD beard oil which I haven't tried\nyet but I do have a beard it's not a little world's longest beard or biggest\nbeard but I'm gonna try this oil because it's another way of a absorbing\nCBD into your body and I know it just supposed to have really good effects now\nthis is a CBD moisturizing lotion and again this you can rub it on your hands\nor whatever you you know you want to rub a moisturizing lotion but this is a cool\nway of getting CBD into your system without actually having to ingest it\nthrough your mouth or whatever which I find very very interesting and\nintriguing I haven't tried this yet but I'm really really excited too okay so\nnext up we have this a skin care cream which is a made by heal by help again\nthis smells amazing it smells very like like fresh and springtime kind of but\nlook it's like a creamy oil you can just rub into your skin which is very very\ninteresting because again if you're not really into taking it orally then you\ncould just take it like this and I'll just show you the other two products\nI've got here one is a tattoo argument which is amazing which is gonna be\nawesome I get more and more tattoos because tattoo ointment I find that it's\nhard to find one that isn't genetically modified or a bit more natural so CBD\ntattoo ointment is amazing and the next one here is a healing balm for deep\nmuscle issues so if you've got like a deep muscle issues you can rub this into\nit and hopefully it will help and I know that CBD is very very good at healing\nstuff I studied chemistry as a BSc and I have a degree in chemistry and we looked\nat CBD and THC's medical properties and this stuff is very very good for\nhealing things like that okay so let's talk about the legal status of CBD oil\nnow here in the UK the CBD oil is completely legal you can walk into any\nstore that sells it and pick it up I bought this off the counter it was like\n9 quid and you walk in there and pick it up this one is a few percent CBD oil I\nknow they do a 5% CBD oil and I'm pretty sure there's a 7% one as well so and\nthere's no legal issues with that whatsoever\nthis actually contains a 0.05 percent THC which is the illegal ingredient but\nit's within the boundaries of a legal amount of volume within the CBD oil and\nI know that in America CBD oil is legal to an extent I think in some states you\nmay have to get a license for it but as long as it has a zero or less than zero\npoint nine percent THC in it you'll be okay to actually take that CBD oil and\na lot of people take the oils for cancer treatment I've seen THC highly effective\nin battling cancer I mean like excessively effective in battling cancer\nand I want to know that people take a mixture of THC and CBD together to to\nbattle cancer but it's really good for your health as like a food extract so\nthat's why people actually take it but obviously there will be some side\neffects from the THC side which we'll get into in a minute but the legal status\nhere in the UK is basically that THC is the bad part of it and  CBD is the good part so everyone's allowed to take to CBD but not THC and I don't know if\nTHC will ever become legal I hope so because of its medical properties but\nobviously there'll be some issues there surrounding it you know if it does\nbecome legal because people smoke marijuana which isn't like the best way\nto ingest a healing property or chemical but I know a lot of people do it to pain\nrelief and that's kind of cool I guess if that's what you're into so let's talk\nabout side effects with THC the side effects are quite interesting if you\nstart taking THC which is the illegal counterpart you can get low blood\npressure you can become really docile very sleepy\nnot you can lose focus you can lose inhibitions you can at least like excessive\neating paranoia I'm not sure it's if you smoke it it's not good for the brain or\nthe respiratory system and they can make you a little psychotic and have some\nlasting effects on your mental ability to cognitively behave but with the \nthat's just THC but with the CBD oil there are no real side-effects that I\nknow of that by taking CBD oil it doesn't have any any bizarre side\neffects I've never heard of anybody run into the skin and have an any side\neffect I've never heard of anybody ingesting it orally and having any side\neffects not made anybody ill and I think the stuff is pretty interesting it\ndefinitely helped me so I would say that there are really no side effects to\ntaking CBD oil the only thing I will say is study the company you want to buy it\nfrom and make sure it's legit and it's organic and it's from the pure sorce\nthis one was made in the USA and this one was made in\nAmsterdam in Europe and this is a highly reputable company these guys are new\nstartup and they're really reputable they've got some great reviews they're\nreally nice people they really care so again it's doing your research on the\ncompany you know if you find them that they're like a you know a home cottage\nindustries in somebody's basement they've had no sales and no kind of\nreviews it's a bit you know you go just make sure that you're taking the right\nstuff because you never know what you'll buy especially on the internet I know\nfor a fact that the NHS cancer unit over here tell cancer patients look yes you\ncan take THC oil if you believe it'll work for you that's fine because they\nhave had some good results with it but don't buy on the internet because you\njust can't be writing vegetable oil or something ridiculous and it's a very\nvery expensive oil so the price of it the CBD is quite reasonably priced\nI think this bottle which is only about I'm not actually sure that the actual\nvolume of this bottle but it only cost me about nine pounds but it was on sale\nso usually usually this cost about twenty pounds but it was nine pounds on\nsale and these products from healed by hemp are very wide variety of prices I\nhighly recommend checking out this site healedbyhemp.us I will leave a\nlink in the description below so you guys can check them out out on the\nscreen here please share them some love send them some social media love and\nthat tell them that Dan from the Aspie World sent you so in conclusion I'd\nlove to know your take on CBD oils are and if you think that they are effective\nfor people on the spectrum and if people should be taking them or should we stay\naway from cannabis oils altogether I'd love to know your thoughts so please\nleave it in the comments below if you'd like to learn more about autism and\nAsperger's please make sure you hit the subscribe button about here and if you'd\nlike to see my last video it's gonna be over here and here is a video like\nYouTube think you will like and I'll see you next time guys peace", "kd1rKFBDt4M": "if you visited a farm field in Minnesota before World War two you likely would have come across a crop that is not very common today hemp when the US government passed the marihuana Tax Act of 1937 hemp dominance took a significant downturn aimed at the commercial sales of cannabis products the Act also imposed an excessive tax on hemp sales which was a hindrance to many farmers during World War two hemp made a comeback when imports of hemp that were needed to produce parachutes marine rope and other military necessities became scarce the federal government even launched a Pro hemp campaign which included the distribution of four hundred thousand pounds of seed it also released the hemp for victory film to encourage farmers to grow as much hemp as possible for the war effort so hemp was grown pretty widely in the state of Minnesota especially around World War two surrounding the kind of war effort the federal government was really encouraging farmers to grow hemp and we had a lot of processing capability to make things like canvas and rope and things that were needed for the war after that the need for the products kind of went down but then also we were having conversations about drugs in America and that led to the passage of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act in which hemp was really linked with marijuana as a Schedule one narcotic so it could not be grown anymore in an agronomic setting nearly 50 years later hemp is once again starting to take root in the u.s. with the passing of the 2014 farm bill states like Minnesota are able to implement laws that allow its Department of Agriculture and universities to grow him for research or pilot programs under the 2018 farm bill states are allowed to set up a plan to regulate hemp to ensure that any crop grown doesn't exceed federal standards for THC so after the passage of the 2014 farm bill the Minnesota Legislature passed the industrial hemp Development Act in 2015 and that really gave the department of agriculture authority to run a pile program under the farm bill and so the department had hemp growers growing and that first year we had six growers growing 40 acres which was really an achievement since we hadn't had him growing since the 1950s in Minnesota but there were a lot of challenges getting the program up and running we had to get a DEA permit to even move hemp material into the state and so it was very much a learning experience that first year so out of the applications that we have right now we have about 12,000 acres and about half of those acres are registered to be growing for CBD about the other half is registered to be growing for grain and we only have about a hundred and twenty acres growing for fiber and so because that market isn't there we think that's the reason why a lot of people aren't growing for fiber if you're growing hemp in Minnesota you have to be registered with the state and so that is for the pilot program but also farmers license to grow hemp so in order to be licensed through the Department of Ag you have to go through a background check you have to get your fingerprints taken you have to pay any sort of fees that we request for the program and then you have to identify all of the locations that you plan to grow hemp on and that's because at the end of the growing season 30 days before harvest MDA comes out and tests that hemp to make sure that it's not over the point three percent threshold of THC levels and so those locations are really critical to us the farmers also are required to sign a memorandum of understanding with the state that outlines what the requirements are or the pilot program while Lee and Shanna Berry's vision for raising hemp and they're traditionally corn and soybean farm began about three years ago 2019 will mark their first growing season I guess the reason why we got in this year it been a thought for long enough and we finally had to act on it get our act together and get moving and just try it and make her make our mistakes and getting hopefully some successes along the way Lee had told me a couple years ago that they were interested in growing something indoor at the ranch if possible just not 100% sure what and then about a year ago it turned into an interest into the hemp and the CBD and use and so I started just in general researching and just what they needed from me was to learn how to grow it and and specifically the nutrition this field went in in June the 15th we were a couple weeks later than we our target date we had to do some transplanting and in places and and then we have been planting off and on for basically a month yep so we'll find out if the later plants do what they'll do and in the earlier plants but ideally we'd like to be in closer to the June first you hand plant them through the with a waterwheel planter it rolls across the top of the plastic pokes a hole and and we drop the plant in and then come back and hand packed the plants and recovered about six acres total we have we designated areas according to type just to see which soils are better pest pressure eight heads just how it if it works good with a cabana you know close to another crop and just kind of spread it out and and see what's working and what if there's better areas that we need to concentrate on just like in in corn and beans there's there's a million ways that a grower can grow a corn crop so you know 28 growers that I work with not one of them does the same as another one and so it's the same in the hemp industry is that some growers are going to grow solid seed males females they're going to harvest a seed bale the straw lean Shanna decided to go this route and that was that was the way that that they had had chose was to go this route more like how tobacco has grown and so the spacing for some research Lee had done was the spacing and then the equipment that went along with it and then from there on and feminized seed and from there on knowing that end-use of how they wanted to have that and oil content that's kind of everything just kind of is a domino effect from one choice to the next to the next we try to get it like a garden and when we form our bed everything just works so much better when when you get when you got you don't you're not dealing with any sod and in the moisture that it just doesn't flow through the machine like it should so we had to make some modifications and and stumble through it because we had a window to get to get our beds made so we could get in with the plants but if it's not right the plants don't go in good the drip tape doesn't want to lace where should there's you get in you get critters living underneath the plastic where you got voids so yeah it's it's it's got to be good it's just got to be a good garden type tillage the watering we're still figuring that out again it's it's a very trial and error basis and each site is different we found that lie clean Shan have been very intensively managing all the sites on the watering end of it they've we're finding that we know that the plants don't like wet feet but they definitely like water and the sites that are are set up this year are very well drained sites which work really well there's one that's probably a little bit heavier that tends to hold water a little bit longer but it's it's just kind of managing managing the plant's response and that's one of the things learning about this and connecting with people that are much more seasoned than than I am in this a consult on the west coast and that was one of the things I struggled with is there was no quantitative values of anything going into this watering nutrition and a lot of them just said well you kind of just get the feel of the plant you'll do something to it and you'll see how it responds and that's virtually what we've learned how it really is it's not not like a normal being in corn crap you make the watering applications the nutrition applications and you see how it responds and then you kind of dial it in from there on how much more or less you need to do so our logging in our and keeping track of everything that we're doing we do a few different ways just to have a couple checks and balances that something doesn't get missed but anything that's that started as seed starts everything gets labeled everything that I've cloned gets labeled and and then in our our girl room we have a calendar of what gets done each day just a just in general and then we have a shared file note file that gets shared back and forth between these in my phone that it's what what they're doing for applications what I'm doing for cloning or planting or applications or or seeing in the field those types of things all get documented in that note file and then I also have a shared photo album that gets shared also so any of my scouting that I do in general on the farm plus with these sites I have a shared album for each site so all the protocols that have been written for nutrition anytime that I'm scouting there's a picture of a bug or a date or a note everything is on those shared files so he always has access to each each site how much gets put down on certain runs and the calculations are already done and about a week there'll be a protocol started where there will be a another party coming in to take tests tissue tests and they will run it through their lab and then that will give us a weekly guideline to go by on the THC and then also visual once we get into the flowering stages and the resin is visible then we can start seeing whether it's virtually the color of the resin of when we need to start pulling the pin of of when it's going to start turning to hot for us to harvest and we want to for sure beyond the early side of that if you do go over that threshold the state does offer a retest you you pay to get your material retested if it comes back to say as the first test then you destroy your crop we all right ordered a harvester this spring then found out that the it'll dismissed our miss our harvest window it'll won't be here till like December and we will hand harvest the flower here in the field well we'll put it send everything through a bunker to strip all the leaves off the majority leaves in stem so that you leave them behind and then the bud will be transported down to the ranch and we will put it out on in dried out on racks bring the moisture down and then once it's at the proper level for storage then we can go ahead and bag it and store it and be ready for the extraction process tht numbers were really low this year I think 1.17 was our highest THC content so it was very very low we would had warmer weather I would have been dissipated those numbers being a little bit higher but well under the threshold it just varied so much from plant planning and when you you know your yield at the end was did you have enough water did you have enough heat did you have this did you have that talking to all the different growers we were all kind of in a very similar weather pattern and that really made the difference it is the this that yield at the end of the day input costs weren't some varied because of where you bought your starts or if you started them to yourselves or if you you know you if you're on organic ground and you didn't have to put a bunch of fertilizer in in labor did you have enough labor to do your own harvest did you have to hire labor to do your harvest and the harvest kind of falls on top of all the other harvests out there so that part kind of gets tricky as far as being able to staff appropriately for 2020 season we're gonna have one large site it will be a site that we use last year but double the size and the the site hasn't been amended and prep work already done and then we'll possibly have another smaller site is my plan just to have a small research site so that can control all the variables on a smaller scale and continue the feeding and tissue test regimen and and hopefully continue to learn on on multiple strains within a site as well as our large site it's just that we'll be more efficient with our time and travels although there is still much uncertainty in the hemp industry the strong market growth for hemp derived products like CBD make betting on hence future stability an attractive option for many farmers the buyer market has changed a little bit last year you were able to sell it in the crude form there was a lot of demand for a lot of people getting into the industry this year it seems like it has to be of the highest quality in order to to move it on you don't get you don't have mediocre oil and expect to move it so that process has kind of changed there's been some back-end refinement that needs to be done to improve the numbers as we wait for guidance from the federal government from the USDA on the farm bill we're gonna be able to have our program up and running by the next growing season so on the grower side of things I think we'll have our regulations figured out on kind of the food side of things and you know the marketing side of things those challenges will take a little bit more time I know FDA has started considering changing the rules that they have for food and drugs with CBD but you know those are long public processes that that take a lot of input and a lot of data that again we don't have because we haven't been researching this crop for a long time so I think the Department of egg will have our ducks in a row in terms of the program but there are all these other considerations that need to be made to make the industry really a success in Minnesota what excites me about going up is the industry's young that it's a it's a big enthusiastic group there's a lot of things that haven't been done it's a new crop to the area and it's a challenge I guess just be prepared whatever you can get done today do it today get your license get your get your background check then start working towards that the more you can put behind you the easier it is the ground you work in the ground getting things right makes it go a whole lot easier start small it can be overwhelming don't be afraid to to reach out to people but don't be afraid to do it your own way either because there really is no right or wrong way we don't know that there's a right or wrong way and we still don't know but there's as far as learning for the year you you know more like we say we know more today than we did yesterday and there's a lot less things that I can tell you that I didn't learn that I did learn in the last seven months hi I'm Dave moats

health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are proven in clinical trials and regulations have caught up treat CBD with caution it's an exciting area of research but there are still many unknowns about dosage

he can help with hemp I want you to meet Dale Heights from bare roots rx he is here to explain Dale I'm so glad that you're here yes thanks for having us Terry yeah let's talk about bare roots are X what is it that you do exactly we are an organic alternative to a pharmaceutical world we started this business because we felt that people were being too over medicated and taking too many chemicals because you know pharmaceuticals are actually a synthetic derivative of what plants do so we want it to be a solution to that for people something that helped them detox their body as well as help them get better or give them the minerals or vitamins that they're missing right and we started researching a couple years ago and found out that everybody has an endocannabinoid system and that system dictates how healthy you are how unhealthy you are Wow and if it's been disrupted because of the toxicities in the world then you're gonna be toxic and you're gonna have autoimmune disorders and all this other kind of stuff and we hear about it over and over and over don't we so a lot of people who come in to see you what what kind of pain are they are they experiencing and and and and what are they saying about using is are they point mints what is it that you use um they can use a combination of things we have oils with ointments we have face cream eye cream we have lip balm we also coming out with some new stuff called body butter beard balm hair growth regrowth serum it's all organic it's all organic we have the renew oil there is that's shown on on the table there we also have reset and restart those are other products that we're coming out with they're made with one's made with lavender or ones made with orange and the orange is the reset it's supposed to invigorate

that stuff I can't live without it Wow you know I have an old there's an old lady she buys product from us lives in a trailer park in California she's 87 years old she couldn't walk for like three years she got some of our pain balm put it on now she walks five miles a day with her friend no way and she calls me all the time and says when can I get a 80 gallon vat of this stuff I just want to bathe in it - you just keep using it yeah yeah no it's awesome to see what it happens I mean a lot of people come in for rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis psoriasis you know diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol and you know they're changing its its most important we say this they're not just changing what they take they're changing their lifestyle yeah so you know they're becoming more active and doing the things that they wanted to do instead of just sitting at home being on drugs and you know being depressed and all this stuff yeah well that's a big key point to it what a

wonderful tulip fields however barb you've you've gone down a different path of opening up another part of your business your big business and that is a growing hemp now in my world my mom would have thought this was the bad stuff but it isn't is it no the bad stuff has the highest THC in it that's like the cousin of this is a whole different place this plant has low THC under 0.3 percent THC and high CBD and the CBD is what but people that use it really say it works wonderful on so many medical problems with them and pain right right that's what we're after so you actually then you grow this but it's not like you just got some seeds and throughout here this is really tracked by the state of Oregon it is something that they write and make sure it's right right we have to buy a license from the Oregon Department of Ag and then they monitor the field we pin it where the exact location is the number a KERS and then we have it tested and it has to test below that point three percent THC or we have to destroy the crown I just have to get rid of it so then not only do you grow this and I know I've talked to a lot of people who want to buy it as a medicine type thing is helping with them in some way which not have that really been proven but they still have used it they believe in it so they're concerned about the stuff being healthy you grow this right here in this field we grow it and you then you make it you you do all the processing of it right that's right we chop it down we dry it we and then we make it into an oil well then I think we should leave this beautiful field and go over there and see and find out some more about how you process it how's that sound sounds good wonderful barb come on okay but her so this is a very clean room it is plans this is you've done the harvesting and this is where you bring those harvest oh no first one after we harvest we have to dry the material first game that creates biomass we call biomass and we separate that biomass we take the woody parts out of it then we bring it in here to extract it and these are co2 extractors so you say extract it extract so what's tracked so we extract the plant waxes and cannabinoids out of that dry biomass okay and that this is a process that you have to go through to actually do that it's not just like ringing a minute no no no you go through this process and it's temperature and pressure and then that separates out all the cannabinoids and plant waxes and then is that CBD no no no eh then that's raw well from there we take it into our lab where we refine it further we take it down and and we separate out the plant waxes and purify it a little bit more and then we warm it up to decarboxylated so we're really yeah it's not just a simple process of getting the oil from the plants I mean youth there are so many steps that you have to follow and legally to make sure that it's right that's right wow that's so interesting now after all of this you have some of the the product has been made into different things that you're selling now so let's go to that store and and look and see what ultimately we can get from that that's good all right so now we are in the store which is a barn red barn hemp right right this is still part of a business is all family family a family business and what I love about it is you can actually see the products that were created and really go from from seed to sample you take care you can come in here we'll give you samples so you can try it out right here so let's talk about some of the products tell me about it well we've got an Evan sub cream that's great for your hands are three cans things like that is what we recommend it's good for Emma Sam cream itself is good for your skin CBD just makes it that much better all better for it yeah we have a muscle gel you have tinctures peppermint and plain you can take it under your tongue or you can put it in your coffee or your drink however you like to take it capsules for those that like to take capsules want to know what their dosage is think about our product is we put in how much CBD is in there so you can dose yourself you can figure out Oh 25 milligrams works for me or I need two capsules or one time a day two times a day okay so you if you're just searching online to try to find places to buy this stuff you can guarantee that the information you give about it is right we ever oil tested at a third party lab the same with our final product right right and then what I love about this besides the other products used to set it up out here was you even have them for dogs dogs right right dogs are mammals they have an endocannabinoid system just like us they have the receptors so you have a dog old dog that's having trouble getting around right they work great and then you you have personally had a lot of people actually talk to you guys and say this works for me this I use it stories are amazing oh it just there we do the tulip festival and create memories this this is again quality of life we use it with my dad when he came home with cancer and we had 42 days we felt that we wouldn't have had otherwise when we pulled him up all the narcotics and just had him on the capsules he could talk to us we could take him around the tulip field it was it was an amazing experience and I know it is to it the same thing happened to my mother and I we came out here and I saw this when you started selling it I bought some Chico it worked on her in a Rob with the energy I really was so thankful that you guys stepped in to and sometimes uncomfortable of growing something and then making something beautiful out of it it love that about great and it's been a huge learning curve for everybody everybody involved not only us but but our customers wonder that's what we want to do is teach you teach people how what this product is all about and what it can do for them well for more information we certainly would encourage you to go to garden time TV we'll click over to their website you can find out the information you can come out here and buy it when they're open you can find those hours on the website as well or you can order it all online which I absolutely love that is available to everybody so barb you know how much I love the tulips I love this too thank you so much all right you're welcome thanks for coming out [Music] you", "jzA-nORdJyE": "there was a misconception that CBD is not psychoactive and that people think it's inert and very very very safe and doesn't produce any acute drug effects so we wanted to bring that into laboratory and test that assumption what we found is that oral dosing doesn't produce much in the way of a drug effect or impact drug testing when the substance is pure when it's vaporized though we did see discriminable drug effects they were not THC like so people didn't report getting high but they did feel a subjective change in how they felt mostly positive not really negative and we didn't see anything in the way of impairment of cognitive performance when we added some THC to the mixed we used a cannabis that was high in THC or high in CBD and low in THC we found that people reported modest drug effects again no impairment of cognitive functioning at the doses we tested but you know relatively strong drug effects we also found in this study that acute dosing with that high CBD low THC cannabis could produce a positive drug test in some individuals the other interesting finding from this is that in consistent with other studies that have been done we found that women tended to be more sensitive to the drug effects than men so women reported stronger drug effects overall especially in the vaporization and the high CBD low THC drug conditions and they reported greater ratings of irritation of their throat when they were inhaling the drug this is a stepping stone study so it's a very small study with a single dose given one time so you know obviously from here we there are a number of ways we want to expand on this a number of directions we want to move forward at some point multiple different doses and and different formulations to better replicate

It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "d7HcVsPa_hk": "[Music] welcome back to the channel in this video we're talking all about Nirvana CBD and why it's by far the best brand that I've ever dealt with or tried okay welcome to the channel if you're new here and like what you see consider subscribing and before we get any further I do want to say a huge thank you to Nirvana for sponsoring this video the only reason I accepted this and went through with the sponsorship is because I absolutely love these products and I will break down why the first time I ever tried CBD I was at a vapor expo in California and a friend of mine Louis when I was down there with hometown hero he and I both tried it and we got rocked like three sheets to the wind completely high there's no other way to explain it we were high I used to smoke weed a lot so I know what that feels like and we were high and then so from there I was very reluctant and hesitant understandably to to try CBD again there was a reason I quit smoking weed and stopped getting high and I did not like feeling like that in that setting and you know it was a big surprise and it was just really terrible I did not like it that's forward I've been getting a lot of a lot of emails from a lot of different CBD companies asking if I will review their products and because of that experience I had and then because of the lack of regulation in the industry and some of the shadiness that I see I'm very skeptical about CBD it's a supplement right and like other supplements even the ones that like health stores like GNC like I don't know I don't know if what they're saying is in the bottle is actually in the bottle and at what amounts and dosing was always kind of weird to me because I always saw like you know tinters and and all kinds of stuff and it was never really clear on like how to dose and and for me here's what I'm dealing with I get migraines frequently I've got neck issues knee issues and I'm just getting older you know I'm just getting older so I've got kind of you know aches and pains and and some other things and I eat ibuprofen by the handful all day long and so I've been really looking for something to help take that pain away and not to mention just deal with my general anxiety that I have a really bad anxiety keeps me up at night and Nirvana has come in and really just kind of blown my mind CBD in general and if you guys would like me to cover CBD and kind of break it down what is it where does it come from the different types in a separate video let me know in the comments I've been doing a little bit of research I think I want to tackle that topic so if you're interested in that please let me know but CBD comes in a lot of different forms and some varieties so there's isolate broad spectrum and full spectrum all of Nirvana's products are broad spectrum and in my opinion that's the good stuff like that's where it's at now unfortunately because of the way YouTube is I'm not going to show you using this product because I think that might be against their Terms of Service I don't really know I really do not want to get a strike on my channel but what I can say is that I've been using these products for about a month now and I love them let me show you some of the varieties they offer and then I'll talk more about about the different products CBD isn't like a cure-all there's definitely a lot of research that needs to be done and all I can talk about is my personal experience and anecdotal evidence and experience that I've I've seen from other people CBD comes in a variety of different forms and the form you choose will really depend on what your end goal is so for me personally for like topical stuff like my knees for some reason I'm having pain in my hand kind of feels like arthritis I'll use something like the CBD roll-on which is awesome so this is like an oil that you roll on and then rub in or one of the lotions and I love these on mine on my back on my neck and they have a muscle recovery lotion which is great for like after the gym for me personally it helps with soreness and any kind of aches and pains for anxiety things like that you're probably going to want something more internal and same with sleep so for sleep they have the excellent melatonin one right here and this has melatonin in it and the CBD alone so even if you just did the natural one the CBD by itself helps me sleep and helps me stay asleep which is key and so I like the capsules for that they also have gummies and twenty gummies at 500 milligrams so what I love about Nirvana CBD products as you can see right here 20 gummies by 25 milligrams per gummy equals 500 milligrams of CBD other gummies aren't as detailed as far as what's in what you're getting and this just makes dosing a lot easier dosage recommendation was big for me too because I didn't know where to start and I didn't want to feel like I was getting getting any kind of head change which most people say you won't but I definitely get a little bit of a head change if I take too much of really good CBD this has zero THC in it some CBDs will so make sure you you check the label and if you don't want any THC like me I don't want any THC at all broad-spectrum is the way to go for me because of the zero THC CBD legally can have up to like point zero 3 or 0.3% of it I think something like that but there's a very trace amount in some CBD allowed by loft make sure you check the label and know what you're getting into if you don't want CBD or if you don't want THC as you can see here we Jess and I really like these gummies she's primarily been been going to town and these gummies she'll take one before bed helps her stay asleep a note about the gummies they are delicious without like any kind of weird flavor they're just really edible you can see yeah they're definitely like a little they have some residue in there but one thing I've noticed about these gummies is that they're just quality they're built well they don't have a bunch of extra sugar and stuff on them and yet they still taste delicious and they're still really effective one of the big reasons that I stay away from most brands is because of the dosing and with with Nirvana it makes it extremely easy to dose even if you're gonna do at inter right you because the bottles have this really fantastic dropper that outlines the milliliters so you can figure it out and dose exactly what you want and at that point for me like this is more this is definitely like a medication I treat it like a medication and I want to be precise with that and this brand allows me to do that which I love so not only is it extremely high quality stuff they have amazing flavors for the Tincher peppermint vanilla strawberry grapefruit and all of these are extremely high quality you know what you're getting you know it's good stuff that's why I'm such a huge fan of this brand now premium brands are going to be more expensive and Nirvana is no exception in my opinion I'd much rather spend more for quality stuff that has in it what it says is in it so if it says 500 milligrams that's what I'm getting rather than paying you know cheap prices for some cheap cheap CBD that could be god-knows-what or maybe not have as much as it says it does and I just don't want to have to worry for me this is one of those things that paying the extra money really pays off this Nirvana CBD has helped me sleep better have less anxiety it's helped me stop taking as much ibuprofen as I do really awesome because I don't know what God knows what that's doing to my stomach and it just works it just works roll-on oil is fantastic for my hand that started hurting all of a sudden I just roll it on both sides and rub it in a one word of caution like I have small kittens small children so I don't use any of the lotions or the oil roll ons and then go play with them because I don't want it to contact them and get on them so if it's going to be during the day I'll just take a capsule know exactly what I'm getting the exact dose its repeatable its precise I can't say enough good things about this brand I love the product and I'm a believer in CBD if you haven't tried it yet I would highly recommend trying it and if you don't want any kind of head change like I didn't start at a low dose starts small and work your way up I started with 0.25 milliliter dose for the first couple couple nights and then worked my way up to the recommended dose overall I highly recommend nirvana if you're in the market for CBD I will have them linked in the description if you'd like some more information if you have any questions or concerns definitely drop them in the comments I'll get back to you there and if you like this video found it helpful make sure you like that smash button get subscribed and press the bell if you want to be notified when I post new content thank you so much for

It contains none of the psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, so there is no \u2018high\u2019 from it. But the many health benefits claimed for CBD including: reducing inflammation, pain relief and reducing anxiety has seen its use in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics become one of the fastest growing trends in the process industry. Silverson high speed, high shear mixers are increasingly being used for R&D and small scale production in this emerging market. They're ideal for a wide range of applications, including blending, emulsifying, dissolving, disintegrating and powder/liquid mixing. A Silverson can easily mix liquids of widely different viscosities, so high viscosity CBD oil can be blended in a fraction of the time taken by conventional mixers. One of the main production challenges is dispersing the oil into aqueous systems such as beverages, as minimising the droplet size is the key to maximising the yield of the active ingredient. With a Silverson this can be achieved almost instantaneously. The same goes for other ingredients such as flavouring essences which can be difficult to disperse. For emulsions such as creams and lotions, the high shear action of a Silverson mixer finely disperses the droplets to give a stable emulsion with a typical droplet size of 2 - 5 microns. Finer emulsions down to 0.5 microns can also be achieved, depending on the formulation. By simply changing the workhead, the mixer can also be used to perform many other operations such as preparation of gels and sugar solutions, disintegrating solids and incorporating powdered ingredients such as stabilisers and other supplements. Another advantage of Silverson mixers is scaling up from the laboratory to full production is a straight forward process, as all our mixers are engineered to the same fine tolerances and exceptional quality we have been known for, for over 70 years. Whether you're looking to make beverages, gummies, snacks, baked goods or creams, shampoos, lotions or capsules, a Silverson mixer offers the most versatile and efficient solution to your mixing requirements.

experience using IMC the oil lotion and this one is from Anna Lou natural and it's very carousel lion so what else further ado let's dive on it I don't know if you've noticed but I've seen so many company advertised skincare products with hemp seed oil in it so of course I was curious to try it and I'm very happy that people to send you this it's the animals natural and aloe Naturals channeis L botanical body lotion it's a chamomile and works relief flavour and known as harmony so this lotion contains a plant extract as the name suggests and that's actually good for us because it provides antioxidants it's anti-inflammatory and what all of this does for our skin is that it helps us with agent CH gracefully and it also helps your skin to stay hydrated and protects you from environmental damage the next thing I really like about this lotion is that they use a hundred percent URM seed oil and the fact that I use this means that you get all the nutrients and vitamins that comes with the MC know else so for example you get vitamin E B and C as well as omega fatty acids there are a few other features of the solution that I really like for one is tc3 they use organic ingredients is gluten free it's vegan and also is cruelty free the thing that I like the best about this is that it has the vitamin C and aloe vera in it and you know that vitamin C house to improve your complexion and aloe vera helps with retaining moisture in your skin so it makes it very soft let me show you the texture of this I really like that it's not thin at all like agent Jessie there it is so its first smooth and it really observes quickly into your skin and it's very moisturizing so I'm just gonna wash my hand I'm gonna use black soap so you know it's a bit drying for the skin so you can see and see how my see rising this is so I just washed my hand let me show you this part right here maybe that's a bit too much so it goes on very small and it feels really good to be honest feels really really good and you see it's not greasy or anything this yes can see it looks yes and it feels really nice but here's the thing about it it smells like like we'd be surprised it just smells like weed I know that a cancer line is fairly new so they're still working on making new flavors and if they make one that I like then of course I would definitely use it because I really like the ingredients I like how it feels on my skin I like on my service and it is my older downside is the smell I've seen reviews online where some people actually like the smell of it because it it picks them up so if you're someone that we'd smell picks you up then this probably would be perfect for you but for me I don't think I would feel comfortable wearing this out the thing about it is that it doesn't last for very long to be honest smell I think two hours or so cuz I had it on for a while and didn't really smell it that much but because I know it smells like that I don't know if maybe I've just gotten used to the smell after two hours and then I don't smell it anymore whereas someone who just bump into me would smell it even a disaster so I'm not really sure if it's if it's just that I got used to it or it actually wears off but outside of that it has really good benefits but they make another flavor then perfect I would actually buy my wonders maybe laughing or wisdom or any other flavor or even flavorless I think that would actually work too well thanks a lot for watching my video I really hope that you learn something new and don't forget to Like and subscribe and leave your comments below I also have an Instagram page where I have all my reviews so if you're interested in seeing that out put the handle in the description below so take care until I see you again bye", "gzFBu1i3ZxM": "new this morning a story that can serve as a warning to cannabis users who may be traveling to the United States a Canadian woman faces a possible lifetime ban from that country after bringing CBD oil over the border as John Paul Tasker tells us the woman thought the cannabis derived pain reliever was allowed because it's legal in the state where she was going all along the world's longest border there are signs warning travelers not to bring cannabis across the border that's because cannabis is still strictly illegal in the United States in fact it's still on par with heroin so it's prohibited at all border crossings and one cane woman found out this past weekend that it's not just cannabis buds it's not just cannabis leaves it's not just cannabis joints that will find you on the wrong side of the law and that's because she was carrying CBD oil something that she uses to treat pain associated with scoliosis it's the non psychoactive component of the cannabis plant that many people use to deal with pain to deal with anxiety to deal with sleeping disorders but that doesn't matter to border guards at the blaine washington crossing they pulled her a sign for a secondary inspection asked if she had any leafy greens on her person she didn't think her pain reliever of choice would qualify as a leafy green but of course it did when they found that CBD oil in her backpack they charged her they find her they fingerprinted her they sent her away with a stack of paperwork that she'll have to fill out if she has any hope of coming back to the United States and she has to apply now for a special waiver but an immigration lawyer we spoke to believes that a special waiver might not be enough for this woman to get back into the United States even though she made an honest mistake if the officers deem that she has a controlled substance with her and she admitted to it then she's inadmissible for the rest of her life a spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection's as its responsibility of all travelers to know US law and they said just because some states have legalized marijuana doesn't mean that it's legal to bring across the border because federal law trumps all at all border crossings John Paul Tasker CBC News Ottawa", "5kWY3hk-Eqk": "today's the day that i introduce you to a great friend of mine a friend that i look at i respect for a long long time who has taught me so much about plant medicine botanical extracts solvent lifts extracts green element cbd this is the cbd company because this is the one that has integrity from the crack of the seed all the way to the packaging of the bottles this product right here is 100 soil king approved everything about it the manufacturers the mind behind the brands the medicinal values to the patient and our pets like this is the brand for you to look at right here i love this brand i love the people behind it let's talk about the cbd tincture why is it important what's in here what does it do it's honestly probably easier for me to tell you what's not in there so what's not in there is anything that you don't need there's a carrier oil it's organic mct oil it's coconut oil and there's full spectrum cannabinoids nothing else no no flavorings no preservatives nothing artificial no additives no isolate let's talk about cbg cbg has been nicknamed the mother of all cannabinoids and it really is the building block the plant turns into your cbd your thc and all your other your cannabinoids that are in a full spectrum product now the reason that we use full spectrum products rather than isolates is you get what's called the entourage effect which means that the parts together are more effective than any one of them by themselves so by leaving the other cannabinoids in you're getting a more effective product the cbg product differs from our cbd product because we've added a second full spectrum extract that has very high levels of cvg this gives you a different cannabinoid profile it's broader it has you know both still a high concentration of cbd and a high concentration of cbg and so you're maximizing the entourage effect shelf stability like how long does this last and you know how the carrier like talk to us about the carrier stability so any shelf stability issue with a tincture you're looking at issues with usually with the carrier oil our tinctures are 100 organic mct oil with full spectrum distillate as our cannabinoid source there's there's nothing in there that's going to spoil the rancidity issues you don't get for typically one to two years on mct oil as long as you keep it i wouldn't store it in a hot car you don't need to refrigerate it it's in a in a dark bottle shouldn't have any problems let's talk about our beloved family members our furry friends our furry friends you have two different varieties right here you have a 1200 milligrams and a 400 milligrams you want to explain the two of those they're the same product it's just a different dosage the 400 typically would be for a smaller animal ranging anywhere from a cat or a really small dog up to like a 30 or 40 pound dog 1200 milligram is targeted to larger animals and that comes from me personally having a large dog and seeing how fast you burn through a lot of these products it's a much higher potency so your bottle lasts a lot longer so how do people find the test results like how do we know that like so every one of our products if you pick it up and look on it there's a qr code on the back of it and if you scan that it'll take you straight to a test results page on our website on that page we provide test results for every batch every product we make and we're not just providing the potency results that most manufacturers do at the end of the manufacturing process we provide the results of the material we intake of the the crude extracts of the finished distillate when we refine the extract and of the finished product and at every step of the of the way we're testing potency we're testing for pesticides we're testing for solvents and we're testing for heavy metals so when you get one of our products you know that it's tested start to finish gunner come here buddy so if you have a pet or a dog and the nose is always dry you see how his nose is dry you're good boy you just put this on it rub it in a little bit look at that moistened it right up there's no regulation that tells you you have to do that high quality of testing you do that because of who you are and the integrity within correct because it's the right thing to do because i wouldn't consume a product that didn't have that level of testing behind it and that's specifically why we started the company was because we couldn't find products with that level of testing and transparency that were remotely affordable to use that's good that's a good line he just said because he couldn't find products so he had to do it himself what's the difference in quality from this product for our pets and this product for our humans one has a green lid the other one has a brown lid that's literally the only difference that in dosage human grade pro humid grade ingredients in both of them integrity integrity integrity 100 percent soil king approved product and that's the reason why right there why would you give garbage to your pets yet feed you something superior make if you love your pet like i love my pet there should be no difference should be absolutely no different unfortunately in a lot of different industries especially the hemp industry you're gonna find products that are pushed on our animals that are not consumable to humans and it's disgusting and it's not regulated and it's okay it's not okay with me and it's not okay with doug well i'm glad you got the opportunity to understand what i see in doug and what he's been doing for a number of years for medicinal patients i'm proud to have him sitting here right now with me and i'm also proud to be a brand ambassador of this great product for more information on the full array of products that green element cbd has available for you you can go to their website at www.greenelementcbd.com there you'll find a whole list of products we have some lip balms sap sticks you know topicals there's a roll-on pain creams and this incredible lotion right here that is just absolutely the smell and scent of this is just smells so good doug you can find a lot of information about what's in the product the integrity behind the product you can go to the website you can find out more information about all these products what's coming in the future but more importantly is the claims and the analytics and the testing that go alongside with these products you'll find all on the website as well too that's why i love a product like this because they stand behind it 100 you as a consumer and a patient can trust that you're going to get what they tell you you're going to",

the screen here all the benefits that cbd brings to your hair strands the cbd is working i know you guys have seen so many products or even just on the news the different states are starting to

for stimulating your scalp which in turn does what produces hair growth so love this i use this every single week in conjunction with everything that i am going to talk to you guys about today alright the only thing that i don't use weekly um is the moisturizing shampoo but i do use that every two weeks the next product that i love to use is the main choice this um three in one revitalizing refresh conditioner it is a co-wash leave-in and a detangler i have been using this probably twice a week because i have been trying to get really into moisturizing and deep conditioning my hair twice a week instead of once a week and i'll tell you why towards the end of this video but i really love this particular product because of biotin that it has in it i and the vitamin e that it has in it which in turn promotes hair growth so you see where i'm going with this this is really good for hair growth and the vitamin e is really good for moisture so with those two naturally it's going to be a breeding ground for good nutrients and hair growth so this particular product here all right and for my next item here which is a deep conditioner i have a bunch of deep conditioners okay and i've used almost all of them but i wanted to hone in on just one particular deep conditioner because i wanted to find out which deep conditioner is working really well for my hair and that is this shea moisture black sorry this shea moisture jamaican black castor oil strength and restore treatment mask this deep conditioner has shea butter moisture peppermint peppermint told you peppermint another product peppermint these ingredients are really good to stimulate hair growth okay along with the apple cider vinegar which is apple cider vinegar is a cleansing agent and it also helps balance your ph levels in your hair strand been using this for years but like i said i wanted to really just hone in on one particular deep conditioner just to make sure that i'm able to give you guys like just some set ingredients or set products that is really working for me all right so moving right along i just want to talk about just a couple of more items next thing is your oils oils are very important they have so many moisturizing and healing and cleansing agents and most of all they have some awesome scalp rejuvenating agents in them so i have really really really been adopting oils to my hair and scalp massages every night using these particular oils every single night so the oils couple of oils that i do want to talk about one of them is main choice like this growth oil is really good um let's see what it says here it's timeless length and lasting retention releases clogged oil and buildup on the scalp it also has biotin in it and a few other oils in here like grape seed oil sweet almond oil they have some sativa oil in here sativa oil cbd sativa if you know then you know all right so love this oil every night i put a little bit so i don't do all of these oils every night i kind of like alternate them i would probably use this one every other night but every single night i do use this miles rosemary mint scalp and hair strengthening oil this has it is infused with biotin and encourage and it encourages hair growth it is for daily use it's a scalp treatment and it also um has split end care look this is like my third bottle and i'm gonna tell y'all this really works it really really works like rosemary and mint that mint is like the peppermint that stimulates scalp stimulating and the rosemary with the healing and the the the gr the length retention properties in it this is a good one you don't necessarily have to get this brand but you definitely want to just think about the rosemary and the mint you know avocado oil again peppermint oil tea tree oil all of those type of oils will definitely help and aid in hair growth all right and one last product that i do want to mention is moisturizing milks if you are low porosity that means that your hair follicles are not open it actually takes a lot for your hair follicles to open like things like heat and um steam things like that opens up your hair follicles pretty easily and i try not to use a lot of like heavy thick like butters because it's hard for it to get inside of my hair strands so i really love this tginn sweet honey hair milk that is this is with raw honey and agave nectar that raw honey is giving you moisture moisture moisture moisture okay and this has so many uh moisturizing agents in it when i put this on my hair um my i can probably go maybe okay i'm not gonna push it okay two days i'm going to say about two days without re-moisturizing my hair and you can get this tgi in along with the main choice shea moisture and the eden's bodyworks you can get those all at your local beauty supply store along with the sunny aisle cbd moisturizing conditioner and moisturizing shampoo at your local beauty supply store but if you cannot get it there you can definitely find it on amazon now i am telling you guys all of this because i have decided to put myself or take myself on a hair care journey for 2021 okay the first three months of 2021 and i am starting now i actually i started probably last week but to really get my hair in tune with it and let you guys know with what i'm doing i'm recording i'm filming and editing this video in december december but i am going to be really going full fledged with this hair growth challenge come january one okay it's all about hair retention thickness and growth okay so the the hair that you grow you want to retain it and the hair that you're retaining you just want it to continue to just get be flourished and growing okay now you guys probably want to know is this my hair well the answer is no this is not my hair but i will say these are my hair goals i'm not too far off the thickness i'm far off but i will get there that's why i'm doing this whole challenge this is like those headband head band wigs that have been going around everywhere i don't want to tell you where i got this one from because it was a little pricey and when i started doing more research i found out that i could have got this wig right here for a fraction of the cost so i don't want to tell you where i got this particular one from but you can definitely search online headband wigs and you will be able to find so many companies that are doing it i'll list maybe two below that i feel like is a good price i will say that okay this particular headband wig is a1 okay it's thick i did have to dye it i dyed it um black a natural black it did come like a natural brown color and the thickness i didn't have to cut anything the texture is a 3c4a no the texture is a 3 b3c which is my texture here i do have a little 4c in there but it's really mostly at the top and but the rest of them it looks exactly like my hair just not as full this is 14 inches and i believe it's 150 density and it's about 22 inches round that's actually a little bit too big for my hair so i'm gonna have to do some alterations but i love this you guys know this is me okay y'all know this is me so i am gonna be doing these headband wigs for the next two or three months and while i'm doing that i'm going to be moisturizing conditioning scalp massages using these type of products with these type of ingredients in them i will list you know what i can do i can list all the ingredients that you want to be looking for in your hair products i'll list them also below so then that way you can kind of like go back and forth take a screenshot or whatever so when you're looking for your products because you don't have to get these products that i mentioned okay you can these products are not the only products that have these awesome ingredients in it but

milligrams south this one is a full spectrum this one is only CBD so cannabidiol full spectrum there's over a hundred different cannabinoids in the hemp plant and the marijuana plant we obviously get our self from the hemp plant so we have all those cannabinoids in here that does include the legal trace amounts of THC below 0.3% is what's federally legal so a little story about how I applied these I went ahead and put some on this one on the full-spectrum on my right knee which I had reconstruction surgery on about 20 years ago I put the isolate based on my left knee which I also had a reconstruction surgery but that was only about three years ago so reconstruction on both played about two and a half hours of basketball this morning both of these are infused with the same organic essential oils um organic beeswax as well and they are both the same price sixty five bucks so we're just we're not looking at it from any other comparison except full-spectrum versus isolate after I put them on I would say about 15 minutes afterwards both knees felt really really good no swelling inside I had full range of motion it's now been about an hour my left knee still feels really good which I used the isolate based on but my patella tendon starting to get a little bit a little bit stiff um the the swelling inside my knee is not there but as I said patella tendon is getting a little bit tight my right knee feels phenomenal so that's basically my personal use today lots of variables everyone is different but pop on over to holistic magnified check out we make holistic topicals tinctures herbal inhalers very potent stuff so love to see you", "ASiXVjPVRR8": "hey guys and welcome to another ready yeti first look i'm at this week we're gonna be checking out made by hemp they

perfect for anyone who wants to start their day with a sharpened mind [Music] and of course stay focused throughout the day sorry got distracted their focus hemp oil extract combines the benefits of hemp derived cbd and terpenes from various plants and fruits fruity isn't that oh wow it actually is really fruity kind of tastes like like fruity gum notes of juicy fruit it's actually really pleasant you don't get any of the typical earthy flavor that you would get in a lot of other cbd hemp oils i wasn't expecting to even be that fruity this honestly would probably be something that's pretty fantastic in tea especially some kind of fruity herbal tea it's also not aggressively oily it doesn't feel like you're really slugging down some vegetable oil or olive oil or something it's pretty pleasant all together there's no weird mouth feel after you bake it this hemp oil is thc free which is already a plus you're getting pure unadulterated cbd and on top of that it is palm oil free of course that's great because that means made by hemp is delivering as much of an eco-friendly product as they possibly can offer palm oil is kind of terrible not a fan made by hemp's focus hemp oil extract is available in 500 milligrams which is this that's that potency a thousand milligrams or two thousand milligrams depending on which potency works best for you what you're looking for kind of like the easy 500 milligrams you could always add more can't take less well i mean i guess it can take less and of course and arguably one of the most important features of made by hemp's focus hemp oil extract is that it was lab tested and you can see the lab results of each potency right on their website in fact that is true for most of their products as well so if you are curious or looking for something a little bit different just gotta check it out speaking of if you are looking for something a little bit different maybe something to help you wind down at the end of your day

conditions with the doctor's recommendation stores though are still selling it but will it show up on a drug test David Schecter verifies have you heard of CBD oil it's growing in popularity as a natural way to treat epileptic seizures and more broadly anxiety and insomnia the issue is how close CBD is scientifically to marijuana verified fast facts marijuana is rich in the compound THC which gets you high CBD is not marijuana but it still has a tiny bit of THC in it which has some people wondering can CBD oil cause you to fail a drug test for answers I'm looking at what the law says and I'm reaching out to one of the largest lab testing companies in America quest Diagnostics maybe you've peed in their cup dr. berry sample is the director of science and technology and yes that's really his name can the use of CBD oil cause you to fail a drug test CBD itself on our test would not be confused with either THC or THC metabolite number one so analytically we can clearly differentiate the two substances so you've passed last year with the 2018 farm bill Congress permitted the interstate commerce of hemp products like CBD that contain not more than 0.3 percent THC a very low level doctor sample is saying that amount of THC is so low that a test won't pick it up case closed right wrong as a product CBD oil is not regulated in the United States that means the government is not ensuring the level of THC remains low and in fact research in the Journal of the American Medical Association tested a variety of CBD oils and found 43% had more THC in them then labeled doctor sample says that's a big problem if somebody is using a CBD oil product that contains residual THC in it they very likely could test positive on a urine drug test not because of the CBD itself but because of a contaminant that is in that oil so CBD should not cause you to fail a drug test but in reality it could if you've got something you want verified send me an email [Music]", "bsR6nU_8UZs": "all right hi guys welcome back to our Channel today we are going to do a tutorial on how to make your own CBD coconut oil in a crock pot and then we're going to show you how to use that to make your own organic CBD dog treats the coconut oil has been asked for a couple times just because it can be used for a number of different things you can use it for baking and cooking like we're gonna do or you can also use it for selves if you have pain and stuff which is really awesome I have made some that I use for cramp cream which is beyond amazing and super helpful you can use it for pretty much anything you want it's a lot cheaper to make it yourself than it is to buy one of those like little tiny containers for like fifty dollars whereas you can buy an ounce and 1/4 of coconut oil which is what we're gonna use today and it creates quite a bit for you that will last a while okay and then we're going to use that to turn it into CBD of coconut oil dog treats that are gonna be all organic these are really handy if your dog is anything like mine and suffers from social anxiety separation anxiety he has a really about habit of chewing out himself when he's anxious we've tried so many different types of medicines and solutions from the vet which just don't help very well so CBD is our next option which is going to be really awesome and a lot healthier than a lot of medications so we're really excited about that as well okay so keep watching you are gonna need a few different things for this video for the coconut oil you would need a crock pot one quart of coconut oil and one ounce of flour and then for your dog treats you're going to do two large sweet potatoes half a cup of coconut flour half a cup of your cvd coconut oil and 1/8 and this created about 24 different sized dog treats so it creates quite a few and you can always freeze the dog treats for later because they don't have any preservatives in them so they aren't gonna stay good for all that long so it's handy to be able to keep them long-term okay so get ready if you want to keep watching and see how we do it alrighty guys we're gonna start out by baking two large sweet potatoes at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes we're then gonna bake our buds just like last time on about 250 just for like 10 or 15 minutes and then we're gonna grind it up in our handy-dandy coffee grinder so that we can put it into our coconut oil all right for this next part you can use any kind of coconut oil we used an already the liquid coconut oil just because it's a little bit easier and then you're gonna put your butt in there and let it sit for 24 hours stir it all up to make sure it's mixed very well you're only gonna want to stir it once or twice while it's sitting in there because the crock pot doesn't need to be stirred as much as the butter did all righty guys just like we did with our butter we are gonna strain that coconut oil through cheesecloth to get all of those chunks out because we do not want any chunks in our food or anything it will not taste good you all righty and then just like we did with our cvd butter tutorial you were going to strain it through the cheesecloth and then squeeze that cheesecloth to get any excess liquid out of there you all righty it's gonna look really dark at first but I promise once we refrigerate it again it will get that beautiful green color that we love already for this next part you're gonna want to mash up your sweet potatoes just like mashed potatoes add all your ingredients together and mix well you're gonna roll it out just like cookie dough and cut out your little doggie treats you want to bank them at 375 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes they're not gonna harden right away so you're gonna want to lay them out until they fully so he wanted to sit on the ottoman and he gets to just but right now good good puppy okay okay sit sit good", "AM8g6LDm0UY": "you may be wondering why should I use both THC and CBD because our study showed that co use of CBD and THC had much more benefit than using either one by itself and other studies have shown this as well well there's something called the entourage effect and that is when you use all the cannabinoids simultaneously you get the best effect there seems to be some kind of synergistic relationship where they just work together for more improvement but does that mean that you need lots of THC and very little bit CBD or give you just a tiny bit of THC and lots of CBD we don't really know unfortunately there aren't any large clinical trials and have looked at this and it's very difficult to get to these nuances in questionnaire based studies because people don't have a great understanding of what it is that they're taking due to a variety of factors it could be the route of administration it could be that the labeling is a good or it could be that people just don't pay attention or they could be using something that somebody else got and they don't know what it is so it's very hard right now to really hone in on what that ratio should be now there have been studies with a pharmaceutical that's been approved in other countries called Sativex which is a spray that goes underneath your tongue and that's a one-to-one ratio of CBD to THC which means that they're equal parts of CBD and THC and it's been used for a variety of conditions like spasticity and multiple sclerosis does that mean it's gonna work for you I don't know because at a one-to-one ratio you still might feel the psychoactive effects of THC because what happens is when you take THC and CBD together the CBD tones down that psychoactive effect of THC so some people that one-to-one ratio is enough so that they don't get high and for others it's like there isn't even CBD there and so there are formulations that are 30 to one of CBD to THC meaning that there are 30 part CBD 1 parts THC which would be very uncommon to be psychoactive but very sensitive people still might feel that and they're already chosen between you get a two to one sir we don't want to ten to one how do you know well you're gonna have to be a little bit of an experiment and equals one and maybe try some things again you want to start low go slow so my recommendation speak to a medical professional so that you can tell them what medications you're on what your conditions are that you're taking it for so that you can talk to them about potential drug interactions and then you want to find products that have a very high ratio of CBD to begin with take a very very tiny dose and work your way up slowly keep a journal so that you know how you're doing and whether or not it's actually helping your condition and you can sort of make changes on the fly I've been using medical cannabis for five years now to treat my condition of chronic pain and spasticity and pain and do since omneya and my regimen has changed greatly over the years as products get better as my condition changes I have to try new things to see what's going to work best [Music]", "enEEEb-rnno": "scientists are investigating whether cbd a chemical compound from cannabis plants could fight inflammation in severe covid19 patients the cytokine storm is when the body's immune system attacks itself and it's been linked to the deadliest coven 19 cases people who are also in cannabis field are also trying to find the right strains for covet dr olga kovachuk is a cannabis researcher at the university of lethbridge in alberta canada she's part of a team who believe they have id'd some cannabis strains high in cbd that could help treat the inflammation that comes along with the cytokine storm of some coronavirus infections she says not every high cbd strain was effective though terpenes are important as well as other minor cannabinoids are also important another study from researchers in georgia found cbd reduced inflammation and protected lung tissues in covenanting patients so far all of that cbd coveted research has been done in models animals or replicated human tissue now to be clear scientists at nusi spoke with say this doesn't mean you should be planning a trip to the dispensary much more research is needed including clinical trials in humans like ones that might combine cbd with other antiviral treatments like rum desevere any antioxidant probably does like 90 percent of the job or 80 percent of the job or 70 percent of the job you may not doing 100 and what we're proposing maybe cbd can do what is left over with that doctor byron reddy is a researcher and pharmacology and experimental neuroscience professor at the university of nebraska medical center he says getting funding is among the challenges holding back cannabis research some labs are even raising their own money the fda just released guidance this week outlining how companies seeking approval of drugs that contain cannabis or its derivatives must follow the traditional drug review and approval process involving clinical trials the agency is still working on cbd specific rules lindsey thiess newsy denver", "qe7eDBoTj2c": "why does it feel like so many media outlets discovered CBD in the past year media including Consumer Reports descended upon the CBD space within the last year and there's a very good reason for it because CBD starts showing up everywhere it starts showing up in coffee bars and brownies and candy and things CBD is a compound found in cannabis plants including hemp and marijuana plants CBD is like a scattershot it's there's a whole bunch of different systems that it's influencing one of which is the end of cannabinoid system but lots of others as well so this is why you see something that works for anxiety potentially for pain potentially for pediatric seizures right and wide host of things because there's a wide number of different mechanisms that it divides the scientific research has lagged is particularly in the area of CBD most of the research that's been done has been on THC which is Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol and that is the primary psychoactive molecule in the plant that's responsible for feeling high more recently probably past five to ten years has there been focused on CBD or cannabidiol that's kind of the second most abundant molecule in the plant and it really came out of you know grass roots if you will of people trying it out on the ground in Colorado in other countries in England trying it out and seeing that it actually helped with pediatric epilepsy which was kind of where it got in its initial buzz one of the ways that I stayed sane honestly for the decade I tried to keep my son alive was research and so I actually had heard about cannabis for epilepsy for me when I take it it comes the anxiety or if I start to feel a headache coming on or migraine it seemed very natural that Consumer Reports wanted to step in and try to understand what is this market what are these products what are the labels say that they are are they safe are they tested do they work and how much are they and who's regulating them and that's that's where we enter into this conversation now despite promising anecdotal evidence we actually know very little about cannabidiol because there is limited research and as the chairman mentioned what we learned was a conflict between the Department of Justice and the Department of Health which prevented that research being done because it was a Schedule one drug is CBD legal so the crazy answer to that is it depends is CBD legal it depends on where you live how strange is that can you imagine not being able to buy tylenol in Ohio but you can buy it at Indiana that's that is sort of what we're talking about and we don't always understand what's the real world application like flying with CBD it seems like in a state where it's legal that you should be able to get on a plane but you may not really want to do that until it becomes federally legal what would Consumer Reports like to see happen in the CBD space to protect consumers sure so that's the most important thing that would protect consumers is clear regulatory environment alignment between the states and the federal government on all things including just the legality of possession and sales how products are manufactured how products are tested how products are sold how products are labeled and we'd also like to see more research in this space so that we the consumer has some assurance that purchasing that product will actually help treat the symptom that they're seeking my son Zack I started having seizures when he was four months old and he had had over 500,000 seizures by the time he was five and we had been through 17 pharmaceuticals he has a rare catastrophic form of early childhood epilepsy and he transitioned to hospice palliative services were you mentally preparing yourself for his death yeah I you know as a as a mom and being faced with what the situation was I and just on Facebook you know they do this memory thing that pops up and it was his EEG that was December of 2011 which was rape before we started this his EEG is of electrical scan of the brain and he was having seizure activity every 10 seconds and so you you know their little bodies and their little brains just can't keep doing that but also how can you don't quit you never quit you can't no one else is gonna fight and so at the same time of of trying to accept things the way that they were was the necessity to make sure that that didn't happen back then it was you know CBD and honey and so I gave him his first dose just in the mouth like you'd give a baby tylenol so it's a liquid he's not smoking anything and his seizures didn't start he fell asleep and two minutes pass in ten minutes pass and and his seizures didn't start and I thought you've got to be kidding me and he didn't have a seizure for 48 hours and they returned they were less frequent they were less severe but his seizures came back and so we just slowly titrate it up just like we've done for the previous decade of everything that we've dried so Zook I was almost 10 years old and incontinent and didn't know his colours and couldn't write his name and had very very poor memory so you know where he was at was he was very developmentally delayed and where is he now he is 15 years old he's toilet trained he's learning sight words so he knows his alphabet he's learning how to read he can do basic addition he's hysterical he's so funny he's so sensitive and cares about how you're feeling he's a very in a lot of ways very typical you know fifteen-year-old boy he's talking about his house he's gonna get and how I'm not gonna live with him it's just absolutely incredible it's amazing [Music] you [Music] we're here in the foothills Appalachia we're on the edge of the coal fields so we're don't have vast acres to farm we have limited acreage so we need to have a high-value crop a high-quality crop that we can grow basically for a cash crop when you talk to people who don't know anything about hemp and don't know anything about CBD how do you kind of begin to tell them about it people know that I'm growing this crop and a lot of them oh they first they automatically assume you're growing medical marijuana that's that's your first thing you have to educate people this is not medical marijuana it is it's a medical marijuana is still illegal in state of Kentucky so it isn't industrial hemp but it does produce CBD we've been primarily at the back upon the tobacco industry of course as everyone knows in decline so we've always been looking for alternatives so three years ago we actually drew our first hemp crop and and we thought this is something that could really fit in our operation and something we could produce that we would be proud to be producing that'd be Kentucky grown and like I said if you can grow something that can help a kid with epilepsy I mean that's just that's just huge it's a great feeling [Music] so when we harvest it's much like tobacco we actually go in and we hand cut it we take it and we dry it in some dryers we have here on the farm and once we dry it we actually separate the relief and bud material from the stock and that's actually a material that we have that we sell and then of course the bud material is were the CBD that and that'll go to an extractor and that's where the extraction cbda be extracted from the bud mature I feel like next year that they'll probably be more demand for him than what they're our farmers to produce what makes you say that just because of the merging markets they can't sit idle so you know next three or four years I think demand is there for in production I've covered pharmaceutical medications and over-the-counter medications and supplements for over 15 years and I have never seen any product that both has medical benefit and for very difficult to treat conditions that also may have a supplement benefit for conditions like anxiety insomnia pain and that also may be used in a recreational space is there any interest as a possible alternative or weaning mechanism for opioid addiction yes there are a number of studies that are going on that are looking at the interaction between both THC and CBD in relation to opiates and trying to see if there are some ways of curbing opiate use but not just opiates their National Institutes of Drug Abuse funded a study looking at CBD and tobacco nicotine addiction you know there's been work that's looked at cocaine addiction so all of those things I think there's potential there's theory that makes sense within this space and we'll see what happens with the research I think it's pretty exciting when I look back on that time period where I was on a lot of medications I actually had so many that my medicine cabinet was just a bunch of yellow bottles prescribed by the VA I served active duty in the Navy for four years we stepped on board the USS Harry s Truman for her maiden voyage and were the relieving battle group for the USS Cole I was injured on board the Truman actually right off the bat I tripped over the catch wire carrying roughly 180 pounds worth of tie-down chains so I basically destroyed my left knee and my lower back simultaneously when were you first prescribed opioids or opiates in 2000 when I destroyed my knee and for how long did you take them thirteen years did they work to an extent after a certain point you get moved from one type of opioid to another so I had gone from basically naproxen to tram it all to vicodin and oxy and in the end I was taking morphine tablets and for me looking back my mental state just it was like I was there but I wasn't it was just like a shell of me hi here's Veronica but she's not present she's faking it so what I made an appointment with my primary care physician at the time she actually recommended that I go out and get a card for medical marijuana and see if that was effective for me and how high did you feel I was pretty out of it for a while and that was one of the effects that I really didn't like about marijuana so I talked to some of the dispensaries about you know what can I do to kind of mitigate this feeling and they had actually suggested trying pure CBD from the hemp plant and did you feel relief immediately with the CBD I didn't really feel relief right away but I felt like after about 30 days of consistently taking it I started to feel normal again and how do you feel now today I feel alive you know I don't I don't feel like the world was coming down on top of me anymore and for me that's big I think the important thing to understand I think the hard part is the disconnect between how much is in those bottles at a dispensary or that you order online and how much is required for clinical effect now some people say I use 10 milligrams and I feel wonderful and again there's no clinical data to support that if you wanted to dose like you're seeing in the clinical trials where you actually see separation from placebo it's a lot so a few examples social anxiety 600 milligrams a day that's a lot adults with osteoarthritis of the knee or other types of pain 500 to a thousand depending on the study so I mean you're not in the tens and if you look at the bottles like some of the bottles it's like this whole bottle is 500 milligrams right it's like you're drinking that bottle in a day and that's a lot the interesting thing about one out of every four Americans has tried CBD that's according to a nationally representative survey that Consumer Reports just completed the majority of people told us CBD was effective for the problem they were trying to treat a solution to what what are they hoping to solve sure so so one of the most common reasons people have tried CBD is pain management and anxiety and insomnia [Music] I've always loved to be outside so I've always hiked and jogged and walked and running is just a great way to get outside get in the woods it's a great way to start the day feels like every day's a vacation we can get out and run before work after work you got to try to run six days a week and I had a tendinitis of my other foot and also my knee I've had a knee tendonitis and so I did the normal things rest I didn't help and then my friend that me some CBD and I didn't really intend to use it and but it was there and I you know at a couple days my tendonitis was still there and I used it and it went away immediately which was I was surprised and yeah so then I've started using it when I've had tendonitis and it seems to work and you've only used a topical ointment yes yes why haven't you tried tinctures I don't I think mostly what I've seen people use them for is anxiety and sleep disturbance which day I don't think I suffer from so I haven't really had any any I don't have any other inflammatory other than the local inflammation and that's pretty rare so you don't feel I really needed anything I'm also a little nervous a little apprehensive I I don't the topical seems like totally safe to me the ting sherry I'd like to see more information do you worry at all about trusting what's in that bottle yes yes for sure I think that at least what I've read about CBD is that's the biggest concern is what's in it who's manufacturing it where it comes from and I think with a lot of supplements when patients I've many many patients who take supplements and I tell them I think that's specially pregnant patients that's you know big risk always is that what it's what's in it things that don't have to be added to the label I think that's a scary part of supplements we wanted to do a study to really look at CBD products that were out in the market be it you know CBD oils and in containers vape oils anything really that was you know liquid CBD to see what does the market look like it and really the point is how accurately labeled by these products and in this study 70% or so of products were mislabeled some containing more CBD than was labeled in some containing less CBD that was labeled but a lot of products also contain THC or other cannabinoids in there that hadn't that weren't necessarily on the labels at all so beyond you know I'm getting less of the drug or more of the drug than I expect but I'm also getting some other things in there that I might want to be avoiding and so from a consumer standpoint it was a bit alarming I think it's very important to be a skeptic in this space especially when we're talking about this much money being spent in this space and I think it's important to you know be realistic about what we know and our approach to this and I really think bifurcating the the people that are there for medicinal use because they have an issue that can't be currently addressed with existing medications and the Wellness crowd I think we really need to differentiate those two crews and I think right now it's kind of getting blended a bit and I could see that as frustrating from the medicinal crowd because they're like hey this is we're trying to you know get this medicine or do whatever and things are getting marketed for you know more the Wellness crowd in some instances so I think it's it's pretty difficult space right now at the same time you are hopeful as a researcher and see great potential I do I do but I'm not I'm not the one that's gonna go out there and say you know it cures everything because I think it's and even seeing it in pediatric epilepsy or seeing it in anxiety it works for some and it doesn't work for and figuring that nuance out is really important but I think it's therapeutic potential is pretty wide-ranging [Music]", "okq7mHdXv2U": "hello my little apples and welcome back to another video if you're like me in this case I really hope that you're not because it kind of sucks but you suffer from migraines or anxiety or sleep deprivation then please keep watching this video because as you can tell from the title I started taking CBD oil about a month ago regularly and I am feeling like a new person but before we get started if you're new here and you like content like this holistic healing nutrition veganism lifestyle and all that good stuff oh and also education because I'm currently a Dietetic student at the moment make sure you hit that subscribe button and also that notification bow so bye well that's interesting I just got a text message but make sure you hit that notification bell so that you know whenever I post a new video which is weekly by the way I also have social media is like the instagrams and the Twitter's so if you're ever you know wondering what I'm doing in my day to day you could check me out over there but let's get into the video so in a CNN report and I just looked this up because I was really curious about it but in 2016 it was reported that the average American spends about half their day behind the screen and I'm not saying that you spend your day behind the screen and I'm not saying that you're an average American or if you're an average American then you automatically spend the rest of your day in front of the screen but I'm saying that I'm pretty much the average American I currently have my social medias I make youtube videos so I mean that's just a lot of screen time in general and then I have my phone where I'm spending a lot of time behind the screen and then I'm currently interning as a Dietetic intern where a lot of the times in the hospital the dieticians and their time behind a computer screen reading charts learning about patients trying to prescribe the right diet or modified diets and that's a lot of strain on my eyeballs I first realized that I was training my eyeballs a lot I think in the beginning at like the end of 2017 the beginning of this year because I started taking on more online classes all of my books are online and I edited a lot of videos and I noticed that when I spent a lot of time on my computer and behind my phone I we get migraines for days and you know when Millennials use the term for days that just like exaggerating until like five minutes I literally got migraines for days and at first I tried using blue light glasses which helps because it kind of blocks the harsh light that comes from screens sorry if you can hear sirens I'm just recording from my room right now I live right next to a hospital what has really helped me these past couple weeks was CBD oil and this CBD oil specifically is from green roads and they were kind enough to sponsor this video so thank you green roads I have been wanting to use CBD oil for a long time and like actually try it with my migraines and I actually tried it before I got into contact with green roads one of my friends actually suffers from chronic migraines and she let me try some of her CBD and it was amazing like my migraine went away it was in a couple hours that's something that I was trying to get rid of like all day and all of a sudden it wasn't like a magical oh it's gone but at the end of the day I was like whoa what my migraine go that's weird so then I was looking into really good CBD oils and I came across this one which is pharmacists formulated so it's medical grade CBD in case you wanted to know CBD does not get you high CBD is economic cut CBD stands for cannabidiol it's one of the many chemical compounds in the cannabis plants CBD and THC are the two most prominent chemical compounds in the cannabis plant but unlike THC CBD does not have a psychoactive factor in it so it does not get you high we actually have a whole endocannabinoid system in our bodies that is responsible for maintaining a healthy balance at every stage of biological life so we have a bunch of endocannabinoid receptors in our body that's because our body creates endocannabinoids does that help with so many functions in our lives but the problem is that our body also creates enzymes that break down these endocannabinoids so the purpose of implementing exogenous CBD like CBD oil which also comes in like different forms so there's an edible which there's like a fruit roll-up that Green Road sent me but I ate it already and they also have cream this I use but I'll talk about it later the purpose of adding exogenous DVD into our system is so that it can reduce the enzymes that break down the endogenous cannabinoids that our bodies make because our endocannabinoid system works with so many areas of our bodies CBD has been linked to so many things such as epilepsy there's been so many papers on epilepsy epilepsy pain chronic anxiety inflammation sleeps just to name a few those are the biggest ones but if you want to know more I will leave a link in the description below that literally shows like why people use CBD like people use CBD for acne treatment why people use CBD for lupus why do people use CBD for Addison's disease or digestive problems or autism or social anxiety so you can check all those out but right now I just wanted to talk about the personal benefits that I've had by using CBD oil this past month it's really made such a huge difference in my life like now I don't even use those blue light glasses anymore and I'm behind a screen all the time and I take CBD every night and I not only sleep better I not only have less anxiety but I've also been able to not have as many migraines throughout my weeks migraines are actually really crippling because you're going throughout your day and you want to think about good things and you want to be comfortable and you want to be productive but all you can think about is this pain just like radiating all over and I used to just be like you know what this migraine will go away it'll be fine my body's strong it's a warrior but what actually happens is that when you allow your body to stress itself out enough you create more and more cortisol which is not good for your body if you guys know about cortisol that's the stress hormone by using the CBD oil nightly and so I'll just do like three to five drops leave it under my tongue for at least 45 seconds and then swallow it has really really helped me wind down in the evening and the next day I don't have a migraine and throughout the day I don't have migraines and I didn't even realize this until two or three weeks into using it and I was like wait I used to get migraines all the time and I'm on a screen way way way more now than I have been before and I really honestly believe that it has to do with using CBD oil have you see video before but I recorded my first reaction of using the CBD oil on camera for you guys so you could see it so I'll show you now hey hey guys just got back from the gym and I look like a boy but I promise I have hair looks like this and has vegetable glycerin Fido cannabinoid rich oil essential hemp oil so place one two three drops under the tongue for at least ten to thirty seconds before swallowing this tastes really good and I'm told what this is but it tastes really really good first impression just like saliva building up in my mouth because I can't swallow anything but on a small office first impression is that it tastes really really good immediately I dropped it under my tongue I felt a little bit of tingling under my tongue but the tingling went away and now I am I guess I'm just waiting for the calmness to overcome me but I just came from a long day at my internship and I have a huge migraine because I was looking at the screen all day and that normally is what happens to me I really like the days it's pretty good back to you Amanda now I'm about four weeks into using it and I've never felt any better when I was actually sitting down to write out my thoughts on CBD I realized that I have been sleeping way better it kind of helps me like relax and wind down for the night there have been so many studies documenting CBDs beneficial effects on anxiety and noticed that that anxiety is kind of wound down more from when I started using CBD and I'm just way more relaxed and I fall asleep way easier and I stay asleep my problem is I fall asleep but then I wake up and I fall asleep and then I wake up and I never really felt completely rested when I woke up from my sleep so say I'd sleep like a good like six to eight hours because that's like a good time for me I'll wake up and feel like I still haven't slept but ever since using this I've honestly felt rested like I wake up and I actually wake up and ready to go yeah I'll hit the snooze button for five minutes but in that five minutes I'm like still awake and I'm just like letting myself rest a little bit more but I know that I'm awake and I don't just like knock right back out what I've set my snooze you know what I mean DVD is definitely helped with my migraines my sleep quality and as for anxiety I feel like I've just mentioned this over and over again there's no black and white where it just you know I'm super super anxious and all of a sudden huh I'm good I'm chill but it's just this gradual like hmm I can think about other things now I'm doing other things now and then I look back and I'm like wait wasn't I just like extremely anxious a couple of minutes ago huh so that's what it's been like for me so long story short that's what my experience has been like using CBD and I will continue to be using CBD oil because it has been so beneficial if you've never tried it and you suffer from the like sleep deprivation and anxiety migraines inflammation pains and aches in your bodies I would highly suggest trying out CBD it's completely legal it's safe good for your body speaking of body aches the green roads also has this bare green muscle and joint cream and I actually use it on my jaws because I have this gum chewing problem and like I've been really really trying to not chew as much gum but my jaws will get really really sore and they'll actually hurt and I notice it when I use this they're agreed and just like put it on my jaws it has this nice like calming effect and then my jaws just don't hurt anymore not to say that the soreness goes away completely but I just don't feel like as tight and tense and so I feel like this would be really good for those of you who have like tense necks or tense backs were like you always feel like you're holding tension there because your muscles are constantly I mean because that can happen when you're stressed and anxious subconsciously you just hold a stiffness in your body because that's the mood or that's the emotion that's going on within you and it just manifests physically but I feel like this could really help with that now you know CBD works for migraines anxiety sleep at least for me and I hope if you give it a try for those issues it works for you as well if you want to know more about CBD or you're not completely convinced please click the links in the description below I hope you guys learned something from this video and that you enjoyed it if you have ever experienced using CBD or if you use CBD or if you have any opinions or comments about it you leave them down in

"cy0r4zIdDMs": "[Music] hi friends trent the wizard here with factory six we're diving deep into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks for watching this is all we have for you today for more information check out

so that inflammatory responses are controlled and proper not creating inflammatory damage or pain but the CVD product landscape is just a confusing amalgam of strong marketing claims and you're left wondering which product works but when you look at them 90% of those products are the same thing they're just isolates or oils dissolved in a carrier oil like MCT and each one of these is fighting to market its way above the other while missing the main point in the CBD game and that's bioavailability bioavailability the ability to get that into your blood and into your tissues where you need it

[Music] okay so getting right into the subject today we are talking about cbd oil and how it potentially can help you in your weight loss journey cbd oil is the hot new thing in healthcare in general really people use it to treat anything from stomach ailments to anxiety all the way up sometimes to cancer treatments so we're not going to talk about any other uses of cbd oil other than how it may help you lose weight this is a weight loss channel after all so to do so we are going to look at two specific studies and we're gonna use the white board so we're gonna look at two studies one on mice or rats and the other is a study in humans so this first one is a 2011 study using mice and what the researchers did was they treated mice with cbd oil and they found that the mice that were treated with cbd oil had a significant decrease in their body weight after treatment the rationale that the researchers gave was there's a cb2 receptor and cb2 antagonists lead often to appetite suppression so these rats were eating less because the cbd oil was an antagonist to the cb2 receptor and it caused the rats to eat less therefore they lost weight so if we talk about this in humans while a human study has not been done yet we can surmise that potentially the same effect would happen in humans a lot of people believe that cbd oil is an appetite suppressant now if you think about marijuana marijuana and cbd oil are two completely different things there's thc in marijuana marijuana often causes hunger and that's a pretty common uh thing out there you know getting the munchies when you when you uh are doing marijuana so that does not happen when you do cbd oil there's no thc in cbd oil so cbd oil potentially could cause you to have less of an appetite therefore eat less and then lose weight research study number two this was done on humans and it was done five years later we're talking about a 2016 study now and we're talking about the activation of browning in white fat cells so they so humans this time were treated with cbd oil now there's two types of fat white fat and that's the fat that we typically think of like if you grab a hold of of your love handle and you've got a love handle there and that's white fat brown fat is a different type of fat so what we're trying to do is get the white fat to turn into brown fat it's called the browning of white cells white fat cells so what the reason we want that is brown fat is oftentimes termed as good fat brown fat is what keeps you warm it it undergoes a very high level of thermogenesis or it burns a lot of energy based on how big it is so it's often thought of as a treatment for obesity because of how much energy it can burn relative to its size so the more brown fat we have relative to white fat the more energy we're going to burn and the more weight loss we can expect so this wasn't a particular weight loss study it was a study seeing how cbd oil reacted to white fat cells and if it could cause this browning effect which it did so there's two studies there again one in rats so we've gotta make sure that we understand this was in a human trial and then an actual human trial and with two different effects we're looking at two different processes appetite suppression and then actually the changing of the white cell the browning of the white fat cell so i particularly i we don't use cbd oil we don't use cbd oil in our clinics we don't use that for treatment as of now the reason more research is needed this is just not enough to give us enough information saying that it's actually going to be a weight loss aid more research is coming out it seems like monthly we're reading new things about cbd oil and its effects but it's not there yet so we don't use it quite yet but it looks promising alright i hope this was informative if you like these type of videos please consider subscribing to this channel you can do so by hitting this button right here and then right here is

with Nicole and today in the kitchen I am making a CBD oil cream so really simple actually this crazy-looking bottle is the base lotion that I made in another video and I'll put the link over here for that if you want to learn how to make all-natural lotion from scratch I've put some other additives in it that extra nutrients that are kind of nice but this is my basic lotion that I can use to make other things like sunscreen you can find the video for that over here for natural tinted sunscreen and also to make other things that we want to add different nutrients to it so today I'm going to use CBD oil and I'm going to mix it just simply in with my lotion cream and this is used one as a way to get it into the body because CBD oil has been shown to be really effective for pain in the joints inflammation in the joints just also problems on the skin check out you just google it to find the effects of CBD oil what people are getting really good results and dealing with some things like arthritis and all kinds of stuff so you can make your own you'll just have to source your own CBD oil so for this recipe I'm just using a 2 ounce jar here and I'm gonna use about C my cream has gotten super thick so I'm going to use about two let's see two tablespoons of my homemade cream and this is one tablespoon of the CBD oil and this has an orange flavor added to it because it's used for internal it doesn't matter you can still use it external so it does smell a little bit orange e it's not orange essential oil though so I think you're okay is for our Sun but I put this on at night just anyway because it might little sticky and by the way CBD oil is not the same as marijuana it's not going to get you high it has no psychoactive properties at all so it's only used for inflammation and things like that so this is really simple I'm just going to stir it up here with my cream it smells kind of Archie if you wanted to add other essential oils to it you know I always go for something like lavender or even a mint those are still great still good for the body have their own properties to them for the skin and even the joints and things like that so it's as simple as that and mixing the cream up and then make sure you put a label on it so you know what's in this jar so CBD cream use it on your face anywhere on your joints or skin that you're having issues if you

"dAHKGKmSxtE": "hello James granny here from internet B's Unicom and I'm back at it again with the hem videos in today's video I'll be going back to its firm in the last video I showed you out on the field what the hemp looks like in this video we'll be going into the shed and showing you what the hemp looks like inside the shed and exactly how you dry out the hemp plant and turn it into a product that you can sell to the end customer I'll be showing you all of that in this video this is the third video in this series in the earlier two videos I showed you out in the field and just explained here about the business ideas behind hemp and I linked up them to videos below this video so that you can check it out if you haven't checked them out yet but yeah this is something that I'm really interested in at the moment I'm learning as much as possible about hemp and all of the future possibilities there is with this plant and build businesses around it because I think there's gonna be so many opportunities to build businesses in this industry in the future and that's why I'm spending so much time learning about it and I'm sharing with you what I learned here so I hope that you're joining us if you are enjoying this series give it a thumbs up so that I know that you like these types of videos but what I'm gonna do now is just flick over and show you some of the footage that I shot while on aids farm and you can learn for yourself exactly how the hemp is dried out and the end products that are made out of us [Music] so hope to be the moisture yeah you know but now that's that's our stuff that was hand picked hang home here about on just on this side here if I win acres worth ham polka and it took four lads a full week that coat is and hang it up now it's good quality stuff but it's it's tough know that I'd like to be getting properly dry it into it will air dry but now with the wet weather it is so Coco Chanel cocoa that's you really it's the drawing is the biggest problem with this whole crop but you need to be able to try that and in order to deserve it now as long as there's it was it was fully dried it is taking in a bit of moisture but it's not it's not doing any damage yes if if I seen air a little bit of mold in a guitar I'd be getting worried but but it's it is fine it is it is okay it's good and what would you do if there was mold bits in it do you fool them I wanna know yeah I want you can have it only spread yeah you know it's not too bad now it's okay yeah there's only very neighbors what a hint they're like you're looking at getting over over five around five hundred kilos all to actually pop that leaf leaf and flower you know so it's that and that's where you're you're you're cannabinoids air is going to be on that but you know that's where your hemp oil yeah but you'll get seed as well this was harvested early which will still have seed because I have males and you're not going to get to weed out there with males okay like I wouldn't buy I wouldn't bother buying family I seen unless that you knew that you're a percentage of CBD was going to be say anywhere from twelve fifteen twenty percent CBD and this is this is going to be anywhere from probably about three percent up to well we got her tested at eight percent which is very very good but I'd usually say anywhere from 3% to 5% okay can you explain the difference between CBD percentage and THC percentage well the THC is your tetrahydrocannabinol and we can only pick varieties that are going to be below zero point two percent THC th is what gets you high yeah cannabis that you'd buy on the street would be anywhere from 10 percent up to thirty percent being that super skull okay and what TAC is only 0.2% and it can only be a maximum with 0.2% and so then therefore you'd have to smoke a telephone Paul sighs joint in about ten minutes to stand like the die of smoke inhalation before he gets thrown so it's just not possible to get stoned off this him yeah and what the other compound there is your THC or CBD yeah so your CBD is your cannabidiol and that cannabidiol then can be and it would probably be anywhere from two to five percent on this variety whereas the Rays other varieties will be much higher but we're not allowed grow those they're generally varieties that are in and the states would have been crossbred with your your cannabis was the likes of ac/dc is a variety there that will have about 15% CBD it generally correlates the to generally currently together that the higher that the tea may see generally the higher the CBD of course because we're only allowed two broads ear 0.2% that's why your CBD is down now there's certain leader coming out with new genetics that you can have zero THC and a hypersensitivity force because this is industrial hemp and you're you're generally looking at a sort of two to five percent CBD now we're using this because we can because we can Road who are allowed to grow it but really and truly in the future you need to be getting into those higher percentages to justify putting in that very expensive equipment for the extraction processes your ethanol ratio to the your co2 could be half a million a million so then you have to have high percentages to justify spending that half-million no whereas what we're doing is we're called pressing this so this this is basically blended up and into a powder and mixed with seed for to a cold press and then whatever this is whether it be 2% to 5% whatever it is that's gonna melt and in that cannabinoid or and could you briefly explain what's next with what we're seeing here so after this is hung up try it out how long does it take to dry out generally about three to four weeks to dry out so and then you want to be keeping sunlight offered if sunlight comes on to that it start to go up around and not that not that that's a huge problem but just aesthetically and you want it to be nice and green so once we have that droid will be will strip strip this off and we'll we blend it blend it down to a powder and then it's mixed with that seed put your cold pressed [Applause] so this is the best day the oil tested bottle now of the of our oil so you can see here now is the book with a seed I have a show so this is the hand seed that's that's your hem see so that's about 20 percent oil right you won't get a full 100% extraction when you go through the cold press you'll get so it takes about a kilo of this seed to make this 25 to 250 ml bottle of of oil and once you press that seed the end up with this cake so that cake is very high in fiber and high in protein so this that's that's the company that presses it for a stylish health or as they're often Ashburn and this is the it's that cake and is milled down and it's put into that package so you have a nice fine powder that you can add to your smoothies or shakes your cereal biscuits bars various different things very high in protein very high in fiber then this is your your oils then that's what's your brand minimum okay Dean Mountain Farms okay you can see you son Facebook and Instagram stop and what does most people you could be on your for and well it's I suppose salads is the big one now it's not what you call a cooking oil it doesn't like that really high heat it's a poly saturated fat so it doesn't like that real high heat you can do a bit of baking with it and things like that what is it it's used similar that you would use a grapeseed oil but it doesn't like that it's not a cooking oil like you wouldn't be frying in my head now or anything but it is it's a very it's a very healthy oil to be just using on your salads using in estos homelesses I do just take that I actually get a glass of milk and pour out two tablespoons of oil into my milk and I drink it down that way and it's a bit like a peanut milkshake like it has it has a nice nutty flavor little bit grassy push it's a more of a notary or taste and it's it's it's not five like it's not an oil no that you take off the spoon like the die-hard might do that hearted but generally I put it in ass will be exactly cool yeah put it in a smoothie added in that way because it is a really healthy oil because you're getting all of your amigas I get has the perfect balance between concerns you know of that four to one ratio Omega six to omega-3 closer has GLA which is gamma Leone gases and that Gamal ionic acid is an anti-inflammatory I hope that you've learned a lot from this video I know that I've learned a lot from us and I've also more videos comment along with this series hope

and bringing that video to you that'll be the fourth video in this series if you haven't watched the earlier two videos I will link them up below this video as well as IDI contact details if you want

little CBD in it to get everybody in the festive mood and ready to have a great time so to start we're gonna go with a little bit of vegan margarine and to this margarine that's when we want to add our CBD oil and to that we're gonna add our sugars so here we have brown sugar and cane sugar start slowly at first we start at a high speed everything's just gonna end up on the walls great so what you're looking for here is a nice well blended product to this we're gonna add our dry our dry consists of flour cornstarch baking soda and a little bit of salt mixing everything together building up from there to about medium speed at that point your cookie mixture will look like wet sand now for the wet ingredients we're just gonna put a little water and a little vanilla extract now we want to mix this as well starting slow building up till everything is well incorporated in the mixture looks fluffy so then I'm mixtures nice well incorporated and fluffy so we'll start with some chocolate chips mix the chocolate chips just - they're all mixed in and incorporated off the bowl now we'll go with the pecans you just want to run it slow until it's all incorporated just a couple turns will do that's good now we do pretzels these are little salted pretzels that we love to use the salt is nice it gives you a nice contrast of the sweetness of the cookie marshmallows these are vegan marshmallows and last but not least potato chips so the potato chips are gonna crush themselves inside so we just fold them in I'll let the machine do the work now we're doing this at the slowest speed possible and that's it we'll take the cookie dough right out of the bowl and so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna grab small handfuls and just form them and then almost into a patty shape almost like little pucks and you lay them on a sheet pan and then we'll bake them in a low oven we bake these at 320 degrees you really don't want to bake anything with CBD in it higher than 320 degrees because you'll lose those wonderful effects that it has so we bake these at 320 degrees seven minutes on one side we'll rotate the tray and bake it seven minutes on the other so they're nice and even so everything kind of melts the marshmallow Browns a little bit you see the pretzel sticking out there chocolate chips are nice and gooey and it's just an overall fun cookie [Music]", "pmIZzHHe2G8": "five different types of CBD that you\nneed to know about any if you're looking for again five different types of CBD\nthat you need to know about if you're looking for CBD in your skincare hi my\nname is Christy and I've been treating a client's I'm a licensed professional\ntreating clients with acne hyperpigmentation and other skin\nconditions for over twelve years and now I have taken early retirement from\npractice and I'm only doing online consultations so if you're interested in\nthat there is a link below you can just find out more information to see if you\nare the right candidate so moving on we're gonna be talking about the five\ndifferent types of CBD so if you haven't caught any of our series of what we're\ntalking about beauty and skincare I do want to clarify because I only mentioned\nit in one video that CBD is not the same as hemp seed oil so the CBD is actually\nextracted from the cannabis sativa plant so there are two totally different\nthings so we're gonna be talking about the CBD as an extract in your skincare\nso the first one is CBD isolate and this is actually consisting of 99% CBD it is\nTHC which is the hallucinogenic agent free it's very consistent of most of the\nmanufacturers that use CBD in their products uses the CBD isolate and all\nother plant actives are eliminated so the next one is CBD distillate and this\none is not as concentrated it's still 80% CBD the other is rest is other minor\ncannabinoids and terpenes and all the other rest of it is plant materials and oils okay so the next one is full-spectrum\nCBD and that consists of 60% CBD and 0.3 percent THC it also is taken from the\nentire plan including the flower so it does have the plant flavinoids the it\nhas the minor cannabinoid such as CBC CBD\nand CBG as well as other phytochemicals so I do have one caveat I've read\nseveral different articles and I read some that come across that say the CBD\nisolate which is the 99% is more effective and then I also have read that\nthis full-spectrum CBD is more beneficial so there seems to be I don't\nknow if it's conflicting or they just have difference of opinion but just to\nlet you know that when you start reading literature on CBD those are some of the\nthings that you might come across so before we get into the last CBD type if\nyou're finding this information helpful please give us a thumbs up and like this\nvideo letting us know that this is the type of information that you are looking\nfor and don't forget to hit that notification bell to let you know when\nour videos come up we would love it if you would subscribe to us so now let's\nget to our last CBD type so the last one is water soluble CBD in our last video\nwe talked about the fact that the CBD is actually naturally lipophilic meaning\nthat it loves oil or oil soluble well when they make it water soluble what\nthey do is they basically shrink down the molecule so that it actually can\nmix with water but when you do or you mix anything with water it can dilute\nthe potency and in this case it can dilute the potency up to 30% so here\ncomes the pro tip when you see hemp seed extract it's more than likely hemp seed\noil and don't mistake the fact that there's only trace amounts if any of the\nCBD in hemp seed oil so it is not the same thing so now that we talked about\nthe five types of CBD we're gonna briefly talk about what skin condition\nworks best with some of these different types\nnow the links of some of these studies will be in my blog in which the blog\nlink will be in my description okay so the first one is acne so there was a\nstudy in 2014 in which they found that CVD\nactually reduces the amount of lipid that is being produced from the SIBO\nsites and that's basically the cells that create the sebum and then in study\ndone in 2016 and actually showed in addition to that it actually reduced\ninflammation in the sebocytes and inflammation throughout the skin and in\naddition to that and also they also found antimicrobial and antibacterial\nproperties which then also can help with fungus related skin diseases as well as\nacne so for those of you who have sensitive skin or dry and sensitive skin\nor just dry skin you may want to listen up to this part so they have found that\nthe full-spectrum CBD that we just talked about with its powerful\nphytochemicals and flavinoids can actually help reduce not only\ninflammation but it has the essential fatty acids that a lot of the lipid poor\nso basically dry skin is lacking it can help serve as an emollient and\na moisturizer with these essential fatty acids of antioxidants and the\nphytochemicals a lot of times the types of products that you will see the full\nspectrum CBD is in oils such as massage oils salves\nbalms lotions and creams so some of the skin conditions that are lacking a lot\nof the lipids or essential fatty acids CBDs actually has omega-6 and Gamma\nlinoleic acid which can help for those of you who have psoriasis eczema and\nsystemic sclerosis I mentioned in an earlier video that also has by\nantioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E so it can help neutralize the\nfree radicals and there was actually a study that was done that actually helped\nwound healing cells so basically helped healing of\nwounds including acne lesions so this is by no means an exhaustive list of all\nthe benefits of it and what you can do with it what skin types obviously this\nis just to better help you read the label of your skincare products because\nremember makeup is an art and skincare is a science thanks for watching and\ndon't forget to subscribe", "dE5eY__w_Cc": "- [Inverse] So, what is CBD? CBD stands for cannabidiol and it is one of the roughly 500 compounds\nfound in the marijuana plant. CBD is perfectly legal and is actually the second most prevalent\ncompound found in cannabis. Falling short to the more\nfamous and semi-legal THC or tetrahydracannabinol. These compounds are very\nsimilar on a microscopic level. Both CBD and THC share the\nexact same molecular formula. C21H30O2. Both compounds also interact\nwith the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are found on the\nendocannabinoid system present in all mammalian species. But while THC is known for\nits psychoactive effects. - I feel like a slice of butter melting on top of a big ole' pile of flapjacks. - [Narrator] CBD acts\na little differently. Early research shows that\nit has the opposite effect on dopamine compared to THC. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with the feeling of reward\nthat you get when taking drugs like cocaine and heroine. THC causes dopamine activity to rise, but CBD seems to decrease its activity. Some researchers think\nthis raises CBDs potential for understanding and treating addiction. Early studies have shown that CBD is also fairly helpful in\ntreating anxiety, insomnia and sleeplessness and chronic pain. There's also early evidence\nthat CBD can prevent seizures and some forms of severe epilepsy. And can help normalize brain\nactivity linked to psychosis. In the last few years, its found its way onto\nmillions of people shelves and topical, ingestible,\nor oil-based forms. It's still the early\ndays for CBD, but so far, the world health organization\ndeems it pretty safe. Cannabidiol is, for now,\nlegal and potentially a pretty helpful compound\nfor a lot of people. (light music)", "179z2Tt9Rsk": "hi everybody and welcome back it is Sunday and it is the day where I start to try in his crust and sort of go through my life with chronic pain basically it's as I said before this isn't going to be easy for me to talk about because it's one of those things everybody is different everybody's pain is different everybody feels pain differently and everybody corpse with pain differently and everybody has different injuries so this is kinda why I have never really sort of delved into it because I don't want to be sitting here and you know sorta feeling like I'm teaching somebody out to sew cakes because that isn't that isn't what this is about this is just about my experiences for you know what I've been going through for years the things I've learned and the things that just may help somebody somewhere along the line so I have had three spine operations the scar on the back of my neck from my last operation was supposed to be like that big he is like that big I smell I'm not really supposed to melt at that to be quite honest but the problem was I was you losing use of my right hand and arm and that was only gonna get worse so the new resurgence said you know we've got to operate on it the issue also is I have two prolapsed discs in my neck so he couldn't do anything about that so it was like you know we need to fix this issue the disc issue belongs to a different surgeon so I went ahead got the operation done came out of it and really struggled really struggled with my recovery basically and I think that was in the November and then in the February I ended up going to my GP and asking her to put me into physio which she did and that is when I realized I was trying we're way too hard to get back to because in my head I always thought I was going to be I was going to be cured basically that operation was going to make me the person that was before and at this point I still believe that so everything I was doing was to get me back to this point of being the person I was before and when I went to the physio she explained I was doing way too much and I decided to buy a Fitbit so I bought a Fitbit and I was seeing my physio weekly so I put my Fitbit on and was tracking 10,000 steps it nearly killed me I mean I was in so much bed it was unbelievable and then when I got to her she was just like oh hang on a minute 3,000 is more than enough from where you are so we set it to 3,000 then in a few weeks it went to 5,000 and then we reached a compromise where it was 10,000 so sorry 7000 not 10,000 7000 so even now I track to 7000 and the reason for buying the Fitbit wasn't to make sure I do those steps every day it was to stop me doing more than the step count because when I did more than the step count that is when the pain flare-ups hit okay so that was kind of where I started my Instagram and then then I ended up still struggling with pain because of the disk pain I had the nerves on my neck burnt out that was horrific if you've ever had that done that took like three to six months to settle down and and now what I didn't know at the time I only found out that the bloody operate DAWs was that you nerves actually grow back who knew I didn't know nobody told me and guess whose nerves grew back within the mine so I was back to square one so really that's like the early days of it that's all gone done and dusted and what happened is it was round about May last year I was in a really bad place a really bad place and this is when it starts coming to helping you know this isn't just about chronic pain because this is this will hit home with so many other people last year in May I was in a really really bad place and what was happening was the things I achieve in life fitted on that fingernail okay the things I couldn't do in life fill the whole room and that that was just weighing me down I just it just got me down every single day I couldn't cope with that at all and when you look at that that translates into real life so if it's like work-life balance we've got a busy job and the job is taking up this much your life and the things you want to do have to be squeezed into this much said they same with moms and busy lives you know if your whole day and week and months and years revolve around your child you home you clean in your everything and you have that much time for yourself it's the same thing and these feelings of being overwhelmed or in a bad place come from that so for me I was I knew I was struggling mentally struggling badly so I went back to my GP and asked her to put me back into pain clinic and at this point in time I was taking gabapentin which were these so that's got paint in there and I was taking three of these a day so that's 900 milligrams and I was also taking naproxen twice a day so that's kind of as much as I would let the GP give me because I just wasn't prepared to go down this line I've been on tramadol which is what I was on in April and men because it just it just doesn't do anything for me it makes me sleep it makes me tired it makes me feel Rottie it just I don't have a life when I take it so that's the medication I was taking at that point in time and my GP put me back into sort of the pain clinic but it had all changed from when I first started going and what happens without pain clinic is you have to see a musculoskeletal specialist and she decides which service you need to get the best results basically when I saw the specialist that was when the next bomb shell dropped so I managed to get my point it was just before we gone on holiday and I went to see her she was absolutely lovely she did two Lords of tests and everything and then she dropped the bombshell and said you've got spinal cord compression and I was like sorry what what you're talking about and she explained what that was and explained that I would probably start losing the feeling in my fingers and my toes and if if something really you know jolted me I could potentially you know end up being paralyzed from the waist down off from the neck down rather not the waist down I mean you just don't need to hear those things do you and then she carried on and explained that you know this wasn't gonna get any better it was just gonna get worse so I can't yeah I was kind of like I'm gonna mean it I felt bad your father just feeling even worse now anyway she wanted me to have an MRI we did that and because of the way the scarring is on the back of my neck it is very dangerous to reopen that scar you know that's why I haven't had the disks fixed basically they'd have to go in through the front of my neck and yeah that was where we left it it was kind of like when I got the MRI done it should be extend to the the spinal cord compression so extreme sports are out for me that's very you know that's okay but where we got to was I had to really be careful what I was doing and I still do have to be really careful what I'm doing and she also taught me that she was going to put me with what was called spine of it because fine fit deal with people that need to learn to live with their injuries now suddenly that is the other bombshell that dropped because I'm still living in hope that I'm going to have my life back now she's just telling me I am happening girl so that was a huge huge meltdown for me in 2018 went into spine fit my consultant was brilliant he taught me that taking gabon Penton was okay but it really I'm not taking enough medication to control my pain but then my argument was that taking tramadol you know the normal tramadol that you GP hands out is it just kills me I can't function on it I can't do anything on it I'm a triple een I can't take so now we are scuppered with me just having to call on the minimum pain medication basically so it was kind of Corp on the minimum and have some kind of life or go to tramadol and just be asleep most of the time and that just isn't an option for me because that would that would send me even further down this black hole so we went through the spine fit thing I worked with my spine click consultant we did range movement stretches all of those things but basically we talked about coping mechanisms and he was very very clear on this coping mechanism if in a day on a scale I could I could do 10 things okay so that that's where we started so if you look at things like washing up that might be like half and hoovering might be another half you had to decide what the numbers were in these boxes you were going to pile up in a day but the boxes couldn't sort of go over ten if you like and exercise for me at that point was it really an eight and a nine so if I did some exercise I'm kind of like that's about as much as I can do so we adopted this approach but to be quite honest that approach didn't really work very well with me it didn't I just kept going over it my pain kept flaring up and it just it just didn't work it was - it just didn't gel with me now everybody's different that approach probably worked for so many other people but it didn't work for me and it wasn't until I started following a guy on Instagram called Darren Cattell and Darren has this thing called meetup which is basically it's everything you do that isn't time to exercise so everything like washing I am in hoovering stairs running up and down stairs cups of tea hanging washed out bring what the whole thing but that is what he was talking about and then what you have is you have that um so untimed exercise the general day-to-day stuff and then you have time to exercise where you got for walks when you do that do that you walk your dog hey your cat here your hamster here you know that is non timed exercise and then suddenly the penny dropped it was like right I get what I'm doing wrong here now and as soon as I understood this neat approach where it was in a day if I need to do all the housework and everything else and be running around doing all of these other things like walking the dog I haven't going down by the way [ __ ] Tom Walker Hampstead got the shops you know pour some letters well I can't do that and then do some timed exercise so if I want to do some timed exercise where I walk around the lake I go for a swim I go for a bike ride whatever I put that first and then non timed activities like the iron in the hoovering the walk in the dog house that is separate and then the balance becomes this is much bigger so I have to reduce this or if I'm doing a lot around the house this is much bigger so the exercise goes out the window so suddenly when I adopted this approach this everything I can do fits on a fingernail and everything I can't do fills a room started to shift balance and then the balance was I started getting back some of my life and it was like okay I'm getting there so we come to the end of 2018 come into 2019 and I have a absolutely massive meltdown again with pain flare-up after pain flare-up of the pain Farrell and I started taking the tramadol that the doctors give to everybody and I I made a decision then I was going to have to take it full time because I just couldn't caught with where it was at mentally or physically so but then I thought I wonder if I could just take half tramadol would that be enough he can't actually take half a trauma dog by the way I can promise you I've tried it it doesn't work then I started looking at well is this such a thing as a slower release trauma doll can I take that would that work is there such a thing and you know what lo and behold there is such a thing the GPS don't tell you about it but there is such a thing and this is it okay let me just see if I can this is slow released Ramadhan okay now I must be the only person to know about this at this I don't know whether this is five times the cost of the stuff they hand out on a daily basis I don't know but that is what I take I'm supposed to take two of these a day but I don't you only take one or take one on a morning so I take one of them on a morning I still take two naproxen and then I can take paracetamol on top of that the reason I have to do this is because I suffer two kinds of pain us of a nerve pain and a supports called mechanical pain which is like the disk parts or two types of pain so I need an anti-inflammatory which is the naproxen so if you if you are sort of struggling with pain and you're on tramadol talk to G P about these because these don't make me tired they don't make me feel groggy they don't change my mood they don't do any of that don't do any of it then I got a message from a girl who who were followed and she told me about CBD oil now I'd already used the CBD oil from Holland and Barrett and I didn't read it at all I was just like for being there ah but apparently not all CBD oils are created equally and here you go this is what I've been using so this is it this is from a company called dragonfly you'll see it comes in three different strains 3% 5% 11% now I have actually bought two bottles myself for this so you know don't run away with the idea I'm trying to sell you this cuz I'm not what I was using was this one so I bought two bottles of this last year which was the five percent and what I do on a on and time I take it to get me to sleep which it will help you sleep I'm not I can do say that categorically if you've got problems asleep and it will obviously because I've been giving grain the eleven percent one to knock him out when you struggle to sleep and it makes him sleep like a baby it's pretty girl so that's what I've been using so what I do now is I only take one trauma doll and then at nighttime I take the five percent CBD oil which is this one so just but the thing with CBD oil is be careful it's not all created equally not all CBD oil is the same a woman that I follow on Instagram spared a fortune for some and it did absolutely nothing absolutely nothing I've bought it from Holland about it did absolutely nothing so make sure if you're gonna buy it you've got somebody who has been using it for a while and they can prove to you that it works so I've bought two bottles of the five percent myself the Lydia follow put me into a competition on dragonfly and I warned three poles I'm like happy days and then dragonfly offered to gift me it so there I thought why not I use this all the time so what I've been doing because I've got the three percent which are worn and got gifted being using this through the day when I'm struggling and then back to the five percent on the night so that is how I have been managing my pain and since May last year because I'm taking slow-release tramadol this and the CBD on completely changed my life around completely and they actually came out of pain management in I think it was September October last year and the reason for that is because I managed to get back to my exercise again which we talked about in the other video where I do a tract exercise mileage per month and three sets so that is how I have managed to control my pain and have managed to get back on my feet and I've managed to turn my life around and when I say I've turned my life around I I know that sounds like [ __ ] I'm just I can hear myself say it I promise you it's not it is I have really half time my life around I mean I if you I wish to God I don't videos like video diaries of how I felt in 2018 to how I feel now and the things that I couldn't do then that I can do now and when I've started to Train and obviously that has built of my strength as well you know as all that was all of this helps but for me it was the combination of changing my pain medication and standing my ground with my GP and saying look I mean I really had to stand my ground with her and say you know this slow-release tramadol i want to give it a go and she's saying you know no it's not for long-term pain but my argument with to that was well you keep giving it to me and offering at me every single time I come in the other tramadol not this one and the other part of it is in three months time if if she doesn't let me try this we're going to be sat having a conversation where I am clinically depressed and now we've got a problem where she has to help me with depression and manage my pain and then it's kind of like well how do I get out of that how do we get my life back from that and that conversation with my GP I had to really dig deep and say look you tell me that isn't gonna work long-term and I'll listen to you prove it to me but she couldn't prove it so she managed to let me sort of have a trial of it and say if your spine fit consult and agrees with this approach then I'll back you and him but you have to have his back in to do this and I am just so pleased I stood my ground because it was the best change for me to to actually go down that route and change my pain medication with the introduction of taking CBD on now the other thing is I'll just point is right out now I don't have any other underlying health issue so I don't have any issues with my heart I don't have any issues anywhere else that all issues I have as managing my pain and the issues I have obviously with what's going on in my neck but I don't have any underlying health issues at all so if if I could take my head off and put somebody else's head on at quite a fit body I'd be like yeah I'm super fit I'm cool um I'm done so that is it look I don't want this to go on and on and on its own for 20 minutes now so I'm gonna leave this here but I'm gonna jump back into this again but from the next one will be about how I manage my exercise and how I manage daily tasks around the house and things like that I just wanted to put this video out there so that you you get to know me a little bit better and you understand why I probably makes other decisions I do like why I do a fridge meal of the week well the answer to that is if I ever pay and flare up it's easy for Graeme to just come in and pick that meal up and finish it off you know why put more stress on myself remember that everything I can do is here and everything I can't do is in a room if you start doing some of these little things like fridge meal of the week or usually slow cooker more or break tasks down which I'll go into later these are the things that free up time and and believe me ignore the free up time because I've spent the last two years do with it okay okay I can prove it to you it does work so if you you know busy at work busy mom just busy then you know keep watching and you know I'll I'll do some more of these videos but I will delve into how I manage to free up my time and stop putting pressure on myself so that I give myself time back and giving myself time back to rest and to collect my thoughts was probably the biggest breakthrough in my recovery because I just never ever once kind of put myself first and I needed to do that to get better basically so they go if you got this far thank you very much for watching if you do have any questions please drop them below and Noor this video is out of what this is about but eventually it will come back to you know why I chose to slimming world how I exercise how I'll manage my day how I'll manage my pain and how it all comes together and I am I am a hundred percent sure somewhere in the line along my line this will really help you if you are struggling for time anyway thank you for watching and have a great Sunday everybody and I will catch up with you back on Wednesday Wednesday's video is going to be one join two gunman is three meals I think it is so if you look into save money that is going to be Wednesday's video", "4ixxyByF2zE": "hi hi hi today's video is a little different little different best CBD oils my favorite so far of 2020 if you're new to this channel what I do is I buy CD products for full price I send them to a lab to see if they're real well as of 2020 this year I send every product to two labs for blind testing why blind test products can you be so obtuse did you call me obtuse CBD products why can't we just trust blindly trust CBD companies and allow them to send whatever they went to a lab that they pay a lot of money to throw out any bad results and only post the good ones and then sell you crap I tested over 80 products over the course of a year without any sponsorship or affiliation but full disclosure this month for the first time I have added affiliate links to CBD examine calm to help pay for the products and lab tests product in lab tests are super super expensive and that's how we're gonna continue to pay for these lab tests well that's where I see things just a little differently contractor no I will not bow to any sponsor I did feel dirty adding the affiliate links to CBD examine calm though almost all review websites work with affiliate links or sponsorships of some sort but it felt dirty right it's like people only do things because they get paid and that's just really sad nothing will change on my website all new products will be purchased for retail price the CBD companies can't send me anything I need to buy them sent to two different labs for blind testing and the official reports of course will be available on each review the process all documented for your eyeballs and I will still be the same jerk that gives critical reviews but this following list was picked last week when I was still innocent pure and poor so after 80 product reviews here are eight of my favorite and these will probably change because I just sent fifty more products to a lab so hit that subscribe button to see more soon I'm gonna go over these super quick and you can just hit the link below to see all the full reviews the official lab tests or watch the YouTube videos on each one number eight oh Jesus look at that beautiful face okay this one needs an update someone lost their job back when Sun soil was called Green Mountain because they didn't know that full-spectrum products contain THC drug test look for THC when I did my review last year I thought that their their lab results could be a little more clear but they fix that issue since their lab results are now very clear I still think CBD companies should do a little more to warn people about THC and drug tests but that's a whole nother problem because if they put the appropriate warning on them certain government employees will flag them in mistake totally legal hemp for marijuana because the government the government in this tone is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently anyway back to us on soil here it's super cheap 30 bucks 600 milligrams of CBD our lab test found it was incredibly accurate on CBD trace levels of THC and lots of other cannabinoids the taste was not bad it's good for all the cannabinoids and the mint chocolate taste helps the natural flavor out a bit but it is a natural taste and it is a good full spectrum so that tastes a little like hemp EMP chocolate so if you don't like the taste of hemp move along just choose a different one if you want the cheapest full-spectrum USDA Organic CBD I think you found it five cents per milligram of CBD is incredibly cheap at only $30 numero seven cheap and trusted and that's not just a CBD company I tested Garden of life's 10 milligram in 20 milligram formulas that's two labs for lab tests dive in links below the $50 30 milligram formula that's 900 milligrams total came in at 5 cents flat cheap he's also taste excellent it's peppermint and orange zest it's really good both are labeled as broad-spectrum so it should have CBD other cannabinoids but no THC nope our labs found that they're basically just a CBD oil which is typical of broad spectrums nothing else most broad spectrum suck I like this as a pure CBD but really if you want other cannabinoids just go with a full spectrum instead of a broad spectrum this one has some essential oils added peppermint frankincense I guess you might be able to say entourage effect I give it to them because almost every broad-spectrum extract I've tasted is pure CBD and other cannabinoids are usually so low that they don't matter in these broad spectrums it's still a great deal for pure CBD and you're getting garden of life they've been around for 20 years and they're a great company I do like that their CBD is formulated by dr. Perlmutter you know grain brain I know it's probably BS he probably just tasted it and was like taste good and they were like okay good because we're gonna say you formulated it on the package and pay you a bunch of money you think that dude is in a lab formulating products probably on some yacht drinking herbal tea or something weird I would think brain maker that was a good book too okay on to number six most trusted brand bar liens our lab tests found this 1125 milligram bottle a full spectrum 70 bucks is a good full spectrum extract you've got CBD THC and good amounts of other cannabinoids like CBC and CBG by the way you guys I know uh people claim a certain CBD oil will be good for specific conditions we don't have enough research to suggest that these cannabinoids change everything I post the cannabinoid profile on every review you might like a lot of THC someone else may have negative effects from tea see you might find that cbc helps you someone else might just like pure CBD you really just got to try a few look at the cannabinoids when you find one you like they affect everyone differently under six cents per milligram great price I really like bar leans they've been around for thirty years and you really can't find anything bad about them well except I did find one thing bad the Center for Food Safety gave them a bad score for CBD testing which was complete [ __ ] that was my December 2019 update and my June 2020 update showed that the Center for Food Safety changed their score to an a stupid government I can say that now that I don't work for the government they were rating CBD companies on testing and transparency without testing anything I know I know and that's why you're here watching a completely insane person sense CBD to labs in California instead of putting your faith in the government yeah I was a government employee but don't don't hold that against me number five most loved CBD company this one is hard to argue with if I wasn't so cheap they would probably be my number one of everything they made the famous strange Charlotte's Web named after Charlotte Figi dr. Sanjay Gupta I don't think I said that right dr. Sanjay Gupta dr. Sanjay had a documentary that featured Charlotte and CBD and that really started the whole CBD movement you can trust dr. Sanjay because cannabis radar ranked him the number one CBD influencer of all time who's that clean-shaven baby face right there that's number two influencer in the world Charlotte's Web played a huge part and the legalization of hemp and I don't know if hemp would be legal today if it wasn't for this company probably not just don't say anything bad about them on the internet their followers really are passionate about them and will email you here's the here's the bad thing I said I really didn't like that the front of their bottle used to say hemp extract that's a [ __ ] term people confuse it with CBD it's not but I always gave him a little bit of slack because they were one of the first maybe the first to navigate the CBD world when you couldn't say CBD for legal reasons on the bottle they started this made CBD products before sea but he was legal then they helped make CBD illegal gangsters only halfway joking about the gangster part what they did was incredible and pretty pretty gangster now their labels are all updated and specific which I like because that's what I look for at CBD examine calm honest labeling our lab testing found that they make a good full spectrum extract even really need me to tell you that they're famous for that they have research on their company the only complaint I have is that they are on the expensive side their $30 bottle that's a new price is about 13 cents per milligram of CBD 15 cents is average but average to me is expensive I'm cheap you know that but if you're willing to buy their more potent formulas you can get a great deal they're 60 milligrams formula goes down to four point six cents per milligram of CBD if you're willing to shell out 275 bucks yeah so I would say go big or don't go at all but you really can't put a price on a specific strain grown by one company that's helped more people than any other CBD company and by more people I mean that they are the largest CBD company with by far the most reviews quantity a positive reviews number for re botanicals this is the first brand to receive a USDA Organic cert it's small but the founder was also the founder of Nu Teva the giant hemp super food brand that people seem to really like our lab tests found that re botanicals makes a well rounded full spectrum extract their new prices are between seven cents and nine cents per milligram of CBD average is 15 cents so good well great value for organic B first USDA Organic I use their role on peppermint CBD oil a lot this one smells so damn good I'm cheap but that smell gets me every time I like it put it on your temples relax a little bit number three best pure CBD med Tara matera is one of the first CBD companies to win a mainstream retail contract you can find them in CVS yeah there's a yeah there's a theme here I like well-respected companies that have pushed the CBD movement forward mainstream in this case by the way they reduce the price of thirty five bucks it seems like all CBD companies are getting cheaper right now I need to update those prices I bought before because they're dropping especially in the last few months in light of a certain shutdown of the economy not sure how that makes CBD cheaper but it has met Tara is nice for people that don't want th see our lab tests found that this is just clean CBD oil nothing else not even CBD V just CBD and they don't make any THC products so this is good for anyone who can't have THC in their system and doesn't want the chance of the product that the product might get mixed up with a THC product or somebody might look at them differently for having a CBD product with THC this doesn't have it this is the one that I recommend to my firefighter friends that can't have THC or shouldn't if I was still a government employee this is what I would pick up and if you have a soul-sucking job where you also get tested for THC met Tara's great I have a full video on CBD and drug testing there's a caveat a bad test is still in use today but for the most part pure CB means that you'll have no problem with drug test that tests for THC their new price brings this down to six cents per milligram of CBD excellent I've tested some that are over thirty cents six cents is great pure CBD has no taste so this has no flavor no weird hemp flavor I like med Terra but if you do want THC look out for Lazarus number two cheapest CBD on earth Lazarus Naturals now in the Bible I didn't read it but I do have Wikipedia Lazarus died and Jesus brought him back to life so when I was deathly ill from a hangover I thought maybe using Lazarus I could come back to life I'm not gonna make medical claims or suggestions for hangovers but miraculously I did come back to life this also happens to be one of the most potent extracts that we've tested for THC so it could have been that by the way always look at the THC levels of the CBD you're getting two milligrams is a lot you will feel that and I cannot confirm that it will bring you back from the dead like it did for me but you may feel it a bit there full-spectrum CBD is so damn cheap I can't believe it when I tested it it was at four cents per milligram of CBD for their $32 bottle and they just updated their prices this month and it's now three cents they're stronger formula is at two cents per milligram it's so cheap it was already the cheapest now it's it's that they beat their own record it's the cheapest cheapest cheapest but please let me know if you found anything cheaper than this because I'd like to test that one out to our testing found that they were extremely accurate and it was one of the most potent full spectrums that we've tested with a lot of CBC and CPG as well now the only downside is that the flavor is also potent it's super earthy but just looking at the candle levels I would expect that they use a natural ethanol extraction process some people don't like that because it does keep the natural flavors ethanol alcohol goes away completely during the evaporation stage but you're also left with one of the most potent extracts possible of kin monoids so if you don't like the natural flavor of hemp this won't be for you but it is such a good deal they make pure sativa tea products as well and I'm testing a bunch of their new products so stay tuned for that number one best CBD company Bluebird botanicals I've been a fan of Bluebird for a long time I wrote about them in my book hemp for migraine best book ever by the way and I'm a very modest person and I wrote about them on CBD examined for a long time where I test products for transparency and accuracy this company pioneered transparency today most companies provide lab tests online a lot of companies provide inaccurate lab reports but that's beside the point Bluebird was one of the first to may be the first to show real lab tests for everything I've tested for of their products now a couple of multiple times I've got more tests on the way also and their lab results have been excellent my only complaint is that they don't make any flavored products no gummies and instead of lowering prices in this time desperation the prices actually went up by a couple dollars still cheap still great still the best company but I might need to rethink this number one spot because everyone else is lowering their prices and I'm super cheap Lazarus load their prices last week Bluebird I'd like to tell everyone you did to in an update next week it's not like my opinion matters it's not like people pay attention to the top video review on Google right now out of 3810 Bluebird review results there are full-spectrum extracts are well rounded and potent I've always compared them to Charlotte's Web but cheaper still cheaper so I can't really complain about the price that prices have always been great and everything about the CBD company is positive too many good things to list and I really like that they give massive discounts to disabled low-income and vets Lazarus does that too if I didn't mention that before bluebirds founder is also the vice-president of the u.s. hemp roundtable which led the political fight for hemp legalization this is just a solid company that has built a reputation over years pioneered CBD transparency and pushed for legalization they really are in a league of their own so there you have it my favorite CBD companies and this list is bound to change because I've already sent 50 more products to the lab subscribe so you don't miss out and I will see you next time", "xa6UDdQjBMw": "[Music] hey with Micah premier pet supply and we are talking about the CBD industry and my first question to you would be what is it so CBD is a compound that's found in the hemp and cannabis plants so it is got great medicinal value to it it's not marijuana it's not the THC that you find in marijuana which can lead people to becoming high so there's some controversy regarding that because people who feels like say you know what I don't want to take drugs that are gonna make me feel high or give my dog or cat drugs they're gonna make them high that's not the case at all in this this truly just has the medicinal value of that plant what are the most common questions you're getting most people are just unsure this one is education so CBD is stands for cannabidiol and that is this the easy term is CBD because it's hard to say that yeah yeah but it has great benefit yeah so in a tincture is probably one of the best ways to administer it because then you can definitely dose and make sure that you're giving the right amount based on the weight of your cat or dog but many ailments can be offset by using this anxiety being one of the most common even loss of appetite things you most commonly find with you know what it's related to but also it has some anti-cancer agents to it it actually definitely reduces tumors it's got tumor fighting agents CBD has got a great great benefit so the most important thing is if you're concerned about it it doesn't have the THC that you would find in marijuana absolutely not completely different correct right you're gonna get the benefit of the of the plant without getting the side effects because when I saw this package and I was like oh a debye it's that's kind of cool but I wasn't sure about it's a it's a play on words for sure but it's got the CBD in it and a treat form yeah and it makes it really easy because sometimes it's hard to administer an oil or a tincture because you have to really get it under the tongue in order to be effective that gets all it's really okay so trees might be easier for a dog like Zen who's a little finicky yeah absolutely and the thing to keep in mind is this stays in in the system for about 12 hours so administering it every 12 hours like a supplement is the best way to get the the effects that you would want we've helped so many people through providing this you know with dogs and cats that are in pain have HIPAA issues and just hard to move and very sick and ill and aren't eating at all what would be your message to someone who might be on the fence not sure if this is the way that they want to go what would you say to them do your research but I you know talk to someone who really knows what they're talking about I mean we have the experience in our stores and find a store that that has the great products make sure they're organic they're well sourced they're gonna be expensive that's something to keep in mind you don't want to cost save on products like this because it could be diluted and they could have other ingredients in there that aren't gonna be healthy for the dog so make sure it's pure and make sure you talk to an expert like Mike thank you thanks", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system

use daily for self-care but before gets onto our store shelves there is an extensive process that starts it in the growing fields News 5s Jessica barreto joining us live with more on that this morning Jessica free right now I'm at the fields at Veritas Farms where we're surrounded by about 38,000 hemp plants and I'm actually joined by the VP of agriculture here Spencer fuller Spencer talked to me about what we're seeing around us yep right here we are in the middle of our field agriculture this is where all of our hemp plants flower off they're gonna be here until about October when we begin the harvest process we put these out in May and we're expecting around 70,000 pounds of dried hemp plant yep in the greenhouse we saw the moms and over here we're seeing what the moms actually produced all their little babies so we do drip irrigation basically what that is is each little plant gets its own watering and we run that on a cycle through our own well here on on property and we're a 100% organic cultivation awesome and so you have some products on you can you talk to me about what these are yep right here we have our solve it's a cooling menthol it's really awesome super cooling obviously and our moisturizing lotion you can't go wrong with that as well as our orange cream lip balm you can find these in Kroger stores City Market King Soopers so how long does it take from us to see the plants here to them going inside those products it's gonna take us about six months to finish our process here before we hand it over to extraction okay awesome anything else you wanted to ask no I think just kind of enjoy the view Thank You Spencer appreciate it and actually industrial hemp was a federally legalized in 2018 with the passing of the farm bill so now you can find all these products online and inside retailers - always watching out for you Southern Colorado Jessica barreto used by", "W0qMN0aZEgE": "- Chances are, you've seen\na news story or a webinar or read a white paper on CBD and your patients may\nthink it's a compound that could maybe make them high since it does come from\nthe cannabis plant. But is this compound something\nthat might be really helpful in a myriad of cases? Well, here's what the science says. And if you wanna know more about CBD, make sure to like this\nvideo and comment below so you can become part\nof the conversation. (pleasant music) So, why only recently gaining\nattention in the media due to the Farm Bill\nbeing passed in late 2018 and subsequent changes in the\nlaw, the cultivation of hemp, just one variety of the cannabis plant, actually dates back thousands of years. Along with the increased media attention, we are now also seeing a\ngrowing body of research aimed at examining the effects of CBD, THC, and other phytocannabinoids in the treatment of\nseveral health conditions, and these include, but are not limited to, epilepsy, neuropathic and MS\npain, cancer, and anxiety. When it comes to this\npowerful plant medicine, although much more research\nis anticipated in the future, to this date, there's\nbeen limited publications. So, to further understand\nCBD and its therapeutic uses, let's first take a look at\nthe endocannabinoid system, also known as the ECS. The ECS is found within the central and peripheral nervous\nsystems where it functions as a neuromodulator and\nbiochemical communication system. It's made up of cannabinoid receptors, two of our own\nendocannabinoids, and enzymes. Our own endocannabinoids are actually lipids produced\nendogenously by the body and function as natural chemical\nmessengers by interacting with the two cannabinoid\nreceptors known as CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are found\nprimarily in the brain. They can also be found\nin the lungs, kidney, liver, bones, heart,\nand reproductive organs. And in contrast, CB2 receptors are found\nprimarily in the immune system, but also a little bit in the spleen, lungs, liver, bones, and muscle. So, what does the ECS and these cannabinoid receptors have to do with the CBD molecule? Well, in addition to our\nown endocannabinoids, there are two other types\nof cannabinoids that exist: phytocannabinoids found in\ncannabis and other plants and then, synthetic cannabinoids, which are manufactured in a laboratory. The cannabis plant actually contains over 100 different phytocannabinoids, and these of course include CBD and THC. These are the two most\nknown phytocannabinoids. And while both of them can\nhave effects on the body and the endocannabinoid system, it's important to understand\nthat it's only the THC that possesses the\npsychoactive properties. So, phytocannabinoids mimic\nthe activity and the actions of our own endocannabinoids within the endocannabinoid\nsystem, and for this reason, it is believed that\nphytocannabinoids can help improve the function or tone of the\nECS and regulate body functions and help to maintain homeostasis. And it's important to note\nthat CBD extracts differ from full-spectrum hemp products. Full-spectrum hemp\nproducts contain CBD, THC, and several of the other cannabinoids, while the CBD products are made by isolating the CBD content\nfrom the cannabis plant, removing the THC and other cannabinoids. And it's also important to note that hemp-derived products\ncontain less than 0.3% THC unless they're isolated CBD extracts. And full-spectrum hemp extracts which are typically standardized to a specific quantity of CBD also contain a combination of\nthe other phytocannabinoids. So, research is now pointing\nto the superior benefits of using full-spectrum products\ndue to the entourage effect, which is when the variety of phytocannabinoids acts synergistically to illicit a therapeutic benefit. So, you've decided to recommend CBD and now you're wondering where\nto find a trusted source.

(pleasant music)", "jZlNFMdFMr0": "CBD does it work better if it's applied\ntopically or if you ingest it which works better\nfor your body and your skin stay tuned that's what we'll be talking\nabout so when we did our video 2020 top beauty trends CBD and\nskin care was a very popular one and based on\nviewer feedback we're going to do another one we're doing a series\nso we need to understand in order to uh start to cover this topic both topically\nand how it works in when we ingest it how the cbd\naffects our endocannabinoid system so the ecs otherwise known as the\nendocannabinoid system helps regulate and keeps our body\nfunctioning at a normal level keeping everything at a homeostasis and\nthat includes everything from our mood stability our appetite control\nhow we metabolize our food our body temperature\neven fertility it controls our pre and postnatal almost everything\nin our body so it's just going to get a tad\nbit scientific here but basically the endocannabinoid system is\nmade up of these lipo lipid based endogenous not andogenous endogenous\nlipid-based neurotransmitters that attach\nto these uh cannabinoid receptors called cbrs now follow me here\nthese are the cameras here i've never done that i'm getting loopy\nthe camera's here that's the light like follow the lights\num christy hello now these are retrograde\ntransmitters so just follow me here so normally what happens is when\na message is being sent it's sent out from the nucleus of the cell and it goes\nout but retrograde basically means that the messages are going into the nucleus\nof the cell cb1 receptors are mostly found\nin the brain and the nervous system around the spinal cord\ncb2 are mainly found in the peripheral nervous system which basically means\neverything but the brain and the spinal cord so\nthese phytocannabinoids or plant-based\ncannabinoids both react with both types of these\nreceptors both cannabinoid receptors and\nnon-cannabinoid receptors so cbd actually can have an indirect and\ndirect effect on these receptors so for example\nif it is done it also has an effect with\ndopamine receptors as well as with the cb2 receptors and if it is\nthat is actually only effect when it is done through\nenzyme interaction so one of the reasons that\ncbd has a good result with so many different ailments is because it\nhas the ability to interact with so many different types\nof receptors so here are some of the pros and cons of\ningesting cbd so one is it can take up to 60 minutes for it to\nstart to take effect however the the pro of that is is\nthat it can last up to six hours after\ningestion another possible con is it may be\ndifficult to measure how much you actually\nneed because by the time you ingest it and then your liver breaks it down\nevery step that it's broken down the level of\npotency can decrease and how different people interact with the cbd\nobviously is going to be different as well another option would be\nsublingual cbd and basically what this is is it\ncomes in the form of liquids or dissolvable strips or\ngels and you can put them underneath your tongue and so what happens is it\ngets absorbed by the mucous membranes so it's a lot faster and it can be\nprocessed within 20 to 30 minutes that you would start feeling the effects\nusually it would be for pain so for those of you who are\nneeding a much quicker result from for pain relief\nthen this may be another option for you because this bypasses the whole\ndigestion process all together and goes right into the\nbloodstream being absorbed by the mucous membrane\nthese mainly can come from vegetable-based glycerin\noil or a medium chain triglyceride such as coconut oil\nas well as alcohol so this can be used for mood stabilizer\nreducing inflammation and pain management\nso now we're going to be moving on to cbd\ntopically so i do have to preface this with studies are constantly being done\nand results are being shown when treating acne inflammation when\nregards to skin including eczema and psoriasis\nso if you scroll past the part where i started explaining between the cb1\nreceptors and cb2 receptors you may want to go back just to hear the explanation\nso the skin is actually covered with cb2 receptors so this is how cbd can\nactually work indirectly with the receptors it doesn't have to be\naffected systemically in order to affect one area so you can\nactually take the cbd product and put it on that\nspecific area of eczema or psoriasis or some afflicted\narea so cbd actually has been shown to decrease the skin cell production\nwhen it comes to psoriasis because psoriasis is basically an overproduction\nof these epithelial cells and but on the opposite end of it it\nactually decreases lipid production in the sebocytes and\nthose are basically cells that produce the lipids that can\nthat basically leads to or can lead to more\nacne so it has like opposite beneficial effects both for psoriasis on one hand\nand then all the way on the other hand for acne so cbd\nis lipophilic meaning oil loving so i refer to the term\nhydrophilic which means water loving for hyaluronic acid\ncbd is actually actually lipophilic it actually\nloves oil so it actually works well with oil based skin care and hair care\nso cosmetic skincare ingredients typically have\nanywhere between 50 milligrams to 250 milligrams\nof cbd in the product clinical skin care products\ncan have up to several hundred milligrams of cbd to\nseveral thousand milligrams of cbd now there\nare water soluble forms of cbd but like vitamin c as you start to add\noil the potency of the product will start to\nbe diluted so stay tuned for next week when we talk\nsome when we talk about the different types of cbd\nin different products and what to look for because remember\nmakeup is an art and skincare is a science thanks for watching", "661GELCg6o8": "it's mad at Raphael studios and woke up to counter basics today we're gonna make CBD oil using a rosin press now we're using the my press portable rosin press today they're also a sponsor of Raphael studios if you use the code roughhouse at my rosin press calm you'll get an exclusive discount and also you'll be helping to support Rafal studios here's what you'll need to do this you would need a rosin press of course and you'll need some high CBD hemp we'll talk more about that in a second you need some parchment paper a pollen press a cold pack that you'll want to freeze in advance you need a scraper tool we use that to scrape up the oil at the end and also a scale now when it comes to the materials what you want is to probably get hemp the hip is high CBD in this case it is 16.7 6% which is really high in CBD and it has a 0.23% of THC very lows to eat THC so this would be good for our purposes the first step is going to be to preheat the press we're going to use a pretty high temperature of 220 degrees Fahrenheit that's higher than I would normally use for cannabis for this experiment today we're going to be pressing 2 grand pressing and then a 1 gram pressing so first you'll want to weigh out your head and then you will put it into the pollen press and then you add in the weights and then some pollen presses have a little t-bar this is just a simple screw together on both sides but you screw together really tightly as tightly as you can and then when you press it out you have a nice concise puck that'll press a lot more efficiently now you want to take that puck and you want to place it in your parchment paper I would recommend using 2 layers I'm only using one in this demonstration but that's not how I know you need probably to use 2 because it can bleed through because it's a real hot temperature and then once you have your puck centered in the parchment we're going to now place it in the press and you're also going to Center it and depress and now we're going to what I call a pre press and then over the next say 30 to maybe 45 seconds we're going to be slowly lowering the lever adding a little bit more pressure every few seconds and not to a fully press it yet but just this is to allow the heat to distribute through so for about 30 seconds we're going to pre press and let that heat fill all the way through from top to bottom on that after the 30 seconds or 45 seconds you're going to finally close down the lever and give it a full press after about 30 seconds or so of that you'll start to see the hemp oil protruding it from around the edges and it'll bubble and run and you'll want to leave this on full press for one to two minutes because we're using a high temperature you don't want to go too long because you don't want to burn off all your terpenes but it is more tolerant than cannabis is and you can see we got a really good yield there so the next step is the cooling step and normally I would have not opened it up and removed the puck to show the camera like I did a second ago I would have taken it directly from the press and put it right until they folded over a compressed bag like you see there and let it chill for about one minute and what that will do is to slow down the heating process and to preserve our curve beans in our flavor profile the next step is to scrape it off and collect it I find doing that with the compress as a backing to the paper makes it a lot easier to remove the oil and you see I garnered about 11 percent yield on that first pressing with the 2 grams then I pressed a 1 gram pressing of the same hip and I can see now I did I have that less of a yield but with one grandma have a better percentage of a yield and in fact on that one I got just at 17% yield a really great deal so it's really happy with the way that my press did it pressing the CBDs if you'd like to purchase one please check out my rosin press calm be sure to use the co roughhouse for that exclusive discount hope you enjoyed this video on how to press CBD oils with the rosin press if you did

its first public hearing on cannabis and cannabis derived compounds and as silly X 18s Mike Valenti explains industry insiders are pushing for some guardrails for action that's the big story at 5:30 [Music] the CBD craze got a major boost in 2018 after President Donald Trump signed the farm bill removing hemp from the controlled substance list CBD based products flooded the market despite the fact that the FDA hadn't implemented any regulations that has left the industry in a state of flux it's really hampering small businesses it's really getting in the way of business that we've been doing since 2014 Adrienne Pauline ACK is the owner and executive director of bluegrass hemp oil her business and thousands of others like it have had to suspend online sales merchant processors severed their ties with CBD companies due to a lack of regulations and heightened uncertainty in the industry there's probably some leonis around the business just around who's getting into the business now and there were reasons why they're getting into the business so there's definitely some need for overall regulation with regards to the product the use of CBD as an ingredient in supplements has sparked many questions about the compound safety and officials at the FDA have expressed skepticism about its medicinal value the hearing today marks a first step in addressing those outstanding questions in Lexington Mike Valenti lex18 news", "N_ygi8eLzZQ": "hi and welcome to the CBD oil source your leading source for CBD hemp oil supplements I'm Alex and today we're going to be talking about the Scimitar line of CBD infused beauty products now each of these products is infused with CBD hello they are all-natural with no artificial ingredients and never tested on animals the last project we're going to be going over is d hemp solve the colours of dark green and it feels really thick once you apply it it's an intense moisturizer that is perfect for really dry areas such as elbows knees and other joints I'm Alex from the CBD oil source at WWWE do else or calm for more products and information and have a great day thank you for watching", "BxgS-rYe3CY": "hello how are you doing today perfect and how may I help you I think I have the very thing you're looking for what kind of CBD product we have a lot here this is a CBD only dispensary oh you had a car accident and how's your back well I am sorry to hear that um thankfully I think we have the thing that will help you out I would recommend to you a tropical South yes I think that it would work best for you you just apply it to the skin you rub it on smooth it over and it should alleviate some muscle pain that you're experiencing it's an anti-inflammatory CBD is and there is different types that you can get and by the way these are frog song farm items and I have been buying from them for a very long time it is a small family farm located in Oregon um near Woodburn and it is just really great they produce and extract their own hemp and CBD and I recommend you giving these products a try what do you think perfect so and they are free of pesticides which is wonderful so the first product I have here is a tropical South that contains 500 milligrams of CBD this might be a bit strong for you considering that you're not someone who uses CBD very often there is mild side effects if you just take a lot of CBD um it could include drowsiness or a dry mouth a little blood pressure but nothing it's quite uncommon and it's also very mild so just so you know in advance okay so I would recommend this cell for you but instead of the 500 milligram we have a 250 milligram and there's Xie butter inside of this coconut oil Aragon oil sweet almond oil beeswax activation time is 5 minutes oh yes yes um CBD is fine to be used on that so you just have to be aware of the proper dosage and be aware of the weight of your pet so do you have to definitely take that into consideration before applying for the intake yes that is a very common question to non-intoxicating the anti-inflammatory antioxidant rich and supportive plant base so those are important things to keep noted before try I mean it may help with sleep conditions anxiety arthritis neurological health definitely worth a try again I would recommend the 250 for you what do you want to do is take a little bit you don't have to take too much because this is very rich in essential oils comments you just really need a little bit it's actually I might have put a little too much there put some back when you rub on like this we're ever needed yes CVT is legal um it was federally legalized in 2018 but it was partially legal in 2014 so another factory that's why it's such a big thing recently as you can see going to store such as new seasons old foods yeah it's a very common it is the next big thing would you like to try some okay yeah here you go give it a go and let me know what you think okay activation time is five minutes so you will feel it in no time there you go excellent okay so another item that I would love to recommend to you is a tincture it is designed to be held under the tongue before swallowing it's just more effective that way however if the consistency or taste is unbearable you can just put some in your food or drink or whatever you wish to do and yeah that's perfectly fine as well and this is the 750 milligrams CBD so this one's a very potent for your situation and socially being someone who's new to CBD I might recommend the lower dose so there's another tincture that has the last CBD unit and I think that one would work perfectly for you yes so yes it is he concluded free so what you do is you shake this and you fill the dropper you can fill it to the point 75 line and I mean you couldn't really use unless on this if you want you know that's perfectly fine I usually use like this much at the point 5 or the 0.25 and you know just use a little bit do you work in real time I think that tinctures really really do a great job when it comes to insomnia or anxiety I think that it does a wonderful job tackling that problem only said something but I've experienced um I like to take some before I go to sleep I think for your condition and the back pain I would recommend a cell for you there's also one other product that I want to show you it is a new product that just came out it is called - the body balm ultra and it is a different consistency from the south is it dries faster and it has a less greasy ER feel compared to the south and it has a little bit of a scent so if you're someone who isn't a big fan of sense roller to get a sense I would maybe recommend itself and really do that's which you prefer so have some of this tincture if you'd like I'm just gonna set it right over here and the next item here which I mentioned earlier activation time is five minutes this also has 500 milligrams of CBD if the two selves they're called a rabbit um the first one that I showed is 500 milligrams of CBD and the second one has 250 those are the two options you have and I'm the tincture again I have the seven so this one might be a little strong for you right now but I think you can start with the 250 rugged and I think after that this might work really well for you since this is less greasy and it dries a lot faster okay as you can see over here it's it's more liquidy there's more watery type of substance consistency what it does smell really nice it's not too strong you know it's it's much lighter than a perfume it's like a natural essential oil kind of smell which I can handle being someone who is quite sensitive to scents and perfumes and clothes and such so yes that one is pretty great again it's a new items so definitely check it out I'm gonna place this right here give it a little give it a go and yeah do you have any other questions okay perfect and which one would you like to purchase today excellent okay so I will put that in a bag I'm glad you decided to go with me nothing 250 so I think sure I think that you made a great decision yeah do you have to let me know helps me I like to rub this on my tummy from time to time it really helps with my cramps cramping pains are just pains and shadow makes it a lot more manageable and I hope that this really uses up the pain in your back yeah just gonna put some on right now if you want back there I notice you have been putting them on your hands so it only takes five minutes again that's pretty fast and the tincture is pretty fast as well just remember to shake it and put it underneath your tongue or if not you're putting food or um the drink yeah probably a drink like juice yes okay well there you are um I hope you have a lovely day and I will see you next time yes let me know what you think of the Frog song farm products I think that they're fabulous fantastic and they've just really helped me so I hope that they help you too okay goodbye", "9Ws1nGul3_c": "hold on the gardener here in this video I'm going to show you how to make a comfrey sale I'm going to show you how I make a comfrey cell using comfrey olive oil and beeswax but before I get into that I want to extend a very special thank you to Pamela at Garden garden novice farm on her help in helping me and figuring out how to do this also want to give you a word of caution here do not apply this kind of a salve to an open cut wound because it will cause the wound to heal over on top before it has healed from deep within as a cut wound should heal and once it has caused you to heal over on top it could trap inflammation in deep in that wound which would then of course be a problem for you so don't apply it apply it to an open cut wound all right let's get busy making this out first we gotta go pick some countries and then we have to dehydrate it the nice dark color of green that you see that these leaves indicates that I did not dehydrate it at a high temperature dehydrating at a higher temperature could destroy the beneficial properties of the comfrey and it will definitely make a leaves turn dark brown so once you have them dehydrated and all you have to do is take your hands and rub them together with comfrey and the small particles will fall out now we have our dried comfrey let's move on to the next step so here we have our one cup of dry hump relief and now we want to and a half cups of good olive oil I'm going to use a crock-pot to infuse the country into the oil I'm going to not put the lid on so that will help to keep the temperature a little bit lower you now it's the time to get your jars or containers whatever you're going to use ready Here I am using four ounce jelly jars to melt the beeswax I'm going to use my instant pot as you would a steam double boiler my beeswax came in one ounce sticks so I have given a rough cut you it doesn't take very long with the steam on the bottom of the top to start melting the beeswax now I guess one point I ought to make this is not the stainless steel pot that goes in your instant pot this is another bowl that I will use only for making comfrey infusions okay now our bees wax is melted it's time to add our oil olive oil which has been infused with the comfrey if you want to add this olive oil all the beeswax is still warm so you can get a good mixture I'm going to add 800 I use a vitamin e and this will help as a preservative for our country sale the vitamin E is a little gel cap so punch a hole in one end of it and squeeze the contents out into our oil and beeswax mixture now we're ready to pour our country sail up into our jars make sure to let it cool overnight before you put a lid on it next day there it is come free South that's all there is to it now you know how to do it be sure to mark your leads with the date that you made this it should stay good for about six months you", "YRTEx_lcNOI": "today I'm going to teach you how to make your own herbal home scent infused oils you'll need these to make salves and some other soaps and products on your homestead today we're going to go over the infused oils and then I'm going to show you how to make your own healing salve [Music] you so salve ourselves however you say it depends on where you're from but today we're going to go over and paste oils and fast assisted in the beginning and this is a really really easy task something that any homesteader can begin with if you're wanting to get into herbalism this might be the best place for you to begin with making products now I know making products with herbs can be a little bit intimidating but it doesn't have to be so in past videos we've gone over how to make tinctures or salve not fast but infused oils there's a couple different ways to make infused oils but before you can make a fab you to make an infused oil most of the time now there are some stats that we make better just use strictly with essential oils and that's okay you don't have to worry about making and infused oil at that point you just buy the essential oil but today we're actually using calendula chamomile and arnica oil we don't have those in essential oils we have them in infused oils so there are a couple different ways for you to make the infused oil before you make your sad the most commonly popular way that you're going to find online is to fill your jar up with one part herb and five parts oil I just use olive oil you can use fractioned coconut oil grapeseed oil whichever you prefer but I prefer to use olive oil just because it's readily available at all times and so you're going to weigh it out for a one-ounce herb to 5 ounces of oil now this is calendula you can see that the oil does not cover the entire st. part of calendula but you're going to fill your jar up you're going to shake it really well and that's going to sit in a sunny area for about 4 weeks that's just ensure that you get all the best attraction from the oil that's the hard way or the long way to make an infused oil the next way to make an infused oil is to actually put the oil in your oven so what you do is you would set your oven to 300 degrees measure out your herb and your oil and a jar and a glass jar just like this and once your temperature has reached an or degrees you turn your oven off put your jar into the oven to set for two to three hours you're not going to bake or cook the herb you're just wanting the heat to heat up the urban extract it the final way to make an infused oil is to do your same ratio a 1 to 5 ratio 1 ounce or 5 ounces of oil and to put it in a double boiler on your stovetop that takes about 30 minutes to an hour just depending on your herb and how hot it is in your oven so that's the next bit of making the Z's a little 3 easy very easy ways one more time consuming than the other I definitely up for the oven option I actually have herbs in the oven right now that I will show you I've extracted chamomile and arnica this is calendula that I actually had extracting for four weeks in my bathroom cabinet medicine cabinet which gets a lot of sunlight sometimes so I want to put that in there so I'm going to get started and we're going to make a homestead SAP I've gotten my herbs out of the oven this is the kimono oh my gosh chamomile is my favorite herb to extract and oil it smells on - I could eat it now your oils are going to be strained I'm going to go ahead and strain it through a mesh strainer but sometimes for certain herbs they can actually there can slip through the strainer but I'm going to go ahead and try the strainer first and you're going to need to go ahead and separate them into separate jars because I'm actually going to be using these probably more than one time you're just going to go ahead and push down and get all of that oil out now there is some of the flower head that's coming through and that's okay but I may want to go ahead and put it through a mesh towel just one more time just to make sure we get all of that out wisdom soon the the [Music] straining the oil's is probably one of the messiest jobs you have during this entire process so you're going to get dirty make sure you wash your hands after each straining of each oil that way you don't have any contamination and the oil isn't soaking into your skin for a really long time so now that you've made and strained your infused oils now you're going to want to make a salve or some kind of product with them today we're show you how to make a SAP now it's best if you go ahead and do your fu stove ahead of times once you make your infused oil you can actually keep it on the shelf for about a year so you can make it way in advance and then use it when you need it now I'm probably going to have some that will lift so I'll just keep it in the pantry and I'm out of sunlight and it will stay good for a year now your next step with making this app your friend is going to be your kitchen scale you're going to need to measure out your oils because you want to know how much exactly you're putting in to your salve you're going to have your infused oils your beeswax and then you're also going to add you can add essential oils or things like that but today we're just using the empties oils and v-flex so I'm going to show you how to do that alright so with this nifty kitchen skill if you go ahead and put your jar on first it's actually going to measure out the tear for you this is the ocre scale it's really good great love it so just going to hit the on button it's going to calculate the weight for you and it's going to start at zero so for starters I need 2 ounces of calendula oil one and a half ounces of arnica one ounce of chamomile so I'm going to go ahead and measure that all out [Music] I thought it had Mexican ate it all sick bounces even so I put in just roughly one and a half ounces of the beeswax give or take you can add more place the recipe to what you like now we're going to take this and set it and make a makeshift double boiler and melt it all down now I've got a saucepan here that's heating up it's on a medium heat you don't want to be boiling but you do want it to be hot water I'm going to go ahead and set my jar down in there the reason that we put the water in there so that we're not scorching the oil or the herb I'm just going to let it sit there for a few minutes as the water heats up and then I'm going to kind of come in and start really good once it's completely stirred and combined then we're going to go ahead and put it in our little tins and it'll dry and be done all right all you got is melted now we need for a medium your 10 [Music] Oh [Music] and just like that you have your very own SAP and this particular side with the Colangelo arnica and chamomile we use specifically for boo-boos and bruises to heal was if you've had a cut or scrape this is great for that this is also great healing for sore muscles it helps relax the body and it's just a really great faff to hat but here's what it ends up looking like and it's just really great to have here's what it looks like you just rub it like this and put it on you're done so there's your basic fab recipe for the day I encourage you to make it make your infused oils make your staff they do really really well they hold up well the last about a year in your medicine cabinet or pantry and that was really good too so

upfront this is not a sponsored video so there's not going to be any discount codes or anything of that nature throughout this video however the company that I will be talking about did send me some product to try out for free but I'm not letting that influence what I'm about to say you see a lot of these CBD videos that get put out there and people are paid so they're more influenced to say certain things to make the product seem a little bit more promising than what it may be so just want to make you guys aware of that now let's start the video well so now guys welcome to a brand new video thank you for stopping by I really do appreciate it as always so the topic at hand CBD oil you've seen a ton of this on social media I'm sure of it everybody proclaiming that it is the number one care to literally everything under the Sun from anxiety to inflammation joint pain migraines anything can be cured with a few drops of CBD oil but is this actually the truth a company called herb strong and I'm sure you've heard of them before they contacted me about four or five weeks ago asking me if I'd like to try out one of their products for free and me being the curious person that I am I just wanted to see what the hype was all about and I did my research on it so that I wouldn't get tested positive in a drug test which I will touch on later so they decided to send me their $65 bottle of 1000 milligram full-spectrum hemp oil and if you want to see how I reacted to it what my thoughts are on it then you can just go to this time stamp right here but first I think we have to talk about what CBD actually is CBD otherwise known as cannabidiol is actually one of over 100 different chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are exclusive to the cannabis plant now the really cool thing about the human body is that we actually have a couple of receptors known as cb1 and cb2 that are cannabinoid receptors now the cb1 receptors are responsible for psychoactive effects so when you consume something that has a strong affinity for this receptor and makes it active such as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol otherwise known as THC you're going to experience things that come with being high impaired movement impaired vision you might forget a few things anything comes up being high it's because of the cb1 receptors being active now the cv 2 receptors are actually found in the immune system and these are meant to actually help the human body which is why you see these CBD oil companies proclaiming that they're going to help things like anxiety migraines inflammation joint pain that's because CBD actually has a strong affinity for the cb2 receptors and when active they're supposedly supposed to help with all these things now is this stuff legal to purchase yes and no it really does all depend because boom people hear the word cannabis they instantly freak out it is 100% legal I'm going to stay away from it with a 50-foot pole however it really all depends from a technical standpoint as long as somebody contains 0.3% or less THC then it is perfectly legal to purchase however anything over that threshold is obviously illegal that's why you see things such as hemp powder being sold in grocery stores because it really doesn't contain any THC now this does not mean that it's not going to show up on a drug test like I did say before 0.3% or less if it contains 0.2% if there's a chance that it's going to show up on a drug test so just make sure you are doing a research before purchasing anything CBD related now the company herb strong they did send me some product and I like I said before I did my research before even saying yes to the free products just to make sure that it didn't contain any THC and I took a look at their lab report and I took a look at the left hand bottom of the report and it said that it did not contain any detectable amounts of THC so as I said before if you plan on purchasing something just make sure that you do some research on whatever company it is and make sure that there's no detectable THC in their products because this is a powered looking Channel and I do compete in the USA PL which is an IPF affiliate let's talk about wada for a second or the world anti-doping agency let me take a look at their banned substances list and you're going to see that cannabinoids are actually on their banned list however they do make an exception for cannabidiol which as I did mention before is CBD but as I did mention if your product that you are consuming does contain traceable amounts of THC then you are going to test positive for drugs in your system so as I keep harping on make sure you do your research on any of these products that are CBD related now that we have all that sciency stuff out of the way let's talk about my experience with CBD oil now again I do compete and tested Federation didn't want to take anything that would end up biting me in the ass for lack of better terms which is why I gave the okay to Armstrong to send me out some of their stuff because from what they said it doesn't contain any traceable amounts of THC now I don't suffer from anxiety or migraines multiple sclerosis anything of that nature all I really do suffer from is some joint pains and some inflammation maybe my sleep quality could have improved a little bit but really nothing on the mental health side of things more so just actual physical pains that I do suffer from so I was hoping by taking this product it would help out with those pains a little bit so I followed the instructions for about a week five drops underneath the tongue both in the morning and at night so it's ten drops a day on an empty stomach and after the first week really didn't experience anything at all took a little bit the email one more time and said to give it a couple of weeks so I gave it another seven days same thing five drops in the morning and at night ten drops a day 140 drops over a span of two weeks and the only really noticeable thing that happened was that my sleep quality did improve a little bit my joint pains were still there inflammation was still there nothing had really gone away now I was giving it one more week but I actually increased the dosage this time to eight drops in the morning and at night so it's sixteen drops a day for another week and again no inflammation or joint pains ended up going away which what I was a little bit disheartened by because you see all these posts on social media and they claim that it is the magic elixir that's going to help out with all of your pains and this isn't something that I did experience so I am a little bit disappointed with that so this really isn't a product that I'm going to be using in the future I actually ended up giving the remaining of the remainder of the bottle to someone at work that does suffer from anxiety and hopefully it does help them out a little bit more than I did help me but I just want I just wanted to put out this video to spread a little bit of truth when it does come to the use of these products just make sure that you are doing your research on all this stuff because you really don't want to be wasting $6,500 on something that's potentially not going to work now going back to the whole sleep quality thing can I take this to improve my sleep quality sure am I going to know because I think there's better ways to improve overall sleep quality such as getting some blackout curtains to make sure that it's pitch-black in your room regulating your room temperature so you're always sleeping in the same temperature every single night and just getting more hours of sleep if you like you could improve your sleep quality for a set price of maybe like fifty bucks instead of always spending sixty five dollars a month which can really add up over time and end up being a waste of money if you could do it in a much cheaper fashion so yeah that was pretty much my experience with CBD maybe it just didn't work out for me I'm not sure but I really don't see myself using this product in the future and just be weary of other people that are saying that it's curing everything that is wrong with them because I for one didn't experiences I did a post on Reddit and other people were saying that they experienced pretty much the same thing that I did with CBD oil where their inflammation and joint pain really didn't go away there were some people that did say that it did help out with our migraines but again I don't suffer from those so I can't really speak on those so to say so yeah that's my experience with CBD oil hope you don't hate me for it if you did enjoy the video or you just feel it does deserve one please be sure to drop in to thumbs up because

[Music] [Applause] so today I'm going to be talking about one of my favorite things and that's educational skincare facts and we don't smoke weed every day just kidding I'm going to be talking about CBD oil what it is if it's even legal why isn't skincare all that kind of [ __ ] if you've been in touch with the skincare community at all lately you will see that CBD oil in products is huge right now everyone seems to be jumping on the bandwagon of CBD oil and I kind of want it so you know break it down to you guys tell you what it is what it does for the skin if it's even [ __ ] legal so what is CBD oil CBD oil stands for cannabidiol oil I I think that's how you pronounce it but honestly if you've watched my videos before you know that I can suck at pronunciation so we're just we're just gonna go with that a lot of companies have been coming out with CBD oil in their products like heels than their cannabis oil Peter Thomas Roth and their cannabis serum and mass milk makeup and their cannabis infused mascara all different kinds of products and for me when I saw these products I'm like yeah you know like 420 but like what why is it in this stuff like why so after doing a lot of research into like such confusing realms of science that my brain was not made to understand I'm going to try to break this down as simply as possible so that it's you know not boring as [ __ ] and it could be somewhat informative to you guys now I know for me when I started learning about CBD url I was like wait isn't this the same thing as like hemp and like what's the difference and I came to find out that there's a huge difference so let me first explain the difference between CBD and hemp so basically CBD is a can avoid what is a can't avoid a can't avoid is something that our body naturally creates to help regulate our sleep patterns our mental patterns our skin digestion and even our memory now cannabinoids or CBD can also be found in cannabis plants and although this is kind of a different form from the kinds our body creates when we ingest it or apply it topically we can see a plethora of really good benefits for our skin from studies they found that cannabinoids are really rich in vitamin A C and E which if you don't know what those vitamins are they're really good for anti aging abilities soothing redness getting rid of sun damage basically everything that we you know like what in our skin and even better than that a few studies have shown that there are very little risks when it comes to applying CBD oil topically to the skin now what is hemp hemp is a different ingredient that's also sourced from the cannabis plant but in a different way and I'm not going to go through all the scientific like processes of how that's done because when I was reading about it my eyes like starting to glaze over and I felt like I was actually high while reading it because that stuff is so confusing but and basically has different purposes than that it balances oil production within the skin it Sue's redness and inflammation and it treats atopic dermatitis does this still have good skincare benefits absolutely but they're a little different from CBD oil and the way that I would describe it is that CBD oil is much more concentrated and has many more benefits than hemp oil now to be clear CBD oil is not marijuana okay so you can't like figure out a way to roll this oil in a blunt just being honest although that's an expensive way to smoke some weed I am already watching this video be coming to monetize it's super confusing but basically CBD oil is extracted from hemp another strain of the cannabis plant if you can interpret that I will give you this YouTube videos monetary earnings which are nothing now the big question is CBD oil even legal to have in skincare and honestly the answer is a bit confusing my eyes are so red it's almost like I've been smoking which I haven't been no I haven't been it's the [ __ ] light they're too bright so up until a few months ago CBD oil was technically classified as legal due to like anti medical marijuana laws in a lot of states why was it illegal well it was kind of complicated because hemp oil was legalized but THC was not legalized and CBD oil kind of falls right in the middle because it's extracted from hemp but it also has THC qualities for the skin now the good thing is that a few months ago Trump yes I am actually talking positively about Trump on my channel Buddha thought Donald Trump have made hemp oil legal in all 50 states and the exact words were feds have removed all restrictions on the sale transport or possession of hemp derived products produced in a manner consistent with the law now just this legalized marijuana or a little like THC no but it did present an opportunity for companies to have easier access to putting CBD oil in their products and once this happened everyone can jumped on the bandwagon so overall yes CBD oil at this point is pretty much legal you're not gonna see a lot of legal restrictions because of the legalization of hemp oil so much politics oh my gosh anyway moving on from the politics when it comes to CBD oil and hemp oil there are a lot of like fact versus fiction you know confusion that's there while certain studies have proved the benefits of CBD oil it is such a new thing to the industry and because marijuana was a long time considered like an illegal substance that couldn't be consumed not many studies were done on the potential benefits of the drug itself not drug plant now CBD oil hasn't been approved by the FDA which FDA does not mean everything but it's pretty much the most comprehensive way of proving whether or not including it is safe for us or not so because so few studies have been conducted it's really difficult to like fully trust companies on what they say CBD oil can do for a long time it's been praised as like the [ __ ] like miracle plant of all plants which you know I'm all for it but like jeez some people are going like all out now the benefits that I was speaking of before with CBD oil have been proven in studies but there's a lot of other benefits that companies will claim CBD oil has which aren't technically like a hundred percent proven so when it comes to purchasing CBD oil I would be cautious I think it's good to like try new things and see what works for your skin but also like don't put a hundred percent of your belief into it because we still don't know a lot about the ingredient it's good to be cautious when it comes to skin I hope this is all making sense because honestly when I was learning about all of this I was confused though yeah now for my favorite part my favorite CBD oil products that I have found on the market no I will say because a lot of these products are so brand new I haven't had the opportunity to try them out on my face but judging from the ingredient list and the powerful ingredients that have been included in these products I can kind of tell which ones that I would want to use and which ones I wouldn't want to use but I'm just gonna be going through my favorites in this video because possibly it's gonna be only no negativity needed now my personal favorite products would have to be the herbivore this which well the herbivore emerald oil now the reason is is because this includes a high concentration of CBD oil but it also has beneficial ingredients like ashwagandha which is a mushroom that helps like calm down your skin Wow we are on weed and mushrooms in this video oh my God look at where we're coming as a society and other abductions or mushrooms to help soothe the skin and calm skin down as well as really powerful antioxidant oils I think this part is just such a great example of what powerful soothing ingredients you can put in one single oil for the face in addition to that I am loving the Peter Thomas Roth cannabis oil that they recently just came out with I think that one has great ingredients and I really love that it doesn't have fragrance and just a strong concentration of cannabinoids in the product as more and more products come out I will be sure to do reviews and see what I think of them but for now from what I'm seeing those are my top two favorites as a final stay for all of this I think CBD oil has some potentially great beneficial aspects for the skin and I think it's a good idea to try some out and see how your skin responds to it but I also think it's a good idea to not believe everything that you hear about it to take as much caution for CBD oil products as you would for any other skin care product and just to you know try things out safely anyway that's all I have for this video if you guys liked it please leave a comment down below so that you can share your thoughts on CBD oil and you could win the giveaway if you haven't already be sure to subscribe to my channel and hit the notification bell so that you can see my videos every single week and I can't wait to see you guys in the next one [Music]", "tjZ-qDLeid0": "welcome back to another edition of our cannabis vlog series with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be discussing a topic that i've been thinking about quite a bit this week and that is hemp flour versus cbd extract so there's been a lot of products that have emerged recently on the market that i believe are to cater for cannabis consumers people like myself who enjoy the consumption experience now have a bit of a choice when it comes to getting our cbd that moves away from the traditional oils bombs and other topicals right i've actually got an example of both here this is hemp flower you can find this online you can find it in several shops in the uk and this is what it looks like and then this is cbd extract the example i've got here is the goods lemon drop cbd shatter which is 99 cannabidiol today i'm going to discuss the pros and cons of cbd flour okay hemp flour and cbd extract aka cbd dabs just to try and figure out which suits who you know like what is going to make this suitable for you or this suitable for you let's discuss that right here so flower pros when it comes to hemp flour you can roll this up and smoke it with your regular weed you can also roll it up in place of your regular weed you can put it into a vaporizer and all of those things make it seem very natural to cannabis consumers so for people that are already smoking weed regularly then adding cbd weed into your diet your your cannabinoid consumption isn't going to present any challenges or really feel any different you'll notice a difference in flavor indeed there are different flavor profiles in the hemp world as well but typically you may notice that it is less flavoursome than your high thc strains um but you will be able to naturally gel with it as a weed product right just looks the same there are different hemp strains with different cannabidiol content so there is actually stuff out there that will suit you as a newer consumer or someone that needs a lot of cbd for their medical conditions so you can get cbd flower up to about 20 cbd i think i've seen and this overall means that it is a really natural feeling product right so really easy to transition or to add it into our existing consumption cbd extract on the other hand really really cool to get the dosage requirements that you can get when it comes to cbd extract so you can literally take your gram and portion it up into 10 or 20 evenly sized portions and then you know exactly how much cannabidiol bearing in mind that this has 990 milligrams of cannabidiol in this pot so that makes it really super easy to uh to deal with dosing much more easily than it is to deal with dosing when it comes to hemp flour right another awesome thing about cbd extracts is the ability to imbue them with these lovely terpene profiles so this one is lemon drop and it just smells like sweet sicilian lemons and you can really play about and get some awesome terpene profiles in the cbd world another benefit to cbd extract which hits less with cbd flour unless you vaporize it is the bio availability of the vaporized compounds that you get when you dab versus the amount of cannabinoids that you get when you smoke so if you smoke something you're actually absorbing sort of 10 to 20 percent of the cannabinoids whereas when you vaporize you're absorbing 80 to 90 percent of the cannabinoids so if you put these in contrast and you smoked this and you vaporize this then you would be getting more cannabidiol from the extract right even if they had the same amount of milligrams consumed you would absorb more into your body with the vaporization so that is a really key positive point for cbd extract it's also a tried and tested method of delivery for cannabis consumption so you can either put it into a vape pen or a dab rig both consumption methods have been used for years and both of them are prized by medical patients for fast and effective cannabinoid delivery and of course it's much healthier to not burn your material if you can help it and that is why vaporizing extract is a healthier consumption method than smoking flour so we've talked about the benefits of both consumption methods but of course there are some drawbacks to both as well so i'm going to discuss that before we make our final verdict the first drawback to hemp flower and one which is always on my mind is that this still sits in a legal gray area so the law never changed to make an exception for cbd flower and people sold it and continued to sell it on the assumption that it contains little to no thc therefore is defined as heaven but the legal gray area does make it quite tricky to operate in the market with some cbd flower sellers being raided by the police in reality this is unlikely to affect you as a consumer so you don't have to worry so much consuming cbd flowers but just know that that distinction doesn't exist in the law another drawback to consuming only hemp flour versus consuming the extract is that you're not going to have an idea of the accurate dosage like you would if you took another consumption method when you smoke flour and particularly when i smoke flour i just grind up a few buds put it into a joint and smoke it it's a really enjoyable experience but i'm not thinking about how many cannabinoids i'm putting into my body that is something to think about for medical patients and why they might opt to consume the cbd extract instead another really key point when it comes to hemp flour is that the cannabidiol content is going to vary from batch to batch just because you smoked it once a long time ago and there was an awesome amount of cbd and doesn't mean that it will have that exact amount again and there are actually some processes where people either spray can abu dial onto the buds or they can remove the other cannabinoids to make it come down to the legal limit as well so there are some practices which you might not be aware of which might put you off when it comes to hemp flour the cannabinoids and terpenes really really nicely so that covers the drawbacks of the hemp flour so let's talk about the extract one of the things that i think is important to mention when it comes to cbd extract is often not always but often you will find that it is made from isolated compounds and broad spectrum terpenes and cannabinoids have been added right so when this is extracted to its pure form this is extracted all the way through to pure cannabidiol from hemp plants grown out in europe so they've taken away the other compounds left the cannabidiol behind and then added in the terpenes and their broad spectrum wax which is 80 cbd also offers additional minor compounds minor cannabinoids making it broad spectrum rather than isolate but it's worth thinking about that this is full spectrum right so a little bit of thc and a lot of balance of all different stuff and then this is an extract so the pure cannabidiol there is a flip side to this obviously from a medicinal perspective you know what you're getting with the cannabidiol and that's a really good thing for patients another drawback to extracts on the cbd side is that you have the potential for low quality because it's a newer industry and growing all the time there are going to be some extracts out there which don't taste as great and particularly when i got started in the world of cbd extracts i wasn't enjoying the flavor so much this year however i've been impressed with the goods flavor profile and i know there are some other awesome companies working on terpene blends and really cool stuff that you can explore so the the high quality extracts are there as well consuming extract also requires another piece of equipment so either a v8 pen or a dab rig as i mentioned with the tried and tested consumption methods however this does make it a little bit more expensive to get started and you will have to buy yourself at least an entry-level product to be able to consume the extract unless you want to just put it in with your joints but then you will be burning it and therefore wasting some of the cbd and finally the extract may feel a little bit less natural to old-school smokers i'm talking the guys and girls that have been smoking joints for 30 years haven't really tried out other consumption methods this is a newer way to consume cannabis right and it doesn't look like it did in its herbal form so it feels less natural to people that have never tried it but once you take the plunge it can be a very enjoyable experience so what is my verdict when it comes to consuming hemp flour or cbd extract which should you pick it's going to depend entirely on you and your motivations but there are clearly some benefits and some drawbacks to both i personally really like consuming the cbd dabs in the morning they're a really good start to the day but i also find myself smoking and vaping cbd flour from time to time so there are benefits to both you know it's really nice to mix them sometimes as well during the day and have a bit of both in different sessions so i find it difficult to pick i really like the flavor profiles and i really like this sort of clear-headed feeling that i get when i consume cbd extracts which is very noticeable for something that's not psychotropic both forms of consumption are entirely valid but you'll get a clearer dosage with cbd extract i'll buy both i'll have both in my medicine cabinet and i will consume both of them but i want to know what your thoughts are on the subject do you smoke hemp flour do you dab cbd extract have you tried both and what is your preference please leave your comments below and we'll be joining

suppressive drugs camon dial has been shown to be beneficial for many of these cats you have a cat with car vomiting chronic diarrhea you should be considering his CBD number five are diabetic cats Murray is now a controlled diabetic he's controlled on diet but in part I was able to get him off of insulin because I'm actually also using CBD cannabidiol daily seems to help decrease pancreatic

of my free book", "uMjiYNWeIFk": "You can walk into a coffee shop,\na massage spa or even a doggie daycare -- and walk out with something infused with CBD. This cannabis compound, which some claim can\nhelp with pain, anxiety or other ailments, has sparked a gold...\na \u201cgreen\u201d rush in the U.S. Sales for CBD -- or cannabidiol as it\u2019s\ncalled -- are expected to grow from $1 billion to $20 billion within the next three years. But if you don\u2019t do your homework, those\nlotions or lattes could land you in deep trouble -- EVEN in places where medical or recreational\nweed is legal --- AND EVEN THOUGH the 2018 Farm Bill removed restrictions from CBD \nif it\u2019s derived from hemp plants. I mean just look at the confusion that remains\namong federal agencies: As of early July 2019, the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture says states can\u2019t block the trade of hemp plants. But if you sell CBD from those same plants\nin any health or food products, the Food and Drug Administration could technically come after you for violating interstate commerce laws. And don\u2019t even get me started \non state cannabis laws. Finding legal CBD is way \nharder than you think, so we packed our bags and headed back to school. Namely, to the University of Connecticut. In January, UConn launched the nation\u2019s\nonly college course that gives hands-on experience with growing cannabis plants. Graduate student Peter Apicella and research\ngrower Shelley Durocher showed us around their greenhouse\u2026. The stems are really purple. It's a nice tall upright plant. The leaflets are very narrow on each individual leaf. The class only grows hemp, which is like marijuana\u2019s straight-edge twin. All cannabis varieties, including hemp and\nmarijuna, fall under one species: Cannabis sativa. The main difference is marijuana makes high\nquantities of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol -- which is federally illegal. Industrial hemp, under federal law, shouldn\u2019t\ncontain more than 0.3 percent THC -- but plants aren\u2019t very good at following guidelines. So even within hemp cultivars, there's a lot\nof variation as far as the morphology of the leaves. that's where you start to see some \nof the variability and different levels of THC and CBDs. A hemp crop can start off making only CBD -- and then unwittingly turn into a \nTHC-laden field of marijuana. That\u2019s right: a hemp crop can become marijunana! And if your CBD comes from a marijuana plant,\nselling it and buying it is a federal crime. That\u2019s why under the 2018 farm bill, hemp\nfarms must submit to state or federal inspections. These mixups are created by the basic biology\nbehind THC and CBD, which are both cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are plants oils, and cannabis comes packed with \nmore than 100 versions of them Scientists suspect cannabinoids protect the\nplant from UV rays, much like sunscreen does for the human skin They think that because up to a quarter of\na cannabis plant\u2019s weight can be just cannabinoids -- and cannabinoid levels change with light exposure. You'll have more cannabinoids with more light. At the top of the plant, you'd get more cannabinoids compared to flowers\nthat are at the lower end of the plant. A cannabinoid starts out as a bit of sugar that hitchhikes around the plants\u2019 enzymes, changing its identity, bit by bit, with each ride. Eventually this wandering sugar can bum a\nride from one of two enzymes: THC-a synthase or CBD-a synthase. One ride leads to becoming THC. The other to CBD. Except in hemp, THC synthase is genetically\ndormant That\u2019s why hemp plants can make loads of\nCBD and little to no THC... ...a habit that will continue as long as the plants don\u2019t pollinate each other. When the plants DO reproduce, their traits\nmix -- and those once dormant genes can suddenly be replaced with active ones. Studies have found if two hemp plants that purely make CBD hook up, most of their offspring will be able to make THC. In fact, some of those seedlings will ONLY\nmake THC. Any biological organism is going to fluctuate\nand that's something like farmers are always and growers are always really concerned about\n-- that fluctuation. If an inspection catches marijuana in a hemp\nfield, then a whole crop could be lost. That\u2019s why UConn\u2019s cannabis class only\ngrows female hemp plants. This is a preflower and it's a very small pistil. Since it's this little tiny white hair we\nknow pretty certainly that it's a female. and they\u2019re all clones. You snip a part of a plant off you put it\nin soil with a little rooting hormone and that cutting is actually genetically identical\nto that first mother plant that you took from. And so these are all genetically identical\nto one of the mother plants we have in here. Keeping a greenhouse all-female is easy, but\nit\u2019s a different story growing hemp outdoors. Cannabis is abundant in the wild -- meaning\nan outdoor hemp field is one gust of pollen away from accidentally breeding marijuana. So before you buy, ask the store how its extracts\nwere made and if they were validated by a third-party tester. That\u2019s important because extracting CBD\nor THC from cannabis plants is essentially the same process. If your supplier does it incorrectly, your\nCBD bottle might carry a little surprise. It happens all the time. Sometimes there is CBD. A lot of times, there's not CBD. Sometimes it even contains THC in the bottle\nwhen it's not supposed to. It's really... it's a crap shoot. That\u2019s the voice of Rino Ferrarese, COO\nof the medical marijuana extractor CT Pharma, and he\u2019s tired of tainted CBD flooding the\nmarket. Under Connecticut law, their company must\nensure their products match the labels on their bottles, which they accomplish through\npharmaceutical-grade extraction. Using liquid carbon dioxide or ethanol, they can strip the cannabinoids from the plant material, in a process that's similar to distilling liquor. Add a little heat, and all of the carbon dioxide\nand ethanol evaporate away. Specific temperatures can isolate CBD and\nTHC on their own. But Rino said many CBD producers don\u2019t take\nthese necessary steps with extraction. Ok, we\u2019re back in the office. Let\u2019s recap. If you buy CBD...and it came from a hemp plant...and\nit\u2019s pure...then you\u2019re in the clear. Not quite. The FDA has prohibited the sale of CBD in\nany unapproved health products, dietary supplements or food... ...which literally means everything except for\none approved epilepsy drug is banned. The Drug Enforcement Administration also still considers CBD a schedule 1 drug unless it is in FDA-approved medicines. So why do we still see so much CBD on shelves? Well, what a lot of consumers don\u2019t realize\nis federal agencies aren\u2019t exactly on top of policing those CBD products that you see\nin a gas station or convenience store. Meanwhile, as those infractions go overlooked,\nmany states and the district have moved to decriminalize cannabis products like CBD. The result is a limbo, where hemp-derived\nCBD is mostly illicit but only if someone is watching.

Johnny Boden to get the answers I'm dr. Johnny Bowden I'm a board certified nutritionist and an author I think the biggest misconceptions about CBD come from its confusion with marijuana from which it is completely chemically distinct the difference between CBD orell and marijuana is not really a fair comparison it's like saying the difference between vitamin C and an apple an apple has vitamin C but there are different categories CBD is a cannabinoid there are about a hundred known cannabinoids and they exist in many different plants let me say unequivocably that you cannot repeat cannot get high on CBD if that's what you're taking it for you're going to be sorely disappointed so the endocannabinoid system is this ancient system in humans and in vertebrates that regulates all kinds of really interesting processes that people care about such as digestion and sleep and and people of reading all that research and they're interested in getting some stimulation of the system that regulates all these wonderful things and I think that's why they're interested in in CBD all that far aliens entrance into this market is very very significant and here's why they've been oil manufacturers for thirty years they know how to extract oils that are have what they're supposed to have in them and have purity and our essayed for all those things and i think their entrance into this is a very important event and makes it possible for people to try it that might have been hesitant before not knowing who's making [Music] you", "eoGDedQdL3U": "you may go unit I back up whatever you say like this has kind of a more even feel I'm like hello even reopen hi youtube 'yes i'm back and i'm reviewing go green hem i have two bottles one is orange and one is unflavored looks like this you can see it is a 500 milligram bottle and it's 30 milliliters they both go for around 39.99 i believe it was the actual price on their website theirs they also have a cinnamon flavour but i'm only reviewing the orange and the unflavored for right now so in the mail it came with these packages Hedison spit in my travel case so they're kind of jagged right now but come in those little packages and it comes with a little pamphlet telling you more about the CBD i'm gonna start with the natural one the unflavored natural so i check this one before i had a show and i had a little bit of anxiety and it actually went away I took about I think five to ten droppers and I didn't have any anxiety while I was performing that was nice it did not reduce so sometimes I take CBD before I drink so that I don't get a hangover the next day did not reduce the hangover did nothing for the hangover I had a hangover but you know maybe that's because the alcohol I drink or how much I drink who knows oh I also traveled while I was taking this one I took three droppers before I got on the plane and I didn't have an anxiety for my whole flight I also noticed that compared to the fab CBD this which was the same milligram content fab CBD worked a little bit better for me I had to take more go green than I did fab CBD and I usually like to take less if I can so for me personally I'd rather have something more effective but go green is actually very useful because it did get rid of my anxiety so it is still a good choice oh the taste was very very we'd like it wasn't it wasn't as strong as blue birds we'd kind of planned he taste but it still you could still taste the cannabis and yeah it was clearing colors that was nice moving on to the orange go green hemp so this one tasted heavenly it tasted exactly like oranges it was like this is the best tasting CBD that I've ever had if you can't do the whole wheat taste with your CBD I would highly recommend getting the orange one because it's an amazing phenomenal I tried this one for pain I had cramps because it was my time of the month and I took it it didn't really help for my cramps I also used it for oh I also used it for two things that I had and it didn't really diminish any pain or I didn't notice a difference at all but it didn't work for anxiety like the other natural one did so that was nice it does work for you you guys are out there looking for a CDD for your anxiety this one is something I would recommend I also tried this one for it's a hangover thing and it didn't help for the hangover that I had after I drink another night but usually after drinking I get anxiety the next day and I did not give it anxiety I felt a little bit aloof still because after drinking also get like well kind of believe things I had a splash like yeah feel a little funky after drinking I still felt aloof but I didn't have high anxiety after drinking which is wonderful overall I really liked both of these I would definitely opt for the orange because it tastes amazing but if you're into the cannabis taste and maybe try this one too yeah go try it guys I'll leave the links below", "7t7Jkz8Iu7k": "as part my daily routine I always take stevedore I use it before bed and I use it in the mornings when I wake up we've obviously launched the range impact sport see video you can see the full range here of oils we've got we've got the 1600 or 400 for men

"come on come on do you go do you like sweet baby boy alright we'll go after hi welcome to Angel's anything show thanks for coming on over it's good to see you today is a very special episode because I am gonna go through some items in this beautiful box that was not sent to me I picked it up nobody sent nobody sent anything in the mail but this beautiful box that I procured and I'm just gonna get into with you look I'm not saying if you want to get on my good side you have to help me acquire marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff that they wanted me to try so I was very excited and also that was happening when I was going through my dry spell like a week ago that you guys saw and it was like it was like water in a desert you know what I got this box instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy - it's like you feel high but like everything feels like it just feels like a warm blanket you know it's nice now the store which I didn't even mention the name of the store the store is called High Times confection they're on Instagram I'll link it below check it out even if you just like looking at pictures of delicious weed candy which I'm a fan of if you like to torture yourself because apparently South Dakota is gonna legalize weed before New Hampshire of course I'm a legal cannabis patient so naturally naturally and 21 plus 21 plus ok so this is hemp CBD one to oneself I think you say solve just most like nice lotion I used once I don't know if it's supposed to be like a pain relieving or just like a nice lotion if you guys want to let me know ok so I've saved the best thing for last this is a two to one THC CBD suppository and each depository is 20 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD so pretty nice a suppository you don't know goes either up the ass or up the vagina I was thinking this would be fantastic for cramps and then I had a horrible cramps the other day and I got to tell you the last thing I felt like doing was sticking Li hand of a bloodied vagina so I I just was like it was a war zone down there so I stayed away I mean I put a tampon that was about it there was no room for anything else dan and I are doing the float tomorrow night and I thought Oh like the sleep perfect I'll do the suppository I'll go to the float I'll be nice and high and then I'll report back do a little bit of a product review is but I need your help guys I need your help should I put this up the V or the V and I'm gonna post on Instagram now asking you and I'm gonna have you boat and then whatever you vote is what I'll do and this is how you really need to be following my Instagram for this type of content okay it's the next day and the results are in actually the results were very mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but", "ZFOxN5w9gno": "seems like everybody's talking about we these days I hear about all the time it's legal gettin legalized in lots of different states in the United States both medicinal and recreational marijuana and now we're getting the CBD oil and CBD stuff everywhere people are taking C V D supplements people are putting it on their skin people are giving it to their pets what is the deal with this stuff we're gonna answer those questions and lots lots more hang tight we're getting into it right now have you been paying attention to skin care releases over the past year you may have noticed a huge influx of products containing CBD as an ingredient and it is estimated that it will be a 16 billion dollar industry by the year 2025 but should it be is this something that you should invest your money in first we need to decide what this stuff is and what it isn't so all hemp is cannabis but not all cannabis is hemp so hemp is something that is within the cannabis category what you're gonna see on labels is cannabis L sativa and that is the hemp plant it is a low THC version of the cannabis plant within this plant there are over 80 different cannabinoids these things that you can extract from the plant in order to get different effects so one of them is CBD one of them is THC THC is the one that gives you the psychoactive effects so when you've got hemp seed oil it has a very very low percentage of THC it actually needs to be below 0.3% in order to even be legal now what is CBD it's cannabidiol is how it's pronounced and cannabidiol will not get you high in that is not its purpose that is not what it does that's THC it's completely separate and because of that it there's no restrictions on flights you can't get arrested for having it in your car like it doesn't matter where you live in the United States it is a federal law that it is legal as long as there is that 0.3% were less of that THC in the product and products being sold on the shelves are legally they have to have less than that point three percent if they have point four percent they're considered any legal substance now because this is brand new companies are really taking advantage of the lacs rules when it comes to CBD some people are taking hemp seed oil and they're marketing it as CBD but if it just says hemp seed oil it's not CBD there's no CBD in just straight hemp seed oil and because of that you're not going to get the the alleged benefits of the CBD if you just get hemp seed oil so the biggest thing is that the CBD oils have anti-inflammatory properties so anytime you have inflammation whether it's dry skin eczema psoriasis that is supposed to be helped by CBD oil another big one is as an acne treatment because of the inflammation that occurs naturally with acne there's actually a second thing that they're studying as far as the acne treatment which is it's supposed to help control your sebum production that extra oil production so that would help people with acne as well if it were true again there just isn't a ton of research on it right now they're also saying it in certain concentrations it may have pain-killing properties similar to like a bengay kind of product and it also may have antioxidant properties that would help with fine lines and wrinkles and skin dullness it also seems to be safe for sensitive skin which is another big thing so if CBD can do all of these things it'll be magical but again the research just isn't there this is where a lot of companies have gotten into a lot of trouble because they're putting these claims on these CBD products that it can do all of these amazing things that are medical claims but these medical claims haven't been proven they had there's no scientific research behind it and as a cosmetic you can't make medical claims so people weren't claiming this is crazy I know but I mean you think about people that were reading this and thinking that this was a hundred percent true that it could treat conditions like Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease depression anxiety PTSD cancer treatment a treatment for schizophrenia for eating disorders and addiction these were real claims that companies were making about their CBD oil products and the FDA and the FTC had to step in and be like no no this is not ok and they got letters kind of cease and desist kind of letters to stop making those claims and they had to pull their products from the shelves so yes this ingredient is FDA approved but just because it's FDA approved doesn't mean it actually does anything the research just isn't there yet in 2018 the farm bill passed and what that did was it loosened regulations on hemp-based products that's why we're seeing this big boom in the market right now my husband and I went down to the Cosmoprof event down in Las Vegas and we went to well I went to a CBD base it's called a cosmetologist and that one was the most full packed people with so many questions I mean it was like wall-to-wall people there are so many brands that are looking at adding CBD to their products and my purpose for making this video is just to let you know that yes it could do lots of really great things for your skin but you also could be throwing your money down the toilet by buying them so you have to realize when you purchase something like this that it may or may not work and if you have tried CBD based products I would love to know your thoughts about your personal experiences with them down in the comments below in the collective brain of makeup awesomeness where we help each other not to buy crap and to buy things that are totally worth it please leave those thoughts because I would love to learn from you and your experiences I do have a CBD product that I'm trying from makeup revolution if there's skincare revolution line right now I haven't seen anything magical with it but I also don't have psoriasis eczema acne those things that will probably be really showing visible results if they were doing those things I'd be able to see them more than I do with my fine lines and wrinkles so let's all work together to learn more about this topic I hope that you found it helpful again anything you want to add leave it down in the comments thank you so much for watching and

butter [Music] CBD topical butters creams and lotions are used for a variety of medicinal reasons and today we'll be showing you how to make one of the easiest options an infused body butter body butter is a thick buttery moisturizer and when infused with cannabis will not only help with rejuvenating dry skin but will also provide relief from inflammation and pain now at its core this product recipe only needs two ingredients hemp and cocoa butter although optionally to soften the texture or to add an aroma you can include coconut oil as well as essential oils but I'll get to that in a little bit so to start you'll need to use a pound of cocoa butter for every ounce of hemp here I'm using half a pound of cocoa butter with half an ounce of buds that just finished drying I'm just leaving most of the plant intact because I'm lazy but I'd recommend chopping up the buds first so that the smaller pieces have an easier time of infusing with the butter and then adding it in after the cocoa butter melts now put it over a double boiler wait for the cocoa butter to melt [Music] and then use a spoon to submerge the temp into the butter before letting it sit for two hours be sure to top off the water in the pot if needed and now two hours later the CBD the buds are infused with the butter we'll need to take out the plant material from the butter and for that I'm using a strainer along with a coffee filter typically for consumables I'll use a cheesecloth instead of a coffee filter as they'll work much faster but because I'm going to be using the butter as a topical and not as a consumable I want to make sure that I catch all of the tiny plant particles so I went with a slower but more effective option once it's almost done I'll give it a good squeeze to get the last of the butter through and now as is this will work as a basic body butter although we still need to wait for it to cool down and solidify you can leave it for a day to solidify on its own in a cool dark place or to quicken the process I just put it in the refrigerator and a few hours later we have a solid block of infused cocoa butter because of how solid cocoa butter is when you wanna use it as is you'll need to break off a piece of it and then rub it into the skin cocoa butter has a melting point of just below the human body temperature so it will slowly melt when rubbed over the skin to make things easier you can always use something to make the pieces smaller like a cheese grate however if you want a body butter that's easier to work with then a simple solution is to mix it with coconut oil which is a lot softer and has a lower melting point of around room temperature to do this I'm using one part infused butter along with one part coconut oil and put it back on the double boiler because this does dilute the CBD content in the body butter you can use double attempt when making the butter or use the same process of combining temp with coconut oil to make an infuse coconut oil as well before mixing the two [Music] [Music] now once both have melted just give it a quick stir take it off the heat and when it's warm to the touch here's where you can also add essential oils if you want to change the aroma of the body butter I personally like the natural coconut and chocolatey scent so I left it as is but there are a lot of ways to complement these smells such as with coffee or peppermint finally storing a cool place for it to solidify and now you have a softer and quicker melting infused body butter and that's it", "w4bquPPJo5U": "what's up high intensity health errs today we're gonna talk all about the endocannabinoids system we're gonna talk about CBD THC and various endocannabinoids synthetic cannabinoid receptors and how you have an endogenous endocannabinoids system researchers actually dubbed this the endocannabinoid ohm because it's this complex metabolomic Anapa dori receptors most namely cb1 and cb2 are stimulated they initiate a blini of downstream metabolic processes that affect both appetite satiety mood anxiety epilepsy seizures they even affect things like adiposity they even affect metabolism ampk this endocannabinoids system is really elaborate so I want to welcome you back to high intensity health I'm like Mott so I'm super excited and an honor that you were here if at any point you're like dude these videos are cool please subscribe hit that like button and I love your comments because I learned from you just like you learned hopefully from these videos so if you have a question comment about CBD THC the endocannabinoids system please leave it below so why in the heck are we talking about this well number one I have been supplementing with phyto cannabinoids for a while I like ned's product they are show sponsor they are not paying me to make this video at all I just want to learn more about this complex system that I've known about for a while and I want to just give you a little shoutout I'm a book here called belly fan effect when I was studying for that book writing that book back in 2009 to 2013 I came across this researcher Patras canny and he's I think he's in Brussels in Belgium but I know he does some work outside of London at King's College and he published a few papers about the endogenous endocannabinoids system and how dysbiotic gut bacteria can cross talk with the endocannabinoids system in fat cells what scientists dub as adipocytes and how there's altered cb1 signaling within the fat cells as a consequence of perturbed gut bacteria so I've been kind of remotely interested almost for about 10 years now and just kind of following loosely the endocannabinoid research in the endocannabinoids system I think it's pretty fascinating fast forward to 2019 then my dog very recently got really ill she appeared to be in pain had labored breathing she appeared to have like some upper respiratory stuff going on and so I started supplementing you know giving her phyto cannabinoids from Ned and her health started to improve and I was like this is crazy what's going on what's going on their immune system I was just hoping to get a little bit of pain relief maybe help her sleep better maybe increase her appetite because she was not eating anything so I started to dive into the research and this is where things got really really fascinating for me because I love molecular biology and I assume because you're still watching this video that you do to so let's now with that as a preface let's talk about this and let me just pause I tried to film a video with my dog Shasta and I started crying I'm gonna try and keep it together during this video but basically um basically my dog is dying and I did a bunch of research around cannabinoids to just see like how I could help her at the at these final stages it was really emotional for me because I was you know telling you all the things I've learned or I was trying to articulate to you all these things that I've learned about the endocannabinoids system and cb1 receptors and the anandam ID and all this and I was crying so here we are with part two hopefully it's a little bit more polished so here's a few three things you need to know okay you have two different primary endocannabinoids receptors in your body these are endogenous receptors friends even if you don't supplement with any phyto cannabinoid if you never touch THC or cannabis it doesn't matter you still have these receptors which is really fasting so you have the cb1 receptor and the cb2 receptor let's talk about the cb2 receptor first because I think this is very important its newly identified and we now know that when we take endogenous phyto cannabinoids and things like that that we stimulate this cb2 receptor it's found and it's ubiquitously expressed in our immune system this is where we might get some antiproliferative and maybe even cancer supportive benefits from supplementing or taking or at least finding of fine-tuning the endocannabinoid system tone by way of stimulating the cb2 receptor in our immune system but now let me pause here I don't want to make any regis claims I was sitting in Airport at an airport recently and overheard people talking about how they cure cancer by taking CBD I'm not gonna say that or make that claim at all but there is some interesting research showing that individuals with cancer may benefit from taking CBD potentially because it may stimulate or affect this receptor and therefore make our immune system more resilient okay so and I'm just just going to leave it at that but very interesting now here's where things get a little bit more fascinating behind me the cb1 receptor I'll throw some things on the screen here this is ubiquitous expressed in the brain so in the cerebellum and basal ganglia and this is why in different disease states such as epilepsy and Parkinson's there is some interesting research being done and conducted about the utility of stimulating the cb1 receptor because in those different disease states the cerebellum and basal ganglia is implicated in the etiology of the disease even in Alzheimer's what we see is a compensatory increase in the cb1 receptor as a means to potentially modulate or read you know balance abnormal brain chemistry and Alzheimer's okay so this is what's kind of interesting and I want to pause on the brain conversation and go back to obesity for just a moment what we see in obesity and the animal model studies have shown us is there is an increase in the cb1 receptor density in fat cells now we know an individual's when they gain weights when they when they transition from lean to overweight to obese there is a there's a linear increase in the amount of inflammation that they have in their dipper sites so it's not yet known if the increase in the receptor density of the cb1 receptor in fat cells is a cause or a compensatory shift once you know there's a lot of inflammation within and among the fat cells and individuals that are overweight so data is still pending we don't really know exactly what's the chicken or the egg here but scientists have figured out that in the context of Alzheimer's that this increased cb1 receptor throughout different parts of the brain may be a compensatory means to reduce inflammation in the brain okay now other tissues and brain regions that you may be of importance you know to this conversation and contact is the hippocampus and the amygdala the hippocampus which is Greek for seahorse it's a part of the brain where we form a lot of memories it's also a part of the brain that's very susceptible to stress induced memory changes you know you people that are very stressed out there's a lot of cortisol that can affect the hippocampus and the amygdala is where we have a lot of emotional responses that are stored and initiated there so a lot of people that are abused that have been raped or physically abused or you know mentally abused or they're very flighty have been in bad situations and then get a really you know like a panic or stress response that can be a hyperactive amygdala and this is why I say people you know and I've experienced the benefits from a psychological standpoint taking you know phyto cannabinoids taking CBD oil and I've noticed that it calms the mood it has a natural anxiety effect that's because of probably this one-two punch with this this high concentration of cb1 receptors within the hippocampus and the amygdala okay so anxiety sleep things like that you know and we talked about the cerebellum and basal ganglia with movement epilepsy seizures even multiple sclerosis there's a lot of research being conducted on using cannabinoids because of the high concentration of the cannabinoid receptors in those brain regions now here's where things get really interesting again going back to anxiety is in the cortex and the prefrontal cortex there's a high concentration of the cannabinoid receptors and that may have to do with again mood again feelings of anxiety things like that so if we're constantly worried if we're thinking and judging and you know adding a lot of you know preconceived notions about who we are as people things like that that are developed in the cortex that can affect mood and create can create anxiety and so this is where ever HAP's supplementing with endocannabinoids whether it's derived from hemp or derived from cannabis can be helpful here's what's really fascinating that I did not know and I think you might find this particularly interesting is when you take cannabis or cannabinoids or say of phyto cannabinoid or something from THC along those lines the CBD cannabidiol is what CBD stands for doesn't directly stimulate the cb1 receptor what it is it prevents or increases this that the amount of time that on your own endogenous endocannabinoids called Ananda mite is present which is crazy so again we think that cannabidiol or CBD would stimulate this receptor but what it does is it actually increases the half-life so to speak where the amount of available and nanda bide which i think is fascinating so for now that's what i've learned about the different receptors different receptor types you know it's a complex intricate system what i can tell you in closing is pharmaceutical companies are investing a lot of money into you know various synthetic agonist or CB one or cb2 receptor antagonist depending upon the tissue specificity so it's a really fascinating conversation fascinating narrative there is some some gender differences here where women tend to have a higher prevalence of polymorphisms involved in the cb1 receptor and distribution so this is going to be just kind of an overview exploratory video to give you a better insight and idea and give you more references and resources that'll link below two papers that really help me to better understand like what's all the hype around CBD is it real is it not is there any science is there not you know all that and let me tell you i've been blown away like this could be a whole video series and we might do that to talk about this system and i will close with links below i make no money off this but net is a show sponsor i use our product it enhances my sleep i use it instead of drinking alcohol i like their 750 milligram tincture i do 1 ml under the tongue at night before bed it's a phenomenal product and they do have this natural skin balm that works really well also as a skin as a skin that works really well also as a sex lubricant no kidding my wife and i have experimented with it it doesn't sting her it's great it's like natural like the real deal so i'm links are below to that i hope this video gave you a little bit of an idea and better understanding into the different you know resources and contexts and applications for what CBD might be helpful one thing that i forgot to mention was that in the context of cancer and appetite CBD and affecting these receptors has been studied in the context of nausea and anti vomiting so that's another application if you're having a hard time holding food down if you're trying to put on muscle and eat a lot maybe you could benefit from taking CBD or stimulating this system in some manner so as always I'm grateful that you watched all the way through I hope you enjoyed this

open squirt them right in there but about three capsules worth of vitamin E oil there and that's it you combine everything right into your magical butter machine just like that my hands are still pretty much clean if you get a little bit of this stuff on you just rub it in it feels good feels good so I'm gonna close this sucker up I'm going to set our temperature today to 130 degrees for one hour what do you think bud Wow that was freakin awesome did you finish it inside of me whoa that's cool man yeah you know it was really cool had a lot of fun today we're getting creative teaching

be sure to stay tuned all day all week every Tuesday my name is Chris we were getting creative today thank you very much and cheers the goodness the moment", "6RyjjthK7VQ": "so one thing i really want to remind you of before we get into this video is that you are beautiful inside and out um greetings from the swirly couch my name is caitlyn michelle and today we are here to discuss ima so i experienced eczema as a baby and into my late teen years i was actually born with eczema and i can fully relate to the struggles of not only just the skin condition but also the emotional struggles that came with having um experience having experienced a skin condition and you know i noticed growing up i was very insecure i didn't feel comfortable you know putting myself out there you know meeting new people and even just speaking i was just so nervous because i was worried of what were people thinking of my face or my arms that were rashed out and red and you know my face that was you know covered in a rash and super dry and so for me growing up dealing with eczema at a really young age first of all they're already very limited treatment options and the prescription treatment options that were available um there were age restrictions on so given that i was a baby with eczema you can't just put anything on a baby's skin or even a young child under the age of five so for me i really struggled with finding treatment options that really helped my skin was so sensitive that i could only use specific kind of soap i couldn't use anything scented like i really had a lot of limitations in my skin care you know so if you're watching this i'm sure you or someone close to you is dealing with eczema and i just want you to know that you're not alone and that you are beautiful inside and out and that relief is totally possible and to allow yourself to be open to that possibility of relief and confidence in your own skin again so like i said relief is totally possible when i was growing up there were very limited treatment options and i was so young at the time that any of the prescription treatment options i wasn't a candidate for and i also lived in a family of six people so by the time i was of age to be a candidate for any of those medicines and those treatment options they were not affordable for my family and so therefore that was just not a treatment option that was available to me and now back in the 90s um when i was a baby um just a wee little taut um there were very limited treatment options which is why it's a beautiful time to be alive where we have so many different treatment options available to us so as much as there are many different treatment options available nowadays not all treatment options are the same not all treatment options are sustainable nor are all treatment options affordable which is why today i want to talk about cbd in the use of treating eczema as cbd can be an affordable non-prescription option that can help to manage the symptoms of the condition while also helping to improve your quality of life cbd can really help in the treatment of the condition by providing relief not only from the inflammation because eczema is an inflammatory response and cbd helps to treat the inflammation there was a study done in 2014 that had proven that cbd triggers an anti-inflammatory response in the cells of our body so when we're utilizing cbd we're working with something that is directly affecting the cells of our body it's not trying to just treat the symptoms but it's going more to the root of what's happening and treating the source of inflammation there which in my own personal opinion i feel that can be where we really start to notice drastic changes because we're working on a root basis rather than just working to treat the symptoms that we're experiencing so there's many different methods of how you can utilize cbd to treat eczema and you can just kind of test them out and see which one aligns most with you so you can utilize ingestion where you like take a tincture or you take a capsule of cbd and that helps to work from an internal place to manage the any internal information inflammation that you may be experiencing there's also the method of topical use where you can use like a cbd soap or a cbd face mask or even like a cbd salve and those are ways that can directly help to nourish and soothe the skin externally and when you partner that with the internal addition of the cbd that can really help to be working from an internal as well as an external place to manage the condition i'm very thankful that i did outgrow the condition however i do still experience symptoms of very sensitive skin as a result for people who have outgrown the condition it is common to still experience very sensitive skin afterwards so therefore we do also have to be mindful of what we put on our skin to find products that align with us and products that are free of contaminants free of irritants and any pesticides one thing to note is that not all cbd products are equal and not all cbd products are pure some may contain trace amounts of pesticides or irritants or contaminants which is why it's very important to get your cbd from a company that has their cbd third party tested because cbd is not regulated by the fda or by the government and therefore it can legally be sold with any of those pesticides or irritants in the cbd product and yeah like we don't need that on our skin so it's super important to make sure that you're using a third party tested cbd product which is why i only trust thought cloud for my skin because thought cloud is 100 vegan they are organically grown as well as they are lab tested to ensure purity and ensure that there are no contaminants or irritants within the products that you are putting on your precious skin so my loves if you are looking to see if cbd might be a treatment option that aligns with you and you are looking to try something new um you can use my code key at checkout and you can save some money as my darling you", "M_-ryb2Q3dc": "THERAPY FOR ALL, NO PRESCRIPTION NECESSARY?

SHE DECIDED TO OPEN  THE SHOP.  \"I was on antidepressant medicine, no longer on any of that, don't have to take  anything to sleep any more my anxiety levels are down.\" AND MANY OF HER  CLIENTS SAY THEY TOO HAVE HAD POSITIVE  EXPERIENCES WITH IT. \"I have clients that have  fiber myalgia, arthritis,  hashimotos, lupis, rheumatoid arthrisits, osteoarthris, and the cbd oil  brings down that inflammation and helps their pain.\" ONE FATHER TELLS  ME HIM AND HIS WIFE  CREATED THEIR OWN  BRAND OF CBD OIL FOR THEIR SON WHO  SUFFERED FROM  SEIZURES.  \"knowing that we were able to do it naturally for him and do it the right way, what we feel is the right way I  honestly still emotional about it because hes thriving.\"  NOW, WALLACE SAYS HIS  SON NOAH IS SEIZURE  FREE.. THEY CREDIT THAT TO  CBD \"you know hes three  and a half and hes brilliant he has no issues and its just  an amazing experience to create something and hopefully help other people  as well.\" ANOTHER  QUESTION OF CONCERN  IS.. IS IT LEGAL? \"now its  presumably legal at the  federal level but you have regulatory agencies like the FDA contacting distributors  saying you are going too far marketing this as an effective drug.\" OILS, DROPLETS UNDER THE TONGUE, AND TOPICALS ARE ALL LEGAL  ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF  AGRICULUTURE ONLY IF THEY ARE SOLD WITHOUT  HEALTH CLAIMS. IN 2018 THE FDA  APPROVED A DRUG WITH CBD AS AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT CREATED TO  HELP CHILDREN WITH EPILEPSY.  NOW THE AG DEPARTMENT SAYS SINCE  THIS FORM OF CBD,  CALLED \"CBD ISOLATE\" , CBD IN ITS PURESTEST FORM.. IS IN THE NEW  MEDICATION.. ANY FOOD PRODUCTS  ON THE MARKET WITH THIS CBD FORM IS ILLEGAL TO SELL. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO SENT LETTERS TO RETAIL SHOPPES, LIKE EDMUNSONS INFORMING  THEM ABOUT THE NEW REGULATIONS..  SHE SAYS SHE HAS PULLED ITEMS ITEMS WITH CBD ISOLATE OUT OF HER STORE.  tag THE FDA WILL HOST A  PUBLIC FORUM ON MAY  31ST AT THEIR WHITE OAK  CAMPUS IN WASHINGTON DC TO DISCUSS SOME OF  THESE NEW  REGULATIONS.

we're going to be talking about how to make cbd oil with hemp seed oil and maybe some of the common misconceptions that go along with hemp seed oil but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support so folks if you are new here to the channel we are a hemp farm and today we will be using our own hemp flour this particular strain that we will be using is biox we also have cherry one which we also like to make oil with biox berry and other strains available on our website so if you guys are looking into making cbd oil and you need some hemp flour go ahead and check out the links in the description below we can ship to pretty much all 50 states so folks let's talk about the common misconception with hemp seed oil and how to use it to make cbd oil so some folks see hemp oil or hemp seed oil and they think that it has cbd in it and it really has zero cannabinoids in it there really is nothing in it other than the value of the oil from the hemp seed itself so there's really no cannabinoids in it today we have some hemp seed oil that was cold pressed it's organic it's good stuff and we're going to be using 16 ounces of that oil now you can use eight ounces we're going to make a larger batch today we're also going to be using 28 grams of cbd hemp flour you can use more so this is one ounce it's a very standard recipe 16 ounces of oil to one ounce of flour you can use two ounces of flour to 16 ounces of oil as well today we're not gonna be making a super strong batch but if you are looking for a more potent oil i suggest doing two ounces to two cups and i'll leave that recipe in the description of the video as well but we will be using our biox strain from our farm that we grew here again guys if you are interested go ahead and check out the links in the description below now the first thing you're going to do is you're going to decarb your flower obviously if you purchase it from us it's already going to be in a one ounce measured bag and you go ahead and put it in your d card box now today we're going to be using our magic butter d card box you can use a pyrex dish with a cover but it needs to be covered and you're going to put it in the oven at 250 for 30 minutes that really activates all the cannabinoids in the hemp flour to really get that cbd to transfer into the oil also what you will be needing is obviously a magic butter machine but you will need once the oil is done you're going to need a filter and a silicone glove this is to squeeze out the remaining oil from the flowers into your jar or whatever you're going to put it in for use and again folks you will need a hemp seed oil 16 ounces you can use eight ounces as well so you can use eight ounces of oil with one ounce of flour if you want the potency but not as much oil i don't really recommend that for the magic butter machine i really recommend 16 ounces of oil the machine doesn't really do well with only eight ounces of oil that's just my take on it you can use the magic butter machine with eight ounces of oil i believe they say you can but that's just not how we make it here on the farm so folks let's get into making cbd oil with our hemp seed oil with our magic butter machine okay folks so the cbd hemp flour is out of the oven looking good and here's our biox flour so what we're going to do is this is obviously one ounce that we already pre-measured and we're going to go ahead and not spill it so we're going to put the first handful in and then we're going to gently put it into the magic butter machine i always end up spilling it hopefully today we're all good so there's that then we've already put some in here this is eight ounces we already did one but for just for viewing purposes we already put one in the machine so you're gonna go ahead open this guy up and in it goes pretty easy again there's 16 ounces of hemp seed oil in here okay so the next thing you're going to do you're going to take the machine you are going to put it on so i've already plugged it in and what we're going to be doing is a tincture i know on the machine it says one hour for oil i just don't like the one hour recipe i like to give it enough time to really absorb into the oil so what we're going to do is we're going to select our temperature which will be 160 degrees we're going to select the four hour button and that is it so we will see you guys in four hours and let the machine do the work okay folks it's been uh four hours and the oil just went off so now all we're going to do is we're going to collect the oil it's really not much different than using mct or olive oil pretty pretty much the same you really can't tell the difference until you taste it um it's just not a much of a difference as far as like you know texture or anything like that what it looks like so this is what we're going to do we're just going to scrape off all the edges so all this is is just a flower that's kind of gotten on the edges from the blender of the magic butter machine pretty common nothing to be worried about all right so then what you're going to do is your initial pour you're going to go ahead and pour it right in now i'm using a uh pyrex uh dish i really like to use this then you can just transfer it uh over to wherever you're gonna store it most people supposed to store it in a mason jar or like a squeeze bottle or something like that so first you're just gonna take your glove get that initial squeeze pretty easy all right so now what we're going to do is get all the plant material that you can see down here let me move this so i can show you guys what it looks like down in there pretty normal um it's just a bunch of plant material what that does is it kind of holds on to a lot of oil and so that's why the glove comes in real handy you could just discard this and you know not get that extra little bit of oil it's it's not unheard of um but a lot of people like to go and get that little extra oil now everything's clean in there we put it off to the side we take the glove and go ahead and squeeze that material that was in the magic butter machine pretty easy all right and that's it so here is your cbd oil uh for you to put in a mason jar any container it doesn't matter but should be good for a while and uh you know people ask a lot about potency you know the hemp flour plays a role the cooking plays a role decarbing plays a role there's so many factors that potency really can't be calculated unless it's done in a lab so that's what i tell a lot of people so if you're watching this video and you're thinking what's the potency you really have to get it lab tested this particular batch will not be lab tested um so we won't know uh what the milligrams are for this particular batch but it nonetheless it's cbd and you know that there is cbd in it because you put cbd hemp flowers in there but that is all i have for you guys today if you guys are interested in the hemp flower we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below guys have questions feel free to leave a comment always reach out via instagram facebook or email um but that is all for today i hope you all stay happy healthy and i will see you in another video", "NXNPDILjQ94": "[Music] hey everybody due to YouTube's new terms and conditions this video is now age restricted if you are not 18 or older please exit the video thank you hello everybody and welcome back to your query cannabis in today's video I'm gonna be making cinnamon flavored CBD oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you're new here and you've already subscribed don't forget to give the video a thumbs up and I really do appreciate you guys supporting our channel so today we're gonna be making a cinnamon flavored CBD oil now the first ingredient of course is going to be our hemp flour that we grew this summer and today we're going to be using our cherry wine have flour so this came in at 17.4% CBD so we'll be doing 13 grams of decarboxylated hemp flour per cup so a total of 26 grams of d carb hemp flour but and today's recipe I will be adding cherry wine shake or trim now this is just trim buzz the sugar leaves or buds that fell off during the trim bag process and these are great to add CBD a now CBD a is the raw plant material so when it's d carved it removes the a and then you just have regular old CBD that we're all familiar with CBD a has its own good properties so we are going to be adding about 4 grams of raw material on top of the D kar material and as you just heard the oven is preheated so is that 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're going to put it in for 30 minutes so while we're waiting for the D carve our I'm gonna gather all the materials in the magic butter machine get that all set up so we can start making our flavored CBD oil 10 grams of cherry wine trim or shake whatever you want to call it this is raw plant material that is not decarboxylated and I'll get our decarboxylated hemp flour in a minute so I did 5 grams per cup of MCT oil so the first time add that material right into the magic butter machine next I'm going to measure out two cups of MCT oil okay so that's 2 cups now I'm going to add our cinnamon now this is all-natural ground cinnamon and you really don't want to overpower it now is the cinnamon going to eliminate the plant flavor no it's definitely going to knock it down but it's not going to taste like a big red or anything like that ok and I do just about a half a spoonful and right into the machine it goes now machine has a blender and a grinder so don't have to mix it around or anything like that now I'm going to go ahead and grab our D carved hemp flour now that's 26 grams of our cherry one head flower at 17.4% cvd so and it goes I can never get all the buds into the magic butter machine without losing a couple of them ok get this out of here and that's the recipe folks and of course I will leave the recipe down in the description below we're going to plug in our magic bard machine get it ready to go all right and we are going to do 160 degrees for 4 hours so I'll see you in four hours and I'll show you the finished product okay so it's been four hours and it's time to get the product out of the magic butter machine so stereotypical magic butter machine style you know you've got to get all the plant material off the base of the blender you know nothing crazy but you don't want to lose that material or at least try the best you can to get it off you're gonna do the same thing on the container you can see in there all that plant material so it's gonna get that all out of here all right looks good now again if you're using another kitchen gadget you know it really depends how messy you want things well that's why I like the magic butter machine so we're going to get our magic butter micron filter and put that into our four cup Pyrex and dump it in you know see if we can get all that out of here again the reason why you want all this plant material is the more you can get in this micron bag the squeeze the more will you're gonna get out of it because all this plant material has got oil in it okay it looks pretty good for now we're gonna get the love gloves silicone gloves just shake it down we're going to give it to squeeze you can see all that material coming out of there all that oil coming out of there so I'm excited to give this a go I know it's gonna be great in some like chai tea stuff like that that cinnamon really holds some good flavor again it doesn't get rid of the plant taste but it definitely covers it a little bit so that's it for today guys I really hope you enjoyed this video hope you use this recipe to your advantage and before we close out the video I want to remind everybody you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now I'll leave those links in the description below along with the recipe that I use today and thank you for watching if you haven't subscribed yet please do don't forget to give a thumbs up on your way out and I will see you guys in the next video take care", "9nBimiqnPnU": "hey guys welcome to my channel my name is valerie and today i thought i would do a little chat about cbd and review some products from a company called bluebird botanicals so if you're interested in that stick around i wanted to start this video with a brief description of what cbd is in case anybody needs a little background information cbd is the abbreviation for cannabidiol which is the second most prevalent cannabinoid in cannabis cannabis is an umbrella term for a plant family that includes both marijuana and hemp the main differences between marijuana and hemp is that marijuana contains high levels of thc hemp contains higher levels of cbd so the products we'll be talking about in this video today are cbd that is derived from hint the farm bill of 2018 basically legalized cbd that is derived from hemp and contains less than 0.3 percent thc cbd can help with things like anxiety insomnia it can help with pain relief and a whole bunch of other ailments i mostly use it for feelings of anxiousness and nervousness so let's talk a little bit about this brand bluebird botanicals when i first started researching cbd something i heard over and over again was make sure you check out the company that you're getting your cbd from especially if you're doing something like tinctures or gummies or pills you're ingesting the product so you want to make sure that the company is doing everything they can to keep their consumers safe so i did a lot of research about a lot of different brands and this one kept popping up and it checked off all of the boxes that i was looking for in a cbd brand according to their website bluebird botanicals is a family-owned business that has been around since 2012. their products are vegan and cruelty free and grown in the u.s they are certified by the u.s hemp authority and they are also a certified b corporation they use the co2 extraction method to get the cbd out of the hemp plant they also do third party lab testing and most of their products come with a certificate of analysis their website has a batch database all of their products will have a batch number and also a qr code and you can scan that and it will take you right to the batch database to look up the certificate analysis on that particular product the certificate of analysis will tell you things like the potency and also whether any toxins or chemicals were detected so it's really great information like i said for the the products that you're going to be putting into your body okay so let's talk a little bit about these products i wanted to very lightly dipped my toe into cbd when i first started so bluebird botanicals has a cbd isolate that is thc free it comes in a little one ounce bottle which retails for 79.95 however i found coupon codes and they have sales all the time on their website so i actually got this 50 off which made it not so bad a serving size is approximately 0.5 milliliters and that contains 25 milligrams of cbd i decided to start at 10 milligrams about 0.25 milliliters just to test it out and see what i noticed on it i didn't notice any changes at the 0.25 milliliters or about 10 milligrams i tried that for a few days and then i decided to up it to the serving suggestion which is the 0.5 milliliters or 25 milligrams of cbd so this is something that you're not going to notice an immediate effect with it's more of a gradual thing so the first time that i noticed it was working i was laying in this bed reading a book and i reached over to the bedside table to grab a full glass of water and i fumbled it and the water went everywhere it went behind the bedside table it soaked a um a power strip it soaked a power strip down there completely slipped it went all over my phone so i get up i go get a towel i come back i clean it all up i get another glass of water i sit back down in bed and i start reading my book again like a few seconds later mid paragraph i stopped reading and i was like holy [ __ ] this stuff is working because prior to being on cbd if that had happened it would have been a total [ __ ] show i would have freaked out i would have been terrified that i was going to get electrocuted by that soaked power strip i would have been worried that my phone was completely destroyed a pain in the ass now i have to move the dresser and get the water out behind it i definitely would have cussed which i did not do and i was like oh my god this stuff is really working i was almost shocked so anyway i was really happy with it um i actually finished the bottle so i went back to bluebird botanicals website because now i was interested in trying a full spectrum cbd to see if there was something to this entourage effect so the entourage effect is a term that's used to describe a bunch of different cannabinoids working together to enhance the effectiveness of the cbd so i picked up this bottle from bluebird from bluebird botanicals of their organic cbd oil it's a one ounce bottle that retails for 49.95 again i was able to find a coupon code and get it for 50 off so this one is a full spectrum cbd oil which means it's not thc free but it's still legal it's under the 0.3 percent amount one thing to keep in mind about full spectrum is that it has terpenes terpenes are what gives hemp the aroma that distinct aroma and also flavor so this one tastes very different from the thc free the thc free you basically only taste the carrier oil that they put it with which is mct oil and i think also i don't know if there's coconut oil in it or not but it's very un it's not offensive at all this one's pretty strong so i usually hold them under my tongue for about 30 seconds and then swallow it i tried this one for about two weeks and i didn't i didn't really notice it working as well as the thc free which i thought was really weird because i thought the entourage effect was going to be like 10 times better and it really wasn't for me so i ended up going back to the thc free and i bought this two ounce bottle that they offer around the time that i went to buy more cbd bluebird botanicals was offering a 70 off sale on their cbd lotion so i kind of thought why not so the two lotions that i got are 3.4 fluid ounces and they retail for 39.96 like i said it was 70 off so they were about 12 a bottle so i picked this one up it's the hemp silk softening and beautifying lotion i like to put lotion on my hands and feet in the winter right before bed so the um lotion that i was using prior to this was an aromatherapy lavender lotion that was supposed to help you relax and go to sleep at night so they tell you to rub it vigorously between your hands and then take a few deep breaths you know to help calm yourself before bed so i guess i was in the habit of that so i put this stuff on did that took a big breath let me warn you if you don't like the smell of hemp or pot or um if you're not used to it this will knock you on your ass i was not prepared for this i thought it would be like a a pretty lotion smell it's not it smells like hemp which is it's okay if you're used to it or even if you like it but for me it was a little bit too strong right before bed i've used it a few times it does help with moisturization so if you like the smell um i didn't really notice any effects as far as the cbd was concerned the other lotion i picked up is the cbd sport lotion i got this one more as like a little stocking stuffer for my husband for christmas because he is a very active guy and he was having some trouble with his elbow so i thought maybe this might help so he gave me his review on it that i will pass along to you and he says that it's sort of like taking an aspirin you have a lessening of the pain or a slight relief from the pain after applying the lotion to the area that you are having trouble with it also has wild mint which kind of hides that really strong hemp flavor so those are all of the products that i've purchased from bluebird botanicals i just want to say if you haven't tried cbd and you are having feelings of anxiousness nervousness this stuff has been life-changing for me i am so much calmer on this stuff one benefit that i've noticed is that i sleep a little deeper at night i'm a very light sleeper and i've noticed since i've started taking this that i don't wake up as many times during the night i also tend to get uh agitated i guess irritated i don't know when like people tap their feet or tap their fingers or my husband is a fidgeter and i am constantly you know when we're in the couch when we're in the couch when we're on the couch watching tv or something i'm constantly like stop stop stop moving stop whatever and he says i'm not doing that as much i hadn't even realized that that was just another benefit he told me just a couple days ago that i was not i guess nitpicking on little repetitive things like that so hey good yay anyway i highly recommend trying out cbd because if you are not an anxious overall nervous person you can't imagine how much calmer you can be on this stuff it's really done wonders for me so hopefully you found some good information in this video i'll link all these products down below just in case anybody's interested in looking at them they're not affiliate links or anything like that it's just links to bloopers websites so i hope you guys enjoyed this video i hope you have a great rest of your day thanks bye", "Ex4V2im8a5o": "your search for best CBD oil for pain can end here perhaps you're searching for the best CBD oil for acute pain the best CBD oil for chronic pain or maybe even the best CBD oil for pain for my dog there's so many options what do you do right hi my name is dr. Gerry Hosken I'm a retired chiropractor and I've taken a deep dive into finding out just how that all works I became a curious researcher when my wife had surgery and was unable to tolerate her prescribed pain medicine her surgeon prescribed just four little red jelly-like pills that were described as experimental at the time when he classified them as natural and evidence-based I was relieved but when he mentioned that they were derived from cannabis my curiosity peaked with just a bit of alarm as a doctor of chiropractic my class in pharmacology and toxicology was years in the past and it was far more aware of the popular side of cannabis than the medical aspects as a husband I was more concerned and even frantic to get my wife out of pain my wife's surgeon took time over lunch to explain the important changes in the medical application of cannabis products well this was the start of my look into additional natural methods of relieving those isolated pain problems that for one reason or another or no reason at all would not respond to conventional chiropractic or medical methods so just like I was I'm guessing you're looking for the best CBD oil for pain also right perhaps the best CBD oil for neck pain the best CBD oil for back pain so with all the things that come up when I'm in the search and with so many options what do you do well here's what I did so I didn't have a whole lot of pain problems but other people around me did my patients did so I just started using CBD oil for pain just to check it out now I wouldn't use it for acute pain and not like a migraine headache or a sprained ankle or something where you're in acute pain but more for chronic pain you know as an example I had some pain in my left shoulder that seemed to linger most often this chronic pain becomes aggravated from extended time at the computer followed by a night of restless sleep one of my chiropractic friends usually corrects the problem two or three months later my excitement for some online project would enticed me to spend too much time at my desk I know it's my fault that's on me I experimented with all the same topical products that were used in my practice and of course those products gave me very short-term relief and took the edge off the pain ironically I first search for the best CBD oil to alleviate some anxiety issues but then that's the story for another day however that search led to the information that indicated CBD oil could alleviate pain could cannabis products give more pain relief and last longer than the products from my chiropractic practice how well do they perform on more serious paint problems more serious than my minor pain challenges that I can take care of him in my own office from the facts that I found and the personal testimonials that I heard I would say yes yes they do perform better than the products that I've been using but how will they perform for you and for others I don't know you'll just have to find that out for yourself it's a personal decision that again you must decide that for yourself do your due diligence and make the decision personally I've been blessed with good health good health training and the ability to ignore pain many years of playing recreational level sports as an adult especially soccer and basketball helped raise my tolerance to pain boy did that change when I turned 80 years old now I'm using the pure hemp works relief to help relax and soothe muscles renew anti aging cream with apple stem cells to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines and then I'm using

Mike Hansen and in\u00a0\nthis video we're talking about CBD what is CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the story behind cannabidiol the cannabis product\u00a0\nthat gets you well not high you've heard of CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the cannabis product whose popularity has reached\u00a0\nalmost crazed lake proportions CBD has come from\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere to everywhere in just the last few years\u00a0\nit is perhaps best known for its ability to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce anxiety and promote happiness but CBDs\u00a0\napplications are seemingly endless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 successfully used to help with pain insomnia and\u00a0\ndepression there are some reports that it helps\u00a0\u00a0 with other medical conditions as well because\u00a0\nof its wide range of uses CBD infused products\u00a0\u00a0 are the fastest growing segment of the health\u00a0\nindustry even some pets are getting in on the\u00a0\u00a0 action for example CBD troubles are used to calm\u00a0\ndogs Carl's jr. the fast food chain has created a\u00a0\u00a0 burger served with a CBD infused sauce not that\u00a0\nI endorse calls jr. or any fast food for that\u00a0\u00a0 matter and New York City CBD infused coffee was\u00a0\nall the rage and sell at the camp and then there\u00a0\u00a0 is medical celebrities dr. oz and dr. Sanjay\u00a0\nGupta who actually advocate for CBD as well as\u00a0\u00a0 non-medical celebrities such as Joe Rogan Morgan\u00a0\nFreeman Quentin Paltrow then you got athletes such\u00a0\u00a0 as David Wells who argue on behalf of CBD use\u00a0\nin sports medicine where it's anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 power would allow players to recover more quickly\u00a0\nand not risk opioid addiction there are plenty of\u00a0\u00a0 MMA fighters who swear by it as well in Bubba\u00a0\nWatson a professional golfer said that his\u00a0\u00a0 decisions UCB was quote-unquote a no brainer the\u00a0\nFDA even joined the bandwagon last year at least\u00a0\u00a0 partially approving the CBD medication at the\u00a0\ndialects this is despite the fact that cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 remains illegal in eyes of the federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a lot coming down the pike and\u00a0\nif you want to know more about CBD or if you\u00a0\u00a0 have questions about it put it in the comments\u00a0\nbelow and make sure to give this video like

something that you guys have been probably hearing a lot about and that is CBD oil now big disclaimer right up front I'm in no way shape or form at all recommending that you take CBD oil this is something that you've got to do your own research you've got to decide whether or not it's right for you alright today I just want to share with you my experience and what I have found as a result of using CBD oil every day for the past seven months these are my bottles of CBD oil a few months ago back in April I did a video talking about my nighttime routine in that I sort of told you that I was starting to experiment with CBD oil and I was liking the results but I wasn't ready to share my thoughts I did that last video back in April about trying CBD I got tons of companies reaching out saying hey do you want to try my CBD do you want to try our CBD do you want to try our CBD the issue with CBD in this industry something that you're going to find out if you start exploring and experimenting is that anybody and their mother can create a private-label CBD company there are a lot of companies out there that manufacture hemp or that grow hemp that are like oh let's get in on the CBD market and their private labeling the stuff and so there are so many tons of different brands out there now the big issue is that you have no idea what you're taking you have no idea of the potency the strength and with CBD it is my personal opinion that you got to know what the hell you are actually taking a lot of these I would say the majority of these CBD companies out there you really have no idea and the only way you're going to be able to figure out dosage and if something's working and what you can change is if you have a super pure form of CBD oil and you actually are buying it from a company that is like in the business of standardizing things testing things and making sure that the product that they're giving you is pure and plant therapy is a company that's been around for years I have known about the because they specialize in essential oils and oil therapies and that is why the company plant therapy is my choice and my partner for this video I've been using plant therapies CBD oil for the past four months they're in the business of oils and extracts and making sure that the quality is there the transparency is their plan therapy is the best in the business in my opinion I have tried a lot of other CBD brands and I noticed the biggest difference when I was actually able to know what specific dosage I was taking and then monitor it and adjust it from there the plan therapy extracts are pure they do the research they cite all of their research guys they have done an amazing job cutting out all the [ __ ] and making sure that they are providing you incredible information something that I asked them to do for you because there are so much information out there when it comes to CBD oil on our landing page down below they have three sections that I encourage you to go and check out if you're thinking about experimenting or trying CBD oil number one is the frequently asked question you've got a question about CBD oil chances are somebody else has had that question it's going to be listed there along with the answer there's also going to be a section about the proposed benefits of CBD oil and then there's also and this is something that's incredibly important the serving chart so that you know sort of what you're taking how to sort of structure a plan that's going to be right for you and if after and only after you do all of your research you decide that you want to try CBD oil guys you will not go wrong buying from plant therapy we have a discount code there are also three different strengths there they have three different flavors you've got natural you are like unflavored you've got cinnamon and you've got pina colada I am a fan of the sentiment and the natural just doesn't really taste like anything that's it now let's talk about my experience with CBD alright so about seven months ago I decided it was finally time for me to try CBD oil I had been suffering with a little bit of anxiety I've also been suffering from some injuries from working out I've always slept like really good but three benefits primary benefits that you hear people reporting from trying CBD oil is sleep anxiety and sort of like inflammation now the reason why those three things are so like reported when it comes to CBD oil is what CBD oil is now I'm not going to attempt to try and explain what a cannabinoid is and how you've got different receptors like in your brain and in your body that's part of like the endocrine system I'm not going to go into the whole independent how cannabinoids work but if you are interested in learning why CBD oil is actually effective for treating certain things guys hit our link and go read sort of the FAQ s and more about CBD oil and how it really works but at the end of the day about seven months ago I decided I was going to give it a try for one is anxiety I have been a little bit stressed lately and not like feeling like myself and so I was you know like hey if this can help a little bit with anxiety and kind of just like take the edge off I'm good um the other thing is sleep now I typically sleep very well but I was like hey if it can improve my sleep I know that sleep is like one of the most important things that you're going to do during the day or during the night that's going to help you with so many other things and the other thing is inflammation I have been suffering because I exercise like all the time and I use my body hard I am always dealing with like some type of injury and I had something called plantar fasciitis for a few months and probably started about I don't know probably nine months ago and it just wasn't getting any better and it was a bit debilitating and so I'm like alright I got to try something because what I'm trying is not working and I did not want to go to like a position and just get like shot with like a cortisone shot or something like that I am a firm believer that nature can heal us but I'm not like some like crazy over-the-top like weirdo like never use like antibiotics and definitely get your vaccines but I am a believer in in nutrition I'm believer in supplements and taking multivitamins and vitamin b-complex and C and d3 like I believe in all that stuff I grew up on it I was in the nutrition industry for a long time and it's just something that I personally believe in for me and so I decided to give CBD oil a try I went to one of my buddies who was sort of in the business I'm like yo can you hook me up he's like yeah and so he sent me this I'm like all right I had no idea what I was doing but I was like all right I'm gonna try this at night now something else you need to understand they're really two types of different CBD oil there is full spectrum and there is broad spectrum CBD full spectrum means that it also has THC THC is the stuff in weed that gets you high now in CBD oil that is full-spectrum it is a very low dose like I think legally it has to be like under like 0.3% and and I could be wrong about that in order for it to be sold legally but I didn't want to take anything with THC I don't smoke weed personally not that I have anything against it I know a lot of people some of my best friends some of my loved ones absolutely do smoke weed it's just not something that I like I don't like the way that it makes me feel and so I decided to go with a broad spectrum full spectrum CBD has everything including a little bit of THC I didn't want that and so I went broad-spectrum and so I got my bottle I was like all right he's like yo use one dropper I'm like all right I had no idea what milligram I didn't know anything about that but at night before I went to bed like after I brushed my teeth and did all that I took a dropper under my tongue held it there under my tongue for about a minute swallowed it and that first night I slept like a frickin rock was it the CBD I had no idea all I knew is that I slept like a rock I'm like damn I slept like super sound I didn't sleep longer but when I woke up I felt just like invigorated I felt like I got more sleep than I actually did and so I'm like yo that was pretty awesome and so next night guess what I did boom exactly again and guess what I slept like a rock so month number one through three I took it one time a day at night before I went to bed and my sleep was good my anxiety I didn't really notice anything my plantar fasciitis in my body it's still eight and so I really didn't notice anything there and then once I started doing more research I realized that a lot of people are saying that you need to take CBD oil actually twice a day and so when I started with actually I started with this one therapy I started with the lowest dosage 16 milligrams or 16 milligram milliliters 500 milligram bottle like I said guys if you have no idea about dosage that link down below there's a chart that actually will talk you through sort of how to start using this and trying it and all that's good stuff anyway took it at night but then what I started doing in the afternoon at around 11 o'clock after I got done exercising I started taking it again and almost immediately I felt this like it was weird I felt this just like calmness and I'm like could it be like the CBD oil or is it totally like placebo effect but the next day did it again afternoon along with at night and I was chill I felt better and then I'm like alright I really got to test this out and so then the third day I didn't take it and I I don't know like I said I don't know if it was placebo effect I personally don't believe it is because I was like I was chilled I felt good I wasn't all like stressed out and anxious something else that happened about like two weeks after I started taking it twice a day my foot my leg it started to feel better I wasn't all like sore and getting like muscle cramps and spasms now I'm not saying that everything is linked I'm not saying that CBD oil cured everything but I know that my foot started to feel better and so the next bottle that I got from plant therapy actually upped the dosage to thirty three milligrams with a thousand milligrams bottle and and that's when it kind of like went away completely my pain in my foot twice a day rocking this and honestly I'm on my fourth bottle now of of the plant therapy CBD I feel better than I've felt in a really long time and I was a bit skeptical from from the first time I started hearing about CBD am I you know like I was like okay this is just a fad this really doesn't work and so going into it being a skeptic and really taking my time over the past seven months and sort of analyzing and trying different dosages and and and different amounts like I feel like I have like my formula for me and I'm going to continue to take CVD oil because I truly feel for me it was beneficial and I feel great and so I just wanted to do this video and kind of share my opinion my opinion is for me I feel like it's made a big difference for me I'm gonna keep doing it but I don't know I mean you've got to decide for yourself like I said there's a ton of information out there there also a ton of brands you've just got to be careful you've got to make sure that the brand that you're buying is pure you've got to make sure that you know what you're doing and you don't just like try like one milligram this day and one milligram that day and just like all over the place typically you don't just try something once and feel like amazing for me I don't know if it was placebo effect I don't know if it was the CBD oil but I noticed the difference my anxiety I noticed that immediately my sleep but regardless of if it was possible effect or not I don't care because I feel better I just wanted to do this video I told you that I would back in April when I sort of mentioned that I was starting to use CBD oil and seeing some positive results for me I'm gonna keep doing it for me I love it for me I truly feel like it's been a bit of a game changer in my overall well-being in health I don't know what the long-term effects of CBD oil is I don't know that it's been out long enough there could be adverse effects I have no idea but I know that for right now you know I I dig it and I encourage you that if you're somebody who struggles with something of you know sleep anxiety or maybe you know pain or some issues but but there are other things right because you know this endocrine system it's like a collection of like glands and it regulates hormones and just makes everything in your body work better and so do your research like I said there are other reported benefits but these were the three most reported and the three that I was interested in seeing if it would actually have an effect on me but at the end of the day guys you've got to decide for yourself do not do it because I'm doing it do it because you want to you have to do your research", "bCuju7IpnQ8": "can I take CED oil for arthritis so that CBD oil has anti-inflammatory effects so it works with our own endocannabinoid system which helps to when it's working correctly it aims for homeostasis so balance within the body and it helps to mediate and regulate the inflammation response and adding CBD to the endocannabinoid system can help to flush out or sort of mediate the inflammatory chemicals that go into our bodies so that can help with the pain for osteoarthritis it can also help with rheumatoid arthritis because of the antioxidant properties of CBD oil so the antioxidant properties that refers to reducing the the effects of oxidative stress by reducing the amount of reactive oxygen species and this chemical reaction obviously stress is linked to autoimmune diseases in general so reducing the amount of free radicals is what I call the oxygen reactive oxygen species in the body will also help to reduce the flare-ups polymers for arthritis", "kmYgH54FaCk": "hey everyone Ashton here with yogi approved and today I'm going to share with you my experience using CVD MD bath bombs let's check out what makes this product so unique bath bombs are all the rage when it comes to self care from the aromatherapy to the relaxation for your body and the soothing calming benefits for your mind also just the excuse to get you in the bathtub but when we add CBD to our bath bombs it takes that element of relaxation to a whole new level now for those of you who are unclear or maybe new to what CBD is let's break it down really fast so CBD is derived from the hemp plant and it is not psychoactive it does not contain any THC and it does not get you high but it does incorporate the therapeutic and relaxing elements of the hemp plant so when we put CBD together in a bath bomb it's just going to increase and boost the overall benefits of taking a bath to begin with up until CBD box I typically just used Epsom salt baths and while they were relaxing I didn't feel those long-term effects so what I noticed with these CBD bath bombs is that I feel the achiness and the soreness of my body melt away in the tub I'm not saying it's a cure-all but I am saying I can feel the difference and my favorite part about using these bath bombs is when I get out so after I'm done with my bath I still feel so relaxed and I'm able to sleep better I also noticed that I wake up feeling less sore which is really amazing to start my day on that note another part that I love about the CBD MD bath bombs is the aromatherapy they have six cents none of them disappoint my favorite is the standard lavender which is their relaxed scent and this aroma just fills the space it fills the tub and you can enjoy this scent throughout your bath each of these bath bombs contains 100 milligrams of broad-spectrum organic CBD CBD MD states that these bath bombs are safe for any skin type because they use natural coloring and no artificial ingredients or preservatives one important thing to note is that they do use food coloring for this color so if you have any sensitivities to that that's something to be aware of also some of these since due tint the water which is kind of fun but none of them have actually stained the bathtub what I respect about CBM D is that they are third-party tested meaning that their CBD is tested for quality and safety by a third party source finally for the amount of CBD that you're getting in each bath bomb this is a really great price point and even more of a value if you opt for their variety pack if you're interested in learning more about these CBD MD bath bombs or learning

Gundry podcast on this program we never shy away from controversial topics and today is no exception my guest Jenny sanssouci and I will be discussing the healing properties of cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms jenny is a health coach wellness blogger and the author of the new book the rebels apothecary a practical guide to the healing magic of cannabis CBD and mushrooms now she became an expert on these ancient remedies after her father was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer as it turns out something that was once considered taboo was key in helping her dad so she's here today to tell you how you can use these plants and fungi safely Jenny welcome to the program thanks so much for having me well this is gonna be fun so can you start by telling our listeners about why and how you got interested in mushrooms and cannabis sure yeah well in 2017 Thanksgiving 2017 my dad was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer as you said and that moment was a real before-and-after moment in my life if anyone you know has been diagnosed with cancer and knows someone diagnosed with cancer you know that hearing that information just completely changes your life in one instant so as soon as he got diagnosed I knew that I wanted to help in whatever way I could whether that was with nutrition or supplements or you know cooking for him or finding remedies that could work for him plant-based remedies anything that I could you know could get my hands on I wanted to I wanted to try to find for him and I had been working in the wellness world for many years and I had some connections with functional medicine doctors and people in the wellness arena and so I had this arsenal of people to reach out to and ask you know what are the things that I should look into when it comes to helping someone with not only treating the cancer but really helping with the chemotherapy side-effects in the immune system because I knew that I didn't know much about chemo or cancer at the time but I did know that that chemo can really affect the immune system and people can not tolerate it sometimes because their immune system is so weakened so I just thought you know what can I do to help my dad and I just went full force into the research and cannabis and medicinal mushrooms were the two things I kept hearing about over and over again and once I started to dive into the research there it was really really promising so that's that's the route we decided to go on so just so that everybody understands your dad was getting chemotherapy and so you're not going to come on and say you my dad never got chemotherapy all he did was have a joint and chew on a mushroom you know in fact in fact my dad was definitely sure that he wanted to go the traditional chemotherapy route for treating his cancer and I was not about to try to you know get him to do otherwise I'm not a doctor so I was not gonna I wasn't gonna go there but I knew that I could support him with some home remedies and we you know we talked to his oncologist and we got his oncologist on board with all the different things we were trying and he said you know I don't know if this is gonna help but it probably won't hurt so go ahead and we'll just keep monitoring his progress so he has the you know the chemotherapy regimen at the hospital and then we've had our our home regimen that we've been doing on the side you know that's actually great to hear because I work with a lot of cancer patients as well and so many of their their oncologists tell them no you know you may not do alternative therapies during this chemotherapy you know how dare you don't even come near this stuff it will hurt your chances so tell me actually tell us about that process how'd you how'd you find an oncologist that lets you do this number one yeah that's a really good point because I hear that from so many people that their oncologist said no absolutely not don't try cannabis you know medicinal marijuana CBD mushrooms and they say maybe it will hurt or they just don't have enough information about it to be able to say it's okay and luckily for us we we were paired with an oncologist who was open-minded to it he definitely did not recommend that we do it and he said you know this may not do anything but I'm not gonna tell you know so he didn't we were really lucky in that sense because a lot of oncologist don't do that so what I always tell people to do is when they speak to their oncologist about potentially using home remedies and their oncologist says no maybe you'll agree with this I always say what's the exact reason why they're saying no is there something specific to your condition maybe there is maybe there is a drug interaction maybe there is something very specific to you and you shouldn't use these home remedies or you know if not like maybe ask me on college if you on college us if you could try it for one cycle you know until your next scan and see if everything is still okay you know if there's not a specific reason to you maybe maybe they'd be willing to just let you see how it goes for one cycle so what made you tell us about the your research that said you know we need to look into cannabis and CBD and medicinal mushrooms what brought that to the forefront well one of the things that happened really early on when my dad first got diagnosed is he watched a documentary about medical marijuana and it was and he had just recorded it because he thought it looked interesting he wasn't even interested in it for himself he just wanted to watch it and it was all about cancer patients that were using medical cannabis and having really good results you know not only with their cancer but with their with their side effects of their chemo and so he his ears perked up at that immediately and at the same time CBD was just starting to emerge and one of my friends said hey just look into CBD and cancer and see what you find and I started researching that and I found so many stories of people who were using medical cannabis and CBD who have cancer and were experiencing relief and then I started to look into studies I went to a medical cannabis conference I started to get in touch with medical cannabis doctors and ask them what their experience had been and I just went straight down the rabbit hole and I I was you know I was really impressed by what I found in medical cannabis and then with the mushrooms I had already known that medicinal mushrooms could be helpful for the immune system that was something that was already in my consciousness but I didn't know a lot about them and when I started to go down the route the route of researching mushrooms I found so much information there is about medicinal mushrooms being used in cancer hospitals and other parts of the world and people using it to help their immune systems know is really really interesting okay so explain to people as if they don't know the difference may hopefully most people know so what's the difference between cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms and our medicinal mushrooms different than magic mushrooms yeah so cannabis CBD is part of the cannabis plant it's a compound within the cannabis plant and it's a compound that doesn't get you high so THC is the compound that most people are familiar with inside the cannabis plant that does get you high so they're two different molecules that are both within the same plant the mushrooms the medicinal mushrooms all the ones that my dad is taking and most of the ones that I write about in the book are completely non psychedelic so there's you know when people think about mushrooms they usually think of grocery-store mushrooms like button mushrooms portabellos Khomeini's or magic mushrooms that are going to take you on it on a trip there's another class of mushrooms that's considered medicinal mushrooms which is their edible and you know you can consume them and they have medicinal properties but they're not psychedelic gotcha and you want for the listeners you want to name some of those medicinal mushrooms yeah yeah some of the the ones that that I cover in the book and that my dad has been taking everyday chaga mushroom reishi turkey tail is a big one that's one of the first ones that we got him started on shitake is a wonderful actually a really great one for right now - because it's shitake has been shown to be antiviral so that's a really interesting one to look at lion's mane and cordyceps and maitake I believe those are those are all the all the ones and then I do I do cover magic mushrooms a little bit in the book too because there's some really interesting things going on in the search with with psilocybin which is a compound inside magic mushrooms but that's not the main thing that that we've been focusing on but it's definitely an interesting one to pay attention to all right so you keep bringing up the immune system with mushrooms in terms of medical marijuana and CBD where where's the benefit that with this in in cancer patients sure yeah with the immune system with the cannabis what we had found with our research into cannabis is that THC and CBD both have properties that have been shown to kill tumors and and slow tumor growth and they can help with the immune system there's not enough research there yet because they can't do clinical trials on cannabis because of the legality so this is a lot of preliminary research and anecdotal stories so that's with cannabis with the mushrooms all of the mushrooms that I just mentioned aside from magic mushrooms but all the medicinal mushrooms that I mentioned have been shown to have immune system modulating properties so they don't necessarily stimulate the immune system or you know dampen the immune system they balance the immune system so they're they're considered adaptogens so they can just help keep your immune system in balance and all of them are really powerful for you know keeping that immune system strong yeah we I have a patient who oh I think he's now 10 years out from stage 4 pancreatic cancer and he we treated him basically with a raw food diet and a lot of mushroom extracts particularly coleus turkey tail and he's like I say knock on wood he's cancer-free now for 10 years and it's amazing now so I'm a huge supporter you know using plant-based therapy in cancer so and I'm you know again I've seen it with my own eyes and and and written about it in my books so can any of these I know that when you have chemotherapy it's not exactly the most wonderful trip so and a lot of patients complain of pain of GI upset of sleep of energy loss anxiety what's the deal with these compounds with that yeah well the cannabis my dad the cannabis that my dad has been taking in a lot of other cancer patients also take this it's a very highly concentrated cannabis oil that comes in a little plastic syringe and you eat these small droplets of this cannabis oil tiny tiny droplets the size of a grain of rice and that can give you around 50 milligrams of THC and 50 milligrams of CBD if you have a one to one ratio product in one drop so that's a very high dose for people that don't know about 10 milligrams of THC is considered a recreational dose that someone may you know use to get high so 50 milligrams is a really really high amount so you have to really start slowly with that kind of medical cannabis product but what my dad has found with that it is really really taken away his nausea completely he's barely ever had nausea and it's two and a half years in now he's hardly had any nausea his appetite came back as soon as he started taking this cannabis oil which a lot of cancer patients I'm sure you know they completely lose their appetite they lose so much weight and that really contributes to them feeling sicker and sicker as time goes on because they're not able to nourish themselves so that was amazing right off the bat he started to be able to eat full meals again and feel really well and then he sleeps great because he takes a higher dose at night he doesn't like to take a higher dose during the day because he still wants to get things done and not feel too you know impaired by the THC but at night he's okay taking a little bit more and he has slept well the entire time so I think that has been the main that's helped ease his side effects from chemotherapy and then I believe that the mushrooms are what's keeping his immune system strong so he hasn't been weakened by the chemo got you so your book is trying to remove the the drug stigma of cannabis and mushrooms why is that important to you well yeah you know when III quit drinking and quit using all drugs back in 2007 so it's been for me I swore off cannabis and mushrooms back then and alcohol and you know I used cannabis and mushrooms in college recreationally and I never thought of them as medicine I never would have even had a reason to think of it as medicine and so for me that part is really important because my perception of all of this has completely changed throughout my research and I've done so much research now into you know the prohibition of cannabis and you know the legalization of psychedelic mushrooms and it is just it has always been focused around patients and I mean of course there's people that that want to use it recreationally but there has been so much focus throughout the years on you know getting these plants to patients who really who really need to find relief and I didn't realize that before so it's really important to me to try to help to shift that perception to see how these can be medicinal for people and that it's not just about getting high or or going on a mushroom trip it's it's so much more than that so you mentioned that the dose is is enough to get you high what if what if you don't want this effect how do you avoid it yeah so if you're using these in the in the book I do talk about a lot of different wellness wellness topics and not just cancer so for cancer patients specifically if you do want to take the THC and use that medicinally and not feel the high you're just gonna want to work up really really slowly a tiny tiny tiny amounts of THC for most people two milligrams of THC is the the threshold if you go above two milligrams you kind of start to feel those those intoxicating effects if you start a little bit lower and move up you know every few days a couple more milligrams and just monitor how you're feeling that can be a really helpful way if you don't want to feel it at all I would take a high CBD product with little to no THC in it and that will you know give you the medicinal effects of the CBD without without having the THC but they do work better together so if you have a little bit of each in there they boost each other up so if you can tolerate a little bit of THC for the medicinal effects that's great but you don't have to you know and if you're not using it for for your cancer journey and you're using it more for wellness then you can absolutely just take a high CBD product with very small trace amounts of THC okay so let's get away from cancer for a minute and let's talk about wellness so give us your take it's the thoughts or the book on why these may promote wellness how do they pronoun promote wellness and let's go from there sure well one of the things that I found right off the bat through my research for my dad was all these different ways that it might be able to help me to which is you know a totally different realm of why I use them versus why my dad using them but for CBD in particular some of the the main things people use it for our pain sleep and anxiety those are probably the top three and I personally found help with sleep right away and the interesting thing with sleep anxiety and pain is that a lot of times when people can't sleep it's because of anxiety or pain either they they have some painful part of their body and they can't sleep because of that or racing thoughts having having those anxious feelings during the night not being able to sleep so using the CBD can take away the thing that is keeping you from sleeping and help you sleep deeper which is what I experience because I can have anxiety when I'm trying to fall asleep and before I started on CBD I would frequently you know take a long time to fall asleep and then wake up a lot during the night with racing thoughts and when I started the CBD I was really - just sleep better so that was that was awesome and as far as the pain goes there was another kind of before-and-after moment that my dad experienced with CBD which was before he got on the medical marijuana train he was just taking CBD that's all we had access to at the time and what he noticed right off the bat was that his joint pain went away just from taking the CBD he was taking CBD capsules and he said I don't even need to take advil anymore he used to have all this joint pain walking up and down the stairs he's been an athlete his whole life so he says all these aches and pains and he was like I'm I'm impressed by that and he's not one of those people that just gets on the bandwagon quickly you know so he that was really impressive so the pain sleep and anxiety are three things that CBD can be amazing for so let's I have a lot of patients who have tried CBD primarily for sleep and for pain and I would say that just as a general rule 50% of them seem to respond and 50% of them don't and of the people who respond what's been fascinating to me is half the people particularly with pain respond to the topical CBD but don't to the oral and the other half they respond to the oral but not to the topical so help me understand this what's going on sure well yeah a base level of why people respond to it differently is because we all have an endocannabinoid system as I'm sure you know in our body that responds and reacts with the cannabis directly so and everyone has their own dr. Ethan Russo who's a cannabis researcher he he calls it the endocannabinoid tone that we all have this baseline tone kind of like everybody has a different digestive system you know your gut flora is going to be different than mine you have a different endocannabinoid system than me so you may have different levels of natural cannabinoids which we make in our body in your system than I do so the cannabis will well and CBD in particular will kind of raise those love raise the levels of the natural cannabinoids that we have in our system so if someone has a lower amount versus a higher amount they're gonna respond differently which is why dosing can be really tricky and is really really personal with CBD dosing and method of delivery like you said some people will respond to a topical some to a tincture it's all gonna really be based on the person's individual endocannabinoid system so let's talk about dosing and how do you know what you're getting obviously marijuana and CBD are legal here in California and we've we've got these shops almost on every street corner now and how how do you figure out okay well is this stuff legit this stuff came from hemp this actually came from the marijuana plant some people argue no no you got to have marijuana base CBDs hemp CBDs no good come on help us sort this out yeah well you're you're lucky to be in California because I really think California especially at the license dispensaries have have have it figured out in a really wonderful way I wish that all dispensaries could be like the ones that I've visited in California and that's because they have a very wide array of ratios of product ratios out in California with different levels of CBD to THC that you can pick from and choose your your ratio because like I said if the more THC in a product the more you're gonna feel those intoxicating effects and so you know you can have a ratio of eight to one CBD to THC or twenty to one and you can try all these different ratios to see what works for you so I think that's wonderful but to answer your question the most important thing right now when you're looking for a product especially a CBD product that's not from a dispensary because those are unregulated you want to make sure you find you had they have a third-party lab test so that's to show that the amount of CBD that they say is in the product is actually on the lab test so if it says 25 milligrams per serving you want to say see that on the lab as well and you want to make sure that it's negative for heavy metals pesticides residual solvents that could have come through the processing because CBD like I said is totally unregulated right now it's really important to get those lab tests if you do get it from a licensed dispensary they have stricter regulations with the kind of products they're able to sell so you're probably better off that way but even if you're getting it from a dispensary you may want to ask and see the lab test to make sure what what you're getting is really what it says on the label so if I'm on my road trip and I stop at the gas station and they've got CBD oil at the checkout counter which I've seen that's probably not the one I want to buy for sure yeah you really want to do your research and make sure the company is is doing like I said those third-party lab tests meaning someone else is doing the lab tests it's not affiliated with the company so they can't you know make it up and it's and you want to make sure that they're using safe practices and then just answer your question about the hemp versus marijuana right now it's all legal terms so hemp hemp face CBD versus marijuana based CBD is basically just about the amount of THC and other cannabinoids which are other compounds within the cannabis plant that are in the product so if it's hemp hemp face CBD it's basically just very very minimal THC it was going to be in that plant that was grown for that CBD and if it's marijuana based CBD it basically just means that in that plant there was a higher level of THC and this is all you know these numbers are are just kind of you know the numbers that they're using to differentiate these plants but it's all the same comes from the same plant at the end of the day now bring us up to date the DEA once classified this substance as really nasty stuff where do we stand where do we stand with the DEA and where do we stand with the FDA with these substances well right now cannabis is still a schedule 1 drug federally so I hope that that will change I don't know for sure when it will I mean people predict that that will change within the next couple of years CBD in as of 2018 became legal federally which is why you see the CBD boom everywhere so CBD from hemp which just means point three percent THC or less is federally illegal anything more you have to get from a licensed dispensary which will be different in every state some states have Medical dispensaries only which you're gonna need a medical card in order to access those products and so you have to go to a doctor get approved for a medical marijuana card and then you can go to a dispensary some states have recreational or adult use dispensaries which is usually twenty-one plus and right now it just varies from state to state so things are changing everyday my hope is that it will become federally legal soon all right I'm going to throw you a something out of left field what do you know about black urine disease so I have a very good friend and I won't mention his name who ran a company that was really big into CBD and kind of put their whole careers into that and was working very hard with the FDA to get FDA approval for CBD and you probably know that the FAA does not approve so yeah yeah and interestingly enough and I did not know this because he said I'm sure you've heard a black urine disease and he said no I I haven't he says well it turns out that too much CBD can actually affect the same receptors in the liver that tylenol hits acetaminophen and can actually poison the liver and it was discovered because some very heavy CBD users notice their urine was turning dark like they hepatitis and it got the name black urine disease and he tells me and I'm not I haven't talked to the FDA about this that the FDA is worried that big-time CVD use and I don't know the dose may potentially damage the liver and that's why they put the brakes on this but but look it up it's fascinating yeah you know I have seen some things talking about CBD damaging the liver because of studies that they did in my surahs' and from what I could gather from these studies the amount of CBD they had to give these rats was was huge like thousands and thousands and thousands of milligrams of CBD like what it would what it would equal with a human it seemed very very I got huge stretch to me but I will look that up and see see what the what they're saying about black hair and disease that sounds pretty scary and you probably couldn't afford to take that much right so let's get back to that is there is there evidence is there at least anecdotal reports about the amount of CBD that you have to use to be effective you mentioned that everybody's endo cab enoyed systems different so what what what should people look for why do they try what do you recommend yeah as far as dosing I mean I've heard from doctors that practice with with cannabis medicine that some patients do well on five milligrams of CBD and some people do well on 500 milligrams of CBD depending on their condition so it's really really different but what I can say is a starting point for CBD you want to start really low and take it by itself and monitor how you feel you know every 15 minutes like do you feel anything different do you feel you're more relaxed do you feel any relief of pain do you feel any relief of anxiety or whatever it is that you're trying to find relief from and pay really close attention and only take more if you feel no nothing if you feel nothing take a little bit more you could start with like five milligrams even something really small and see if you feel anything if not you know around fifteen to twenty five milligrams is a standard dose for people for many people a standard kind of wellness dose and then if you're having a high amount of pain or anxiety you may need to take you may need to take a little bit more and just kind of move up until you find the relief that you're looking for or switch products if it's if it's not working for you or methods of delivery there like you said before you know topicals work really well for some people for people for pain for anxiety a lot of people like to take the tincture under the tongue because that works usually within 15 minutes or so and you can really measure your dose drop by drop so I would suggest starting with it with a sublingual tincture because that that's how you can really really get a measured dose and say okay I took it's this exact amount where some of the other methods you can't always know exactly how much you're taking okay so we talked about anxiety pain sleep and you use the buzzword the wellness dose of CBD so again help me experimentally anecdotally where does CBD fit in a wellness regimen sure well like I said before we all have this endocannabinoids system in our body that CBD works directly with and we have our own molecules inside our body that work with this same system that CBD can help to regulate those those molecules and they affect things like you know pain sleep the immune system anxiety depression mood they have they have so many things that this endocannabinoids system affects it really keeps you in homeostasis or keeps you in balance so taking CBD as a daily tonic is kind of you know tonify z-- your endocannabinoids system and can keep things in balance many people just find that taking it you know a day as a daily thing whether it's at night or during the day depending how you respond can just make you overall you know feel more balanced got you okay interesting dr. McCullen and I have talked about CBD for sleep when we've been on each other's podcast and we back years ago now did 20 milligrams of CBD sublingual before bed and tracked our sleep with an aura ring which I'm holding up on camera and quite frankly neither of us found any effect on our sleep and as I recall I won't put words in his mouth he even tried it with THC and also found no effect for him or me so we both kind of stopped doing it but you're right maybe our endo cab annoyed system is so phenomenally balanced and I hope it is that maybe we would not see that effect so that yeah or the other part is that sometimes taking certain amounts of CBD or THC can be more wake promoting for some people and especially taking a little bit too much THC can kind of make you have those racing thoughts or can cause anxiety for some people so that yeah I know this it is so so personal and some people will say I take CBD it makes me more focused and awake and some people say they take it and it makes them fall asleep so it's yeah it's an experimental journey alright so I'm sure everybody wants to know because you're a rebel apothecary in' should we be regulating these substances what's the best approach to regulating them if they should be regulated yeah I mean I really think that some of the licensed dispensaries in California are doing a really good job with with the way that they are providing their products I think that cannabis products with THC should be most likely just allowed in licensed dispensaries but I do think it should be federally legal I do think that people that wants access to cannabis medicine should be able to have access to it I don't think it should just be you know sold at gas stations and have these low quality products on the market I think that there should be should be staying third party lab testing for all cannabis products and all CBD products I do think they should be regulated in a way where they have to you know contain exactly what they say on the label so yeah I do I do think it should be legal federally and just as long as as long as the regulations are in place to keep people safe so we're not going to pull up to the gas station and get a six-pack of beer and a brownie to go I would say make your own brownies at home which there are some recipes AHA I knew I could get a plug in for you there you know with the magic mushrooms and legality and regulation they're the predictions that are happening for those are that they'll be legal within therapeutic settings because they are researching them for depression and even you know comparing them to SSRI depression drugs and seeing you know how they affect people so I think that those mushrooms which are currently illegal as well will will be available for use in therapy and I don't think those should just be you know available a gas station either those should be you know closely monitored yeah Mike Michael Pollan ism has made uh I think a very strong point that there is good increasing evidence that there is some bona fide medical use for these I think particularly in depression and yeah we need and you you know you argue for this that we need to look at this as another federally regulated license use of these products for specific reasons all right yeah absolutely and I think you're right and maybe you talk about that the use of these products kind of in your own home is probably at least in our state of understanding not a great idea this should be taken with a practice professional in a setting in a controlled setting what say you I say if we're talking about psychedelic mushrooms I would definitely recommend that people don't just try it alone whether it's with a trained therapist or someone who has a lot of experience guiding people through these types of sessions I definitely think that having having guidances is the way to go yeah I had a personal experience in college where I one of my members in my singing group dropped acid and decided to we were on the third floor of our dorm and he threw up open the windows and decided he was going to fly and luckily I grabbed him by his belt and pulled him back in this is a true story so I firmly believe from personal experience that this should be done in a guided setting yes yes if you take a little bit too much of a psychedelic compound you mean it can take you to places that you aren't ready to go by yourself so definitely right in 30 including the ground from a third-story window yeah all right well Jenny this has been great thanks so much for joining me and where do they find out about you your book your work first of all thank you so much for having me this has been just such a great conversation and I'm glad you have so much personal experience with the topic too that makes it really enjoyable to talk about so thank you my book is called the rebels apothecary so you can buy that anywhere where books are sold except right now we can't go into bookstores so online you can find that my blog is healthy crush calm and you can find me also on Instagram Jenny sanssouci healthy crush dot-com I'm sure there's a story what's the crush well the healthy cards I've actually been writing there since 2008 so I've been blogging about wellness and personal development topics for quite a long time and the healthy crush just kind of popped into my mind the tagline is a love affair with living well okay the way the way I've always felt about you know finding out about new wellness topics and getting excited about them and very very good very good okay it's time for our audience question Sandra Liliana on Facebook asks is keto diet safe for people with heart conditions believe it or not I do use my version of the ketogenic diet for my patients with heart disease who have also for instance diabetes as a co-founding factor and as a cause of their heart disease the key and my ketogenic diet is you got to eat about 80 percent of your calories from fat but that fat shouldn't be ribeye steaks it should be fats from avocados and for you people who are watching I have avocado socks on today and they should be from olive oil and the more olive oil macadamia nuts you eat macadamia nut oil sesame oil the better and the key of a ketogenic diet is to really severely limit your carbohydrates to really leaves and vegetables that are going to carry olive oil and avocados into your mouth that's totally different than a paleo or carnivore keto diet where the vast majority of the foods you're gonna eat our heavy cheese's heavy meats heavy fats you know three bottles of cream every day that's not what I use for my heart disease patients so you got to be careful in the term keto diet there's a good way to do keto and there's a bad way to do keto particularly for heart disease so that's a great question Sandra and thank you very much all right Jenny thank you again and good luck with the book and best wishes to your father how's he doing by the way he's doing fantastic I've actually been quarantined up here with him for the last six weeks and he has felt so good the whole time we keep saying we forget that he has cancer he's been off of chemo now for the past three months I'm just cuz he's been doing so well that his oncologist said why don't we give you a break and his blood markers are in the normal range his tumors have all been stable so we're happy hey very good very good all right keep up the good work great thank you so much thanks for having me take care and now it's time for the review of the week following my most recent episode ANCOVA 19 we Dobrin Ellie jr. on YouTube wrote thank you dr. Gundry clear info without fear and hype well thank you that was concise and we're trying to give you the up to date information without I put out the fear because as you know I'm dr. Gundry and I'm always looking out for you so see you next week thanks for the review before you go I just wanted to remind you that you can find the show on itunes google play stitcher or wherever you get your podcasts because i'm dr Gundry and i'm always looking out for you [Music]", "cGtiVP83s10": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so in today's video I am doing a video request a couple of you guys have asked me in my comments and also on my other social media accounts to do a video on CBD because I talked a lot about it so you guys kind of want to need to talk about what CBD is how I use it and the products that I use so I'm going to do that today I'm sure you could tell by the title of this video but if you found this video helpful be sure to give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss my future videos so what is CBD CBD just stands for cannabidiol which is a strain of a cannabinoid and cannabinoids are just chemical compounds that share the same structure as THC aka what's found in marijuana now I'm not a scientist or chemist or anything of that nature I actually failed chemistry in high school so the way that my brain understands it is that there's THC and then there's CBD now THC is obviously what's found in marijuana it's the psycho active part of marijuana that gets you high and then CBD on the other hand doesn't get you high so it's non psychoactive and it's used more for pain management and mental health problems nowadays in 2018 THC is finally being used for medical purposes in many many states finally it's used for cancer patients patients with neurological conditions they've actually done studies that THC in combination with CBD together they actually inhibit tumor growth and they decrease the proliferation of cancer cells so they stop cancer cells from growing this is a whole other topic for a whole other day I'm such a strong supporter of the legalization of marijuana I just can't really wrap my mind around the fact that medical marijuana is still illegal in some states and it's been illegal for all these years and even though it's legal like medical marijuana right now is legal in my state but it's so freakin hard to get it like you have to have really really like horrible diagnosis to get it and I just can't wrap my mind behind the fact that it could also help people with conditions like you know anxiety depression more like minor conditions not that those are minor conditions they're awful but um I don't know I feel like it should just be more readily available for more patients and more people and especially since like I work in the healthcare field so I see many many patients on a daily basis that would probably benefit from medical marijuana and not only that but like doctors push prescription medications so much and prescription medications are more deadly and more addictive than marijuana is or CBD or anything and I'm just wondering why we're pushing drugs to people that could potentially kill them when marijuana has never killed anyone I'm just saying that's a whole other topic for a whole other day like in my opinion everything can be abused alcohol can be abused sex can be abused food can be abused through overeating like like everything can be abused but yet all those things are still legal anyways with CBD you can get the health benefits of marijuana without actually getting high maybe you don't like getting high maybe you get drug tested for your job maybe I don't know there are a lot of possibilities in which a person does not want to smoke marijuana but with CBD you don't have to get high it's an all-natural substance that you can benefit from without getting high now CBD is great because it is completely 100% legal in all 50 states and you don't have to find a drug dealer when you're in pain so that's good news right so all of us have cannabinoid receptors in our brain and in our nerves so when we take CBD it binds with those receptors and helps us deal with chronic pain or anxiety or depression or whatever the case may be now I know I talked about in videos before I have a lot of chronic pain issues and a lot of my subscribers are subscribed to me because you also have the same issues I have vulvodynia so I have chronic vaginal pain internal and external I have chronic back pain which I'm actually going to an orthopedic surgeon in like two weeks to go get evaluated I have chronic neck pain I have chronic pelvic pain I have a lot of issues like clearly something is not working right in my body I also have social anxiety general anxiety and depression so I have a lot of not only physical pain but also I have a lot of mental health issues as well so this is kind of what got me into CBD yes I used to smoke marijuana all the time before that was in my like wild community college days now I worked six days a week you know I have stuff to do when I get home it's just not practical for me to like sit around and get high every single day so that's kind of how I discovered CBD now multiple studies have been done about CBD being addictive and studies actually found that CBD is not addictive at all and it's actually less addictive than marijuana and I know a lot of people with will argue with me on the fact that marijuana is not addictive but honestly a lot of things can be mentally addictive if it's in the hands of the wrong person or the wrong personality do I think marijuana is addictive no but it's just like anything else in life like you can become addicted to food you can become addicted to alcohol you can become addicted to sex and even though those things we don't see as addictive they become addictive when you are in the wrong mindset if that makes any sense at all so CBD is found to not be addictive at all even when you have that like addictive personality or mindset it's actually shown to not be addictive at all so that's fun now I'm not gonna sit here and say you know CBD is a miracle product it cured my pain I'm just saying it does help me take the edge off a little bit let me just kind of quickly explain exactly what pain the CBD helps me with it helps me with my back pain it helps me with my neck pain it helps me with my anxiety and if I'm having internal vaginal pain it helps me with that the external skin pain and irritation it doesn't help it all with and it doesn't completely take my pain away but it does help reduce my pain level so it's not like you're gonna take you know a couple drops of CBD and all of a sudden you're gonna go out and live your life and everything's gonna be great it just kind of helps take that edge off so it gets me to a point where I can get up out of bed I can clean my room I can go to work I can do things and function with my pain if that makes sense and because CBD binds to the receptors in the brain it also helps with things like mental health so I do notice when I'm really anxious I'll take CBD and it helps take the edge off to the point where like I'm not gonna have a panic attack but I'm still nervous just not as nervous as I was before make sense with my depression it doesn't help me I know some people with depression say they take CVD and it helps them for me personally I haven't noticed a difference with my depression but yeah anyways I'm gonna show you the products that I use and why I like to use them and anything that I mentioned in this video will be linked in the description box down below so make sure you check that out so first I'm going to talk about CBD oil because this is the most popular you know method of taking CBD so most people take CBD and a little tincture like this come on there we go so a lot of people take CBD and a little tincture like this there are a million brands on the market that sell CBD and tinctures like this so this one is by the brand foria foria is actually um a brand that sells CBD products for women with vaginal pain so that's cool shoutout to them so this one has 21 milligrams of CBD per 0.5 milliliters um this I will say I have a very strong tolerance for CBD and for anything really um I know it's weird because I'm like such a tiny person but I have a very very very very high tolerance for pretty much everything so I have to take a lot of CBD for it to work for me so other people you might take you know a half milliliter of this and you notice the effects but for me I have to take a lot of CBD and unfortunately that's just something that you have to play around with and find your tolerance if you take it and don't notice a difference take some more until you notice a difference so unfortunately for me I'm like this with literally everything I have a very very high tolerance for any kind of like supplement herb medication anything you name it I have a very high tolerance so I could take a lot so I usually will take like two droppers full this like a full-size one milliliter dropper I'll take two of them until I notice a difference this is the most popular method of CBD you just I just take it fill up the dropper uh-huh I just dripped it all over my mouth that was a really bad demonstration I put it under my tongue and then I just kind of like let it sit there for a minute and then swallow it that's how I ingest it so this is probably the most popular method I've tried many many many different CBD tinctures and honestly can't find the best one so if you have a suggestion let me know now I will mention that forea has this lubricant called awaken which has CBD in it and it's really expensive for this tiny bottle so I've only used it like twice did I notice a difference maybe a slight difference but I still have pain with sex so I don't know I just have issues but I did once you mention this because a lot of women really really like this and they also are coming out with suppositories that you can put like inside your vagina for internal pain and I'm really excited to try those they also have ones if you live in a state where marijuana is legal they also have suppositories that I've THC in them so I don't know if you can order those online or where you get them but this brand does make THC and CBD suppositories for vaginal pain so yeah not just vaginal pain but like pelvic pain as well so oh the least common way of ingesting CBD and probably my favorite method is smoking it now this is CBD it's not marijuana it actually has like the most trace amount of THC in it that it's completely legal in all 50 states to purchase so it looks like this so this is just pure CBD flour now I smoked this just like would with marijuana I basically just grind it up put it in a bowl and I smoke it now this is my favorite way of ingesting CBD because I feel like it takes effect faster and I feel like it's stronger than just using the oil so I feel like when I smoke it I'm getting the effects within like 20 minutes compared to like an a half hour to an hour with the oil tincture and I feel like since I'm smoking an entire bowl I'm probably getting in more milligrams of CBD then I would if I was just taking the oil so I get this from a company called tweedle farms like I said I'll leave everything linked below it's completely legal in all 50 states to order online it looks like marijuana it even comes with a little slip in the package when you buy it that says like this may look like marijuana but it's actually not and it has like this big scientific explanation as to why it's not marijuana in case like someone thinks you're transporting drugs through the mail or something honestly I find it to be cheaper to just buy the flower then the tinctures honestly the oral like the tinctures are like a hundred dollars and this was I want to say forty five dollars and I've had this for almost two months now this bag so it does last me a lot longer than the oil and it's cheaper now they also make CBD products like this this is a vape pen it's falling out this is a vape pen from CBD luxe and it's called be calm so this one has essential oils in it it's CBD coconut oil lavender chamomile and valerian oil so this is just you just I think I used it all up almost and it tastes like essential oils but this I don't find it helps me with my pain but it helps me with my anxiety it helps me relax so I just wanted to show you that there are like vape pens out there vaporizers there are different ways of ingesting CBD last but not least I wanted to show you this guy this is by the brand sagely it's their CBD and tumeric pills so you can also get CBD in pill form so tumeric I take every single day as a supplement I take the Gaia I think that's how you say it supplements I take it every single day for inflammation because tumeric is really good at controlling inflammation so any kind of like back pain neck pain pelvic pain that I have it does help with that this guy has CBD and tumeric combined so this has 10 milligrams of CBD per capsule so usually like this morning what I did I was in a hurry to go to work so I took two of these and I took um one milliliter of the oil so that was like 40 50 60 milligrams of CBD and that helped me like get through work this morning so I just wanted to show you that they also make capsules there are many many brands that make capsules if you're not a fan of the oil or if you're not a fan of smoking it but the capsules are also really expensive so if you're someone like me where unfortunately you need a large amount of CBD in order to feel something it can get really freakin pricey they also make things like creams that have CBD in this is the sagely CBD cream it's like a lotion that has CDD in it this is just like the little sample packet that they sent me but they have options like that in case you wanted to like rub it on your neck or your back they also make like CBD coconut oil which I really want to try I for skin irritation I know some women tell me you know with their vaginal pain if they have like skin pain they put the CBD oil on their skin and it helps with me I haven't noticed it notice the difference with that so you just kind of have to see what works best for you through trial and error and yeah I think I covered everything that you guys were asking if you have any other questions comments suggestions concerns leave them down below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and I will see you in my next video bye guys", "i8ITLj9AHdQ": "hello again everybody and welcome back to your career economists in today's episode we will be making CBD coconut oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button for those of you that are new to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much so I'm gonna leave a link to my CBD MCT oil and that's gonna kind of go over the entire deke art process so I'm just gonna run through a really quick today I've already packaged up my biotics flower and I have that right beside me here this is 24 grams of Vioxx flour which came in at 21.1% CBD and this is our bag of flour so I'm just gonna put this in the oven for 30 minutes D carb at 250 degrees okay so while we're waiting for the flour to D carp I'm gonna go over some of the materials you'll need to make the CBD coconut oil first you're going to need coconut oil now I have organic coconut oil just run to the middle nothing crazy I got this larger container at BJ's you can pick it up yourself you always get it on Amazon I like to use organic stuff same thing with my MCT oil it's just if you're going to be putting this kind of stuff into your body you're gonna want it to be organic and we've put all that effort into making our head flour organics so why not just buy some more more organic products the other thing you'll need is you'll need to measure out 2 cups of coconut oil and I'll get into that too but you definitely don't want a measuring cup and of course in today's video we'll we will be featuring the magic butter machine now this recipe can be used without a magic butter machine but for today's purposes we are going to be using a magic butter machine some people use crock pots some people use a bunch of other stuff I just like the magic butter machine because it's just a no mess situation its cleanup is super easy but you can't use another household kitchen gadgets so now we'll wait for the flour and we'll start making the oil okay so our canvas has just D carved in the oven so before we take it out we are going to add the coconut oil to the magic butter machine again if you're using a crock-pot or whatever the recipe is still the same but your device is going to be different so here I've measured out two cups of coconut oil and you're just gonna put it right in try to get as much of it as possible I know coconut oil can be a pain because of its solid texture and you know it melts at like I don't know 75 degrees or something like that so what I like to do too is take the glove and I'll just kind of use that to get the coconut oil off I can always wash the glove all right so that's all the coconut oil now we're going to grab our D carb M flower smells awesome and gonna add it right in make sure you get everything get this out of the way make sure everything's out I'm gonna put this right on lockdown I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in all right and so the magic butter machine recipe typically calls for two hours at 160 degrees but I like to do 160 degrees for four hours I like the longer cook so that's it now we just wait for the machine all right so the magic butter machine is now done it's been four hours and we're going to take the top off here now looks to be pretty nice not a whole lot of mess this time around which is great shake it off a little bit and now we're gonna slide this scoop off the edge let me show you inside here very typical for this machine you just want to scoop off the edge get as much as you can that plant material holds all that CBD all the good stuff that down I put the glove on my right hand and I am going to pour [Applause] he's gonna get all that juice out of there looks really good so now we'll put this off to the side just back up now there's some plant material down there in the bottom so I'm just gonna scoop the rest of this out all right give this one more good squeeze you can see right there just squeezing it get the most you can out of it that looks to be it so we'll put this in our sink and that is it so what I'll do is I'll take the coconut oil I'll put it in these mason jars and I will let it rest it will risa Lydda fie and you can do what you want with it now the great thing about coconut oil is you can add it to your lotion you can cook with it you can use it as a lotion you can pretty much do anything you really want with coconut oil it's kind of a really good way to use CBD but that's today's recipe that's all I have for if you wouldn't mind please hit that

when most CBD products supposedly don't contain any at all the 2018 farm bill federally legalized hemp but the plant was still allowed to contain 0.3% THC or less this means that CBD products might still contain trace amounts of THC while that trace amount of THC probably won't get someone high there are a lot of stories out there of people failing drug tests and getting fired over it confusion and shock followed for Ryan who says he hadn't used marijuana instead he blamed CBD CBD oil helped Mandy with anxiety and headaches but she believes trace amounts of THC inside showed up in a drug test and it cost her her job a study published in September 2017 found 21.4% of 84 CBD products from 31 online companies contained up to six point four milligrams per milliliter of THC 26% of those products contain less CBD than labeled reporters from ABC 7 in Chicago bought eight CBD products from online retailers specialty shops and gas stations and had them tested by a lab in Morton Illinois ABC 7 reported that all eight samples came back with THC levels above the legal limit of 0.3% in all but two of the extracts the CBD content was higher than the dosage stated on the label one container of gummy bears bought online even contained no cannabinoids at all the labs lead technician noted quote advertised as 1000 milligrams of hemp oil in there and we literally detected none in there at all not even like traces of any so it really like this is snake oil much of the lack of regulation falls on the Food and Drug Administration on October 8th 2019 a group of senators sent a letter to the FDA asking to set up a quote comprehensive regulatory framework for CBD the FDA has yet to make a move common drug testing techniques have also potentially misidentified CBD is THC a chemical analysis method called gas chromatography mass spectrometry requires a lab to add a chemical to the compound being tested the most common chemical used for this derivative process is trifluoroacetic anhydride which the Journal of analytical toxicology reports can cause CBD and THC to be indistinguishable false positive drug tests can have huge implications on people's lives a Colorado man named Mark Pennington nearly lost custody of his child over a false positive according to the New York Times Penningtons ex-girlfriend took a hair follicle from their two-year-old son and had it analyzed at a lab the drug test came back positive for THC Pennington told the Times he'd been providing his son with CBD infused honey but denied ever giving his son any THC when Pennington talked to Frank Conrad the lab director at Colorado green lab which is a consultant to the States cannabis industry Conrad pointed him to the GCMs study Pennington is now suing the lab that performed the test on behalf of his son saying quote this matters to people in the military this matters to people who might lose their jobs this matters to people who might lose their kids this matters to people who might have to go back to jail that's the point of the lawsuit stopping this form of testing it's unethical with hemp in the marketplace as more states legalize and regulate cannabis products the risk of false positive drug tests likely won't be as high but without a standard of accurate testing across the board this is more than likely going to be a problem until steps are taken to address [Music]", "08qTKHI26Uc": "when people see CBD or they see a marijuana leaf or a hemp leaf they automatically assume drugs you know illegal activity and that's not the case with this type of product this this product is supposed to be presented in a more medicinal way what's it like to be on the ground floor of a new industry that few people fully understand welcome to the business of CBD the CBD superstore in Queens New York actually used to be a vape shop but a few years ago the owner saw the potential in CBD and gradually started changing his business originally we started off with a couple of products that we tested ourselves some for anxiety some for pain and we saw the growing popularity of the product and the results that customers were getting and before you know it it just it grew into a full blown-out CBD business though this company this is actually a specific facial serum yeah CBD infuse but it has some great ingredients in it my name is Nick Aragon EC I own CBD superstore here in Whitestone New York and what we do here is provide high quality pharmaceutical grade CBD products to our consumers but the jar the jars are those jars the seven gram jars are forty-five but the ones that we have loose those are fifty four seven grams don't necessarily get caught up with the strongest only because every strain could affect you differently in a better way so just because something says 20% doesn't mean you might not get great results from a 16% the Sun sets 19.5 the juicy fruit is 16.7 this is 7 grams that comes in a jar or you can get 14 grams which is doubled so in the beginning obviously there was a stigma you know people thought that when they heard hemp and they heard CBD it was automatically a marijuana product it was an intoxicating product and that really wasn't the case the fact is that we actually had some kickback from community people who actually thought we were a dispensary or we were opening up a marijuana dispensary in selling marijuana and you know the police department came in and we spoke to them and we spoke to the community groups Whitestone itself as a conservative community you know it's a family-oriented community so our job was to actually inform them and send out you know mailers to everybody's homes and reach out to the civic associations to explain what the product was how it works and how it does not conflict with any type of illegal substance that's on the market today unlike marijuana which comes from cannabis plants containing high levels of the psychoactive compound THC CBD is derived from him a different variety of cannabis with very low levels of THC that won't get you high despite its many uses the hemp variety of cannabis has been mostly illegal for decades due to its close relationship to marijuana but last year the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp production CBD products are still in a legal gray area and potentially subject regulations the brightfield group an industry analyst estimates that in three years the CBD market could hit 22 billion dollars everybody was looking at the THC version of cannabis thinking that that's going to be where the real market is is people wanting adult use cannabis for recreational purposes you know fast forward to the hemp legalization in the 2018 farm bill and all the sudden everybody realizes wow we can put him derive CBD and just about everything under the Sun the companies kind of did this pivot and thought well of course we want to have this THC type of cannabis product but we might be able to make big big money having something really mainstream that could be sold on Amazon or even a Walmart typical would be a oral ingestion of either a tincture or a capsule all comes out the gummies different types of gummies dog treats we have isolates we have fruits shoes it's not necessarily the cure-all for everything it's not a miracle type of product you know we market the product as a natural relief while new products seem to be hitting the shelves of stores like NYX each week CBDs actual health benefits are still being studied now that hemp is legal and CBDs popularity has exploded a flood of new products claiming CBD content has hit the market the challenge for Nick is figuring out what's actually good you know obviously I would still buy them from you if you got them but we need to know where they come from well not by here I said you have to really talk to the farm owners you have to talk to the manufacturers and you have to talk to the companies you have to see how their products are being made how they're being sourced you also have to confirm that there are third-party lab results so there's no conflict of interest of companies testing their own products and that's been the problem for the consumers they don't know whether they're getting a good CBD product or a bad CBD product you know we need to know the cannabinoid profile in these products prior to getting them we need to know it has a medicinal benefit that's our job in the industries to be able to prove to a customer the validity of the product and the legitimacy of the company that we're buying from hey NBC News viewers

taking CBD oil in its potential negative effects on the liver now I want to start out by saying that commonly it takes an average of 17 years for a subject matter in health and medicine to be initially investigated and then for it to be ultimately implemented in modern day medical practice 17 years that's amazing now I understand that CBD oil is a hot trending topic right now especially over the last five years and ultimately the answer to this question may be we don't know yet there are some negative studies and they're also also some positive studies and also be advised that the media has been known to root misreport research on cannabis a recent article came out in Forbes magazine where the scientific author stated that CBD oil taken orally might be just as dangerous as alcohol or taking acetaminophen these substances have safe daily recommended amounts that may not harm the liver but while alcohols abuse is well-known an acetaminophen toxicity has replaced viral hepatitis as the most common cause of acute liver failure in the u.s. CBD has very little abuse potential because it is non-intoxicating so its users have no incentive to approach similar levels say as alcohol and the same author begrudgingly conceded that there is research on the positives of CBD he brought up a study showing that cannabis users have a significant dose-dependent reduction in the odds of developing each of the four major stages of alcoholic liver disease CBD oil regulates 50 genes the key word here is regulate CBD works to regulate the rest of the body and help it to calm to homeostasis CBD actually has over 80 mechanisms of action generally speaking therapeutics CBD oil doses range from 0.5 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to 20 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day so one study in mice use significantly higher doses of CBD than what is typically taken for therapeutic benefits in humans the study in Forbes magazine to put that into perspective that would be over 1300 milligrams of CBD per day and adult Wayne a hundred and fifty pounds that is much higher than the typical daily dose of casual CBD oil users most people stick somewhere in the range of 10 to 80 milligrams per day with slightly higher doses for insomnia certain therapeutic effects and flare-ups the few studies prefer performed on how CBD affects the liver are a little conflicting and not entirely clear in one study ten percent of the subjects developed higher liver enzymes they actually had to stop using the CBD oil for this reason while other research suggests that CBD oil can actually improve liver function as determined by these studies CBD is metabolized by the liver people with non alcoholic liver disease are encouraged to limit any over-the-counter medications to avoid stressing the liver including CBD oil CBD significantly attenuated or lessens the alcohol feeding induced increase in liver enzymes in one study liver inflammation and oxidative nitrate of stress CBD treatment also attenuated or lessened the respiratory burst of white blood cells isolated from chronic alcohol fed mice and from humans and decrease the alcohol induced increase liver triglycerides and fat droplet accumulate in the liver furthermore CBD impacted alcohol induced hepatic metabolic dysregulation and fatty accumulation by restoring changes in the liver thus CBD in this study the authors concluded may actually have therapeutic potential in the treatment of alcoholic liver diseases associated with inflammation oxidative stress and fatty accumulation in the liver in another study ischemia or reperfusion they looked at and it's a pivotal mechanism of liver damage after liver transplantation or liver surgery in this study CBD significantly reduced the extent of liver inflammation oxidative nitrate of stress and cell death and also attenuated the bacterial endotoxin trib triggered activation and inflammatory markers of the all-important kupffer cells in the liver these protective effects were preserved in the liver in this study thus the authors concluded CBD may represent a novel protective strategy against reperfusion injury by attenuating key inflammatory pathways and oxidative nitrate of tissue injury now we do know that some metabolites of CBD oil inhibit phase 2 detoxification pathways in the liver which theoretically can cause a problem because if you have phase 1 detoxing and pushing off those toxins 2 phase 2 and phase 2 is inhibited you get the buildup of potentially more toxic chemicals in the bloodstream the major cellular event in the development and progression of liver fibrosis is the activation of what's called the liver stellate cells in one research articles the authors proposed that CBD by selectively inducing death of activated cells represents a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis word of advice all CBD oil is not created equally a recent report by the cannabis testing lab can a safe to the California's Bureau of cannabis control BCC for example stated that somewhere between 69 and 80% of CBD products failed to make the label claims so is CBD harmful for the liver we may not know yet we need to perform more studies there's no

is David Spratt and welcome to episode 10 of carp a sweat series this week we're gonna be talking and answering the question about whether CBD oil can be used to help manage the symptoms of hyper I drove this last week episode 9 everything you need to know about iontophoresis we go VIN - what iontophoresis is how it's used and how it can help in addition to some feedback that we've heard from people who have used iontophoresis machines and kind of feedback from dermatologists so this week we're really excited to dive into this very trendy topic which is CBD oil we've heard from people on reddit forums and online posts and articles that people have actually been using CBD oil to help manage the symptoms of hyperhidrosis and someone said that I've worked so we're gonna dive into that today but first my embarrassing story so about four or five years ago on Christmas Eve we went to a church ceremony and it was late I was tired and I'm so ready to go and it was it was a service that I wasn't familiar with so at the very end I I just feel like it's you know everything's coming to a close and worth into the program and everyone is sitting down and people start singing and I just jump up out of my chair like ready because I expect everyone else to stand up - and they're about a thousand twelve hundred people in this church and I look around and I'm the only one standing up and I just felt this wave of anxiety and sweat I just immediately started pouring sweat everywhere around my body my hands my feet my face my underarms everywhere started sweating it was terrible so this week sweat story comes all the way down from South Carolina one state under us from a woman named Donna Donna has a really interesting story she's had two sympathectomy x' which is as we talked in an earlier episode a surgical procedure to essentially like clip sweat glands to help reduce underarm sweat she hasn't seen any success with the sympathectomy x' and so she's still desperate for a solution and unlike our previous sweat stories Donna actually hasn't tried car pay but she's really really excited about it because nothing's worked for her she's trying to everything she's had two surgical sympathectomy x' and she she just got car pay and she's thrilled to be able to try it and Donna has a really interesting story she has a lot going on in her life outside of the two sympathectomy x' that she's had and the various other prescription and OTC solutions that she's tried to help manage her hyperhidrosis her husband needs a kidney transplant and her son is going to be the donor so everyone please keep her and her family and her thoughts her daughter just got married and she really needs some support right now and she's definitely excited about the support that car pay will bring to help manage the sweat but she can use your thoughts as well so let's dive into it so first I want to dive into what CBD oil is so CBD oil is a substance that's derived from the cannabis plant and it's called cannabidiol and THC is also derived from the cannabis plant that is like that's what gets you high and everything we're not talking about that CBD doesn't get you high it doesn't have any psychoactive effects CBD oil has been really trendy recently for helping with anxiety and epilepsy and now some people are reporting sweat however it's a really new area so no one really knows much about it so most of the findings are qualitative and based on people's personal experiences so there's not a lot of scientific research if it's really new but that research is picking up and we're starting to learn more about the impacts that CBD oil can have on epilepsy anxiety inflammation and a host of other things so how would CBD oil help with hyperhidrosis and does it so some people think that the anti-inflammatory impacts of CBD oil along with the anxiety reducing benefits of this substance can help reduce the activity of the sweat glands and actually reduce the amount of sweat that's being produced by the body so that would obviously help with hyperhidrosis now what we don't know is whether that's true or not so there's no scientific evidence that actually proves any correlation between CBD oil and reduce sweat however based on online forums and some reddit posts and what some people are saying it has helped some people and they've found some success with it so we don't really know if CBD oil does help with hyperhidrosis it could for those people that do currently use it it could be placebo we don't know it could actually help but what we have heard from these people who are really all about it is that they think the anti inflammatory and anxiety reducing aspects of CBD oil help them manage their sweat and help reduce the sweat and that makes sense to a to a degree because anxiety anxiety stimulates the the sympathetic nervous system which then stimuli it's the sweat glands which produces sweat so could be possible but we can't make any conclusions before there's scientific evidence supporting it so with that thank you so much this wraps up episode 10 of carp a sweat series and please remember if you have hyperhidrosis if you sweat a lot if you're looking for a solution check out carp a we love to have the opportunity to help you manage your sweat just like it's helped us so please check it out let us know what you think we can't wait here and please submit your sweat story to me at david at carp a lotion calm i can't wait to read it thanks so much have a going", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is

Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "lFNzyeD5Jh0": "it's been suggested that medical marijuana can offer relief to chronic pain patients but many may wonder what the cost if any the practice can have joining me now to discuss concerns around the use of medical marijuana to manage chronic pain as dr. Dean Drazen is associate medical director for care and treatment centers dr. drowsiness thank you so much for being here today thanks for having me so Ken marijuana be used to treat or to manage chronic pain chronic pain is one of the number of diagnoses that are acceptable for a physician to prescribe or to authorize use of medical marijuana we hear a lot now about CBD as an alternative so is that a viable option CBD in the scientific study seemed to have some good pain relieving properties and that was very exciting initially because CBD in and of itself is not associated with addiction however in real life as we see there's a lot of CBD products on the market I'm not hearing patients getting great pain relief from CBD it also has some all CBD preparations also have at least a trace amount of THC which may be a concern for some patients so what are your other concerns with marijuana being used as a chronic pain treatment well in the context with with in which I treat chronic pain which is patients who have a substance use disorder as well as a chronic pain condition part of our aim is to calm down the part of the brain that's involved in the substance use disorder marijuana use is not going to allow that part of the brain to calm down like we want it to in order for them to get good recovery excellent I see so what solutions might you offer to alleviate the current opioid epidemic in terms of marijuana and using it to manage chronic pain well I think that for people who have an opioid use disorder that using alternative methods of treating their chronic pain acupuncture massage hydro therapy physical therapy yoga meditation all of these are harmless all of these will allow the part of the brain that processes chronic pain to calm down and allow the part of the brain that is involved with addiction to calm down and get to its baseline state medical marijuana really does not have a place in the treatment of chronic pain particularly in a patient with a substance use disorder and that touches on my next question is there any concern about swapping out one addictive substance for another in this treatment yes there's no question that marijuana has its own addiction liability associated with it and certainly for somebody who has a substance use disorder again we want to allow that part of the brain to heal without stimulating it with a different substance and what alternative chronic pain treatments exist that don't involve opioid medications or marijuana well as I mentioned there's many alternative treatments acupuncture massage physical therapy hydrotherapy as I mentioned previously but in combination layering these treatments and individualizing them for one patient that's the way to go and if there's one takeaway you want people watching this to walk away with what is that I think that the most important thing to understand is that most effective relief from chronic pain involves a minimum of drugs and a maximum of alternative therapies excellent doctor drowsiness thank you so much for being here thanks for having me and if you're interested in learning more you can visit Karen org", "8hoC4UEE3g0": "from gas stations to pharmacies all around us stores are selling CBD products marketed as a way to help with the pain and stress CBD is made from the health plant which is in the same family of plants as marijuana but without THC or with a very low amount and it doesn't get you high if you find this connection between CBD products and weed a little bit confusing you're not alone McAllister has an in-depth look at a gray area of CBD laws in Georgia something that even law enforcement officers admit is confusing and because of that people are selling and buying illegal products in Tennessee CBD laws more closely match with the federal farm bill so there's not as much confusion but in Georgia state law does not match federal law we found out some businesses are selling illegal CBD products and customers are buying them without realizing that it's not legal for example today I spoke with 8 different businesses that sell CBD products in North Georgia half of them tell me they sell CBD with a small percentage of THC that tiny amount may be legal under federal law but it's not in Georgia five years ago Josh Manning nearly lost his life in a motorcycle crash on i-75 damaged my right side lost my leg he spent a year and a half on pain pills I know a lot of anger issues with pain management but all that changed when he discovered CBD a natural product derived from hemp CBD helped with his pain anxiety and stress now are you on any pain medication at all don't take any pain medication cannabidiol or CBD is in the same cannabis family as the marijuana plant but without THC or a low amount it won't get you high like marijuana would it helps come on down helps come with my body down as well after experiencing the benefits firsthand Josh started selling CBD products last year at the i-75 flea market in Rossville things were going great until about eight months later josh says a local officer told them they couldn't sell CBD because it was illegal in Georgia threatened with felonies he complied leaving Georgia and opening this shop across the state line in East Ridge it's affordable it's legal now you know it's 50 state legal of course each state has their own behind it we sat down with Dwayne brown the commander for the Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit Drug Task Force based in the Fayette in the law enforcement for 21 years Dewayne agrees Georgia law is confusing right now there's a whole lot of confusion we're not a federal agency here so we followed the state laws federal law says CBD containing 0.3 percent THC or less is legal but Georgia state law says CBD with any THC amount is illegal the stores are everywhere you can drive down any road and see you know we sell see me Dean Dwayne says they only investigate CBD sellers if they get complaints we're not out just targeting folks for this stuff that's going on like Josh Dwayne also see CBD as a way to help with the opioid crisis I'm not against the CBD oil they're not having to take all these opioid pills which is our huge problem for our nation right now you know I think there's benefits to it in 16 months he says they've made three arrests after they got complaints about people selling CBD products containing THC we don't go out and target those stores one of those stores is just down the road from Dwayne's office Ledford pharmacy owner and pharmacist madison Ledford is a big fan of CBD products it's safe its natural he uses it for stress the coffee with CBD oil is great but says even more importantly it's such a good alternative to opioids no sorrel synthetic made by big pharma to make money even this pharmacist is confused by the current law I think you can have 0.3% or something like that remember currently in Georgia you can't sell CBD products with any amount of THC no matter how little Madison says his products are THC free so he's not worried either way I have a police officer coming here every day everyone we talked to you though is looking forward to more consistency between US law and Georgia law we're not here to just take your by Joe we're gonna educate them too and help them guess what we can change is on the way just this month Georgia governor Brian camps signed the hemp farming Act this means in July it will be legal for him to be grown in the state and certain CBD products to contain 0.03 percent or less

"uZzpi7JWy00": "hey guys welcome back to our channel today is just me erica and i'm doing a wash day routine and for today's wash day routine i'm adding an element that is highly effective and that is cbd now just a little quick watered down lesson about cbd um in the past few years i feel like cbd has become more mainstream i think it's because a lot of people are doing their research on the benefits of cbd and i just wanted to say this cbd doesn't get you high it's the thc that gets you high and there is no thc in the um cbd products that i'm using but this is just i'm not going to go into the whole uh a whole lesson on cbd or like in depth about cbd you guys can research it for yourself because that's not what this video is about i am just showing you the benefits of it in hair care and a lot of hair care brands are starting to incorporate cbd in their products which is why i'm doing this video and the hair care brand that i used was the brand hemps and i've been a fan of pimps for a while um i used their lotion their body lotion and all of their products smell really really good but recently they introduced their cbd haircare line and i really wanted to try it out and they did have like travel size options on their site so i did get the travel size option of each product which is actually amazing because if i don't like the product it's not like i'm wasting a lot of it um so i did get the trial size and um even their full size is very affordable i was really impressed with their line because a is affordable like even the big size and b their uh cbd product line is very thorough like it comes with a shampoo a scalp oil a conditioner hair mask and a leave-in so i'm just going to go through this wash routine and let you guys in on the benefits of cbd so i started off with the cbd moisture hit ultra hydrating herbal shampoo and this has 45 milligrams of cbd so the cbd that hemp uses the hair care brand um the one they use is cbd isolate meaning there is nothing added to it now the shampoo or the product line itself isn't odorless and that's because they added eucalyptus and tea tree oil to their products and that's just to add to the benefits especially for the scalp and cbd is amazing for the hair and scalp because it is loaded with vitamins and levels of collagen and keratin so you are getting the effects of a protein treatment cbd is known to strengthen the hair so my thoughts on this uh shampoo immediately when i used it i felt a cooling sensation on my scalp it felt so good and i definitely think it was the tea tree oil working to cleanse the scalp that's why i felt that cooling sensation and the shampoo itself wasn't anything special as far as when it comes to moisturizing um it just felt like any regular shampoo but it definitely wasn't bad it didn't dry out my hair or anything but um yeah as far as i definitely felt more you know the scalp area but as far as moisturizing nothing really wowing but yeah it wasn't too bad and after the shampoo i used the cbd royal treatment ultra hydrating herbal scalp serum which also has 45 milligrams of cbd and again all these products have eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil in them so not only do they smell amazing but these two oils work together with cbd to care for its scalp tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil helps soothe the scalp cbd kind of comes in and gets to the root of the problem and reduces inflammation in the scalp so if you are suffering from dry itchy scalp um if you have eczema cyborg dermatitis um cbd oil infused products are i feel like they're recommended if you have any of those problems but again do your research so my notes on the scalp serum like this stuff is the real deal um if you don't get or if you want anything from this product line i would say get this even in travel size it's a good size and it's super affordable yeah my itchy scalp went away just like that and that combined with the shampoo was a definite game changer so i would say this product is definitely something you want to add to your hair routine and you don't have to get like the whole product line you can just use this like by itself or you know in addition to the regular shampoos that you use but yeah if you have dry itchy scalp definitely get this alright so next in rotation was the cbd on one conditioner ultra hydrating herbal conditioner cbd also contains loads of fatty acids and amino acids and if you guys don't know those both kind of lock in moisture and combat dryness in the hair and again with this conditioner kind of like the shampoo i didn't really notice a difference in moisturization or moisturizing um like i said it didn't really obviously make my hair dry but it wasn't again wasn't anything like too special i did feel like again it was more of a scalp thing like this focusing more on the scalp but yeah i'm probably going to be feeling like the cooling sensation for the rest of the week all right so next up is the mask and i'm so excited that they included a mask in their collection because a lot of collections don't really add masks in and i used the cbd masquerade party instant ultra hydrating herbal hair mask and that contained 40 milligrams of cbd also all these products and all hemps products contain 100 pure natural hemp seed oil and this is another strengthening aspect of the cbd collection hemp seed oil just fills in the weak part of the hair with strengthening benefits and i just left this on my hair for about 30 40 minutes just so that my hair can get the strength it deserves um i am i think i want to say i'm 10 months post relaxer so um yeah i just need my hair to be built for it tough because the two textures i don't need them like breaking off all right so after rinsing that out the next stage is to add the leave-in and i am a leave-in conditioner snob i think it's because i have my my top five favorite leave-in conditioners so anytime i use a new one it has to live up to the height and i know what i want out of a leave-in conditioner and the main quality needs to be in its ability to detangle so i'll let y'all know in a second how i feel about this one but it is called the um cbd seeing is believe in ultra hydrating conditioning mist now this product is supposed to help hydrate detangle and control frizz but i will say after using it i really really wasn't a fan again like i said earlier i am 10 months post relaxer it's time for me to get a new relaxer to get another relaxer and my new growth is just all over the place so i can really tell how good a product's detangling aspect is you know because of my you know new growth and this one just didn't really impress me that much i think if i was at the beginning stage of my relaxer it would be okay because it wasn't terrible at detangling it just wasn't it didn't live up to the height or you know my standards of detangling so yeah during the middle of my um my detangling stage i just switched over to my oi all-in-one hair milk and the difference was like night and day i love that detangler again that's one of my top five retailers so i just switched over to that and it was like easy breezy detangling and the rest of the routine just went flew by it went by fast so also i did go on hips website to see if this detangler had any type of uh heat protectant in it and it didn't say so i was kind of iffy about that because again after i detangle i blow dry so um yeah i switched over to the oil all my hair milk and that has a heat protectant in it um so yeah i don't think this detangler has heat protection so just a little side note but again it's not bad but i just won't be reaching for this again so yeah all right so i did finish my routine i just blow dry my hair and i also flat ironed it um so here are my notes on the collection so i did feel like the collection did what it was supposed to do my hair feels like i just got a protein treatment um i haven't had a protein treatment in a while so it was kind of again it was kind of needed because i am getting a relaxer soon so i want my hair to be a little bit you know not in its weak stage and with all the protein benefits that come with using cbd i can see why my hair feels like it just got a protein treatment my scalp also feels clean um no more itchiness and also usually after i finish my wash my blow dry or in flat iron stage i usually have like little flakes on the edge of my hairline i didn't have any of that i feel like it did its job again in the scalp department and in the strengthening department but as far as moisturizing um all the products that hydrating in the title so i don't know me like i said didn't make my hair feel dry so it was hydrated yeah you guys let me know if you guys use cbd oil in your hair products um i know some people like to add like drops of cbd oil and their shampoo you could do that but hair care lines are starting to come out with cbd infused hair products um this line again does not have thc in it you're not gonna get high and yeah it's also paraben free and gluten free yeah i feel like the real winner of this collection was the scalp serum and like i said you guys need to go get that like i will continue to use that and like massaging my hair i will definitely use it after the shampoo kind of how i did it in my routine um but yeah my scalp just felt clean and like you could just feel the cooling sensation it's just a good feeling overall so again let me know if you guys use cbd if it's not in hair care if you use it in skincare let me know um yeah thank you guys for watching and we will see you guys next week bye [Music] you", "S0S4bMrmj-I": "- This is my very first\nshipment of CBD oil. (upbeat music) Good morning y'all, rough morning. I honestly was not planning\nto pick up the camera until I was feeling a little better, but something adorable happened. Harlow, while you are adorable, I'm actually not talking about you. I managed to make it downstairs, and I found this from Judd. This is gorgeous. Got a sailboat, a pink sunset, wow. This is so touching, it says, the card says, with you,\nlife is an adventure, happy Valentine's Day. And he wrote the sweetest most amazing... I'm not gonna share what he\nwrote 'cause it was personal, but you know this is\nnot typically like Judd, the romantic gesture, so I know he put a lot\nof thought into this and, I've got a great man. Alright I have made it to my destination. I need the heating pad, I\nneed my nausea to go down. I will see y'all in a bit. Hey Harlow, you wanna be snuggled, and your nose is like right in my armpit. Well y'all I am feeling a bit better. Harlow actually slept on our\nbed all night last night. Usually she'll get up after awhile 'cause she gets too hot, but I woke up and she was happily\nlaying between Judd and I. She was actually kind of invading Judd's space and like pushing him, so that Judd starting\ncoming into my space. But we made it work. Anyways I've got a\nphysical therapy session and the PT should be here any minute now. And then I'm going to\ntry something new today. Alright I had my physical\ntherapy, it went well. The first thing he asked me is, \"Do you have your AFO's yet?\" And I said no, but my appointment, I'm not sure if I told y'all yet, is Friday to get my AFO's and my joint braces from Hanger Clinic. So, looking forward to that. Anyways as a Valentine's Day treat, I am making Judd some pulled pork, one of his favorite things. The last time I tried to make pulled pork, it went not so great. I cooked it on high instead of low, so the pork really didn't shred well, but I think this one's\nready to be shredded. Oh my goodness, yes, it's\nshredding beautifully. Okay so the secret is to\ncook it on low for six hours instead of high for three hours, ta-dah! Alrighty, so I shredded it up, I put some of this sauce in it, and I actually have a\nrecipe to share with y'all 'cause I was like if I mess this up again, I wanna blame it on a recipe. So I put a link to it in the description, and then I added some Sticky\nFingers Carolina Sweet, and I think he's gonna love it. Alrighty y'all, I said I\nwas trying something new, and here it is. This is my very first shipment of CBD oil. So I've been talking with my\ndoctors about my chronic pain, and we are always looking for new ways to improve my quality of life, and to help me manage my pain, and it had been suggested\nto me to try CBD oil. And if you wanna learn about\nmy pain management plans and past discussions of this, I would check out my\npain management playlist. So originally, I was\nopposed to trying CBD oil because I was worried it\nwould lower my blood pressure, and I already have problems with that. I have to take medications\nto keep my blood pressure up, but I think that was just me\nnot knowing much about CBD oil. Some people it doesn't do anything to BP, some people it goes up, down. We don't know exactly how\nit's going to affect me, but I talked to my pain\nmanagement doctor about it, and he thinks it's at least\na try 'cause many people have had a lot of success with CBD oil, and if it helps me, how\nwonderful would that be, especially since it is natural. Now I did a fair amount\nof research on CBD oil before deciding to do it, and before deciding which company\nI was gonna purchase from, and one of the first\nthings I learned is that many people have very strong opinions on which company is the\nbest to purchase from. And what I think will be\ntrue in this instance, is that every brand can\naffect everyone differently, and you really need to do a little bit of trial and error to see\nwhat works best for you. So the company I decided to go with first is one that a fellow EDS blogger uses, her name is Christina Dougherty, and this company is called Theramu. And if it works well for her, I felt confident in giving it a try to see if it works well for me. Now CBD oil may do nothing for me, I know a lot of people\nhave success with it, but I have spoken with some people who said it really didn't do much. Or it did very little that it\njust wasn't worth the cost. So I am moving forward with\nthis, cautiously optimistic. I really, really want it to work, but I'm not going to get my\nhopes unrealistically high. I like my saying of cautious optimism. If this one really doesn't\ndo anything for me, like I said, different brands\nmay affect you differently, so I will probably try\nat least one more time with a different brand. I was looking at Lazarus\nor Bluebird Botanicals, those look good 'cause they\nhave third party testing on their products, but anyways, this is what I have right now. So this is... It just came in this box, this\ndoesn't fit in our mailbox so they delivered it\nto the leasing office. It was fine, it came with my receipt, and this pretty stuff that looks like, I don't know hamsters would use it, or like birds for nests, whatever. Packaging I guess and\nit came with this box. Now it's open because I\ndid try it last night, I put a drop on my skin first because, you know me, I'm\nprone to allergic reactions, and after awhile, nothing\nhappened with the drop on my skin, so I put one drop under\nmy tongue and went to bed, and I was totally fine. I wanted to try it first last night because, well, that's when it came in, but also Judd was home,\ntoday he's working. And so you open it up,\nand here is the oil. It was facing the right\nway when I first opened it. And I got the Theramu Calm Pro. Which I think just means it's a higher strength\nthan their original. And it is mango flavor,\nand 100% pure hemp extract. Sublingual dietary supplement. 750 milligrams pure hemp extract. And this is one ounce. Supplemental facts, serving\nper container, about 120. Serving size is five drops. So I get one drop under my tongue. The dose would be five. Other ingredients, pure Emu oil, organic mango extract, it's gluten free. Directions say shake well before use as pure ingredients naturally separate. Place five drops under\nthe tongue subliminally. Up to three times a day or as recommended by your\nhealthcare practitioner. Hold under tongue for 20\nseconds before swallowing. Store at room temperature. Does not contain THC. So yes, I'm using CBD oil,\nthere's no THC component which is the component\nthat makes people stoned. And this is legal in all 50 states. If you wanna know about\nprices for this specifically, just check out their website, I'll link it in the description. That's kind of what I worry\nabout, it being cost-prohibitive 'cause it is kind of pricey, and depending on how much\nI need it, but we'll see. I don't even know if it's gonna work yet and some people say it has\nto get into your system, so it takes awhile to\nstart seeing affects, or it works right away. I didn't notice any difference\nyesterday from my one drop, but, oh I forgot to shake it. So we're gonna shake it up. Alright, I got my drops. I'm gonna like open my mouth and use this while y'all are watching me okay. So here we go. And then I leave it under my\ntongue for like 20 seconds. You really can't taste anything, it doesn't really taste\nlike anything to me. Maybe like a hint of mango, but... Has it been 20 seconds yet? Okay I left it for like 30 seconds 'cause I wanted to be safe. But there we go, we shall\nsee how it affects me. No difference yet. (laughs) But I will keep y'all updated\non my journey with CBD oil, I am really, really hoping and praying it will be a good resource\nfor me, but time will tell. Hi y'all, I've made it into bed. I honestly do not feel a\ndifference with the CBD oil. However my pulse is giving\nme lots of issues tonight. Generally my heart rate is 110, 120, 130, so still tachycardic, yes\nmy pulse gives me issues, but it looks like my baseline. Not tonight, I am up in the 160's and Harlow alerted to me twice today, one syncopy I was able to prevent, by laying down and elevating my feet, the other one I couldn't even prevent it, so, I mean I'm okay. Harlow alerted, I was in a safe place, but (sighs) my pulse is bad tonight. And it started to get worse like two hours after I took the CBD oil, but I don't feel the CBD\noil is making my pulse worse because I was having issues\nwith it this morning. And just the nature of the beast I guess. With the CBD oil, I talked to Judd, and kind of our game plan, is that I'm going to finish\nthe bottle from Theramu. The current bottle I have,\nI'm gonna take five drops in the morning and five drops at night. I watched the video. I edited the volume a little bit, and I think I put way more\nthan five drops in my mouth. It's kind of hard to tell, but anyways, I'm going to take it in\nthe morning and at night until the bottle finishes. If I don't see any difference with it, then I will try another brand and I've decided I'll\ntry Lazarus Naturals. And you know I wanna\nreally give it a good try, I'm really hoping it can help me. Also, if y'all have\nbeen watching the news, I'm sure you know that something really tragic happened in Florida. There was a shooting at a high school and it happened in Parkland, which is several hours South from here, but, gosh, it's hard to\nknow exactly what to say when these things happen. It's heartbreaking and\nwe feel it, I'm sure, all through Florida and\nthrough this nation, and my prayers are with everyone affected. Snuggling Harlow close to me tonight. She's also very attached to me because I'm not feeling\nwell with my pulse. I'm actually gonna be running\nan extra liter tonight to hopefully help with it\nso when I wake up tomorrow I'm hopefully not struggling as much. Anyways, I'm going to bed, so with that I'll say goodnight, and thanks for joining\nus on our adventure. (upbeat music)", "Ij46cs0RuvM": "[Applause] [Music] bath bombs are an easy gift idea and adding CBD isn't hard to do so if you want to give the gift of relaxation here's what you'll need baking soda corn starch Epsom salt and citric acid these are your dry ingredients you'll also need essential oil coconut oil CBD infused oil bath bomb molds water and food coloring I mix the wet ingredients first starting with the coconut oil it's a solid at room temperature so I put it in the microwave for a few seconds and then I added it to a mason jar with the rest of the wet ingredients [Music] I used two types of essential oil here peppermint and eucalyptus [Music] one thing to keep in mind is that the color of the CBD oil will influence the final product so my first batch was very yellow I used less CBD oil and more food coloring in my second batch and I ended up with a nice light blue shade if you care about the color of the final product just make sure to use enough food coloring to counteract the yellow from the CBD oil it's time to mix the dry ingredients when citric acid and baking soda meet water they undergo a chemical reaction and that's what you're seeing when the bath bomb is fizzing up and making bubbles the cornstarch slows down the chemical reaction so you can actually control how long your bath bomb fizzes just by playing with the ratio between these dry ingredients I'll leave tips on how to do this below the video this step isn't hard but it does require patience slowly mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and when I say slowly I really do mean just a few drops at a time you don't want the dry ingredients to start to react if the mixture starts to get really fizzy you're going a little too fast when you're done the mixture should feel like damp sand now it's time to pack this mixture into the molds as quickly as possible press the mixture into the mold firmly you'll want to slightly overfill each one so that when you press them together there isn't a gap between the two halves [Music] these will be dry in a few hours but I recommend leaving them overnight removing the top half is easy sometimes the bottom half comes right off but if it doesn't just tap the metal a few times and try again this whole process involved about 15 minutes of actual work you do have to factor in drying time but this is a great option for inexpensive gifts that can easily be made in batches if you're trying to tackle several gifts at the same time if you choose to add CVD supposedly there are anti-inflammatory benefits but with any wellness trend you should do your own research to see if it's something you're into you can find more information about the instructions and the materials down below for more simple DIYs subscribe and stay tuned and I know it's been a while but as always thanks for watching", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book and a video that teaches you how to get started with cannabis so why not head over there now until then I will see you next week",

okay I've got a project that I'm working on you guys saw Priscilla's like DIY vanity that we did with the IKEA table and all that the ring lights great for what it's for but it doesn't quite work with her doing the makeup and stuff so I'm doing something different here I ordered this mirror isn't that cool it's a big old mirror good sized mirror and then I got these lights too and it has a dimmer switch on it stuff in there LED lights so we're gonna try this on this and this should give her exactly what she's looking for then I'll show you guys the finished product okay here's the finished product what do you think sweet right look at that Priscilla's Mir I got the lights put on there and they kind of make like a border thing I know they sell like some Hollywood lights that you can get for it to that are little fancier looking but this will work better for Priscilla making video so but it's that that's her little phone stand for when she's doing her live feed and then this is the switch over here I just like stuck it to the mirror she can't turn on check that out and it's adjustable so bright that's cool right she's all set up ready to go I like this better for what she's doing the only reason is because this needs to be closer to her just because of the way the Facebook live works but other than that awesome the light ring I still love it just not for this setup so but if you guys want to link for any I'll put a link for this if you're interested it's great for doing video doing like the talking head stuff and then I'll put a link for that mirror and the light strip that I got off of Amazon down in the video description if you want to make your own little vanity I think it's awesome it works great are you being a tyrant your head no say no way [Music] multitasking pots pans of brazilian lipstick mama you're so excited aren't you work from home I said nice peaceful work environment I kind of feel like this whole vlog has been one big eye why the sponsor buy lipstick mama and fathering onto some merch well I mean it's things we're doing it is things we're doing it's our life so let's talk autism so those are vocal stems that she's doing or yelling as a vocalist then a little bit of frustration maybe she seems to get kind of frustrated this time of night it's just like a daily thing for her and then the clapping that's also stimming audible stim would be what sense is that I think [Music] that's why she does it not necessarily mad about anything I think she's a little overwhelmed just with the day in general but it's every day it doesn't matter what we do doesn't matter when we get out of house as a matter we stay home while they doesn't matter she goes as a fool or doesn't physical activity no physical activity it seems like it's every single afternoon so you guys haven't asked us a lot in the comments about CBD oil and we did start CBD oil and we did stop CBD oil for a full week in every single day that she was on it this was works like we had meltdown every single day yeah and it was way more violent than this she didn't sleep well the entire week so it's not it's not been great and it just didn't work for us you know I don't want it I don't want to I think you should give it at least a week you know we might have stopped it a little bit a little bit earlier than we should have yeah we're tearing out I was crying because we don't want to see her like that I mean we just don't want to we don't want to put her through that for more trials you know and it's just not something we're willing to do we did get a good CBD oil it was a it was actually a pretty high-end to see the oil but we didn't want to you know we're saying they wanted us to try it and then talk about it so you know of course I don't want to bash the company by any means I don't think it's a problem of their product at all just different things work differently with with different people you know I have a guilt melatonin we've been asked by melatonin for sleeping melatonin does not work at all for her it doesn't even touch her I mean it's she'll be up all night I guess where we're at right now is working we might need to work on this that she's experiencing in the afternoon so I'm gonna go sit with her and see what I can't calm her down some yeah is that the same thing that we do for the meltdowns when I sit down with her like that it tends to calm her down just to kind of help her a little bit so we're gonna do that so just so you guys know we did try the CBD oh yeah we chose we're very hopeful hopeful that it would work and it just didn't you know that the two things we were looking to reduce was aggression and anxiety and and both of those things I think actually were amplified by that which is not abnormal we've seen stories of that before where it has an adverse effect a totally opposite effect of what it should have I'm gonna help her a little bit all those summers doing a pretty good job helping you have all your things you okay good okay you need help I'll help you this is how it goes this is how we have to do it Abby shovels it in yeah we got a I'm gonna slow her down I mean too far away from me I gotta move your blood sugar [Laughter] here's the vial wait here's chillin okay guys fork down take a break take a break take a break put your fork down which fork down finished on what you got don't you finish chewing this is really hard for us to eat because we have to stop her after every large bite she takes one bite okay put it down they break good job now wait they should what drink no show me trick there you go same thing with a beverage okay okay okay okay this is so good I'm glad you like it you don't drink it all once doing good okay take a break drink you got extreme let's do first chill good job I mean eat what do you what do you know let's drink that's great no you don't one drink what do you want eat what go down you'll get a napkin okay go get it happen job you wait your face might be face there you go nice job so that's pretty much how every meal goes we had to slow her down we have to cut her food for obviously which allows her to eat faster than any of us but then we have to slow her down the whole time nice job you doing great slowly but surely we'll get to where she can eat on her own and she's taking breaks on her own and we may have to start a protocol an eating protocol with that don't you think so that's what we were talking to Brandi about was some kind of okay a mealtime protocol is to keep sending candy and grabbing packages so we're hoping that's in one of these packages but we don't have Isaiah here so we had to improvise so we have Isaiah version 2.0 complete with button-down shirt and everything [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] slinky

tasted different so sense of taste changes my brain is working much better i'm able to be a little more friendly and alert both do i feel high no i just feel a bit confident i feel a bit um you know i feel like working i feel uh a bit happy not happy but i feel a bit content like there's no low in the mood the mood is a little up so that's good um other things so this is the maybe the fourth or seventh time i'm taking cbd and just wanted to tell you what happens when you take it so you take it you don't drink anything for 15 20 minutes and you can take it in the morning and i usually take three to five drops max and um the good thing is that you have a better day than you would without it you're in a better mood than you would be without it you are more efficient than you would be without it food tastes better could be a good thing if you're having bad food it is supposed to let go of pain give you less pain this is tired and tested it is good for that let's go you don't feel that much pain with cbd um now let's talk about the negatives i think i think it could make you feel um hungry more hungry than you would without it so it's sort of like ashwagandha on that front you will definitely feel more hungry than you would feel without it and you will end up eating more than you would without it because food will taste better um you would probably consume 400 i consume on average 400 to 800 calories more than i would without cbd but i'm trying to see if i can control myself if there is something i can do to dodge that thing but that is the only negative i can think about right now other than that it's mostly positive how much does this cost i think i paid about 10 000 bucks for this bottle and i don't know it's 10 ml or 20 ml let me check i simply googled it and the first thing it showed me was a paid advertisement um this is 66 thc what and 33 cvd it says 9 700 bucks for this another about 600 2 000 bucks for getting a prescription you're looking at about 10 500 odd to get cbd um if you're thinking it's expensive i don't think it's expensive because i've used it six times or eight times and somebody else has used it 10 12 times so and it's still right on the top it's easy to use it's uh it's legal now if you get a prescription everything is legal and they give you a prescription it's pretty straightforward so you can simply google this i think it's called cbd online or something like that they're not paying me anything for it nobody pays me anything dude so yeah that was a quick review of cbd um i will do more of this so i can do better review i don't know it has thc by the way dsc is supposed to make you feel high i feel a little better but i don't know if i'm high man i smoke joints that's completely different now other things i've tried is ashwagandha which is quite similar to this it does make you very hungry more hungry than cbd would make you maybe because it's a bigger dose and second thing i've tried is modafinil i've done two reviews of that um cbd does not help you read it does not make you faster it just makes you more aware and in the moment um i didn't do this review for the longest time because i thought i'll do it so well and all that but i feel a job done is better than a job not done like imperfect is better than just being perfect also i was waiting for a day but i looked good and then a month passed away and i still don't look good but i'm still uploading it because somebody has to", "WekMGzxRPig": "hi I'm dr. Dani Gordon and welcome to\ndr. Dani TV and this is the Cannabis wellness show where I talk about all\nthings cannabis and CBD I'm a medical doctor and I specialize in something\ncalled integrated medicine which is\nevidence-based natural medicine and in cannabis medicine and I've treated\nthousands of patients with medical cannabis in CBD over the years and this\nis where I share all of that knowledge with you so in this episode today we're\ngoing to be talking about CBD used for chronic pain so how can CBD help chronic\npain conditions what kind of chronic pain conditions it helps with and which\nones it may not be so helpful with and then we're going to talk about how to\nactually use CBD and the experiences I've had using high CBD types of hemp in\nmedical cannabis with my patients with chronic pain so this is a question I get\nasked all of the time in facebook groups by email and of course with my patients\nis they really want to try to use CBD and usually in an oil forms of CBD oil\nfor their chronic pain now there's some CBD oils that you can get\nover-the-counter in some countries that are from hemp and they don't have any\nTHC in it or less than 0.2 percent THC so basically none and then there's the\nmedical cannabis that really has high high high CBD low THC but does it a\nlittle bit of detectable THC in it let's say 1% THC so in my medical practice in\nCanada where medical cannabis is legal I use a lot of very high CBD very low THC\noils to help patients with chronic pain now chronic pain it's a just a huge\nbroad area of medicine because there's so many areas where pain can come from\npain can come from the nervous system being injured and come from the nerves\ncalled neuropathic pain or nerve pain it can come from inflammation so if someone\nwho has an autoimmune disease or they have arthritis from just wear and tear\nthey can all get different types of pain and you have pain in the nerve endings\nand you have pain in the body and then you have pain that starts in the brain\nthat's again something called central pain so with all of these different\ntypes of pain actually one of the most important systems in our body to manage\npain is our own cannabis system in our body our endocannabinoids system so what\nthis means is that when we are facing pain whether it's chronic pain or acute\npain there's molecules in our body there's\nchemicals our body makes to help fight that pain and our body makes cannabis\nlike compounds cannabis like molecules called endocannabinoids it helps to\nreally regulate our pain perception how we kind of perceive pain and also how\npain really changes the brain over time so a really common question I get is you\nknow what should I do when I've already tried CBD from somewhere over the\ncounter from a hemp store for example for my chronic pain and it didn't do\nanything does that mean that cannabis medicine in general and CBD in general\nit just can't help me the answer is usually no usually the answer is that it\nprobably can be helpful somewhat but it really depends on the type of CBD the\nconcentration of CBD it's different for every person in every pain condition and\na lot of other factors like was it a full spectrum cannabis medicine product\nwith lots of different chemicals in it besides the CBD or was a just CBD\nwithout anything else like a CBD islip what I find with a lot of chronic pain\nconditions is because CBD actually interacts with our own cannabis system\nin our own bodies called the endocannabinoid system it doesn't\nactually turn pain off directly like a painkiller for example what it does\ninstead is it down regulates our perception of pain and the kind of tones\nour our nervous system so to speak so it can help with chronic pain over a period\nof time but often times it might take weeks or months to see in effect and it\ndoesn't cure chronic pain so you have to keep taking it so what can happen with a\nlot of people is they start taking a very small amount of CS CBD oil and they\ndon't really see much difference if anything oftentimes they have to use a\ndifferent dose a different product or sometimes adding a tiny bit of THC\nso using in Canada for example where this is legal a strain of cannabis oil\nthat has a tiny bit of THC and still very very high amount of CBD actually\nworks better for chronic pain in many cases because it actually binds directly\nto some of the the pain receptors using the THC and then the CBD makes the THC\nwork even better even at these tiny little doses so normally even at those\ntiny doses of THC people don't normally feel impaired or high so a lot of times\npeople think that CBD oil is going to work directly for their chronic pain but\nagain because CBD actually doesn't bind to either one of the cannabis like\nreceptors in our body the cb1 or the CBT receptor like THC does it works in a\nmore kind of overall toning capacity like a lot of herbal medicines it's all\nabout really toning the nervous system and this is where CBD can be helpful\nover time there's also still so much we don't know about CBD and about the\ncannabis plant in general we're really only at the beginning of our scientific\nunderstanding and this is really I mean I mean when I say the beginning I mean I\nread the most up-to-date cutting-edge research every week on this topic and\nI'm still feeling like you know we're really at the beginning so that being\nsaid how can you actually use CBD if you have chronic pain well one way that you\ncan use it is you can help use it to help decrease the anxiety that comes\nwith chronic pain because what happens when you have chronic pain is in the\nback of your mind even though your brain gets used to having chronic pain it\ntakes up so much bandwidth in your brain so much mental and brain energy to\nbasically dampen the pain signals so you can just go about your life and not feel\nlike you're in constant trauma that over time it can cause a lot of brain anxiety\nand it can cause a lot of fatigue so what I find seem to be helpful with when\nsomeone has chronic pain one of the ways there's many but one of the ways is\nhelping to decrease the brain anxiety levels so basically it helps kind of\ncalm their brain down which dampens the fight-or-flight response or you know the\ndanger response system in the brain and that also dampens pain signals and it\nalso dampens our pain perception because when you have chronic\nyour nervous system is on edge all of the time it's like you're caught in this\nfight or flight running away from a saber-toothed tiger cycle all of the\ntime and everything is heightened so your awareness of everything of sounds\nof smells of bright lights and of pain everything gets amplified so basically\nit just helps kind of calm everything down a notch and even in itself that's\nreally helpful with chronic pain sufferers another way that can actually\nhelp chronic pain is if the chronic pain has an inflammation component so that's\nactually most types of chronic pain even indirectly if you have nerve pain\nsometimes there's an inflammation component as well so what CBD does in\nanimal models we know and we think in humans although we need really bigger\nresearch studies to say exactly how this works but it's probably very similar to\nwhat we're seeing in animal models is that CBD actually works on inflammation\nthrough a number of different pathways in the body so it can shut down\ninflammation in some pathways so if pain is coming from inflammation CBD used\ndaily over time may help reduce inflammation and that kind of pain as\nwell another factor in many forms of chronic pain even if you didn't start\nout this way is the longer the pain goes on the nervous system tries to adapt to\nthe pain and basically your own endocannabinoid system in your other\npain control systems they get out of whack they just don't work as well and\nthey kind of reach this new baseline this new kind of dysregulated baseline\nof I'm okay but actually the nervous system is really just regulated so this\nis where CBD may be able to help again because it may be able to help rebalance\nthe endocannabinoids system when it's gotten out of whack so the last thing\nthat I'm just gonna mention is okay what types of chronic pain do I see enjoy\ntreat with medical cannabis and high CBD strains especially so I see quite a\nvariety of chronic pain conditions one of the really interesting things that\nI've noticed in my clinical work with patients and this is not something\nthat's really in the published literature yet is after someone's\nreceived chemotherapy for cancer in many cases they use different drugs that\nreally affect numbness and tingling and burning sensations of burning pain\nthe hands and the feet and this is kind of a neuropathic or nerve type of pain\nthat specifically people get after a lot of chemo therapies especially the breast\ncancer chemotherapy regimens and what I've found is when patients use CBD oil\nafter they finish their chemo and they keep using it their pain their burning\npain in their hands and their tingling pain in their hands and their feet tend\nto tend to go away a lot quicker then I would say on average so it may be really\na place specifically receiveed II show some promise there's some animal studies\non that type of pain specifically using CBD and we need more research to say\nexactly how it works in humans but it's really promising another type of pain\nthat I treat is fibromyalgia I also treat arthritis pain and pain that's\nassociated with a lot of other chronic diseases so I'm gonna talk about each of\nthose in another video specifically but in general I think for chronic pain CBD\nholds a lot of promise especially when it's combined with other\nchemicals in the cannabis plant and potentially with other herbals and other\nmedications so if you like this video please subscribe to our Channel and

charlotte's web full spectrum hemp extract cream their 750 milligram formula i've tested uh quite a few of their products in the past they usually have a bit extra i sent this one to two labs and it had a lot extra which is surprising for the biggest name in the hemp game we're gonna go over those lab tests the price breakdown the strength and what i think about charlotte's web full spectrum hemp extract cream right now my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow a beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer this is not medical advice visit cbdxamen.com for official lab tests and more please like share and subscribe to support these free lab tests and cbd videos enjoy all right for forty dollars charlotte's web claims you get 750 milligrams of total cannabinoids they don't actually say the cbd quantity in this product which is a little complaint i have i do use affiliate links to help support these free lab tests i pay for the lab test i pay for the product and as you will see i cannot control what the labs say both labs gave it f scores fifty percent fifty point nine six percent more forty eight point four two five percent more the uh official lab tests are here and they claim 750 total milligrams we found over 1100 let's break it on down okay and they have over 1100 milligrams of cannabinoids and over 1000 milligrams of cbd this is a good full spectrum extract it just has a lot more let's see the uh the price break down here okay 3.8 cents per milligram of cbd that is very good but remember this is based on the lab results you're actually looking at according to their claims around five cents or more but the average topical goes for about 17 cents the oils the average full spectrum oil the kind you put in your mouth goes for around 10 cents so a premium brand according to lab results going for under 4 cents per milligram of cbd is great okay you got a bunch of natural ingredients in here some organic ingredients you got rosemary i do smell that a little bit i definitely smell the ginger and i definitely smell the hemp in this product one of the downsides to having a natural hemp product like this with all the terpenes those terpenes are thought to have some medicinal benefits they're basically like essential oils the problem with having a lot of terpenes in the natural ingredients is you smell the hemp the hemp smell comes from the terpenes which is earthy and pungent and potent it does not smell good and this product doesn't really smell good i would say it smells about average for a strong full spectrum extract so you definitely have to want a natural product like this and want all those extra terpenes now the uh the look of the cream it it does not look good it's a brown um and it has that that strong smell the hemp smell goes away no it doesn't go away it goes starts to go away and smell just like something floral after about five minutes but even even if you have it on for an hour you still smell something like a flower not necessarily hemp but you you still you still smell the hemp it's still there and the uh the oil once you put it on there's a little bit of a brown tint to your skin and that that goes away after about five minutes but i wouldn't say it's sticky after five minutes even after an hour it there's still a film uh feel to it i put some on my legs this morning that was hours ago and i still i still feel it on my legs a little bit it's not sticky it's just i know it's there um it doesn't feel great now the bottle itself looks really nice it's uh which is typical of charlotte's web i mean it's a premium brand it has a nice matte finish and then the text is raised with uh it's got a shiny text and you got foil on the front it's it's a nice bottle you got the us hemp authority certified on the back it's nice and moving down to their gram breakdown on about 14.5 milligrams of cbd per gram a gram is about a milliliter you can apply it over an entire body part it ends up being quite a bit and this is a good full spectrum a lot of the full spectrums that i test are three milligrams five milligrams of cbd so 15 milligrams is higher i've seen them go up as high as what our re botanicals had like 50 milligrams very potent little guy a lot of the ones i like are over 10 milligrams but with the cbd and cannabinoids you really have to try them out and look at the cannabinoids and ingredients because all of these creams are going to affect everyone individually and differently because your absorption rate your endocannabinoid system everyone has a different um experience and it would be misleading for me to give you my experience because it's going to be different from yours the thc that's a decent amount of tac it won't enter the bloodstream but might relax your your skin a bit the 0.45 milligrams or more almost 0.5 milligrams of cbc that is a decent amount this is a well-rounded full-spectrum extract you got some trace levels of other cannabinoids this is really good even though it has a bunch more cbd and cannabinoids in it than you expected okay so there's a bunch of stuff i don't really like it came with way too many cannabinoids uh they don't even specify the cbd levels in it uh the the brown look the the texture that stays on there the smell that kind of lingers none of that's great but if you're looking for a quality really good full spectrum extract with a lot of different cannabinoids from a brand like charlotte's web that's pushed the cbd industry forward this is a good option i can't recommend it because it doesn't have accurate lab reports but it's a good product and you you have to be okay with the hemp smell and the naturals the natural terpenes in this but a lot of people are looking for a natural hemp product with the full entourage effect with all these cannabinoids and this would be a good product for them i will see you next time you wonderful person you", "wAbPGSeR7Q8": "hi everyone welcome back to the channel as you guys can tell today we're going to be talking about cbd um basically we've been getting a lot of questions about cbd and if we're still giving it to emma and we actually have stopped giving her cbd about a couple of weeks ago and we wanted to go into the reason why and all of the new stuff that's going on all right so to start off as you know we started giving emma cbd um what was it a couple months about two months ago two and a half maybe just to try something new you know as parents we want to try anything that will help our child so we started on cbd um we started we really weren't seeing too much of a difference um then after a while we we thought we were seeing something but you know we're not sure if it's because you know she's getting older maybe aba therapy we just weren't seeing too much it wasn't like oh wow this is really working you know the sleep wasn't changing too much her appetite wasn't changing too much nothing really so a couple weeks ago we decided to um try stopping the cbd to see what happened just just to see and lo and behold emma just kind of breaks loose and i've been working out of town um for a couple of weeks and it's like i come back and my daughter's saying a whole bunch of stuff like everything she hears something once and she repeats it um so then we're thinking oh is it because she's off the cbd but then we're trying to think what else has changed what else is different that that's going on you know yeah she's an aba she's off the cbd she's getting older but also one of veronica's friends from youtube told her about this probiotic i think it's called all-star all-star probiotic for i think it might even be specifically before children with autism yeah so that is the only thing different we've been doing emma has been going to the bathroom regularly maybe once or twice a day which she never really did um and she's been doing great really good now we're not saying that we're for sure that it's that but that's the only thing different that has really been happening yeah i mean we did notice improvements with the talking from when she started cbd because we've had like our her aba therapist and her speech therapist write down stuff that she was improving but i just didn't know if it was the cbd or just her age or if anything else was changing um and then i i the same time when i was doing the cbd i ended up getting the probiotics and then i noticed that she was like feeling different she was eating more and she was doing all of that more so we stopped that um we stopped the cbd to test it out to see if it was the cbd or the probiotics or what it was and honestly she's been talking even more now that we stopped so i don't think that the cbd was suppressing her speech but i just don't think it was helping at all but it could also be because of the dosage we were giving her a really really low dosage so it could be that it would have helped her more but it didn't help her with eating and it didn't help her with sleep which was the main thing that we wanted her to help for it to help her with and that's still the same like her eating is up and down all the time but i do think that she's eating a little bit more now yeah and um her sleep was not changing and her sleep still doesn't it's very weird her fortunately it's like one week she's amazing and then the next week she's all over the place so that didn't help with the cbd and also the um food didn't help but the probiotics i feel like it's helping a little bit more with food now i don't know if it's that the aba therapy is working now that her age is different or what it is but she's doing amazing right now and without the cbd so we're not planning on like restarting anytime soon unless she has like any other medical conditions that we would have to start her on cbd again but yes we're completely off cbd and all we're giving her is just the vitamins now right um so we're in no way speaking against cbd because obviously it has worked for some people so we're not discrediting cbd we're just saying in our situation it hasn't worked for us we are not trying to discourage you if anything i i think that if you think it could help i think you should try it anything that you think might help your child i think you should try it i think you got to be weary and careful because some cbd comes with thc so you got to be careful that you don't overdose your child and then knock them out for half the night and they're for the day and then they're sleeping that wouldn't be good so you have to be careful and another thing if you do get cbd and you call the doctors they're not allowed to give you a specific measurement in which to give your child because there's no standard by which to to go off of because i don't know if it's not fda approved but they don't have enough research of cbd with children and autism to actually give you a definitive answer so they can't they can't really tell you anything so you have to it's all guesswork um so you got to be careful doing that but there's so much there's fish oil there's probiotic there's specific vitamins there's tons of different things and i think you should try them all but i want to encourage you this is so so important i encourage you to pray before you make any hasty decisions as parents we should be praying for our children no matter what but especially in these situations we because the lord the lord really he does he hears and he answers prayer and i give all credit to god god can use probiotics god could use cbd god could use the aba therapist but god is sovereignly in control of it also go to him pray to him and ask him what's going to help your child and ask him to lead you to it you know and i i believe he's a god who hears and he answers prayers so i want to encourage you to do that i think that's important yes definitely and we just wanted to basically update you guys on what's going on with cbd because i've been getting a lot of questions on my cbd videos that still give it to her what's the dosage and all of that and i can't recommend a dosage because we weren't recommended dosage and we just gave her 0.25 million milligrams right yes but we gave her a really really really low dosage and i don't know what would work for your child and i don't know i just feel like every child on the spectrum is different some will be good with cbd some won't be good with cbd it's just you it's kind of like a right and you try it yeah and we just decided to see if it was a cbd that was working or if it wasn't and apparently it wasn't the cbd because now she's doing even better she's doing a lot a lot better she's repeating a lot of words she's copying us she's seen him on her own she's doing scripting and she's doing like everything like i really am so happy and proud of her right now but like i said it could be a lot of different factors but as parents we would definitely want to try everything that we can to help our children so pray about it see what's going to work for you and what's going to work for your child and we don't discourage you guys from trying it it just did not work for us um but we might try it in the future if we need to for any other reason but yeah yeah that's about it um if you guys still have any cbd questions definitely leave them down below and we can try to answer those for you and also we will show you the probiotic that emma is taking and if you want more information on that i'm sure veronica could hook you up with that yeah and i've actually done a video on the morning routine one it gives them the information on what probiotic it is but i will still link it down below anyways if you guys want to see what it is and if you guys have questions on that i'll i'll answer those questions also yeah god bless good luck and take care we'll see you guys next time bye", "eNxZDSGqdHI": "[Music]

hope you can at least respect my opinions because always respect yours guys I am a supporter of medical marijuana I think there are a lot of scientific medical benefits and overall health benefits behind medical marijuana you sink and help with chronic pain it can help with diseases it can help with inflammation anxiety a ton of problems that you may be experiencing with your life I know a lot of people who use medical marijuana and it significantly helps improve and enhance their whole quality of life so I hope you guys connect leave open your minds to do some research if you're very against weed I think we got a terrible rep because smoking obviously smoking is not good for you and then also people when they smoke and get high they are completely demotivated they can't do anything with their lives so they basically just become bombs and come back couch potato and that's when it becomes a problem but I'm not trying to get into the pros and cons of medical marijuana use right now what I am going to talk about is my process using CBD and hemp oil because I am huge fans of these products and what you have to understand is CBD hemp oil it does not get you high that is such a big common misconception THC in weed is what gets you high there is no THC or very minor traces in CBD oil and in hemp there's actually no THC so you're not getting high what you do get from CD and hemp oil is a body relaxation but it is not gonna make you dysfunctional or unable to do other aspects of your life so say you're trying to do work cv oil is not gonna screw up your mentality so you're not able to get your work done now if you're wondering the difference between CBD and hemp oil CBD oil is extracted from the whole cannabis plant which can have more minor traces of THC in it where hemp oil is derived from the seeds of the cannabis plant which is not likely to have any THC in the product and another point you should know about CBD and hemp oil is it will not show up on your standard drug test it does not change your mentality THC of weed is what changes your mentality makes you feel all space-bound and lamping out but CBD and hemp oil it is made for medical benefits and has a ton of recovery aids and a lot of other benefits I'm gonna get into right now before I give it to my favorite products I want you guys to understand that I am sponsored by Arab strong and I want that point to be known because I'm not trying to [ __ ] lie to you guys this is actually what I believe in and it's a company I really do support so let me talk about why I support it and how I actually feel difference with it the oil guys I just drop five drops under my tongue okay huh no you let's sit on your tongue for a minute this is full spectrum hemp oil recovery drops I'll take five drops in the morning and five drops before I go to bed and the reason I like taking in the morning is because it really helps with my anxiety during the day guys I do a ton of [ __ ] during the day and this literally helps me just relax and go through the motions of my day much smoother that's my experience with in the morning and the reason I love taking is before bed is it helped me fall asleep sometimes I have a really hard time going to bed you know I'm one of those people who fix a thousand stories and thinks about my day and thinks about all the things happening tomorrow before I go to bed so I've all these thoughts wrapping around my head and they want to try to go to sleep I'm thinking about trying to go to sleep so now I can't think go to sleep because I'm thinking about go to sleep so it's just like ah [ __ ] so that's why this has really helped me just relax and it helped me fall asleep faster and then when I wake up the next day I feel better now here's the full spectrum hemp oil recovery cream this is stuff you saw me get in the mail now when I first heard of hemp oil or CBD oil as cream I was like that's ridiculous that's never gonna work as [ __ ] this stuff has been the biggest life for me as you guys know my quads were absolutely killing me before my pal ting me I was putting this stuff on three times a day before my meet and come me time I hit a new swap yard my meet now every time after I work out I rub this cream salt to show you an example of rubbing it on take a look I'll rub it on with my form right here you literally just rub it into your skin it's that simple there's no smell or anything like that guys we wrap it in but I really love this stuff because it significantly has helped me at least with my joint pain my overall muscle pain it's really just helped my muscles recover faster and get rid of any inflammation I may have so I highly recommend this product especially for everyone who lifts because it really has helped me make a difference and helps me just feel significantly better after I use it I didn't use this for a while because I was a little nervous about a drug test with C because I wasn't too sure but I did a lot of research on it and I actually bought my a standard drug tested like check for myself because I really do love using the CBD oil and hemp oils but what I did notice guys is when I stopped using this product I was more sore so I can honestly say that this has made a difference for me and I would recommend it if you're someone who has inflammation or hoho I almost forgot a huge point guys I know a bunch of grandmas I got my mom on this stuff they use this for arthritis this has been a huge help to my mom I noticed that obviously is my mom so I can say like personally I know for a fact this is gonna significantly help a lot of her long-term problems because it's been progressing worse for her and now she's been using it it's really made a huge difference for her arthritis she just feels less pain from arthritis it's actually really crazy how that works so I really do recommend this product and I'll put a link in the first minute comments what's the description to herbs wrong because like I said guys it is something I support I know I'm sponsored by the company but listen to what I'm saying cuz I [ __ ] mean this and another reason I wanted to have this honest talk with you guys is not to promote a product but to talk about CBD and hemp oil in general because a lot of people think oh [ __ ] that's drugs guys to me it's another supplement it's like taking pre-workout it's like taking protein powder it's a supplement that's helping me enhance my daily aspect of life and it's also helping me with my lifting goals so it's supplements to what I'm already doing with life and I do recommend it because it's benefiting me I also do want to personally say thank you to herbs strong they really make me feel welcome to their team check out this little letter they gave me thank you for your order we are thrilled to have you on the team please let us know if there's anything we can help with little things leave the big things guys it's something small like that just adding a little personal note really goes a long way with me because it shows they really value who they're working with but also that they really care about their brand and actually believe in their product that is something a lot of companies they don't I don't really get that sense from this is why I'm really proud to stand behind our F strong and support their cause because it's something I believe in as well and having a whole team behind me that makes everything so much better and so much more powerful now let's switch gears guys and talk about something I thought I'd never do I hired my first powerlifting coach Brad cool yard I always thought I'd be doing things myself but I really want to take things to a whole new level I told you pounding nationals a couple weeks ago really push me to the next level it changed my entire mentality it really humbled me and I want to give it my all to become one of the strongest people this entire country than the world and now you're probably thinking why the hell would you need a coach are you eating you don't know what you're doing no guys I freaking love coaching other people I love making workout programs I love doing dieting plans I actually considered making programming one of my specialties that being said when you get to a certain level it is really hard to self-analyze and figure out what exactly you need to do for yourself specifically to get to the next level it's great to have a second perspective an outside perspective from your own and I'll give you an example Michael Jordan guys one of if not the best basketball players of all time he had like six coaches a basketball driven coach of course a nutritionist a workout specialist even a mentality expert a bunch of different things to help him get to the next level even though yours are good at that top level guys you have to step outside yourself sometimes it's really hard to do that too it's really hard to get out of your own ego think you know what you're doing all the time thinking you're the best and just kind of humble yourself to be able to reach out to someone who can actually help you get to the next level I'm a huge advocate for programming you guys know that if you're not following a program I think it's really hard to actually progress so that's why I always advocate following the program and why you need someone else to make that program and I've really just taken a step back for myself and realize to get to the next level in power thing I want someone to make me a program I don't want to think about it I want someone to analyze my form for me so I don't have to go along in my own head try to figure out what's going on because then I just kind of Drive myself crazy guys I've been struggling with my deadlift for him for a long time it's driven me absolutely nuts I switch back and forth assuming the conventional and now I'm sticking to Sumer because I know anatomically it puts me in a stronger mechanical advantage but just I need someone to look at my form and break things down for me it helped me get better and I'm really excited to do this whole program from an outside perspective because I've never done it before it's something completely new to me and I'm expecting some serious strength games I'm ready to give it my all as I always do and see what I'm made of and it's gonna be really helpful being able to send someone else my videos of me lifting since have someone else analyzing my form and tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it instead of trying to do it all myself I do this whole business and of all killings by myself I can't keep doing that with lifting - I need someone to help me out and just kind of ease the stress of the whole things and get me to that next level because I'm gonna come back with nationals next year and [ __ ] kill it and you can count on that guys so my new coach Brad and I are really gonna be putting a lot of focus on correcting my mechanics my breathing patterns overall movement pathways and also just focusing on tempo tempo is something I've never really dedicated time to I've never truly dedicated programming to working on my form just because I freaking love lifting heavy but that's the ego guy so you gotta toss that aside sometimes if we're really trying to get to the next level and I've really just up and humbled by this whole National Park experience before this national power to me I win all my power that means guys regional means I know one of the strongest people in my area and that's not I'm not trying to sound cocky it's just it's just kind of how it is but when I got to a national level with some of the best lifters in the world I didn't win and that was the best experience that could have gone through it made me understand what I needed to do to take things to a whole new level and get better and better myself and that's me guys I believe No Limits and now I'm really gonna get after it and just to avoid any possible confusion I'm obviously going to be continuing my coaching services I know it can help a ton of you guys make your games no matter what your time availability or equipment accessibility is I already have multiple clients that are making incredible results and I'm so happy for you guys it really just motivates the hell out of me being able to help someone else and make them make gains but I'm now reaching to an external source they give me an outside perspective to help me make more gains on my own and now I'm gonna go film some videos for you aliens as you guys know now Scott Hartman studio Adam plasti of New Hampshire where I used to film all of my YouTube videos that is no longer there anymore me and him had to take it apart since he moved to Florida and I moved to Boston so that's no longer an option of film I'm gonna be filming all my videos at Jimin and Watertown in that private personal training area the only thing is though right now I need to buy a new microphone I needed buy some specialized lighting in order to make that quality content otherwise it'd be completely dark and you wouldn't even hear me so it wouldn't be worth filming there right now but I'm gonna order that stuff and do some research on some of the top products I could find online but for the time being I'm gonna have to run home to my house in Lexington guys and just film some of the at home workouts dumbbell workouts and things I can do here for the time being another little situation I'm dealing with right now is my normal filmer doctor eyes and eyes you see him in a couple of my videos he's my buddy Aaron he's in optometry school so he's becoming an eye doctor and he's in midterms right now so he's crazy busy song have anyone to fill me right now so I got to do all this stuff on my own so during this little figure out period I'm gonna be filming some videos in the upstairs living room it's the most amount of open space in the house the least amount of echo and the best lighting I've actually dumped some videos in this room in the past if you recognize the room I took the middle ad workout here and a few others but I'm also gonna try to film some videos in gym it it's just I'd like to do my videos real time for these specific intense workouts as well as a few others so I do need a talk which is why I'm gonna need the mic when I do feel more videos in that personal training area over there and like I said I'm filming myself right now so I've got the tripod set up and you guys are gonna love how I've been capturing my thumbnails you ready for this but other tripod attached to the ceiling fan got to do what you got to do video releases have been a little slower for me lately which is why I wanted to explain the process I'm going through right now just trying to create these videos for you guys I'm doing my absolute best and it's gonna be so much better when I get this new equipment it's literally gonna be next-level guys the content is gonna be so dope so from Boston to Lexington and now off to Watertown to go to gym it which is the gym I lift that now I've got to do some squat work [Music] to the top wait I'm gonna go at today is 475 pounds I'm doing three sets of just two repetitions I'm really gonna be focusing on homework and embracing my course much as possible and on another know that just down with Apple music it's [ __ ] dope guys check this out anabolic annihilation play this baby no [ __ ] limits so the first may thank my coach and I feel fencing off my squad is poor engagement and breathing what we've been finding is that has I have been taking my big deep breath and before you said on the squad it's actually been results gave me losing the core engagement that's gonna cause my chest and upper back to keep or because I lose my tightness when that happens now what we're doing to fix this is I'm taking actually exhale before I get into my spot so I exhale to get my core fully engaged and then I slightly elevated my chest squeeze my upper back and this is gonna allow me to stay tight and now into the positioning to do my squad and then as I'm into this positioning I under act the barbell I'll take my big deep breath in while keeping this tightness in this core engagement and then on the sense of the squad and secondly as we work on this core engagement it's gonna allow me to get a lot more air into my lungs and we're also focusing on pushing my elbows back when I grab onto the barbell to really emphasize that tightness of my upper back we're really focusing on avoiding my chest came forward so we're focusing on coming down in the most straight bar path as possible and coming right back up in the exact same bar back [Music] so squats [ __ ] alright today guys it's gonna take a little bit of an adjustment period to get used to focusing on this core engagement of breathing well I'm actually doing the squats because when you lift in heavy you don't always think about the form so that's why it's really important to understand what strain training you don't always train as heavy as you possibly can like I can did more weight than four into 75 pounds I can't do more reps with 475 pounds of two reps but I'm just focusing on the mechanics right now so I've dropped the weight down and I'm really just trying to establish new patterns to transmit over to when I am doing those heavier weights for those heavier set scraps so after squats guys I just did some really light accessory leg work going through the motions this week the focus is on the compounds and mechanic tips that my coach and I talked about on improving so I'm really working on applying back that on Monday I start my new intense strict Palestine plan and I'm gonna be vlogging all of that guys so you know exactly my process and how things are going and it's really gonna be intense as book getting mad gains you guys like that flow I just got a haircut guys I wish that cool there I just frickin don't but I hope you're excited for this new power lifting vlog series that I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna be showing everything my training my diet I'll be showing macros calories I'm even gonna be doing body fat analysis weight management and then I'm also gonna be showing you guys body measurements of each muscle group so it's gonna be so intense and really excited to take you guys through this whole process with me I'm gonna work on actually I'm gonna probably cut down guys to an 83 kg weight class I've been competing 93 kg weight class so I'm gonna be losing weight in this process too so I'm really hoping that's gonna help me aesthetically as well as it gets stronger oh yeah bested both where else and another announcement guys over a hundred new exercises are gonna be added to exer prize his exercise library XAR prizes my workout at make sure you download it but it's gonna be added to the excess price library so you can be able to do a ton more variety with your workouts because we're

and I'll do them enough if you're not into with my vlogs yet I'm telling you start watching them because they're gonna get better and better but I'm not only gonna be doing vlogs so don't worry about that as well I'll still be doing my intense workouts my tip videos all that because I know you guys freaking love that content and I love helping to my best ability so let's get them games together aliens we in the salvation oops [Music]", "jymg-5bwAI4": "hi there my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today we're going to talk about the indica raw hemp 3% the indica raw hemp 3% has 300 milligrams of full-spectrum supercritical co2 extracted him inside each bottle the bottle is 10 milliliters and has about 30 milligrams of CBD per dropper full which is about one milligram of CBD per drop if you are one to stay up to date on all of the latest in the hemp industry make sure you like and subscribe to our Channel the indica story is actually really cool this is the very first brand to sell hemp products online they actually controlled the entire product from the little bitty seed until you get the bottle they have a little over two thousand acres at the time of this recording all in Northern Europe Denmark area when you order your product because it is both in Europe and in the US and headquarters in California it takes about three days like I got mine just in under three days from the time that I placed my order online until the time that I got it in my house so they're really really on target with their shipping times too another really great thing about the indica raw hemp number three or three percent is that it includes both CBD and CBD a so the difference between the two are mainly the biggest difference is the CBD a is the non-heated the non decarboxylated oh say that one really fast and so you're getting slightly different benefits because you get to have both CBD a and CBD both of them are great for inflammation anxiety and things of that nature but the fact is you're you're getting both of them in this particular product so that helps to aid in the entourage effect so each bottle is 10 milliliters it only has one flavor and that is natural it is very natural and like I said one drop is about one milligram and a full dropper is about thirty milligrams it comes with a non marked glass dropper and you'll notice that it's very dark it's a very very dark full-spectrum product for me I normally don't take thirty full milligrams of CBD although I did do it at night and it was amazing to help me sleep so during the day I generally take about a quarter of a dropper because I am not good enough to count those drops underneath my tongue so let's try it indica uses a hemp seed oil as its carrying base and it is non-gmo it is organic and it is created or manufactured in a GMP certified facility that means every single time you take this product every single time you buy this product you know exactly what you're going to get it is a very high quality product with consistent results from their test which by the way they do a really good job of showing you and giving you access to their tests so on the side of the box you'll see a little bitty UPC code and on the back is actually digits that are stamped on there with it looks like a date and a four digit code that was a little confusing to me at first honestly when I went in to type in the batch number but basically it's the last four digits that you need for the batch it's also on the side of the bottle so if we stand it up and then turn it you're gonna see that same those same dates and four digits in order to find the test results you have to go to their website and there is a tab on the far right where it's quality control and then what you do is you search for they give it to you in like 50 batch numbers so you have to go into your drop down to about your 50 range and then find it let's dive a little deeper into the test results so something that indica does really really really well is they tell you everything probably even more than most people want to know you're gonna get the microbial reports you're gonna see how they tested for pesticides which by the way both of those tested non-deductible non-detectable and then they show you the different terpenes as well as cannabinoids inside their product so something that I definitely wanted to make sure that you are aware of that indica did is this is called indica raw hemp 3 for 3 percent if you look at the test results you will actually find that it's actually a little bit more than 3 percent of the total concentration it's like 3.3 percent and I know that that's not a ton of a difference however in an age where everyone's trying to round up and sell you more I really appreciated the fact that these guys were like hey it's just 3% even though they're giving you more than that and so that just kind of spoke volumes to me about the corporate culture and what they're trying to offer their consumers so you're gonna notice that it's got a very nice packaging it's a pretty heavy Winkle blue if you've seen some movies not quoting any on the outside it's very clear and easy to read and you're gonna see that it's 3% this is actually labeled a little bit differently than products in the US which are usually labeled as per dropper full of milligrams of CBD or the total amount of CBD in the bottle this is labeled as a percentage of the entire bottle which is it was a little confusing to me as an American consumer but once I started digging into it it actually made a whole bunch of sense it does have one milligram of CBD per dropper so you know if you're taking a half a dropper that's about 15 drops or about 15 milligrams of CBD so when you get it you're gonna notice that on both of them it does have the batch number but it also talks about all of the different products that are inside of it and so you can see that they actually have omegas in it and they it is using a hip seed oil as the carrier base okay so now let's actually talk about taking this product the first thing that you're going to notice when you open it up is it has a very pungent smell like you don't even have to get it that close to smell you can smell it from here it's very strong very earthy flavored and I actually smell kind of a bunch of pine needles almost and that's actually due to the terpenes terpenes inside the canvas planter what gives it its flavor and this one tests really high for limonene which is the same turkey and that's found in lemons but believe it or not it's also found in pine needles which is something I learned while doing this review and so it made a whole bunch of sense to me that I finally like that's why I smell pine needles it is very very strong and the flavor does stay with you so definitely keep that in mind when you are considering purchasing this product however I want you to tell I wanted to tell you that the first time I used it I used 15 drops which is about a half a dropper full about 15 milligrams of CBD I took it and within 30 minutes I fell asleep and guess what ladies and gentlemen I stayed asleep the whole night which is basically a miracle so this is very very very effective I didn't need to take it the next day because I didn't really hurt and so I found myself just supplementing with this as I needed throughout the day which sometimes it was never sometimes it was in the middle of the day like when I was ready to pull my hair out and then I would again I wouldn't have to even take a full dropper full a half a dropper or even a quarter of a dropper was enough to take the anxiety away and help me to get focused and get a whole bunch of stuff done actually this just happened I was working on something and I got really really stressed out so I took a quarter of a dropper which is about seven or eight drops and I lost complete track of time and I was almost late to my daughter's piano lessons because I was so focused so this stuff is very effective albeit it is also very very very strongly flavored so now let's get down to the Nitty Gritty when you go to purchase the indica raw hemp 3 you'll notice that the value of it's actually pretty good it's a very I can they consider this a moderate strength with about 30 milligrams of CBD per dropper I consider this more a little bit on the higher strength dose a higher concentration it does come in a 10 milliliter size bottle which is a little slower but it is very effective so cost per milligram it's very very very reasonably priced and you'll really appreciate that you'll also notice that it's it works like a little bit goes a long way it's very very very effective at what it does to help reduce anxiety reduce residual pain and to help you sleep and so you don't need as much which helps to maybe cushion the purchase price just a bit the one thing that you definitely definitely want to keep in mind is that this stuff is strong flavored like it's strong and so if flavor profiles definitely get to you if that's something that you can't get over even with a little bit of water you might still taste it keep that in mind with this indica rub but oh my gosh it's not like you're sitting here taking this as your dessert you're taking this because you're seeking relief from anxiety or you're taking this to help you sleep or maybe some relief from inflammation so if you take it with that in mind like I'm not taking this because it tastes good I'm taking it because it freakin works then just take it and then go chase it with your cake okay and then you'll definitely love the indica or all three before we go remember that this indica raw hemp 3% has one milligram of CBD per dropper or about thirty milligrams of CBD per dropper full it does have about 2.2 percent THC which is the legal limit in Europe and you can get it both in Europe and in the u.s. it is strongly flavored so keep that in mind but it is such an effective product and the price point is so easy for you to get into in my opinion it's really worth your it's worth your time and your investment to try this product out let me know if you've tried it I for one love it I definitely will be keeping this around my house it is very effective it works it does taste strong but I actually I really appreciate how little I have to take to get all of the benefits from the CBD and I also appreciate the fact that it isn't that expensive to to procure if you will I'd love to know what your thoughts are if you've tried it and if you want to learn even more about all of the different hip products on the market make sure you like and subscribe to our Channel once again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and I can't wait to see you again soon take care bye bye [Music]", "2VCDFUeC3Ow": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make CBD pills [Music] so if you're looking for a great discreet and portable way to consume CBD then you've come to the right place because today we'll be showing you how to make CBD pills we'll start first with making CBD infused coconut oil to fill the capsules coconut oil works well for this because it solidifies at room temperature so that the pills are more stable when transporting around and because of their high saturated fat content they'll infuse well with the CBD I used a quarter of an ounce of medicinal hemp per cup of oil you can add more or less to this recipe depending on how potent you want the pills to be but I found that a fourth of an ounce is a good starting point for most people we'll start first with grinding of the hemp and then decarboxylated in the oven at 250 degrees for about 30 minutes now that the hemp is nice and toasty you'll want to place it in a bowl with the coconut oil place it on top of a pot of boiling water and then use this double boiler technique to infuse the hemp with the coconut oil you'll want to let this boil for at a minimum an hour and preferably two to three hours to make sure that as much of the CBD is infused in the oil as possible now you want to take it out the heat and let it sit for about half an hour to let it cool down not so cool that it solidifies to room temperature but not so hot that I'll burn to the touch strain everything through a cheesecloth [Music] [Music] squeeze as much of the oil out as possible and now we're ready to place them in the capsules you'll probably need to wait another 15 minutes or longer for the oil to cool down just a bit more the melting point for the gelatin capsules are around 90 to 95 degrees because it has to dissolve at below the human body temperature of 98 degrees so you'll have a range of around 75 to 90 degrees to work with since once you're below 75 degrees then the infused CBD coconut oil will start to solidify we now need a few supplies for this part starting with the capsules I found that the zero zero sized capsules are a good compromise between size and ease of use if you want a smaller capsules you can go down to the size zero which is easier to swallow but harder to fill I don't recommend anything smaller than a size zero as they're just really hard to work with you'll also need a way to fill the capsules most food-grade syringes work well and the ones with the needle tips or a tapered deep reach will make it easier to fill the capsules accurately now there's a ton of capsule pill holders on the market to help hold the capsules in place to fill it quicker and to automatically cap each pill afterwards but if you're not making that many pills you can always make a simple one with a small cardboard box and a drill which is what I'm doing now now that I finished drilling in the holes for the capsules I placed each inside as you can see well the hole i accidentally drilled too large so i'll just skip that one now I just used a syringe to fill each capsule cap the maus and that's it [Music] for long-term storage I definitely recommend keeping them in the fridge as warmer climates will keep the coconut oil from solidifying and here's what they look like once solid", "29hyb2rrrgo": "and Marley how do you like your treats did you have any like reservations about giving them CBD at first I was desperate to keep him so I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat will like weed as much as you do [Music] you", "3XCHoEynnoY": "I'm gonna take you through the shopping do's and don'ts of CBD skincare what to look for what to avoid and I'm going to be reviewing my top favorite CBD skincare products and of course being will be joining us this is cheddar cheese bean or bean for short he is our little rescue job that we got 5 years ago and it makes sense for our CBD film because he also takes CBD CBD that I got from healthy spot but before we dive into the shopping do's and don'ts of stephenie's skincare I just want to run down a few of the CBD basics for you guys and don't worry this is gonna be fun and cute and brief so CBD is just one of 80 different cannabinoids found in the hemp and cannabis plants and the way that it works is the CBD cannabinoid it attaches to different receptors in the body and it works to create homeostasis so homeostasis is just kind of a fancy word for saying balance or equilibrium so if we have all this inflammation in our bodies the CBD attaches to receptors and just tries to bring everything in line so that it's in balance again how cool is that right so cool and this is why it's DVD is everywhere in the beauty world because inflammation really is at the heart of a lot of different skin issues like acne rosacea dermatitis redness in the skin or blotchiness and so CBD is able to help with all of those so let's jump into my shopping do's and don'ts for CBD skincare my first shopping do is to opt for full-spectrum or buff broad-spectrum and the reason is because full-spectrum just means that they've taken the entire plant and they've put it into the product so that means leaves stem flowers possibly seeds stalks everything is in there and so in addition to getting these beautiful cannabinoids like CBD you're also all of the powerful antioxidant properties within the plant itself you're getting the omega-3s you're getting the terpenes which are the essential oils of the plant you're getting the flavonoids which have insane antioxidant properties and you want all that together because those components when paired with the CBD have synergistic powers they work together to create a more powerful anti-inflammatory result but the thing with full spectrum is that it does contain a little bit of THC so if the product is a hemp product it's gonna have less than 0.3 percent THC if it's a cannabis product and it's full spectrum it's gonna have anywhere from 3 to 35 percent THC and I know there are some people out there that are wary about THC and just want a product that doesn't have it at all even though it's not gonna hurt you if anything it also has positive benefits too but I do know that some people just want to avoid it and if that's the case then you want to opt for what's called broad spectrum and broad spectrum is essentially the same as full spectrum they use the entire plant when creating the product so you're getting all of those antioxidant benefits from the plant and you're getting the cannabinoids but they go in and they extract the THC so that there's zero THC my next shopping do is do buy sustainably source organic product and I'm not one of those like preachers saying you have to have everything organic but when it comes to CBD products you really want to be very mindful of the sourcing and make sure that it's as clean sourcing as possible because and cannabis plants are called phyto remedial plants and what that means is that they are soil cleaners so they pull out all of the heavy metals and any chemicals that are in the soil and they absorb so if you are using a CBD product that doesn't have clean and good sourcing you know the plant is gonna have all of those pesticides all of those you know chemicals and the fertilizer and then you yourself are gonna be ingesting that now my first shopping don't is don't buy isolate and you're probably wondering what isolate a me well an isolate is where they go in and they extract just the CBD from the plant they take it out and drop it into some coconut oil or some kind of carrier oil and these products are substantially cheaper than broad spectrum and full-spectrum products but they're not gonna be as effective and the reason is because when you're just going in and you're taking out the CBD yes you still have the CBD but you're leaving behind like I said all the flavonoids the terpenes the omega-3 is all the beautiful rich antioxidants in the plant that works synergistically with the CBD you're leaving behind people are probably asking well then why do they even make isolates cuz it's cheaper because it's easier when you're just extracting CBD it's so much easier to measure how much CBD you're putting into your carrier oil then if you compress all the plant matter and you have to try to measure out the THC in there this the CBD that's in there along with other cannabinoids and antioxidants that are in there it's much more difficult and it's more time consuming to do that now my last shopping don't is don't be afraid of products made from the cannabis plant I feel in our culture there has been a long history of stigmatizing cannabis Oana but when it comes to CVD skincare the cannabis plant is so powerful it has more resin on it that's really rich in CBD than the hemp plant and so to get the same levels of CBD in hemp products they have to use just a lot more of the hemp plant I just recommend if you're open to trying them dabble in it try it I highly recommend it so that wraps up my shopping do's and don'ts for CBD skincare and now I'm gonna dive into some products that I've been testing and highly recommend so the first brand that I'm gonna recommend is this brand called flora and fast and they will be getting the organic certification later this year it is a beautiful brand that makes CBD products from cannabis and I have been testing out their age adapting facial serum which I freaking love so much I like to use it very very liberally at night I'll apply almost a full dropper to my face it's very smooth and a light oil it does not absorb fast so you're gonna have oil on your face which is why I like to use it at night and then I'm used my Gua Sha and I'll massage my face and it's so amazing I wake up in the morning and my skin is brighter redness is reducer on my chin and my nostrils almost overnight it just sues that inflammation and it feels so good does not clog my pores whatsoever makes my skin feel very very hydrated and I just I just I love this product so if you're open to trying a CBD skincare product that's made from the cannabis plant I highly recommend checking out flora and bast so this is their topical one and then the relief potion this is a sublingual product and it has like a cute little pump pump here and you just do like a couple pumps under your tongue I like this for during the day it makes me feel like very relaxed and it just helps with my anxiety so again if you're looking into CBD products and you're open to try and once from the cannabis space definitely try out flora and fast and I've linked it up down below because I do have a discount code for you guys 420 off from floor and baths if you're interested in checking it out and they also are available now at Sephora now the second brand that I'm gonna recommend is Lord Jones and you may have seen this brand because they are available in Sephora also and there's two products of theirs that I've been testing out there royal oil which is for the face and there's body oil now the royal oil has about 10 times as much CBD as the body oil which is why it's more expensive this one is about a hundred dollars this is 66 but I've actually seen really great benefits from using the body oil on my face and I would have to say between the two based on price and results I would actually go with the body oil I feel like it's a better value I don't know hundred dollars for it versus this I feel like works just as well and it's sixty six dollars I say go for the body oil now it has a rollerball which I really love for application and I just roll out at night or sometimes I do it like a few little dabs and then kind of Pat it in for the day but this brand is fantastic if you want to avoid THC completely because it's a broad spectrum brand so if you're looking for broad spectrum this is the brand to check out now the last product that I'm gonna recommend is from this brand two cranes which I absolutely love products sustainably sourced it's grown in Denver Colorado and this is an ingestible product you just take a dropper I do about a full I'd say like I do three-quarters of a dropper and do it underneath my tongue every morning and it has helped so much with my stress and my anxiety and as you guys know stress and anxiety play a huge role in how our skin looks and how it feels so I really love taking this one in the morning and I love taking it before I could have any kind of social engagement I have social anxiety I know you're probably thinking that's kind of strange because I'm so outgoing and talkative with you guys here but I have a tendency to Oh like overanalyzed myself like kind of question like oh my god did I sound stupid like why did I say that or what did that person think of this and like freaked myself out but since I have discovered this two cranes product like I don't have it anymore I take a dropper before I go to meet Fred I just feel relaxed I feel calm I feel present I feel clear and I just feel like I can be myself without having this like chatter in my brain that's constantly causing me to question things so that has been a really huge game-changer for me and I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for a CBD product to use during the day for anxiety is it doesn't give me any like physical heaviness some other CBD products that I have tried make me feel mentally and physically relaxed which is not great if you want to get done during the day so those I really am saving for the next video where I'm gonna be talking about the best CBD products for sleeping that's it guys um thank you so much for watching this video you like this video give it a big thumbs up it helps me get my videos visible and out there into the you know wherever it is that they go on the interwebs and I hope that you guys will hit that subscribe button so I'll see you on next week's video [Music]", "urBi1xewboE": "i'm craig henderson here at extract labs in boulder colorado i founded this company about 19 months ago originally in my basement in Arvada Colorado and then about three months later we were fortunate enough to go to move here in the boulder the original business model was to just do toll processing for heme farmers and give them back their oil I soon learned that hemp farmers don't want their oil back they just want to grow plant material and sell it so we went from being just a full processing company to a products company we started off just making tinctures and bulk isolate and then from the marijuana side of things I saw that shatter and crumble was a huge industry so I found a way to make CBD shatter and crumble so it wouldn't be limited to any one state it was a shatter crumble that could be sold across the country my background is all co2 processing that's what we primarily do here co2 processing we also do some alcohol and hydrocarbon the co2 is really what separated us from all the other CVD companies we use my Tallis that's what we started with well in my garage I started with you know a small alcohol extraction it just wasn't enough it didn't make very clean oil so once we got connected up Vitalis and got that machine now we've had for a little over a year that's really what took our business to the next level it makes a lot cleaner oil it's a lot simpler to use everything that comes out of it is just liquid gold you know alcohol is still nice for just going I slit if we need a winterized oil or a distillate or somewhere in between something they've put in our own products it's all co2 it's all from the Vitalis today we're doing about 700 pounds a week in put pounds we should be about 1,200 pounds in the next two months our goal is to be at 2,000 pounds per week in put plant material so if we put in 2,000 pounds you know a percentage of that will go to winterized oil you can also take it to distillate ice lit we have flash chromatography they can remove THC so we can make THC free distillate you know there's 120 some cannabinoids out there th C's one of them that everyone's focused on we're gonna focus on the other 119 of them I'd say our shatter and crumble is what most people would probably look at us like we I feel like we were kind of Raiders or founders of CVD shatter the top five biggest CVD companies shatter companies online or all are shatter just white-label for other people but really the body cream and muscle cream is what I feel like I'm personally most proud of it's what I use the most of just tempering the body cream or the muscle cream to get it to the right consistency using the right ingredients trying to keep it very simple if we get our hands on good industrial hemp like the cherry wine strains we have we can pull off really nice terpenes and put those in our products so our cherry wine is something we pull off in-house and then put back into our products and then we just discovered a really cool method for making a really legit water-soluble isolate or full-spectrum water-soluble haven't even released it yet but we should have really nice water soluble products in the very near future you do everything in-house we're not outsourcing really anything that I can think of everything is made here it's processed here it's shipped from here everyone feels like they're kind of part of something you know that's changing the world and I think there's that super-high passion as well as separating us from some of the other companies you know I've had other jobs in the past and they just didn't share the same vision so you're working around a whole bunch of people and they're just not on the same page here I'm working with 25 people that are literally sharing the same vision they wake up excited to the same thing as me every day so I think just the passion and the fact that we do everything in-house we're not reporting to a bunch of guys in suits that you know aren't part of what we do you know it gets scarier the more people you hire the more you start feeling like a large corporation I don't want to lose those small company that that high passion I want to get big but I don't want to lose you know what we have today so it's kind of a balancing act my biggest fear is that Big Pharma will get involved manipulate it over regulate it and change what it is today and make it to where it's impossible for people like me or other small people to get into this and then it just becomes another big pharma problem there's a lot of pharmaceutical products today that I think hopefully get pushed by the wayside they're really not that good for you they're covering up small things are causing bigger problems be nice to see in five years what cannabis can do for people I'm curious to see where that's gonna go you see how big we can get and try to keep it like I said keep that passion alive keep it um just owned by us when I stepped into CBD and him I thought I was taking a step down I thought I wasn't good enough for the marijuana side of things you know and I feel like now the hemp or the CBD side of things is gonna far outdo marijuana I think marijuana in a few years is gonna be a small niche in the realm of the cannabis industry so I feel like I really got lucky you you", "02Ucs3V1U-k": "what is going on guys welcome on in we're gonna bring you another carrier oil 101 serious video but first my name is dancey bearded my subscribers they call me the trust and teacher for all things beard related and today I'm gonna cover the highly requested hemp seed oil video I'm gonna tell you where it comes from the history behind it the benefits for your beard and skin underneath your beard and importantly if I recommend it to you guys but also include some companies that are using this and I want to make this clear hemp seed oil is totally different than CBD oil and I'll cover CBD oil on a future video probably in the near future actually but they are two totally different things and make sure you watch the whole video I have some really important points and some misconceptions that clear up is specifically with hemp seed oil [Music] where where does the ingredient hemp seed oil come from that is in some of your beard products well it is likely from the country of Canada all the way up to estimate some 90% of the hemp seed oil in the United States is from our neighbors to the north Canada we'll get into the reasons why on the history portion because that is really important for this topic and for hemp seed oil but one important thing to know is hemp seed oil does come from the cannabis plant when we look at where it is cannabis but it is a totally different strain than the cannabis plant that people use recreationally to smoke a totally different thing this is not a plant that you could smoke to have THC or to get high from it it is completely separate even though when you see hemp lotion and all these other things they usually advertise with the green marijuana leaf they are two totally different plants in strains so I don't to make sure that's clear because that misconception is gonna be very important as we talk about everything else about this ingredient history as a history teacher I love diving deep into this segment for any ingredient or really any topic period but the history behind hemp seed oil is loaded and interesting first off over 8,000 years ago hemp seed oil was first used by the ancient Chinese and that is important because you can find tons and tons of stuff dating back to probably ten thousand years ago of people using hemp for clothing for paper for all sorts of different things but the actual seeds being cold-pressed and creating oil was done by the ancient Chinese in about 6000 BCE now they used in three ways they used it for their skin their hair but they also ingested it they thought it would improve their immune system they thought it made them healthier all those things that may or may not be legit that's for a different channel different time but this is about the hair in the skin and the Chinese were the first to use now this goes all the way through Europe this goes through the history all the way back then to more recent history in the u.s. in 1937 there was a really misinformed tax law that pretty much halted all hemp production in the United States whether it was for the drug whether it was for hemp seed oil whether was from hemp oil or anything to do with that plant whether it had THC or not and again guys THC is the psychoactive ingredient that gets people high when they smoke it when they make any kind of drug product out of it right now they have edibles they have everything you can imagine well this is a totally different strain but the tax loss still impacted it so still to this day hemp seed production in the United States has greatly been hurt compared to countries like Canada or France or anywhere else in the world that is producing this ingredient and we'll see in a second if it is a great ingredient or not and whether the US should look at their misconceptions with that law the impact of that law and even the way that we market and advertise any product that has to do with hemp I think this is a loaded thing but it's gonna be really important here so the history loaded one but we could kind of make sense of this ingredient why it's used or why it's not used in some of our favorite companies benefits we see companies using this ingredient in our beard oils and beard products so what are the benefits refresh revive and strengthen flatout this is an absolutely amazing ingredient one of the best I've ever used in research and I am loving it more and more as I use more and as I look more into it it is referred to as a freak of nature it is the most unsaturated fat oil in the plant kingdom it is called the most perfectly balanced oil there is unplanted earth it is thin it absorbs quickly and on the co-manage Enic scale so check out that video if you haven't it comes in at a zero meaning no matter what your skin type is oily dry no matter what your hair type is straight curly course it will not clog your pores or do any damage to your hair it is a heavily nourishing oil that is going to both help your hair and your skin it is full of vitamins minerals fatty acids antioxidants everything we want and it is the second most packed protein rich oil on planet Earth that is amazing with the proteins that we see in there and the fatty acids it is gonna promote healthy hair growth and to help you grow your hair faster and stronger by stimulating the blood flow at the base of your hairs there is truly no downfall to this ingredient and it's something that I would love to see in more companies providing us with hemp seed oil it is really known as one of those just wonders of the plant world and it does so many great things for our skin and for our hair hemp seed oil I could go on for a much longer time and bore you guys about the benefits just know that it is absolutely amazing and is a one-of-a-kind oil truly one-of-a-kind recommend do I recommend this ingredient when you're checking the labels on your beard products after my rants on the benefits portion of this of course I recommend this it is very unfortunate that a misconception is the reason that we do not have this readily available in the United States and a lot of the companies that we love that could really benefit from this ingredient are not using it I really really hope to address misconceptions on this channel and change opinions with facts science and just good old common sense and I think this video is a perfect example of that there are terrible misconceptions that have been put on by the government but also by advertisers and also just by people that are not looking into what they're talking about and they hear the name hemp and they just assume that it is something negative that something that's gonna get you high that is just not the case this is great for our beard hair and even better for the skin underneath it and it's something that I really hope companies are paying attention to and play with in the ingredients to make this more accessible to help out those beards that we see and that we love so yes I strongly recommend it three companies that I love that use this we have luxurious bastard husky and royal beardsman I cannot find a bunch more that I actually use on a regular basis that have hemp seed oil and I was actually disappointed to see that a lot of these other ones that we cover I could make a list forever I Argan jojoba sweet almond fractionated coconut oil every company checks those box off check check check check when it gets down to hemp seed oil very few those are really the only three if you know another company that you love that uses hemp seed oil boom please drop it in a comment down below question will leave you guys with what did you learn in this video I know there's something about hemp seed oil that you are not aware of I don't care for your company I don't care if you're a consumer I don't care if you're a scientist there's likely something in here unless it's your field of study that you did not know before watching this video I know I sure did when I dove into the research when I started talking to experts in the field I learned a lot and it really enlightened me and I love learning so leave me a comment down below about what you learned and then if you have any questions or even requests for future videos for the carrier oils 101 series I made this one because I had the most votes on the previous video so keep it come with you guys I love these and you know it's not gonna go anywhere in the future it's gonna evolve into essential oils 101 and then it's gonna evolve into Co wash and wash ingredients 101 this is limitless and I'm so excited to be the person to have the chance to bring this information to you guys so thank you guys as always for the support if you liked the video make sure you check that thumbs up at the bottom also just check to verify that you're subscribed or consider hitting it if you're not my name is dancey bearded stay bearded and stay positive [Music]", "N3Yw3dtj6Pc": "hey guys so today's video is gonna be me talking through my experience using CBD oil I've been using it for about a month now so I thought it was about time I share my experience with you guys and yet share if there's been any benefits for my skin so the CBD oil that I've been using is by Zen CBD I picked this up in Planet organic so any of you guys given the UK or live in London then CBD is stocked in Planet organic and yeah and you can pick this up I think the reason I picked this up is because it was firstly a really good price it would being discounted from I think 30 pounds to 20 pounds and I say a good price that it's still super expensive but yeah I went in there and actually spoke to a sales consultants and they taught me through the different options I'm I explained of what I wanted to use it for I liked the fact that I hadn't ever used cbz or before so they recommended this one it's a fairly low strength I think it's between 3 to 5 percent obviously it determines how much you use I've been using 1 to 2 sprays I started with one spray and I've built up to two so yeah this is the one that I've been using like with other supplements I think it's really beneficial to actually speak to somebody who actually sells the product or is experienced in using the product just because they'll be able to give you like an honest opinion or an honest review on which of those sort of things actually work which kind of brands might be more suitable for what you need them for so yeah like I said I started on a low percentage and that's what I've been using I know that you can build this up but for me I just wanted to start with yeah the lowest strength and just see how that worked for me first so the potential benefits because obviously there's a reason I wanted to try this in the first place I had read so many positive reviews on how this had really been able to help people manage day-to-day stress anxiety and a ton of other really great health benefits for me I've noticed such a huge correlation between my acne flaring up and like my emotional well-being like how much stress I'm under so I really wanted to find something that could help me yeah just manage the day-to-day stresses of life lots of people have reported that they've been able to lower inflammation that they've been able to regulate sebum production and tons of other really great things to your skin as well so yeah I wanted to give this a test see if it actually works and that's exactly what I've done for the last month so the lady that's we this in the shop instructed me to spray once two sprays underneath my tongue and hold it there for sixty seconds and that is exactly what I've been doing I haven't actually applied this topically to my skin because oil is for me really a clogging I know that some people have like miraculous results and are able to clear their skin using things like the oil cleansing method I've tried that but it just does nothing for my skin it just does not work it just makes me produce more oil it makes me feel really greasy and honestly I just I just know it doesn't work for me so if you want to apply this directly to your skin and see if there's any benefits for you then please come and report back because I'm just not going to put myself ones of that experiment but I'd love to know from you guys if that has helped your acne and yeah if you've seen any improvements in your skin so the first thing that I wanted to mention that I've seen as a result of using CBD oil is that my digestion has definitely improved now if you've been following my channel or you'd follow me over on Instagram then you will know that my digestive health has definitely been something that's been playing up since about November last year I've had all kinds of things going on from IBS to a chronic acid reflux and yeah I've just found that using CBD oil has really minimized any flare-ups I've had of those things like for example my acid reflux was really bothering me every single day all day from about January the first all the way through till the end of kind of April and it's no coincidence I've started using CBD oil and I've been able to just relax about it a bit more and I'm not saying it's completely gone please believe me it hasn't it isn't a miracle but it's definitely helped like I don't feel like I'm dealing with it all day every day it kind of comes in waves sometimes but yeah that has been the most exciting benefit I found of using CBD oil and yeah quite excited to see if I continued to use it and what will happen I've also noticed that my severe bloating which I get at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon every single day until I eat dinner and yeah it just continues to get worse and worse so that has definitely been something that's improved to I've also been kind of monitoring why I've been eating I keep a acne diary so I wanted to kind of when I'm breaking out the sort of things I'm eating how I'm feeling all the sort of things that could be tribute to a break out and I've noticed as well because I've been monitoring my in there as well that this is actually reduced as well since using CBD and again yeah it might be a coincidence but I really believed that actually the stress I put myself under about my health has reduced because of using CBD oil this is also really exciting because lots and lots and lots of studies have been done on acne and digestive health and they definitely have found correlations between the two so if you're somebody that struggles with your digestive health and you also struggle with breaking out then this could be a really really exciting thing for you to try and could potentially really heal up your skin another positive side effect I had for about a week was I started to have really great sleep like I was sleeping super quickly fall into a deep sleep and I felt very well rested when I woke up I wish I could say that this lasted throughout the whole month but honestly it didn't I feel like after the first month it sorry after the first month after the first week it kind of just sort of subsided and I just went back to my usual sleeping pattern I haven't slept really badly or anything I don't find that it's really kind of like given me that feeling before sleep where I just yet feel completely knocked out and just really well rested however lots of other people have said that this is an absolute miracle worker when it comes to insomnia and really bad sleeping patterns so if that's you then potentially you could give this a go potentially maybe I need to use a higher dose so I need to take it slightly further in the evening towards bed I've been taking it just after I've eaten probably like 15 minutes after I've eaten so that you're digesting the CBD oil with food I think actually on the bottle it says between meals and let me just check yeah it does actually say on the bottle to defy spray in between meals for best effects spray under tongue so potentially I could have taken this nearer towards bed as opposed to nearer towards dinner and maybe that would have helped me with my sleep better so the next thing the big thing for me that I really wanted to see some help with was reducing anxiety and just reducing like how you handle day-to-day stress so for me this is definitely the biggest one I've been wondering this very very carefully and I know lots of people have said that this is like amazing and has really helped them I honestly believe for the first few weeks it was most definitely helping I felt really well rested like I said and yeah just fell I don't know a little bit more able to cope with certain things and I just wasn't kind of like I don't know letting stress take over my life however for the last few weeks I just don't think that has been the case I would love to say that this has been like again a miracle-worker maybe I need to be taking a higher strength I don't know but yeah I haven't found that this is like miraculously help me manage stress and like I said at the beginning of this video if you're taking this because of stress it's also because you really want to reduce the amount of acne flare-ups you pads for me I've definitely noticed I've been breaking out around my jawline and around my kind of ears with the more kind of deep cystic spots so I haven't noticed a big improvement in CBD oil and my skin today I'm actually feeling like I'm really happy with my skin but this week hasn't been great but it's also worth noting that lots of things that help your skin that you take internally don't just work overnight and that is the case for like supplements that's the case for things like I keep saying that's the case for the pill nothing works within like a month usually so potentially if I take this for longer which I really plan to do to see if there are any additional benefits I think the three-month mark is really a good indication about whether something can really work for your skin however I also tried things for three months and they've absolutely not worked I'm looking at you best your book so yeah if you feel like something's actually making your skin worse than probably best to stop I've tried tons of other things that help me reduce my stress and my acne as well so I think the biggest trial for me was coffee like I am a coffee addict guys I know it can increase anxiety I stick to one cup a day but it really is something I look forward to and I love but last year I actually tried to give it up for two weeks and it was very very difficult guys I've actually filmed an entire blog looking at me quitting coffee the benefits I might have had in my anxiety in my skin and in fact our link it on screen now somewhere around here so go and check it out let me know what you think and I will see you over there I don't know if it tastes that nice I mean really no it doesn't taste like coffee that's for sure hmm just tasted", "Hu0iwsk6qEU": "hey guys welcome back to sunflower health foods my name is Gabriel and today we're gonna be talking about CBD oil alright guys as you can see we have a pretty big selection in our store of CBD oils now you might be wondering why would I want to take a CBD oil so simony has a couple different benefits some of the benefits include helping with chronic pain insomnia stress and nausea also it helps with cognitive function and brain health so some of those CBD products that we carry in our store come in different forms and have different purposes we have foils soft gels and then we also have the creams which are topical so one of my personal favorites of the oils that we sell in our store also a customer favorite is this oil here by a straight hem they are super pure company based out of Colorado and everything they do is super clean there's no additives or anything else just CBD in him so the straight hemp oil does use the whole plant extract meaning it does have that little bit of THC but for those of you that are looking for one that is THC free we do have a selection of those down here they are all by garden of live which is another super clean brand but just no THC in there they only use the stem of the hemp plant moving on to the soft gels we do have a pretty big selection on those as well one being the urban brand now they also make a super super clean product very pure no additives and some of them they do have a couple of blends with tumeric and other things but for the most part super clean super pure moving on to the creams now if you have a localized pain these are perfect for taking that away very very fast no mess if you don't like take anything internally just topical put it right on the spot get rid of the pain so for that we do have one buy straight hemp the same brand I was telling you about earlier another super pure product there's a couple different essential oils in there with the hemp and CBD just help kind of get rid of that information in pain another softgel is won by garden of life the same grand I was talking about earlier there's their soft gel as well as their oil with both THC free so you don't have to worry about any of that they do have a couple different blends here with their soft gels there's one for relaxing sleep inflammatory response so if any of those interests do we do up those as well so if you're looking for something without the THC that's a great choice for you then we have the South so if you have a localized pain that you're trying to get rid of them the could be arthritis it could just be tennis elbow any type of pain put it on the spot it's gone within four or five minutes of applying it for those of you looking for a less concentrated version of the Sun we do offer the lotion so if it's a large-scale area it's a lot easier to apply that directly to the spot CBD provides many different benefits adjusting many different health issues so as you guys can see we have a wide selection of CBD products at both our locations in Gainesville and Lake City so come on down no more than knowledgeable staff will be happy to help you find a product that suits you", "N53s-b_TX34": "in today's episode of how to not get high with cannabis we're exposed CBD to THC ratios in video 1 we talked about hemp CBD products and in video 3 we taught you how to find your minimum effective dose of THC but if we're really trying to use cannabis as medicine then we want to be using both CBD and THC together and I'm video about hemp CBD products we mentioned that ideally you want to be looking for those full spectrum or whole plant extracts that had at least trace amounts of THC as they've been shown to be more effective than CBD isolates and this is because of a concept in cannabis called the entourage effect the entourage effect theorized is that all of the compounds in cannabis cannabinoids terpenes flavonoids and more all work best when used together enhancing one another's effects to maximize therapeutic benefits when it comes to using cannabis as medicine choosing a CBD to THC ratio will have a big impact on the level of intoxication or high that you'll experience if you recall from our hemp CBD video THC is a cannabinoid that binds to endocannabinoid system receptors primarily found in our brain and our central nervous system which is why it can create intoxicating experiences while CBD is a cannabinoid that slows the breakdown of our bodies on it naturally produced endocannabinoids so that we can use more of them but when THD is consumed with CBD CBD is actually able to buy our receptors as well and it changes their shape weakening team C's ability to bind to those receptors and ultimately impacting how how you feel when used together DVD can reduce the negative side effects of THC such as paranoia anxiety elevated heart rate memory loss and sluggishness while THC can enhance the therapeutic benefit of CBD this is really important information for patients who need the therapeutic properties that THC has to offer but don't want to feel high and if you are someone who enjoys using THC recreationally keep this in mind if you ever do get uncomfortably high CBD can help reduce those effects for you so what's this look like in practice well if you walk into a dispensary you'll probably see products labeled a sativa indica and hybrid but this doesn't tell you anything about the CBD to THC ratio you'll likely need to ask your bud tender about which products offer the CBD to THC ratio that you're interested in this is known as a cannabinoid profile and all cannabis products fall into three general categories CBD dominant balanced and THC dominant generally speaking if you're not looking to get high then you should be looking for a CBD dominant or balanced cannabis product although it's important to note that cannabis affects everyone differently and depending on your condition and dosing a THC dominant product may be an effective medicine for you without producing a high if you want more information on that look at video three on how to find your minimum effective dose of THC you can typically find CBD to THC ratios such as one two one two one one two two or even ten to one or twenty to one when shopping be aware that DVD dominant products are still relatively new most cannabis strains have been bred to be THC dominant but as new research is emerging on the benefits of more balanced and CBD dominant strains this is changing so be sure to ask your bud tender to direct you to the CBD dominant products offered in your dispensary now if you have no experience with THC and are particularly concerned about getting high then starting with the highest ratio of CBD the THC available is definitely the way to go many medical patients have reported that using a twenty to one ratio of CBD to THC has been helpful for their symptoms without leaving them feeling high at all but even with this ratio you're still going to want to start low and go slow paying attention to how many milligrams of THC is in the dose that you're consuming for more tips on how to get started dosing with THC check out video 3 from this series on how to find your minimum effective dose if this ratio doesn't work for you you can start increasing your ratio of THC again starting low and going slow this may feel tedious and perhaps even expensive as you explore new products but just keep in mind that as long as you're careful with your math you can always combine products to find your own perfect CBD the THC ratio on the flipside if you are already experienced with THC and you're looking for a product that will help give you the relief that you're seeking while still remaining alert and productive during the day then you may want to start with a little bit higher THC ratio perhaps two to one or even one to one parts CBD to THC know that your perfect ratio may change based on the symptoms that you're dealing with for example I found that a one to one ratio of CBD to THC does wonders for my migraines while still allowing me to work but if I'm struggling with back pain a two-to-one ratio a CVD the THC allows me to keep a clear head either way always be sure to track your dose and the effects that you feel this is really important for either recreating or avoiding experiences in the future for more information on the science behind using THC and CBD together visit Hensleigh comm slash learn if

friends this time cats specifically we've already talked a lot about the great benefits of CBD for dogs but did you know that it can be just as beneficial for your cats - I don't have a cat for this video a lot more difficult to get our hands on but very similar to dogs now I know what you're thinking cats are very different than dogs how much does it get them to take this well first things first always talk to your vet before giving your pet any supplement see buddy works wonders to calm some pets down but it's not perfect for every pet so make sure you talk to your vet and ask whether it would interact with any of their medications you can also ask your vet for advice on how best to give CBD to your cat like with dogs the best way to give them CBD is poorly so with cats you have two options one oil placed right in their mouth or two tinctures mixed in with their food or water oil dropped into their mouth with the dropper is the most effective way to control the dosage but cats don't generally like taking their medicine so this is a little tricky for some owners if your cat allows hold their head back by the scruff of their neck it doesn't hurt them I'm not doing it but I don't have one this is how mothers carry their young insert the dropper into their mouth and squeeze the CBD right on his or her tongue the other option which is much easier for most cat owners is to mix the CBD tincture into their food or water measure out the serving and sprinkle it in on their food or water before serving the only difficulty with this is that unlike dogs cats typically don't finish their whole bowl of food or water in one city so they may not get the full serving if you and your vet decide that CBD is right for your cat it's really important to remember to check the serving size since cats are so much smaller than dogs they can be more sensitive to the CBD we always recommend starting with a smaller serving size working your way up until you find what works for you and your pet and that's it not quite as easy as it was with the puppers but that's cats for you don't forget to drop any questions you have in the comments and we'll get back to you live well be well [Music] you", "l66VIVxVkSU": "well hey guys welcome back to my channel it's Adrienne the naturalist and I have a special for you guys on a CBD cream by a company called CBD oil biotech and this

arthritis pain it's made with our proven pain relief formula and boosted with high quality raw hemp oil the screen provides relief when you need it the most and both of these creams are from a company I get called diamond CBD and I'll link down below the website but to be honest with you I started out with the higher strength one the 1500 milligrams and it knocked my socks off with pain you guys I mean I get joint pain and every joint specifically my hands my knees my back my neck and yeah it's crazy I get a lot of pain from being and chronic pain from fibromyalgia and with my arthritis in my my right hip and my lower lumbar which is my lower back it gets irritating so I put on a little dollop of this and I'm not sure if these both have the same ingredients but they might be very similar but let's talk about the thousand milligram one because that'd be a good place to start out they do make 500 milligram ones as well and this one right here is on sale right now plus if you sign on to their website and sign up if you're a teen or years or older because these are THC free CBD creams then you get 35% off I'll link down that coupon code - I believe it's welcome in all capital letters and then the numbers three and five but don't quote me on that but um yeah the ingredients in these and this is why I like them the first ingredient Halong coffee break delicious venti iced decaf nonfat latte with three stevia's and extra light ice that's my drink of choice industrial hemp cannabidiol or CBD menthol purified water we've got alcohol mineral oil we've got stearic acid we've got glycerol aloe vera powder another alcohol EDTA we got la Vera gel some things I don't know how to pronounce some other things we've got camper which is a good cooling agent we got tea tree oil that's another good cooling agent for the joints and muscles in vitamin E and there's a couple of ingredients all packed in there and I'll link it all down below for you guys THC free lab tested made in the United States of America made with industrial hemp non GMO like I mentioned and no pesticides and thousand dollar grand one is great and it says for the instructions to not apply more than four times a day massage is not necessary just apply it to the skin smells nice and soothing it's really nice and creamy it stays in there but be careful when you open the jar I've already done one application on my hands but as you can see I'm just using a little gulps worth I'm gonna put it in the areas that hurt the most and we're gonna rub that in for some relief pain relief and then I'll let you guys know what I thought about this side of a 10 star but yeah if you're just trying out I'd say if you have pretty extreme pain like myself like a 9 out of 10 10 to the 10 on your worst days I would go with the high strength 1500 milligrams because that's just like the best option and it's worth the price I believe right now it was normally it's a little pricey 199.99 for the 1500 milligram illustrate the milligrams strength one I can't dog forgive me and it's on sale right now for a hundred and $9.99 and then this one right here I believe is normally a hundred and something and it's on sale for $60 and I'm not sure if that thirty five percent off coupon on top probably applies do you get it for even better deal my I stocked up and got two of these since they were on sell for sixty they were sold out like I might have mentioned on the 1500 milligrams they have these back in stock but if you're just looking for something more affordable and you're just like I got a pain here in there thousand is more enough you guys so what am I gonna rate these on a 10 star being 10 plus and 0 the worst luck job well I'm going to give him a solid 10 a 10 they're both amazing I mean the 1500 milligram I was like wow this is the most soothing moisturizing effective cvd cream for my joints and my muscles that i've experienced and then i was like they're out of stock so I'll try the thousand milligrams got to these and I've had it for a few days and I am not disappointed I'm literally just gonna stick with a thousand milligram one is perfect for me so I just want to talk about that 10 10 star rating for sure on both of those products from diamond CBD company CBD oil biotech and they have a website as well I believe maybe it's not listed on here not sure but they are out of Fort Lauderdale Florida that's where they're distributed so check out this CBD cream and you won't be disappointed and sorry I'm a little not too energetic today I have another chronic migraine I'm trying to figure my way around these if you guys have any suggestions out there or any treatment plans that work for y'all on chronic migraines related to whatever you can think of please let me know I'm looking into doing some neck exercises not just like that but some pole bar in kind of exercises at the gym I'm sitting across from my dream right now I was gonna go in but wasn't feeling so good today I got sick again going off a new medication I started a couple months ago that's been giving me a lot of nausea and migraines and so it's giving me more Naja and more migraines going off of it there you go on pharmaceutical drugs people hmm that's why I love CBD it's all-natural no side effects going off it for a while no side effects getting on it it's just a beneficial plant so just bear with me while I'm making my videos here lately but if you have any suggestions like I said on treatment plans for migraines please comment down below I'm desperate for anything natural but yeah the guy at the GNC in town here the other week said he used to suffer from chronic migraines and he pumps it up at their gym y'all do do or do it funny huh he wasn't like that and I wasn't like that with him but um basically he said to do like the polling Robo kind of motion ones towards the chest ones up above the head and if you can do it with your lower or your upper back ones behind pulling up like that machines and that'll strengthen the muscles in the neck which connect up to the head which go to the blood flow which can cause migraines or not migraines depending on if you strength those muscles so I'm definitely gonna look into that I want to make some updated garden videos before the garden has to be kind of harvested here at the end of the summer and I'm seeing a lot of videos pop up on YouTube about plants that can be grown in productively and survive through fall time so I'm gonna look into that some videos for you guys on that and other than that I'm just thinking to take it easy with my migraines my nausea the next hour long and just get it through this with my CBD and my supplements and I'll make a video here soon on the supplements I take there are people going out to their cars and I feel like a nerve because I might youtuber and people don't know who I'm talking to I could care less what people think but I don't really have much else to say if you guys have any suggestions for videos besides reviews if you want to see I know one of you mentioned a comment if you want to see what I eat in a day overall ideas I can post a video on that I could make videos on grocery hauls if you guys want to see exactly what I buy the grocery store that's healthy low-fat options is a vegetarian and yeah I can do a view on my new supplement regiment because I did start a new CBD capsule that is CBD isolate from diamond CBD website as well as where I got these two creams from and they have 5-htp which is a natural supplement for the brain for anxiety and mood disorders and I've been trying that out as a supplement itself so I thought why not get a CBD capsule to replace my other CD CBD capsules I'm almost out of and try the one with a 5-htp add it into it kill two birds with one stone and also I am taking l-theanine but I can make a video on that I started some ginkgo which is a plant that's been around for centuries since prehistoric times basically it's good for brain functioning so I'm trying that for memory and my migraines trying to think what else I started in vitamin D I started a caffeine supplement despite what doctors say they don't know everything every body like body of your body is different and I started a supplement that is all-natural I can show you guys in a video one day when I'm home that contains yerba monta in it which is a good caffeinated natural drink from the yerba mate a plant and it also has natural caffeine from green coffee beans I believe it is and a little bit of rhodiola rosa in it for some energy and it's all good combination to do treatment for my ADHD because I am no longer on adderall I was on that for a month or two it didn't work for me and the alternative to adderall the non-stimulant pharmaceutical medication for ADHD is just too many side effects not good for you and I'd rather take the Supplemental form in life the natural approach if I can so I'm gonna sign off and I have a lot of great videos coming up just bear with me on my migraines my nausea I'm trying my best to pump through these migraines last nine months a bang basically every day all day and I'm doing my gosh dang best so

just a little drop here and there in a tincture bottle I have but I can clean out from a CBD tincture I had I like to be reusable but minimalistic at the same time if that makes sense so okay guys I'm feeling a little better and I'm waiting for my mom to come out so I'm gonna finish my coffee okay guys this was Adrian the naturalist and this was a little review slash chat vlog with me I'm the parking lot this morning on some CBD oil biotech thousand milligrams CBD cream as well as their 1500 milligrams CBD cream okay bye guys [Music]", "0FaGl2HjHEM": "hi everyone my name is Kelsey and my name is Becky and we're the star girls we're back with another video idea for a DIY Christmas week series this one is yet another one that can be really pricey online and we're gonna show you how to do it for that cheap cheap Oh actually remember we were doing that series we were getting our makeup done and then the makeup artist totally recommend this like a little bomb serum um I bought it but it was like fifty dollars why but I like really liked it when she used it on me so I was like this is solely worth it what was it for uh you can use it on your lips it's like a bomb just like the thing we're making today especially the moisturizing one and gave us what the ingredients are they're like the exactly the same as wax they are oil so if you guys haven't figured out already we are gonna show you how to make a DIY solve ourselves however you want to say it or bombs yeah so many fun words for this thing so basically these can be used to moisturize but also to soothe different problems that you might have or somebody that you want to give it to you my house so we're making a couple different kinds today one is more first skin and lavender is really good for skin and healing skin so you can use that essential oil in your salad or balm also pepper and cayenne we're using in a muscle ache balm yep and this one's right music heats up so the warmth is really nice on muscles and another ingredient you could try mixing in is peppermint because performance really cooling it helps to like soothe if you have headaches raining that's hot so you want to cool it down it's fun to play around with ingredients like that yes but let's get started with the ones that we are tackling today so our first salt is a moisturizing style and this is perfect for combating their really cold dry winters that we experienced here in Canada yes which I'm sure a lot of people out there to also experience in different parts of the world so to make this you're going to want to pick up these ingredients coconut oil shea butter some grated beeswax and avocado oil or you could just use regular olive oil and if you're planning to make this for a gift make sure you pick up a measuring cup or a container that you're only gonna use for making these types of things because the waxes and the oils can leave a permanent residue on the containers that you might not want to cook with and of course you're using a glass measuring cup as well as other glass tools because we're gonna be heating up don't use plastic add three tablespoons of grated beeswax to the measuring cup create a double boiler by adding some water into a larger pot and then placing a measuring cup or bowl inside and heating the water we used a glass measuring cup that we had just because we use this specifically for DIYs and we can place it in there and not worry about anything happening to it or melting it because it's class let the beeswax fully melts and then add half a cup of avocado oil 2 tablespoons of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil once everything is fully melted together you honestly shouldn't need to stir that much it kind of just blends nicely but you can stir it if you want take that out from your double boiler and then add in your essential oils you can use whatever essential oil that you want but if you want to use lavender that is really good for the skin and then you're gonna want to pour yourself into a giftable container we have these really cute tins we'll link you guys some options below but you can also use mason jars as a pretty standard one our second self is a heating saw and this is great for achy muscles to make this heating salv you'll need to go pick up the following coconut oil grated beeswax cayenne pepper ground ginger ground black pepper rosemary essential oil avocado oil or olive oil again start with a measuring cup in a larger pot of water add in two tablespoons of grated beeswax 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of avocado oil or olive oil 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons of ground ginger 2 teaspoons of pepper stir them all together and let them melt so next add something to strain the mixture to the top of a separate container and pour the mixture on top so we tried using a standard coffee filter at first but that didn't strain it very well it didn't seem to drip through fast enough we then had to switch to a fine fabric that we just owned for previous DIYs and that worked perfectly yeah now I've also heard that pantyhose works amazing for this make sure that they're new yeah but you could try that as well from the dollar store and here's what all the chunky ingredients looks like that we strained out you can add the container back into the hot water if you find a mixture has cooled too quickly add in 20 drops of rosemary essential oil or really whatever essential oil you want but rosemary is great for this one and pour it into your little giftable containers so to make these super cute and giftable we use an old-school label maker to write on the side of them what they're gonna do for you aches relief moisturize they won't cause a total relieve and then we wrap them with some holidays wine [Music] so to actually use these selves you just need to rub your hands in them to warm them up a little bit and you should turn into a super moisturizing consistency and then you can put it on any problem area that's like dry skin or if you have sore muscles sometimes I take out like the solid form and put it on the back of my hand and then I warm it up there and then again apply it wherever you need to yeah super easy we hope you guys enjoyed learning how to make these the best thing is that a lot of the base ingredients are similar so once you buy them in bulk you can make a ton of different versions of this make sure you guys tune in to our other videos throughout all of gift week we have so many fun ideas that are affordable and easy to do I can't you love them yes then if you like this video make sure that you give it a like if you love it make sure you sub it we'll see you next time bye guys [Music]", "Qe29DzB92x4": "today's review and lab tests are on r medicinal's 2500 milligram extract 2500 milligrams this is nuts yes i sent their 1 000 milligram extract to the lab before and got some backlash from that review i originally found this brand on amazon amazon does not allow cbd so brands on amazon don't mention cbd or thc it's a problem but now a bunch of credible brands do this the 1 000 milligram review was very impressive very cheap lots of cannabinoids but i still talk [ __ ] about the transparency issue well a bunch of r r medicinal fans reached out and they were like what's your problem jeremy it's a good product and you're not being cool one of them even called me an l7 weenie i don't even know what that is come on benny man the kid is a l7 winnie so i sent their 2500 milligram oil to the lab labs to see if it's real you've got to test multiple products or you won't know if a brand is consistent or real that's a big problem let's see the results right after this intro and disclaimer my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer lab results do not guarantee all products by cbd company will test the same many cbd companies produce inconsistent or entirely fake cbd i use affiliate links to support these free lab tests these are my honest opinions this is not sponsored i pay for the products and i pay for the lab test all cbd is blind tested to give you truly independent results you're welcome visit cbd examined.com for official lab tests and more this is not medical advice enjoy they claim 2500 milligrams for 96.99 that's a weird price and that is a lot of milligrams of who knows what our labs found 9 to 18 percent more cannabinoids than suggested by their label that's good but if we went by cbd lab a found 2600 milligrams of cbd which is extremely accurate we measured this in total cannabinoids because rnr medicinals doesn't mention cbd anywhere let's break this down into milliliters this is insane about 90 milligrams of cbd per milliliter that's so much a lot of novice cbd users might use nine milligrams this is 90. 90 milligrams wow over two milligrams of thc wow wow for sensitive people watch out because that can start to give you high effects for sensitive people those thc high effects and you certainly don't want to take a drug test if you're using this product a lot about one milligram of cbg and a milligram of cbc that's extremely good this is a well-rounded full spectrum look up the entourage if you don't know what's going on here this is probably the most potent i've tested in terms of total cannabinoids but the dropper is labeled that's nice so you don't need to take this much you can take far less the problem with any natural full spectrum oil that is this potent is that it will taste horrible it's just hemp and peppermint oil hemp doesn't taste good and this is a lot of hemp extract it's almost got a natural like tobacco or oaky flavor the hemp flavor is that strong this will put hair on your breast let me tell you but they warn you that the flavor is intense and they do not recommend this for those that are sensitive to hemp taste i respect that we can't really complain about the strong flavor because they warned us and the flavor strong because this is incredibly potent and natural the cost the cost is phenomenal under 4 cents per milligram that's cheaper than about 90 percent of cbd products on the market plus this has more cannabinoids than 99 of products out there which is a statistic that i just made up but highly accurate this tincture looks like something a dock in the 1800s would give you right next to a saloon in a gold mining town the liquid is brown it doesn't look appealing but the viscosity is actually light it goes down pretty easy which is a good thing now i still don't like that this brand is not transparent about cbd and thc levels i mean this this is strong and i'm a little worried about sensitive people to thc and cbd buying this they should know but maybe i should stop being an l7 weenie right you are in our medicinal fans whatever that is hey if you think that too leave me a youtube comment it helps this channel grow aside from the transparency issue this is one of the cheapest the strongest hemp extracts with a bunch of different cannabinoids it's pretty good see you next time don't forget to uh subscribe and check out cbdxamen.com to check out

of marijuana and CBD oil my daughter and I have gotten into disagreements over the issue I've always known marijuana to be a bad illegal immoral thing yet with the illegal legalization of it in more and more States it's harder and harder to argue against it I know little about its non high version CBD but because I related to marijuana I think it's bad is it a compromise as a Christian to accept CBD as alternative medicine I must confess I'm not an expert on any of it because I've never used marijuana and these people are clean mine I smoked it but I didn't inhale that's baloney marijuana really does bad things to you it has strong effect on your lungs and other parts of your body I know it's being legalized and people say well smoking pot is good for you I think and what I understand if they purify this CBD oil it doesn't really have any marijuana effects in it and it could be good for things and I know marijuana is being used to treat certain extreme cases of cancer etc so I can't give you the medical diagnosis of it but I do think if it's pure that CBD oil doesn't have any marijuana in it so it's it's it's beneficial I think all right thank you for watching make sure you

Antonio and now we're gonna be talking with Erika della Rossa one of the other owners here at the de cafe and we're actually learning more about the health and wellness benefits of hemp so tell me about I mean your story is amazing and using these hemp-based products you've actually recovered from from acne right yes absolutely adult acne it's something that I see young ladies in their 30s 40s suffer from and I'm not sure if it's childbearing years because I know that's when mine flared up or if it's a stressful lifestyle work stress family stress whatever it might be but I noticed that my breakouts works me they were consistent I had to use concealer that had covered tattoos so when I showed that photo to most people they're like I don't remember your face looking like that and I said well I used concealer that was strength to cover tattoos when working with these hemp-based products within two weeks I saw a difference I I was almost on my way to dermatologist for accutane which is horrible for your system so I'm so glad that I found an alternative and a way to do this in a natural and effective way and you become such an advocate for these products look at how you have the cafe right with your husband and but we actually had your picture out there that was a before picture and now look I mean your skin's just cleared up so much from it and it's just it's using and you can see it again there guys it's back up that was before and that's it's just amazing the transformation that you've done with these hemp-based products that you have here and it's it's all natural right absolutely you can pronounce the items that are in the formulation hemp seed oil peppermint lavender beeswax I love that that's important to me as a mom as a business owner I'm gonna provide quality for my family and for my customers and that was the most important thing that it's not something that I would utilize then that doesn't show up in this store and those ingredients sound like something I can either eat or drink which I'm comfortable with if I'm gonna be putting it on my face right you don't want anything too crazy and you actually have some products right here right next to you as well that are also a hemp base tell me a little about these yes these are our products and they come out of San Francisco California there are hemp organics this is a lipstick that I utilize it's certified USDA organic and it's moisturizing chapped lips are something that I think a lot of us suffer from because of the cold and the hot and intense heat but this is something that's moisturizing

your back when it comes to all things food from cooking battles to gadget review and as the worker and cookbook challenges to a midweek meal Pat's app crack your eggs we uncover the tools that will help us all cook and eat smarter join a community where everything we do starts with you hello I'm Jamie this is Mike welcome to fridge today we taste essence CBB food and drink products to see you know it's a trend worth taking seriously and do they actually taste really good so many of you have requested that we try some CBD food products so we've got our chefs Ben and James here we've got our normals Jamie and Baz to give a conflicting perhaps different side of the argument and we're going to see whether we think CBD and food have a place in synergy together in the world [Music] ok see what we're talking about today whoa smile so first off very very important that we make it clear that we are not researchers nor are we in the medical profession what we do like to do is eat first off what is CBD marijuana CBD is a compound found in the canvas plant it can be using several different ways including vaping teachers capsules and edibles it's what we're talking about today unlike its close relative THC which I'm not going to tell you the full name CBD is completely non psychoactive this allows us to benefit from the many health properties of the cannabis plant without the negative side effects of getting high this is one of the highest rated CBD oils that you can get in the UK it's made in the UK or the UK but before we begin anything pop three drops under your tongue hold it for 30 to 60 seconds and swallow Grassi very earthy mm-hmm it's got actually got a slight burn to it floral it's like the grass poppy it's got like a a spicy back note to a hoppy flavor it's not terrible it's just very safe very savoury this is how this is marketed it may reduce anxiety and depression improve sleep reduce seizures in people with epilepsy soothe pain and information and improve heart health board claims a lot of players have tried this before with the idea thing it's you've got quite useful for anxiety and so on but actually I couldn't get in the habit of using it regularly enjoy I actually asked one of my friends who I know uses it to give us a quick summary of why he uses it and he said I've been using CBD oil for the last six months to help me manage my anxiety and insomnia I often get anxious being in crowded places so I'll often have a few drops about half an hour before doing these activities it comes me down very quickly and slows my mind down I also use it if I wake up in the middle of the night and I can't switch my brain off I think it's good to use infrequently I try and only use it a couple of times a month that is interesting right to have such a cause-and-effect mmm is I I'm surprised that it's that direct John hasn't a guess in how much that bottle cost I'm going to throw thirty pounds okay I was gonna say like more like eight pounds 4495 oh well very clear when you tasted it earlier you didn't like the taste let's see if we can find a way to get the same benefits through something yummy dip the cloth [Music] these are CBB Zen bears CBD gummies with the guaranteed 5 milligrams of CBD per pair each pot contains 100 pairs giving you a total 500 milligrams of CBD it's all about natural delicious fruit flavors with no sugar or sweeteners so the highest searched CBD term on Google difficult to find recommended dosages online the guys who provided the oil recommended we go on body weight so for people your body weight you're looking to consume around 18 milligrams both a THC free you will not get high you will not suffer those side effects they do both contain CBD now I'm gonna try a little let the red one a yellow one mine tastes like a gummy bear it's a lemony it does not taste like CBD does not quite CBD yeah right now how not per mange really I really expected that to taste like fruit but that tastes a lot like the CBD oil sweet gummy fruity it certainly hasn't got any of that flavor that we were having from the oil it's a much less experience than having the CBD straight but it doesn't like their nostrils [Music] CBD gummies treat yourself to an extremely chilled out Valentine's Day eight gummies in each pack eight sweet kisses of calm each gummy heart contains two milligrams of CDD scent match to the fragrant Tahoe og cannabis strain that must mean something to someone somewhere they don't taste amazing but again like I probably would never attribute that term CBD their hearts are much sweeter mmm but still not I mean love hearts are the first to go - can any picker mix oh no no way totally with you then Oh Percy pig oh absolutely not no no Harry by Friday oh wow I didn't expect that oh I mean that looks more like is aimed at kids now edible cannabis weird it's giving off the whole subculture of being high and stoned and applying that to the branding of a product that does none of that hmm they are playing to that market and misleading I should imagine this is a good thing looks a bit more more a bit more medical how much do you think the gummy love hearts are eight gummy hearts they can't be more than copy a quid by the four pounds because you're bonkers yeah five or six quid love heart gummies are $8.99 for that packet hmm okay and the CBD Zen bears there are a hundred in that thirty-five forty quid I reckon there's fifty quest probably forty quid hmmm oh yeah tenner 39 pounds 95 pence is 500 milligrams of CBD it's exact same as the oil the good thing about them is that they're it's a lot easier to apply a dosage well I don't know how much oil I had but I thought I had a drop he watched me pour half a dropper down my throat amazing how much packaging changes your mind because if those who come in that then I'd be I'd be all over there maybe like this is no good but because of that plus the price you see my quite a good idea ready for another yeah Oh stressed you not with these little delights luxury chocolates with a whopping 5 milligrams of CBD each four chocolates in each box perfect for sharing 100% legal for a guiltless experience they cannot get you high only chill you out if you say after eight months as in though yeah it's in like an eighth of an ounce Oh see this is a ha ha ha yeah I like that I'm already pre-empting that the price is on par with luxury chocolates we'll see about the quality please copy our bad mm-hmm making a gooey middle oh I was expecting like a truffle it's not unpleasant if I had that ended up in Canada I wouldn't be offenders because it tastes like I drank heaven for chocolate you know the little chocolate footballs or chocolate coins you got a Christmas in netting it tastes like cardboard chocolate lime in yeah I'm disappointed by that there's no minutes not right it's the myth right Trey you pay chocolate with a cream in his hand again they've gone down the cannabis room it actually plays off that negative stigma doesn't it yeah and I like I don't find that cool personally if the benefits of CBD work for me I'll actually be personally embarrassed to get out of product like that yeah to pay off drug culture yeah dare I ask the price would you want to take a guess or 20 quid 20 quid oh yeah I'm in 16 full pound a 16-9 pounds ninety-nine oh wow you can still keep them we're getting a bit sillier now have a lift what oh my goodness okay what Christmas pudding this is a CBD Christmas the most festive way to get a hit of the glorious green to delicious only to sell at Christmas time handmade pudding infused with CBD and cannabis terpenes don't worry it's 100% legal and cannot get too high it might make you feel chills out low do you have any brandy I'm not providing anything I'm not even bothering you no because come on like who's eating this well apparently we are yeah [Music] but I do like a good Christmas pudding I'm not sure that's a good Christmas pudding no it's the kind of thing that someone would have got old little Johnny's a STONER why don't we get him listeners without heating up Oh garnish it with Holly flambe and 70 brandy butter it just tastes like fruit it's like guys that it's a pretty good as just as bad as any other fruitcake I think I've still six tip of the air the oil yeah I'm still sticking with the oil happy holidays yeah there are studies showing that CBD loses its potency once heated to above 200 degrees Fahrenheit this is not by any means a bad fruitcake I just I'm not sure I see the point I'm not sure this would be the vehicle in which if I wanted CBD I would take it it is an odd thing but its novelty again isn't it how much how much for the PUD ten pounds twelve Robin I want to say ten pounds fiver three pounds ninety-nine yes hmm I'm quite young surprised at how cheap they is well the recommended retail price is $9.99 it's because it's not Christmas boy slightly different this one right there so that whoa look at the color of that this is cannabis sativa Jim cannabis sativa is herbaceous flowering plant from Asia it's been cultivated throughout recorded history of the source of industrial fiber seed oil food recreation religious and spiritual moods and medicine each part of the plant is harvested differently depending on the purpose of its use this has been infused with cannabis sativa to have a taste see what you think not my favorite did but it tastes like gin alright it's not home okay crafted in Amsterdam for massive cannabis plant on the front of it so this is completely different in the there are no CBD benefits this is the other way round this is marketing purely cannabis as a selling point fine fine I mean it's a perfectly suitable botanical I wonder what they put in it that gives it that green tinge food coloring probably it's 40% it's a property it's a proper gin it tastes nice and it's a nice tasting too you know yeah I think yeah you have to work our ways that you can market yourself out there and by adding the botanicals of cannabis I think it does it so I can see how on the shelf in Amsterdam this would stand out would you put it on your alcohol shop I would yeah I'm good it's interesting that's a talking point that's it people would ask questions about it Oh does it and you go no yeah Oh could I get no you can't other than the whopping great big leaf and the association that cropped up recently there's nothing novel about hemp it's been around forever in rope-making and clothes making and paper making and all sorts there's nothing new about it it's just the craze now they're latching on to this doesn't offend me as long as doesn't cost a fortune how much do you think it costs for the bottom 25 hours bang in the middle 30 pounds $29.99 just what you pay for a nice bottle of gin so in summary CBD food the crossover what your thoughts CBD is not necessary and food and food is not necessary see we do see videos of supplement boom and you can choose to have as an oil or I think it's quite a good idea to put in something like gummies so you can regulate it a lot and it's more enjoyable I can definitely see it having a place I don't necessarily think that we're there yet like so many people feel they have to play off the legality of cannabis and it's naughty and you shouldn't be having it but it's okay because we put in a Christmas pudding for you I think the market needs more education about the benefits of CBD and then that can be celebrated and there's actually a CBD brownie recipe in our brand new cookbook to the beat yeah we fuse music and food we've got loads of playlist loads of recipes it looks amazing if you'd like to get a hold of it I'll click the link in the description can I do that can I do it please do accidentally broke my favorite bottle of whiskey last night it's alright I picked it with some scotch tape yep-yep-yep hominoid I even smiled yes to the beat is available bright now it's a load of great recipes styled themed and chaptered by genres of music from punk the country and classical to pop is bold it's a load of fun and comes with bespoke Spotify playlists for you to play whilst you cook so go and grab it now at sorted Club and now a blooper so what CBD products have you already heard of fish CBD fish how would get a fish no okay", "j79Hwu0XSkU": "hi guys welcome to another episode of ask dr. Patel where I answer your questions about medical marijuana and CBD oil now today's question comes in from Amica of Las Vegas Nevada and here's what she writes dr. Patel my eczema is out of control I've had it since I was probably 9 or 10 years old and I'm now 29 and still dealing with it my nights consist of insane scratching it's incredibly annoying I literally wake up with new scars and scabs nearly daily because of the flares when I stress it flares the most sweat triggers it too and it takes 30 minutes to get home from the gym so my eczema gets really bad in the winter time I don't have the luxury of taking hot showers I can't wear foundation and feel so embarrassed about the patches of dry flaky and inflamed skin I feel like people think I have some sort of contagious disease I've tried everything you can think of from lotions to creams even dangerous photo therapy and essential oils that are supposed to help egg them up but the eczema just keeps getting worse my dermatologist keeps prescribing steroids but they only work temporarily and I can't deal with the side effects would you recommend either CBD oil or marijuana do either of them work thanks in advance Anika Las Vegas Nevada all right Anika I imagine that having eczema must be an incredibly frustrating experience but I'm really glad that you wrote in because believe it or not there's actually research that shows that medical cannabis does help eczema now in addition to walking you through this now in addition to walking you through the medical research I'll also walk you through the results that my own patients have experienced so a human trial done back in so a human trial so a human trial done back in about the mid 2000s had patients between the ages of 2 and 70 with a top dermatitis which is otherwise known as which is otherwise known as eczema use an endocannabinoid cream over a period of six weeks now a human trial done back in the mid 2000s had it now a human trial done back in the mid 2000s had patients between the ages of 2 and 70 with with atopic dermatitis which is otherwise known as eczema use an endocannabinoid cream over a period of six weeks and here are the results that they reported so 70% saw an improvement in the following symptoms dryness excoriation which is skin picking essentially like henna fication which is which is when you develop thick leathery skin from from too much scratching and too much rubbing scaling which is flaking of the skin scaling which is flaking of the skin redness itching as well as an improvement in the quality of their sleep now thirty three point six percent of patients completely discontinued their use of topical steroids and in ten percent of patients the strength of the steroid was reduced significantly twenty percent of participants were able to stop their topical immunomodulators and 38 percent stopped using their oral antihistamines so what are some of the results that my patients have experienced well patient well patients with patches of eczema generally benefit from using cannabis topicals however patients with more extensive eczema really ultimately end up using some internal form of cannabis whether it's inhalation ingestion or using it sublingual II which is under the tongue now for some patients the cannabis completely clears up their skin and then for other patients it minimises redness flakiness itching and irritation however bear in mind that these changes don't occur overnight it may take up to two to four weeks to see the changes overall though my patients have experienced a reduction in the number of flares overall my patients have seen a reduction in the number of eczema flares that they experience now on the prescription front many patients are many of my patients now on the prescription front many of my patients are able to either eliminate or reduce the use of topical steroids topical immunomodulators and/or oral antihistamines so now on the prescription front now on the prescription front many of my now on the prescription front now on the prescription front many of my patients are able to either eliminate or reduce the use of the or reduce the use of their topical steroids topical immunomodulators in or oral antihistamines now before you go off and start you know stockpiling on cannabis topicals here's what i want to tell you you want to ensure that you don't end up reacting you don't you don't you want to ensure that you don't end up reacting to one of the other ingredients in a cannabis topical so test the product on a small area before you apply it all over and I'd also recommend that you watch out for ingredients that may exacerbate eczema and I also recommend that you watch out for ingredients that may exacerbate eczema such as parabens fragrances dyes lanolin formaldehyde etc all right so what's going alright so what's going on why is that that cannabis actually helps relieve the symptoms of eczema well it's possible that the endocannabinoid used in the in the medical study that I mentioned that it's possible that the endocannabinoid cream used in the study reduces the inflammatory response by way of the cannabinoid receptors in addition medical studies have also shown that when topical cannabinoids interact with cannabinoid receptors on the skin it significantly reduces histamine induced itch and vasodilation now just so you know histamine is a now just so you know histamine is a compound you know now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in reaction now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in reaction to go it in response to okay now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in response to an allergic or an inflammatory reaction and it ends up causing vaso to and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is vasodilation and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is known as vasodilation as I just mentioned which is enough and it ends up causing and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is known as a vasodilation alright

restorative botanicals to a lab to see if it's real this is one of Amazon's top-selling CBD products which is funny because Amazon specifically says that they don't sell CBD so is the CBD real or sorry is this hemp oil really CBD let's see the lab tests by the way I bought this one for 20 bucks and I've gotten no affiliation with this CBD company or any CBD company these are the results of an independent lab that I paid directly if the CBD company pays for the lab tests it's not independent shocking I know you might want to let the rest of the internet know about that okay 20 bucks they claimed 400 milligrams of unspecified remember Amazon doesn't sell CBD so they're not gonna list what this is so 400 milligrams and they had a cord indoor lab 433 milligrams of total can monoids or 8.5 percent more cannabinoids men claimed they're even more accurate if you base this on CBD because they had 411 ish milligrams of CBD and it's a high quality full-spectrum extract meaning all these other cannabinoids 13 milligrams of THC not enough to get high by any means but to provide some extra effects and some CBC and CBG I've got to say I was shocked by these results the whole package in a good way kind of confusing way I suppose best CBD on the platform that doesn't sell CBD you can see the labs are here as always the links below for this whole review look at this it's below 5 cents per milligram of CBD and it's also below 5 cents for all of the cannabinoids it's extremely cheap I bought this for 20 bucks on Amazon to get below 5 cents per milligram of CBD for 20 bucks is crazy the average is like 15 cents some go over 30 cents and you're often spending over a hundred dollars to get those price points the more you spend the better deal you usually get not in this case it's cheap let me first say that I don't like that this company or any company sells CBT on Amazon you hear that restorative botanicals you're this close from a timeout Amazon has a specific policy that does not allow for the sale of CBD and I feel this misleads people so they get around this by saying that their hemp oil and full-spectrum to suggest they have CBD they also make some medical claims which is not allowed for CBD companies to say but they don't say they're a CBD company which is a long debate that we don't have time for here here's the craziest part restorative botanicals is US hemp Authority certified it's considered the best cert you can get right now for showing that you're a legitimate company that produces high-quality CBD come on US hemp Authority this company hasn't even transparent about what's in their product how can you give this award to them I also did an extensive review on restorative botanicals and found no negative reports so that's my review and I just realized I'm a little biased because my whole website is about transparency it's all about accurate CV labeling and well this company would fail miserably in that aspect but I can't really knock them they're playing the game they've got an extremely accurate product if you take their hint that they are in fact CBD and the cost is ridiculously low thank you for spending a few minutes with me here today if you want to see more of these independent lab tests and reviews please do me a solvent and lightly tap that subscribe button in like button I'll see you soon", "3qY5KHkuH7w": "The use of CBD oil is becoming one of\nthe hottest trends in the health and wellness community, for good cause. It has\na growing number of scientific articles that have been published on its\npotential health benefits as well as a growing number of anecdotal reports from\nboth clients and doctors alike on its potential health benefits for pain, for\nmood, for sleep and today I'm with someone that has some experience with\nCBD oil. I'm Dr. Ryan Shelton and I'm really honored today to be with Angela\nDavis. Angela is a registered nurse and she is also a representative for a\ncompany that manufactures and sells CBD oil. So Angela thank you so much for your\ntime today.  I'm treasured to be with you, just a few quick questions for the audience, again I value your time and I value their time as well, do you\nhave any personal use with CBD oil. Yes for sure.\nI started maybe about a month ago started using it myself\nthere's multitude of different options you have out there for trying it but I\nhave been able to find some good relief with anxiety and to help with regulating\na sleep pattern for my life. I feel pretty good with what I've been using so\nfar there's a lot more interest in a lot of different types out there that I want\nto investigate using between THC and THC free type of products so yeah I'm really\ngood with it so far. And the forms that you use are they\noral drops are they topical creams? They are two different forms so far the\ncompany I found and I've invested time in and interested in is has two\ndifferent forms right now and one is it tincture that dissolves underneath\nyour tongue, okay and one is a topical cream. Okay now I\nknow from my own research that there are quite a few companies that market CBD\noil online in the marketplace so it's important to me to always choose a\ncompany that works with high integrity that works with products with\nguaranteeing potency guaranteeing purity. How did you come about to choose the\ncompany that you work with? Great question, I actually went to, I was\ninvited by friends to go, to just to talk about CBD and I kept hearing about it\nover and over again there from my parents or my patients each each morning\nwhen I was at work I kept hearing the patients were using it and the success\nthey had find with it my parents suffer from some chronic arthritic type issues\nand pain issues that I would really wanted to be more knowledgeable about\nwhat CBD is because people kept asking me my opinion on it so I said well I'll\njust go and listen to it just so I can learn what CBD is but the more time I\nspent with this talk I was very much intrigued by the company's grass roots\nmom-and-pop type style business that was literally selecting the exact seed that\nthey're using all the way to the seal that they closed it with it is an all\norganic company they manage every aspect of the growing process to the selling\nprocess and I found that really intriguing that they took out any\nmiddleman and you know it's U.S. grown, it's straight from North Carolina you\nknow where it's coming from and that was very intriguing to me\nbecause there is so many different products out there that you would have\nno idea where it's coming from or what you're getting right a big deal for me\nwith it too is that each of our products have a quality code that everyone can\nlook up and scan and see exactly what you're getting in your model or your\nyour topical cream so it's very important to me to know where it's\ncoming from what's in it in the purity of it so you use it yourself and you\nhave recommended it there's are there reports that you're\nhearing back from others maybe have not seen yourself but others may be\nreporting some benefits that you personally have not seen yeah for sure I\nmy family member one of my family members that's using it has had a\nsignificant decrease in the need for other medications to help her sleep she\npretty severe sleeping issues meeting multitude up to four different\nmedications to help her get a full night sleep never still actually getting into\nit or REM type sleep and feeling rested in the morning and she started with this\ncompany she thought about trying it before to this hesitant not sure what\nshe was getting into so she also actually join me at the meeting and\nlearned about it and purchased the products that night she also is very\ninterested or intrigued with this company and how they're doing things and\nshe is down to one to two of those medications and the CBD oil to help her\nsleep now so when these were all over-the-counter things you know we\nnever would suggest her to get off of a prescription medication unless she's\ntalking with their doctor about it but she was able to get herself down from\nthe over-the-counter stuff by using CBD and it's feeling much more arrested than\ngetting full REM sleep and getting back into dreaming\nmuch more well rested Wow that's fascinating yeah it's pretty amazing\nMike my father as well has also found some great help with sleeping he has\nsuffered over the years from some PTSD and things like that that had a really\nhard time with his sleep patterns he too is using a multitude of things to\nhelp him get some solid rest throughout the night he would always tell a story\nof how he would wake up at a particular set of time throughout every night for\nyears which is kind of an amazing story wake up at the same time each hour\ndirectly throughout the night but that's been going on for as long as I can\nremember the most recent time I checked in with him on how he was doing with the\nCBD oil he says I don't make up with those times anymore so it's it's been a\npretty significant relief for him as well.\nWow so positive benefits do you have any\nconcerns about its use the research I've done shows it to be safe with little\nreport of adverse effects is that what you're seeing reported that to you as\nwell yes I mean my just coming from the medical field and being a nurse I you\nknow I always been doing research on and I'm reading a lot about it\nthe more I read about CBD and the benefits it has for such a wide\nmultitude of problems the more I'm impressed with it but I worry that\nthere aren't enough clinical trials out there that there have the solid\nbackground research on what it's doing with actual human patients you know\nthere's plenty of research out there on this beautiful plant and what it\nactually could do for your body we know what it does and how it helps them\nattend get yourself back to homeostasis but the clinical trials just aren't\nthere and published and that's the piece that always worries me a little bit I\nwant some some proof in the pudding I want to see it on paper but no I have\nnot had any personal negative you know feedback from it so far I think\nsomething that people always are a little bit concerned about a question\nits functionality is you know why didn't it work instantly for me whereas some\npeople do feel that they have some pretty immediate relief from it\nespecially the topical creams with the menthol and things in it for aching\nmuscles and sure joints and things but everyone is completely different with\nCBD oil and how it's going to affect them and how long it's going to take\nit's kind of a based on how does it make you feel like do you need a little bit\nstronger milligram dose do you need to take it twice a day instead of once a\nday so in every one you know some people don't get into a full effect until a\nmonth of having used it consistently so I think that's probably a challenge for\nmost people is how do I figure out exactly how much I need and how long is\nit going to take until it fully affects what I need it to affect mmm in the\nbeginning of the video I described it as a hot and trending topic are you are you\nseeing more and more people be interested in CBD oil\nyes for sure it was when I first started kind of jumping in it researching more\nabout it I was it was this huge explosion of people asking about it over\na really short period of time like I had nurses talking to me about it I have\nfour or five patients that week talking to me about it one of the ones it really\nsticks out of my mind I was just amazed by I was reading over her medications\nthat she takes reviewing it with her and it was on there and I just asked her\nlike you know how are you doing like this evening I'm curious about it I've\nbeen hearing so much and she was a chronic pain patient she was a\nrecovering addict she had been the poster child for addiction she had\nchronic pain she started with pain pills needed to go to the stronger ones to the\nstronger ones and she done into stronger medications because a narcotics didn't\nwork any longer but she luckily now in is a survivor and she said works an\naddict Recovery Center with other addicts which is amazing but she said\nshe still had her pain even though she got through the addiction until she\nfound CBD oil and she says it to her it saved her life she said she even her\npain is significantly less and that she knows she will never have to relapse and\ngo back to some type of pain medication that she finally son found something\nnatural that could take care of her pain yeah that's me\nit is her all right Angela I thank you so much for your time today I value the\nfact that you spent some time and opened your schedule so that we could inform\ndamaged you can inform me about your experience with CBD oil so thank you so\nmuch available my name is Dr.

we're going to make an herbal salve Salve czar very useful preparations it can be used similar to the way many people use something like neosporin for example how a salve is used depends on what herbs are in it and what you're making it for such as wound healing moisturizing aches and pains bruises and insect repellent and so on making a salve is a very convenient way to preserve the medicinal qualities of the plant material in a form that can be easily applied for various conditions it's easy to use and it's not messy like carrying around an herbal oil in your bag for example today we're going to make our sev out of comfrey oil to learn how to make your comfort oil you can refer to an earlier herbal basics lesson or you can simply purchase 8 ounces of comfrey infused oil which is what we need for our lesson today that's 8 ounces why comfrey comfrey contains a LAN toing which encourages rapid cell regeneration for this reason your comfrey sad that we're going to make here it's going to help wounds heal quickly the oil is also very moisturizing and will even help heal bruises so let's make our staff as with all herbal remedies you can make them in a variety of ways with a variety of materials but most often these days a salve is made with an herbal infused vegetable based oil like this comfrey leaf in olive oil infused in olive oil like we made in a previous lesson combined with beeswax beeswax allows the oils that are liquid at room temperature to harden I happen to have these neat little one-ounce pieces that I have for the herbal medicine making kit on learning herbs calm but you can simply break off an ounce off a larger brick of wax or if you have wax shavings it doesn't matter as long as by weight you have it on slacks and that's the magic formula the magic formula is 1 ounce of wax by weight to 1 cup of oil by volume ok that's 8 ounces as a cup okay so 1 to 1 easy to so when you make yourself you know how much you're going to end up with so in this case we have a cup of oil along with a bit more liquid when the salve amount I'm going to India when the wax melts so we have to prepare our containers take that into account so I have some containers here also from the herbal kit I've got 4 1 ounce tins I've got a couple of 2 ounce containers these might be a little more than 2 ounces actually might be 4 ounces but but in any case whatever it is always make sure I have ample containers when I start even if I'm not sure I kind of overdo it just because there's you know you don't want to end up with hot salve material and not enough containers to fill it with so I always have make sure I have enough containers so I need to prep those before I start and we're also going to use some lavender essential oil ok it smells wonderful and it also has wonderful healing properties in itself so we'll see how that's used so let's get making our SAFF now first I get out my double boiler and I put a little water in the bottom of the double boiler and get it simmering and then I put the top right on there like that now you don't have to use a double boiler you can also use any old medium sized saucepan and but what if you do use a soft span just make sure that your heats on low because you don't want to risk scorching the wax or the oil so a saucepan is fine I just happen to have one of these I got this at a thrift store locally for like 5 bucks so if you find one of these awesome but you don't need this piece of equipment you can use a regular saucepan so don't let this from stop you from making your salve okay alright so and then we simply add our gotta beeswax to the pot there and it is going to melt and now this is salve cam a view from above you see the wax melting starting to melt and melting a little more so my 1 ounce by weight of wax has melted and I take my 1 cup by volume of herbal infused oil and I pour it on in weird what just happened is that I just poured some room temperature oil in hot wax and the oil solidified a little bit or the wax solidified rather so what's going to happen now is I'm just going to leave it on the stove longer until it once again completely melts and you can simply stir it a bit as it's going along to help it out alright our SAP mixture has completely liquefied behind this here see that and I am just going to pour it back into our Pyrex container our measuring cup because it has a nice spout on it so now you see our finished salve liquid here okay this is what we're going to pour into our containers right now we have to do it quickly because it's kind of hardened as you see it's starting to already on the edge here what you want to do for essential oil is put in about two drops per quarter ounce in this case that comes out to about a teaspoon actually about sixty four drops so I have that measured in there and I just want to mix that around that's my lavender essential oil here you can also add just a few drops an alternative is to as you're pouring these in your containers I have to start doing that so it doesn't harden on me an alternative is that you can simply put in a few drops or more depending on how much scent you like in your sap like this as you're doing it as you're pouring it you could do like one two two four but I already put it in so I'm just going to keep pouring so if you noticed I have my jars open ready to go so we have to be quick about it and if you ever do this and you notice a lot of your salve hardens I like to pour it out in small batches if you notice that that you can just swap it back in the in the your pan and remelt it so you're not you're not in dire straits if you don't okay and there's a wee bit more in here and I could easily pour that another small tin I don't want to get a huge jar full I'm only going to have a little bit in it but I'll Rimmel Tam innit and put it in another little container but like I said I always have extra encase because you know I guess I've done it enough for him like oh no where's another container I need another container so what we're going to do now while we watch this I guess these jars right here the jars are a little larger than I thought they were but that's why it's good to know your sizes huh so anyway we're going to hang out for a second as our poured salve hardens and now you see it continuing to harden here like on the bottom do the different color so that's hardening and there we have it see this once the large jar is still solidifying but the ones in the tins because they're smaller has finished so I can just put the lids on them and these containers by the way are available in the supply section of Mountain Rose herbs as well so and then you can also then put a pretty label on it like such as these this is from our herbal kit on learning herbs I'm not going to put them on it because it's not a right salve mixture but just gives you an idea that that you what you can do to decorate them really easy to make labels you can get any Avery labels these are the one I think the 1.67 in diameter labels and you can get a template they often have templates you can download let's say in word and you can drag and drop artwork and write pretty you know put pretty pictures in it and write what the SAB is and print them right out and stick them right on your nice tins if you've liked that sort of thing or you can just get a little blank label and write on it handwriting too and then we'll put the cap on this one and it'll harden up real soon so there you have it your finished herbal SAVs store your finish Savin your herbal cabinet for later use for longer storage you can also place it in your refrigerator staff making is endless and there are many reasons to make it and many herbs to try for oil making if you want to try making your comfort with fresh concrete you can check out our video on herb mentor com thanks so much and have fun making yourself Oh", "VUrc51axCAQ": "THEY THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE THEY

CBD soak combined with the CBD massage and I haven't seen this at any place else I'm really excited to try this treatment come along with me let's figure this out let's see if CBD really makes a difference [Music] my name is Daisy I am the owner and founder of Despard spa it is a very popular service so she will be getting today soaked we are using Cecil combined with CBD we are gonna add some bubbles I'm a central oils to make it a little more fun and relaxed and fluffy she would be in there for 30 minutes and then we're gonna follow her move her into another room and then she's gonna be getting a nice relaxing sport deep tissue massage we're gonna start using our massage oil which is the carrier CBD massage oil though such that we use for the CBD infused massage is 50 milligram per 1 ounce and for the soap is 100 milligrams per 1 ounce the CBD you can get all the fun medical benefits but you're not gonna get high you're not gonna get a positive on drug test for so you can just get all that fun stuff without being high some people some people experience a little tingling sensation everybody's different the benefits are the next day when she goes home you should go to sleep she's gonna wake up like a brand new woman I'm let into this room with this gigantic copper tub candles burning low light huge bubble bath and there's a smell in the air that's a little bit different than a normal bath smell it kind of has a herbal medicinal smell a little bit strong but still looks super inviting the smell is interesting because it smells like well it smells kind of like weed frankly like smell but it's definitely a strong smell the minute I put my toes in the water it was super warm and I immediately felt warm tingles in my legs and once I settled in I started feeling warm tingles all over my legs are fully floating and like tingly warm and tingly not mad at it okay guys just leave me here to soak I'll be here for the next thirty I'm at work right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] so after the soap go into the massage and that was a very welcomed experience after that warm bath she's using a CBD oil and the CBD oil right when it goes on it immediately you feel like a nice warm tingle and it's mainly afterwards that I still feel that warmth and that tingly feeling from the massage and she left the oil on and I still have the oil on so I still have that heavy warm deep feeling of relaxation I would say it did feel extra relaxed after this because of the CBD which was surprising I actually didn't know if I would feel anything at all I worked out yesterday I worked out pretty hard and I would say all that soreness is gone please let me know what I can be your guinea pig and try next because I'm down to try any beauty treatment so let me know using the hashtag ET style feed [Music] [Applause]", "8AvMjQUmKQ0": "[Music] good morning good morning everyone and happy fourth of July oh my goodness so as you guys know we are doing a very special

some really awesome information and as you guys I'm sure have already seen science of life alchemy CEO Jill Humphrey is actually going to be in the chat to answer any and all questions you have about

awesome person so please make her feel welcomed and of course if you have any questions at all about CBD just direct those to her in the chat and she'll be able to answer them for you oh man so let's get started we're talking about CBD and sex today now this is such a fun topic CBD is just such an amazing amazing thing and it most recently has become legal in Nevada as well as in many other states there's a lot of confusion about what CBD is versus what THC is so I thought it would be a good idea to start off with just the facts so what is CBD it's something that stands for kind of it all it's the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant the cycle active part of the plant is called THC which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol that is the part which makes you feel high CBD is completely non addictive it can't get you high it's not gonna mess you up you're still safe to drive it also will not cause you to fail a drug test they generally speaking or not worried about CBD being in your system again because it's non psychoactive many many states now have legalized THC as well as CBD so definitely check with your local area as far as your state specific laws here in Nevada of course we have fully legal everything isn't isn't that right luna luna is all excited today she can probably smell the fact that there's like the bacon-flavored pet tincture on the tape with her and she's like oh allah need some of that and as always I've got my phone here this morning to save space but I'm able to see the chats if anybody has any questions at all whatsoever for me if you leave them in the chat I'll be able to scroll back through afterwards and answer whatever it is you have asked oh my gosh so it's CBD obviously it's really cool it's not gonna mess you up it's just a really fun product that ends up being whole body beneficial so like what is what a CVD do cuz yeah it sure sounds great but like what does this stuff actually do well CBD can be used in a whole number of different reasons you figure first it's used to treat seizures this is actually how I first became familiarize with CBD one of my baby cousin actually has a seizure condition her family used to live in a small town in Texas and about five years ago they were one of the first medical refugees to move to Denver Colorado specifically for access to CBD so it's something that I've been aware of for a number of years in terms of just how beneficial it is and how life-changing it can be you figure my cousin was having like a hundred seizures a day she was literally and like one of those like straps you down like even her head had to be strapped to back kind of wheelchairs because she was just having so many seizures throughout the day and comparatively she's now like a bum grade level the kids a damn genius she's I mean she has maybe a seizure each year if that and the only thing she's taking for it right now is CBD but CPD is helpful even if you don't have a seizure condition it's been medically proven to treat a number of different issues including birkin Parkinson's Huntington's disease it can help with PTSD and it can also help with anxiety well as you guys know anxiety tends to be a pretty severe symptom for a lot of people it tends to be very impactful in life in a multitude of different ways one of the biggest ways in which anxiety tends to affect people is sexually sexual anxiety tends to lead to a whole host of issues everything from body confidence to erectile dysfunction issues which obviously are not so fun believe it or not anxiety oftentimes ends up being the root cause of a needy condition so as such using Lube with CBD might be an amazing way to go about treating a needy condition there's a whole variety of different products and things that they've put out now all sorts of really cool stuff and each one does something a little bit different depending on what your particular needs are of course if you have any particular medical can missions just chimed in the chat with whatever you have going on and Jill will be able to make very specific personalized suggestions for you there so the first thing I wanted to talk about is the all star of the day which is the passion CVD Louvre now this is such a cool product and I'm so excited that they reached out to me about it and introduced me into it so one of the reasons why CVD loop works so well is because guess what your sexual organs are made of mucous membranes CVD absorbs most effectively through a mucous membrane barrier it's going to be absorbed by the body that much quicker and take effect a heck of a lot faster you figure it takes approximately 15 to 25 minutes depending on your particular body 40 Hz lube to fully take effect so how you use this product I always suggest people to start off by maybe moving themselves and their partner up and then shifting the focus to foreplay you figure quality foreplay should laugh somewhere between 15 and 25 minutes anyway so you figure that's the time that you need for the Lube to start taking effect and for that CBD to start affecting and kicking into your body so what does it actually feel like when the loop is being used for me it feels really pleasurable I I noticed that it enhances my own natural wetness it kind of turns me on a little bit and it just puts me at ease it's like I'm just in a really good mood right now this is this is really nice like yeah I'm totally turned on of course everyone's gonna of their own individual reaction to it so your experience may vary but overall most people have reported back that it kicks in very very quickly and it ends up being very very effective so I've said this bottle off to a few people to get their opinions and and just kind of get an idea of how it affected them and their bodies I sent it off to a buddy of mine he's a little bit older with an e D condition he decided to go ahead and give it a try and report back with what the difference was from like one session to the next so Luke himself Bob waited 20 minutes went masturbated and he found that he was about 20% harder then without using this particular Lube when women try CBD loop with Dave reported back is that it actually increases their own natural wetness during sex it turns them on and as a result they end up producing more Lube naturally too so they don't end up needing as much of the product and then on subsequent experiences it ends up doing just the trick it's wonderful it's fun and at least a really good sex I mean who doesn't want really good sex let's see all sorts of stuff yes yes it is super super wonderful stuff I really do like it and there's so many different stuff that they offer you figure beyond the Lube they also have air let me bring this bottle a little closer camera come please and it's so cute this is an air moisture and CVD it's gonna focus in here there we go thinking about it it's considering focusing anyway this is thereafter Inc repair product which works wonders for healing tattoos and I personally have been using it because I'm getting my tattoo laser removal II well for protecting the skin after a laser treatment I've also used the after infer repair after going outside because let's be real unkind of pale and yeah I'm outside for five minutes and I have a sunburn it's a thing I've used a little bit of on my shoulders when they get burned and yeah it's really nice stuff I mean you can definitely feel the refreshingness of it it's very moisturizing it's a really fun thing to use and it just it makes you feel good additionally they put out a really cool cooling massage stick which can be great for after sunscreen I like that one as well it's kind of it's like a cool tingle sensation afterwards it has arnica in it which promotes more healing so again lots of high quality products lots of high quality ingredients in the high quality products and it tends to lend itself to a whole lot of fun and coffee break oh yeah you can totally like also put th CBD in your coffee so obviously the company's website is CBD sugar and so they actually do have CBD sugar packets to which you're just adorable I think it's the cutest thing little raw sugar things you just pour them in stir it up and it's happy coffee now it's feel good coffee and who doesn't like feel good coffee so there's so many different ways that you can really incorporate CBD into your sex life and I wanted to take the time to really make sure that everybody felt familiarized with what this stuff is and so they're not so intimidated by it many people have stigmas associated with CBD THC cannabis in general in many past generations it's been a very taboo thing it's been buried oh no that's a drug that's terrible but as we've learned more and more about the differences between THC and CBD we've come to realize that there is really no reason to stigmatize CBD in the first place it's it's essentially medicine in the form of a plant and it's something that was used for thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of years completely unregulated there was never any issues with that people have never died of overdoses from it it's not something that causes harm to the environment or to your body but unfortunately there's been all of these horrible things out there in the media that it's kind of painted it with a broad evil paintbrush of oh no all CBD is evil and let's be real it's it's not it's not evil it's actually pretty wonderful it a lot of your level of connectivity too for those that are a little bit more spiritually inclined or spiritually minded they've reported that CBD allows them to feel more connected to their partner during the active intimacy they're more aware of the small body movements and the nonverbal communication so they're really able to pick up on their partner's body language because it kind of sets your anxiety it is it makes it so that you can be 100% there in focused in that moment which let's be real that's like the greatest gift you can give to anybody during intercourse is to give them 100% of your undivided focus and attention I know for myself that it can be very easy to get distracted during sex like Oh need to make sure the music is going oh I need to make sure the condoms on uh need to make sure the best thought the other thing and it's like no I want to be able to like quiet my mind and be able to focus on the act itself and I found that CBD is a really cool way to do that it just grounds you down and connects you a little bit more readily to everyone oh and I've got to mention it because Luna is literally like traversing around my feet winding around here this company also has a CBD lube that's bacon flavored for pets we will be using this today for the fourth of July very very heavily all of my dogs will be getting a nice little dose of CBD to just bring the crazy manic energy down from the 17 to hopefully hopefully a - yeah last year Anubis he tried to go over the fence which is six foot tall and ya knew this is not a very big dog Anubis is like a little chihuahua mix he's like this big of a dog so he was not going over anything but yeah the fireworks really scared the crap out of him so you figure I'll be keeping a close eye on them dosing them up with a little bit of CBD and then my pet sitter is gonna be keeping an eye on them this evening so everybody is nice and cool and calm just the way we like it and yes CBD is effective in pets as well the reason that CBD and THC is able to work is that we actually have an endocannabinoid system in our bodies which essentially means we have the receptors to be able to respond back to the active chemical in CBD or THC the same is true for many pet species they to have this endocannabinoid system in their body again I am NOT an expert on this topic this is something that I teal I'm learning more about and familiarizing myself on so if I screw any part of this up my bad apologies but for my understanding it ends up being very effective and very helpful for pets as well as people because it's an everybody thing it works well for all of the people and as to the ranch for the 4th of July we are going to be having a pool party on the 7th because it kind of fell in the middle of the week it's Thursday which is kind of weird so we're doing it this weekend on Sunday the 7th if you're looking for a date to the party reach out to a lady it's gonna be a ton of fun it's gonna be nuts I'll be taking pictures and photos and all sorts of fun stuff so make sure to follow me on in gram you can find me there at the Alice little official on Instagram so talking a little bit more about the passion lube in particular it has 300 units of active ingredient so it's going to last you quite a long time personally I found all I really needed was one or two pumps to really get enough lubricant to get my own juices going and as such I found that one bottle will actually last you quite a quite a long time it's very reasonably priced I want to say on the website it's like $40 but you can use the code Alice 10 save yourself 10 percent of the product or anything else on their website to really they do all high quality products everything is made the correct away which is why I chose to reach it well which is the whole reason why I'm even doing this with them in the first place because let's be real if this wasn't actually decent I probably would have just like tossed it over my shoulder by now and gone on a 10-minute rant about it like yo how I am you know how this goes like it's definitely fun stuff yes so for those of you who were on Twitter and if you're not on Twitter follow me on Twitter - it's the Alice little you will have noticed that one of the things I was doing was giving away a pack of their CBD gummies now I love the fact that they have these because they're pre dosed by the individual piece this particular package has 10 individual gummies but a hundred and fifty milligrams of CBD so map 15 per individual gummy this makes it great for anybody that's concerned about overdosing not that you can really do that with this but if you're very concerned about exactly how much you have in your system gummies are a really cool way because they're specifically dosed by the piece which is really really nice a lot of people also like the flavor there's sour watermelon EES goodness and they're all sugary and who doesn't like gummies after this episode I will be going on Twitter somebody who has retweeted that post will be winning a package of

announced I'll announce the winner at a 11:30 to give everybody a little bit of extra time afterwards to be able to retweet that anyway let's go ahead and open this up to Q&A because I'm sure you guys have tons of questions about all this cool stuff I just had to show off this amazing menu that they said me because it is just so beautiful like check this out and inside it's got information about their products why you see et right you really have just a really nice professional set up all sorts of information about what they're doing how to use it how to get a hold of it yes let me scroll back through here excite so there was a few questions earlier yeah yeah cats and eating plastic it's a thing sadly Lunas definitely deterred when it comes to doing that she's um yeah kind of a kind of a troublemaker yes I totally love Rubik's cubes I've got one sitting on my desk in the office and then I also have the really cool Rubik's Cube coffee mug sadly it doesn't turn I totally tried to turn it when I first got it but like it's a really freaking awesome mug regardless let's see yeah yes so CBD amounts in each particular product there's 300 milligrams in the loom in the individual tinctures it depends on the bottle they offer different bottles and different strengths you figure this one has 2.5 K whereas the standard pet one has what is that 300 milligrams in it for the bacon-flavored pet CBD oil and then for the air pain relief which is the after inc relief this one also has 300 milligrams in it just like the Lube does but yes you can check out all that information on their website they've got it all listed there nice and easy and then of course if you have any specific questions we still have Jill joining us in the chat for a little bit longer here so you can ask any questions of her to scroll back down here why is the tattoo going away well it's actually a really great question I'm going to be recording a whole video about I am removing my tattoo I will probably actually be videoing me getting my next session of removal and pink tights the full story is coming because I have to say it's a really crazy story of how I ended up with this tattoo in the first place what the tag team is why I decided to get the tattoo and why I've decided to get rid of the tattoo I have to say laser tattoo removal yeah do not recommend it's a really freaking painful holy crap it's like they heat up like they superheater up your bed and then they flick it on your skin it's really painful but not as painful as getting the tattoo itself you'd figure it only took about 3 to 5 minutes of him passing it over with the laser granted it took me about like 5 minutes to calm myself down to let him do the passover with the laser it's kind of a pansy I don't like paying a whole lot or just kind of ironic when you think about it because I'm totally into BDSM and kink and I totally love impact play but like when it comes to really sharp pain oh not for me not a fan so much yes so new Alice little merch will be coming soon I of course just recently premiered a whole new logo which is super cute so for those who haven't seen it my new vocal is awesome you can go to my Twitter account I've already updated all of the images on there I'll be going through and doing a little bit of a refresher on my website as I introduce the new logo to the webpage change the

going on here yes my tattoo was the golden apple of discord again in the next video I'll be going into all the details of that it'll be a few more weeks until I go in for the next laser removal session so this video will probably come out probably five six weeks from now but hang tight I promise the full story is in fact coming so bunnyranch podcast a few people in chatting like when's it

have been a falling out with the bad fit fail I'm sorry fabfitfun was that their name oh yeah that that subscription box company yeah apparently they didn't realize I was a sex worker even though they emailed me and my bunnyranch email apparently they didn't realize I was a sex worker at least that's what they claimed they demanded I take the picture down after doing a whole elaborate photo shoot for them so I'm not a big fan of them anymore and as such I encourage people to support companies that genuinely support sex workers like these guys they're awesome alright guys I'll catch you all

see you all next time bye guys", "f13Z7avwH08": "hey guys it's michelle tangerine bliss today i wanted to make a video about CBD oil we have to take care of ourselves so they can take care of these little people you know here's the CBD oil that i've been taking my lazarus naturals and it's a high potency it says to take a whole milliliter which contains 50 milligrams of CBD oil however i only take about three drops and the most I've ever taken is about seven drops I'm not a physician and I'm not a scientist this is just my personal experience and what I have personally found online about CBD oil I found that for anxiety pain and general health two point five milligrams up to twenty milligrams is often recommended so if I take three drops of that oil that's just four point eight milligrams there's a very small amount and yet it was actually really effective I was so pleased to find out that it was actually just enough for me to not be constantly anxious irritated oh my gosh I don't feel good inside my kitchen because there are dishes everywhere - okay there's that was left out of course you have a little bit of mess they were just taller Bulgin taking CBD oil was like little drops of grace so I started taking CBD oil while I was pregnant I actually went to a health care provider with midwives and there were actually multiple midwives at this practice and I took the opportunity to meet various ones of them during my pregnancy during my last pregnancy and I asked each of them when I would then I would say you know what do you think about CBD oil I would also ask what kind of medication is recommended for postpartum anxiety you know is that different than for postpartum depression and all of these things are so important to think about while you're pregnant and you might not have an experience of pee Mads during your pregnancy but you might and you might not have that experience postpartum but you might and so thinking through these things before you get to that point where you're like I can't take this anymore and you don't know what to do thinking through it beforehand is so important I highly recommend that during my pregnancy I was feeling just the anxiety kind of like building up for me it's not been typically like a depression thing but it's like stress it's like not normal and you know yourself and you know if this is not typical I'm a really optimistic person but when I start feeling like I might have a panic attack because I'm worried about XYZ I know that's not normal that is hormones and that is the effect of pregnancy that is the effect of postpartum sleep deprivation and it needs to be addressed for my own well-being self-care is so important and if you're looking at this video and you're thinking okay I'm not feeling great you know maybe you're in the middle of your pregnancy and you're like I just want to kill my husband or I'm just getting angry all the time this is not like me or I can't take my other kid to the park because I am so stressed out those are kinds of things that you may be on the fence as far as do I need medication or is there something natural that I can take this this little thing even just a little bit I can notice the difference there was another website that said therapeutic reactions are in full swing within 20 to 30 minutes and the effects tend to last anywhere between four to six hours that was extremely true for me if I take three drops of CBD oil and this is zero percent THC it's not from a marijuana plant it's from hemp plant and it's very well reviewed I found it on a website that reviews lots of them this one is actually one of the least expensive that was on this like top ten website oh I'll go ahead and link to it below if I take it just out three drops I can tell the difference in like twenty to thirty minutes so what it means though if if it's between four to six hours and that's true for me to like I can tell that it's wearing off after about four hours I start kind of feeling the way that I was again and that doesn't mean that while you're awake you're probably going to take it about every four to six hours being pregnant I was waking up during the night and I was feeling not good you know intrusive thoughts sometimes especially like an early postpartum that sleep deprivation is huge on me it's a it has a big effect on you and different people respond to sleep deprivation in different ways but that is a very big concern so if I woke up in the middle of the night then I'll just take three drops again then and you're probably curious how you take it so I'll just do that right now you just shake the bottle gently a little bit and then since you're if you're only taking like a few drops you don't need to have much in the thing but you just get really close and put it under your tongue you drop this under your tongue and then you don't want to drink your water or eat your food like right after I loop I usually just let it sort of sit there in my mouth for about two minutes before I drink more water staying hydrated is also key but taking care of yourself is so important so I mean my experience and like I said this is just anecdotal you need to talk to your own care provider to make a decision but my choice was hey this is legal where I live if you have concerns about that there are videos and websites that talk about your state and what you're allowed to buy and use this took the edge off for me to the point where I did not feel anymore like hey I might need to take a drug that's prescribed to me and that's a much more involved process as far as breastfeeding and taking CBD oil I equate it to caffeine consumption and breastfeeding if you're consuming a cup of coffee each day you don't need to be concerned about that making a baby wired there are some people who firmly believe that their babies are super sensitive to caffeine as well as other things and that's person to person you're going to get different experiences obviously you're going to want to do your due diligence and make sure that you get an oil that is pure and that is you know refined correctly it's like well reviewed everything and I think that if you're gonna try something this is worth looking at I'm very importantly I'm healthy mentally and I'm taking the time for self-care in doing what I need to do to make sure I'm well rested my anxiety levels are kept at bay and I'm taking care of myself leaving myself nutritious foods because otherwise I can't take care of my kids the way I need to and that gives the thing for you to I just

"AinA_wKFQe4": "hello CBD fans it's Brad from hemp remedies wwm pyramides calm also have remedies on Facebook you can look for me personally on Instagram I don't have a business channel yet however I have my own a moist person videos on there most importantly guys if you are watching this video please take a second to like and subscribe to the channel I'm constantly doing product video product demo videos and when I do when I launch a video you'll get an email notification that way you'll have first dibs at the products when they come in today I am so excited I finally got in my company's DVD saw this is hemp remedies reliefs of what makes this sub different than the majority of the other sobs on the market is the other sobs made by the big manufacturers have about fifty milligrams sometimes 100 milligrams of CBD in a two ounce jar now those are excellent products I sold many of them so I always say in my videos I was one of the first in the industry I've been in the business since 2013 prior to that I had a medical marijuana company so I've been around for a long time I have also been the sole CBD provider to numerous patient groups so I've have a lot of interaction with people and how the products work the sobs that were on the market prior to this fifty maybe a hundred milligrams of CBD many great products they were all made with the same starting oil all of these manufacturers used the same starting oil to make their products that was imported in from the Netherlands it's quality oil guys non-gmo organic pesticide free organically grown I've seen I used to sell it by the kilo I've seen labs on every single batch while the stalk and stem oil is great oil what you're not getting is the terpenoid profiles minor cannabinoid profiles as well that you find in the flower of the plant and that's because importation rules would not allow them to use the flower so everything was made with the stalk in stem oil which again same CBD and the stalkin stem is the same CVD that's in the flower you just didn't get that big minor turpenoid or minor cannabinoid and turpenoid profiles that you would find in flower oil so you don't get the entourage effect in Turkey an interplay this is my new Saab I am starting it out at five I have it at 500 and 1000 milligrams of CBD in a two ounce jar way stronger way more much more CBD in these products than you would find in the other manufacturers and it's true whole plant so that means that the stalk and stem what I was still used which is excellent Oriole it has all of the fats and healthy oils that you find in the plant that's very good for you but it's also got oil from the flower as well so you get the terpene or clay you get all the terpenes in there the minor cannabinoids much more relief much higher quality product so I'm very excited about this and to bring those guys to you it's going to be on the website now I am waiting for labels to be finalized and shipped to me until then I will be shipping it out without labels with a CoA stating what's in the product right from the lab yeah very excited about those guys I also have a texture that's in a 2 ounce bottle that's whole plant it's got no glycerin Zoar any type of additives to it it's in a coconut oil base the flavorings natural orange made from distilled oranges and I also have them lavender from distilled lavender plants so everything is all-natural the textures go 500 milligrams all the way up to 5000 and I have a vioient made the same way it's in a coconut oil base so there's no polyethylene glycol and a vegetable glycerin all natural flavors from either distilled oranges or lavender so I'm excited about that that should be on the website in the next couple of days and of course I made the world's first legal CBD CBD dad back in 2014 called early I have that out right now at 800 milligrams per gram or 1 ml serving whole plant pesticide free organically grew and just like all the other products and I have the new wax crumble got a sample of that right here this is just mind-blowing stuff it's a true wax crumble from whole plant oil CBD on this and batch was 94% 940 milligrams of CBD and a gram so with that being said I want to thank you guys for your time make sure you like the page the YouTube channel subscribe to it I would be ultra grateful if you shared any of these videos on your Facebook page Facebook is not allowing me to run sponsor two ads again so that's super appreciated and keep your eyes peeled for my next video", "F82-_2jBY4M": "[Music] right now there's some turbulent times for the cannabis industry the cbd market is really really big the eyes of the world are upon us and we've got a lot of responsibility to make sure it's done correctly some rise some fall but at the end of the day we're going to get to a place where this industry is respected for the complexity and the regulation that it's voluntarily taken on and how it performs at a high level and that's the exciting part of being part of this and being able to shape [Music] sometimes i that asleep when josh is cutting my hair bro my girlfriend loves the sage that you got her oh the sound the lotion yeah so really cleared it up and she's used numerous products but nothing worked like the emotions so she told me to tell you uh thank you awesome man it's always nice whenever you actually hear the stories you know because that dude i know at first whenever i started making products i kind of was like well does it really even do anything you know like does this is this a placebo or does it work i just was lost with using so many creams and just being at a dead end when i seen that on his shelf i started using it and i got immediate results like within a few seconds i just saw a big difference just from looking in the mirror within a split second it just changed everything it's a great feeling you know to be able to create access for people that for one reason or another have the need to consume cannabis products hemp products and if it provides them some type of life-changing experience and it's really awesome for us and thankfully more and more people are sharing those personal stories and that's what's moving the ball on this issue people being educated on the issue and feeling empowered to share those stories because they don't have to be shamed for it anymore not everybody understands what it can do for you and i just want everybody to have the opportunity that i had and try it seven billion people have endocannabinoid systems we have something that's been a social movement that is now becoming an industry and there are definitely growing pains there are definitely people in companies who take the approach that's very extractive and they just want whatever profits they can and that's it and then there are folks who say all cannabis should be free it's medicine that's the ethos of it and then there are a lot of people somewhere in between trying to find their way we fight for our freedom right and i feel like growing this plant is a god-given right you know as long as you don't abuse it it's really important that companies take the time to do it right make sure that you're testing your product make sure that they're clean making sure that products have what you say they have i mean if you're saying as a company as a manufacturer that this has you know 50 milligrams of cbd in it you better make sure that that product has 50 milligrams of cbd in it and that is bioavailable that the body can actually absorb that 50 milligrams it's important that we as an industry push out good high quality products for people the laws are continuing to crack the door open and crack the door open more and more and more so that products that come from cannabis are and are continuing to be mainstream eventually they can't stop it no matter where we come from around the world we have all lived under prohibition we are all still living with stigma we have all had the same experiences with this plan those experiences have taught us certain lessons and those lessons have informed a common value system and now there are hundreds of millions of us all around the world collectively we are larger than most nations and one day we will learn how to recognize each other we will learn how to reason with each other and once we've done that we will start moving as one and we will change the face of this planet when we do that [Music] what's up bro hey what's up dan let me uh i'm on my way to the lab to see we're going to talk about everything bro the good the bad and the ugly my friend okay all right okay bye it's crazy i mean we just i just got an email a big national pharmacy chain wants to carry our products and who would have thought a retailer of that size would be carrying cannabis products you know what i mean made by two brothers that are growers and a chemist all foreigners all immigrants [Music]", "8gBX5sbaa3Q": "woohoo first 45 mile week in a long time that's what i'm talking about i even got a peek day in and seriously it would not be possible without this [Music] hey y'all welcome back to biz live i'm vivian camille and today we are talking about hemp daddy's transdermal cbd cream this stuff right here is no joke i am not kidding when i say this has been the difference between me going out for a run and me not going for a run um with how effective it has been for me cbd was not something on my radar i really was not comfortable ingesting it so when caleb who is the owner and founder of this company reached out to me i said you know i'll give the cream a try and see how that is and i'm really thankful i did because like i said this has been the difference between me going for a run and me not being able to finish my run due to my knee and hip injuries and so this pretty much just like alleviates the pain and allows me to push through those runs i think it's a combination of this cream and just my body healing itself but i know that this makes a big difference caleb sent this to me for free in return i make a review video um however i didn't feel comfortable making a full review video based off of one cbd experience so i've tried two or three others to get a better idea of how topical cbd works and to better review this one and compare it to kind of the others i tried one that had like magnesium in it and like a cooling cream in it and it was good it worked well but it just it like ran down my knees there was like dripping wetness that would run down my knees as i ran and i didn't like that that was really uncomfortable another one i tried was a little cream that went on and it didn't work at all i didn't see any difference when i went running and the third one i tried was also a cream of sorts the first one that magnesium one was a roll-on kind of one but the third cream i tried it worked all right but it was like a lotion and again it like it stayed on top of my skin so when i started sweating when i ran it began to sweat off it didn't drip as bad as the roll-on magnesium one but it was like a lotion and if you've ever run with lotion on in the sun in the summer in tucson that's like the worst feeling on the planet i didn't know there was such a wide spectrum of cbd this one is the best i've found or i guess i could say this is the best one that found me um i met caleb at band at the bandera 100k and he kind of introduced me to his cbd company i figured out that it's all organic and it is tested by a third party to make sure that everything is consistent and the batches are all the same if you don't know a whole lot about cbd and are considering whether or not it could be a good thing for you he has a youtube channel i think it's called hemp daddy's i'll link that down below you can check out and he's got some really good informational videos that kind of explain it explain what it does explain the process and what have you so this hemp daddy transdermal cream the reason that it rises above all the others is number one because it actually works the first and foremost thing that i love about this is that it actually absorbs into my skin the importance of that is number one i don't feel like i have a second layer of skin on me my knee which has the cbd on it right now and my shin which doesn't they feel almost identical it's not like a gross layer there's no fragrance to this there's no dye in this there's no added anything it's just the cream and it absorbs really well the second reason why that's important is because it actually works some of the other creams i tried didn't really work at all this i put on about five to ten minutes before i go out on a run and within that time this stuff is jiving i mean i start like i am able to run and i think it lasts i'd say probably two hours on some of my long runs i've brought it with me and reapplied um but it works really well it works quickly and it absorbs into the skin there is 10 milligrams of cbd per pump this is the extra strength it's called extra strength for a reason it works i'll show you what you get in one pump you get that much sumo so i usually do one pump for both of my knees and then i kind of spread it out to the back of my legs um and then i do one pump for my hip to make sure that i am covered and that i don't have any problems um a lot of people use this for recovery after their run and they've said that it's helped them with their recovery but um i kind of use it as liquid gold and so i just use it on my run so that i can make sure i get through that run another reason why this is such a good product is that there are two ingredients in it lipoderm and hemp extract and hemp extract is number one there's about 60 servings in here i've been very disappointed with the other cbd i tried so if you know a product works then you stick with it so i am very very excited to share this product with you if you want a discount i will link a code down below and you're welcome to use that do your own research always um this is my review this is my experience with the cbd i would tell anyone who's comfortable using it to use this one because it actually works and it's third party sourced and it's organic and it's from colorado hand-picked family farm and those are all reasons why i would support this product and i'm endorsing it now but like i said do your own research try out different cbd figure out the one that works best for you but if you're interested in this one you can check that out with a link down below thank y'all so much for watching really appreciate it thank you for supporting my channel please like this video and subscribe if you're interested in more fun videos they're not all review videos but when i find something i like i enjoy sharing it so yeah you'll have a wonderful rest of the week i'll see you next week and happy trails yeah my knees feel unstoppable oh yeah i also came up with a jingle it's more of a wrap jingle goes like this hip daddies cbd and in the midst of that you can do a little bit of this him daddy's cbd hip daddy's cbd because your knees feel so good yeah um", "8mKrbjop7Jk":

have seen my review on hemp daddy's cbd oil and at the end of that review i promised that there would be much more reviews of hemp daddy products starting with the hemp daddy's transdermal cream transdermal cbd cream and obviously weeks have gone by i have not delivered on that promise so it's time to get into that today this will be kind of a quick and dirty review of just the essentials you need to know so if you didn't see my original review of the hemp daddy cbd oil i would check that out first just because i give a lot more information about the company in general and what really sets them apart as a product but for today we're just gonna focus on purely the benefits of this cbd transdermal cream if you're not familiar with cbd creams one of the first things i noticed about this is that it is a transdermal cream i didn't actually know what that meant and i realized a lot of the products that i've used in the past are actually topical creams so of course i looked it up to figure out what's the difference between topical and transdermal and basically what transdermal means is if you're rubbing it on your skin the cream is absorbing through the skin into the muscles into the body underneath the skin so you're feeling the impacts the effects of cbd not just on the specific area of skin that you apply the lotion but also beneath as well as it absorbs through the skin the topical creams on the other side are just going to absorb into the skin so you're only going to feel the effects of the cbd in the skin or on the skin as opposed to really absorbing into the body so just some vocab for you there and what i mean when i'm talking about trans durable cbd cream another thing that i mentioned in my last hemp daddy's product review is how i am certainly wary when i hear of all of the kind of cure-all claims that you get from a lot of different cbd companies so i do always appreciate that hemp daddy's is very upfront about the benefits you can expect to experience with their products and they also have a ton of research and different things published on their blog so you can get some more expert information on what you're getting yourself into so i just want to kind of give that as a caveat before jumping into this i'm not by any means trying to say that this is the cure-all for any illness any pain or anything like that what i will say is this is an excellent resource if you kind of have like a nagging i don't even necessarily want to say injury but kind of a nagging stiffness or soreness in a muscle or joint that's where i think this comes in handy because what the benefit that i have found from this is let's say after a particularly tough sprint workout and i personally experience like a um a con not constant but just a i often get a tightness or stiffness in my left calf specifically in my left calf i get it all the time especially like i said after particularly tough workouts so where i would use this is sometimes even before the workouts just to ease the strain on that leg but then after as well just to ease the inflammation it's not necessarily just masking the feeling of the inflammation so it's not encouraging you to train through pain but it just helps reduce it to allow you to continue to train and reduces that inflammation so hopefully you are not necessarily as much at risk for injury again these are just the the benefits that i personally experienced but that's where i think this really comes in handy as with kind of how i use all cbd products it just helps with overall maintenance as runners dealing with the inflammation the stiffness the soreness the joint pain the muscle aches etc that just come with the territory a lot of cbd products are just gonna kind of help to uh dampen the effects of that soreness or how you're feeling and kind of lower that inflammation just enough to allow you to train through it or to make it a little bit more comfortable i guess is a better way to put it make you a little bit more comfortable with that inflammation or make the inflammation a little bit more comfortable to train with i hope that makes sense i feel like that was a lot of words basically just to say that this is helpful as a tool but in no means should be used to just cure injuries but definitely definitely definitely can be helpful just to ease stiffness this especially was useful during the goggins challenge towards those later miles especially when i was really starting to feel stiff i would just put these this on before runs again just to kind of reduce that inflammation a bit to make it a little bit more comfortable for each consecutive run without the soreness building up to an unbearable amount that's sort of just a little bit about my take on the product i'll show you very quickly how it works it's very easy one thing i do appreciate is it gives you just kind of the recommended dose in the squeeze almost just like a little dime size or maybe nickel size bit of lotion there rubs into the skin nice and simple it's not greasy by any means uh it actually has a very nice scent to it it's unscented so it's just the natural scent of the cbd which i really like but just that little dollop is enough to pretty much cover the whole top of my forearm to get an idea of how much you need for any impacted area and it rubs in pretty quickly like i said you don't have a lot of the greasy excess just want to wipe it between my hands etc but very easy to use and a little goes a long way for larger muscle groups like when i was having stiffness in my thighs i would probably use like two to three squirts just to get a good amount of lotion around my whole leg again during more significant stress or more significant soreness that i was experiencing on especially those much larger muscle groups as i mentioned this is just a quick and dirty review i hope it gave you some beneficial information as i mentioned really what this is good for is just with all cbd products just the maintenance of your running routine and just helping to reduce the the negative impacts of the stress that we're putting on our body through this sport so the only thing that you can do is really check it out for yourself so if you are interested in checking out hemp daddy's transdermal cbd cream or any of their products go to their website hempdaddies.com i run on beer to let them know i sent you there and use the code i run on beer to save 15 on any order i mentioned at the top of the show i do work specifically with hemp daddy so if you order any of the products from their website using my code i earn a little bit of a commission off that it doesn't cost you any more it just helps me keep my website my youtube channel etc up and running and lets me celebrate an incredible product so thanks for tuning in i hope you enjoyed the review i would love to hear from you in the comments about benefits that you've had from cbd i think there is a lot more research to be done because i think there is a lot of benefits that maybe we haven't discovered or more ways to use cbd that maybe we're not tapping into yet so i'm always interested to hear about the experience others are having this has been my personal experience with hemp daddies i'm trying out the full range of their products so stay tuned for future reviews the next one coming up that i'm super excited about is the vaporized cbd that i've been using so stay tuned for that hopefully sooner than it took me to get out the review of the transdermal cream but really loving hemp daddy's products and loving adding cbd into my recovery routine so thanks for tuning in to another product review i hope you enjoyed it and let me know what you want to see from me in the future but until then i'll see you around cheers uh", "Eig_EUF0Q-k": "a new CBD store has opened in a unique location the Westroads mall now questions still remain about the products legality but those selling it say they are breaking any laws new tonight reporter John Madden checked into the legal concerns and spoke with those running the shop well it's not the typical place you'd expect to find a CBD store but the Westroads mall now has one and with the opening of this new location questions still remain about the legality of this product would you like to try a sample of some see we do today if your retail shopping doing fine a little sample on your hands you can pick something else up along with your new shoes or clothes so we figured just with the amount of people that are coming through here is a massive opportunity to really educate everybody on what CVD can do the Westroads mall now has this CBD kiosk good afternoon iein Cunningham sells products he says will help with a wide range of health issues people that are experiencing joint aches and pains sometimes you know a hard time sleep will CBD comes from hemp which doesn't make you high though closely related to marijuana it doesn't contain high amounts of THC CBD gives you all the medicinal benefits without the same euphoric high that you would typically get from a product that is high in THC it's a legal gray area Nebraska's Attorney General Doug Peterson maintains that CBD has been and continues to be illegal under Nebraska law American shaman this is Garrett butt Cunningham and CBD store owner Garrett carbonelle say they aren't breaking the law no one's getting high it's not hurting anybody and it truly is helping a lot of people Nebraska law shows hemp products should not have a THC concentration of more than 3/10 percent and the products sold at both of these stores don't exceed that we had anything in here that was above it I would I would expect them to come in here and shut us down well it may not be much of a war ii for Cunningham he hopes these kinds of stores will thrive going forward definitely the right time for something like this because again people are looking for a good alternative in Omaha I'm John Madden 3 news now carbondale says he's had members of law enforcement in his store and never questioned him about his products which they market as health and wellness aides we reached out to Peterson's office along with the Douglas County Attorney office for comment neither of them responded", "6jxGSKLRpZo": "[Music] hey guys Cathy here and today we're gonna be making a hemp well so hemp oil being let's see not a huge portion of the self it's about 10% of my oils but it's a very dark oil and has some really great benefits for your skin I'm not fragrancing this one so I'm leaving it natural you might get some of the nuttiness off the hemp oil has a very distinct odor to it but it's not it's more gonna be an unscented soap and for colorants I'm going to do part of this in a French green clay I have mixed in with some of my soaking oils and for the uncolored portion I'm using not titanium dioxide but I'm using the sweet rice flour which I've used before in soaps and if you do some reading on it you'll see that the the geishas used to they may still use the sweet rice flour in their skincare regimen it's great for lightening the skin lightening any blemishes so that's what I'm doing today so we're gonna get things going here I'm gonna pour most of my white or should I say natural color in I'm gonna swirl with the French green clay leaving white on the top and then I'm putting on some hemp seeds after I texture the top I'm just gonna run a little bit of hemp seeds down the side so that is my plan I'm just straightening out my little swirly to earlier get my goggles on and we'll get to blending this adding my lye in it's always nice once in a while just to have a nice unscented soap like this something that's good for your skin but you know you don't have the perfumey fragrance oils or essential oils in there just just a nice soap to clean with [Music] you can see the color already it's just a lovely creamy color [Music] [Applause] I'm going to pour some of this off to make my green with not a lot just a bit like so just enough to swirl in the batter so we'll pour there the green in there get my spatula that's gonna be stirred in my hands and then the portion with our rice flour as well this one I'm going to blend a bit with the hand mixer just to make sure I get that rice flour incorporated really well [Applause] you can see it's not changing the color it's a white car it's just adding the rice so that that is good clean this off is it just a very basic simple soap nice and fluid so far look at the green in here from the French screen clay it's about a heaping teaspoon full I put in here and blended with my soapy oils so bring this bring this over occasional hemp seed fall in here I'm just picking those out here I've got these wonderful hemp seeds if you can see there we go beautiful beautiful the little something-something to top this with okay so I'm going to pour pretty much all of this in I'll save that much to put on the top just in case there's some green that shows up on top and here we go with the green and clean that out we'll get this swirled and I'm gonna stamp it with one of the victor stamps another one that he sent me and I'll link you in the box below to his shop on Etsy but I figured since I'm doing green kind of in this soap we're gonna make it for March first st. Patrick's Day and I'm gonna use this stamp to stamp it with after it's a little four-leaf clover so anyway that'll be cute so just giving it a swirl like so cleaning off my tool that's best I can there okay and then we'll spoon in the rest of this white onto the top pour it in I guess it's still pretty fluid hopefully we can cover pretty much all of this green cuz I like to have just the white on the top speak the rest of this in here trying to do this at an angle where I'm not blocking your view so I think we're pretty good here see if I can scrape this bit just so just trying to get every little bit I can out of here okay now I'm just gonna kind of cover the top I'm going to texture this I think so that green might show back up on the top anyway bang this down onto the floor here still have my glasses on cuz you're doing every you want to bang yourself down you wanna make sure you protect your eyes okay so there's that nice clean spoon at this point I'm gonna take my glasses off because I'm done with this with the blending it's such a etc I'm just gonna tidy my area here and I've got my hemp seeds and these these are edible these are food grade but you don't want to eat your soap naturally so we'll bring you in a little bit closer and hopefully won't take too long for this to set now just give it a little a little texture on the top and see if let's see if it holds or if my soap is still too soft as you'll know if it starts to disappear down into itself after a minute or two just trying to get some interest here it's so delicate and I just I can't help I love to play with the soap anyway I think that's alright that's gonna hold so now I'm gonna take my gloves back off and we'll sprinkle some of our hemp seeds on top I'll just bring you in just a hair and I'm just going to aren't they lovely they're so natural looking and just the perfect addition to the top of our hemp soap like I said I just want to go down one side and then we'll be back it'll be tomorrow for me and we'll use chopper to cut this beautiful soap and and then we'll do some stamping with our little clover stamp I know Victor does have a hemp stamp too I believe anyway I think I saw that on his site but I wanted to do something like I said in honor of st. Patrick's Day when I see my booboo but that's what we've got and we'll be back in just a moment to do the cut okay we're back and ready to use chopper to cut our hemp soap and I'm just going to cut the end slices off just to get to the color under hopefully and take that first slice off so there's our little end slice you can see the pretty little swirl I really like that don't worry I will we'll zoom out and get a good shot here when I'm done cutting and we're ready to stamp I'm just gonna adjust this actually let me get the other side and slice I'm cutting with the hemp seeds slide down so they don't drag through the soap when I cut it I love how chopper works look at that beautiful swirl with the French green clay it's just gorgeous okay so let me finish I'm going to measure my loaf and and then I'll see how many even slices I can get about 8 and a half inches so I think if I do for sure one inch and then I'll have a little bar left for myself so let me set this for an inch right about there tighten that down and we'll start cutting you get these beautiful bars oops see I almost cut wrong side I'm gonna have my hemp seeds facing down so there's a beautiful beautiful bar look at the pretty swirls and I have I haven't decided whether I want to bevel these or not I know I want to stamp them though with Viktor stamp so pretty we have a beautiful sunny day here but very cold a nice so it'll be nice to go shopping today it's Saturday and we'll have nice sunshine and it will just have to bundle up we had tons of heavy wind last night so pretty I just love this can't mine there we go love the swirls love love-love-love such a nice natural bar with no fragrance and here's our last cut very pretty so I'm going to put you on pause and I'll get a range to do some stamping and we'll be right back alright so we're all set up and ready to do our stamping and give you a better view of the lovely swirls that are going on in this soap period of natural I love the natural colorant the rice flour and the French screenplays wonderful so okay I've got my four leaf clover stamp here from Victor and it's soap stamps for you and I'm going to spray that again with a little bit of alcohol and we're gonna place our little stamp right in the center of each bar like so beautiful you can't see it like a lot because of the color of the soap but it's just gorgeous and we'll zoom in for a close-up here in a second but you can see cute little four-leaf clover and it's just adorable give it another spritz and finish these last few bars and like so let me Bob them up a little paper towel here just to get that shine off a bit so you can see the stamp it's so pretty and we'll put these right back by each other they kind of you kind of got a little bit of a butterfly effect going so anyway I'll take this out and you can look see so there's our little four-leaf clover I like that one almost looks like a bat or an O or somebody standing there with wings spread out that's kind of cool another one here and here's some good swirling going on in this so again this is the the a four-leaf clover stamp from soap stamps for you on Etsy I'll link you in the box below to his Etsy store stamps were provided to me at no charge Victor song gonna highlight a different one every now and then in my videos but for now this was our hemp oil soap and we put in sweet rice flour and the green is from French green clay no fragrance just pure natural with the little hemp parts on the top really pretty and thank you for watching I appreciate you tuning in and we'll catch you on the next video and we'll say bye for now", "j3AtaxZRIJE": "[Music] so this is part one of making an anti-inflammatory full-spectrum hemp oil SAP this is the base the salve base which is olive oil which you can use straight organic olive oil or like I did I steeped for a few weeks this jar full of comfrey with olive oil poured over it and then I drained it out poured it in here there's a half a cup of coconut oil there are three tablespoons of shea butter and about four tablespoon or eight blocks of rock cow butter so you put all that together and then you're going to put it in a double boiler and heat it up part two if you don't have a double boiler you can do this which is what I do a larger pan with water in it and a smaller pan with your oil base in the top of it and you just keep stirring until all the solid particles liquefy so here's the dish and the consistency is soft but I like it I brought it out of the freezer and it's been sitting at room temperature for few minutes so it's okay so I poured the dissolved from the top of the double boiler into a measuring cup where I've already put my essential oils and the DIY hemp oil which this stuff is awesome and I did add a little copaiba oil now it's all in here and ready to get put in little containers and that will", "eg87YJiw9aw": "hey everybody I'm April this is Elise style the channel where I teach you all about Young Living Essential Oils and today we're going to be talking about a product that Young Living has not come out with yet it is called CBD oil hey guys welcome to the channel normally I start with like a box and I'm pulling product out I'm telling you how I use it and how much I love it and or you know whatever but actually today we're gonna be talking about a product that Young Living does not have yet we will be seeing it in 2019 from them so um we're gonna be talking about CBD oil but before we talk about that let's talk about some things that I think need to be addressed let's talk about hemp versus marijuana let's talk about CBD versus THC let's talk a little bit about the history and uses and things like that okay so if you're ready to nerd out with me this is the channel for you alright so a CBD oil what is CBD oil CBD oil is oil derived from him okay Young Living CBD oil will be organic hemp that then we derived the the CBD from so let's talk about let's talk about cannabis and hemp in marijuana because those are words that we hear and a lot of people I think think they're exactly the same thing so cannabis is like the umbrella term okay it's like the overarching family of the plants and then you have him and you have marijuana and they are not the same plant okay they look similar and everything they're in the same plant family but they're not the same plant so you've got cannabis and you've got him and you've got marijuana now the main constituent of him is going to be C B that's canna been like stink at pronouncing things I apologize canna Biddy all can a vide all and I may be saying that I go quickly because I usually do canna Biddy all is CVD oil and then over here we have marijuana okay same cannabis family different plant marijuana has the main constituent is THC I will try to pronounce this for you it is tetra hydro canna bin all tetrahydrocannabinol THC is in marijuana in him we have CBD okay CBD is legal in all 50 US states marijuana is legal in 30 US states okay different they're different things so recently the fda approved CBD like as a drug called at the dole x Epidaurus for treatment of to specific epileptic orders and so what does that say that says that that people are taking notice that CBD can help with specific things so these specific synthesized drugs that were created are to help these seizure disorders now I'm going okay wait where did they get the idea to use CBD for that well that's because CBD has been used like around the world for a long time to help people with different things it's got antidepressant properties anti-anxiety properties and there are protective properties alright so um it's used oftentimes in the management and treatment of like chronic pain PTSD anxiety issues depression type 1 and 2 diabetes seizures brain trauma and even for help with the side effects of chemotherapy okay so how does CBD oil even help like how does it work so let's let speak out together for a minute and toxin chemistry and biology okay CBD actually binds to the specific receptors in our brain it's like the information pathways of our brain it's like our brain talking to our brain okay and then our brain talking to our body these are these information pathways and so the CVD oil actually binds to those and helps with the communication there so what are some things the neural protective effects brain neural brain protection there's actually been studies done where CVD helped hinder the development of Alzheimer's symptoms which Alzheimer's is literally the breaking down of the brain it's the degradation of our brain so CVD has actually been shown to stop the degradation the breaking down of the brain in Alzheimer's patients imagine what it can do on a proactive level for healthy people who have healthy brains imagine that that's amazing to me all right also there's analgesic effects like pain killing effects from CBD so it's proven itself useful especially for chronic pain sufferers because it inhibits the neural transmission that would cause what's called analgesic tolerance so if you guys have ever heard of people getting addicted to painkillers and they need a higher and higher and higher and higher and higher dose in order to feel the same effects they used to fuel down here that's because their brains are going okay I need a that little bit isn't doing it anymore it's called analgesic tolerance they build up a tolerance to it a higher tolerance and then they use mourn and they build a higher tolerance and that's how people get super addicted to painkillers but CBD has not been shown to have any analgesic tolerance meaning it can be really good for chronic pain sufferers because their bodies won't require more and more and more over time there's not those addictive properties that you would find with with actual like street drugs right or even pharmaceutical drugs that we have the market today so um CVD can can really be beneficial for chronic pain sufferers also CVD has been shown to have an antitumoral effect and that's a big deal guys um studies have shown that high doses of CVD has no toxic effect on humans but that with patients with related tumor conditions um that it can be extremely amazing for its antitumoral properties cancer patients this is like I mean breast cancer lung cancer any tumor or cancer this is this is a gate this can be a game-changer for you right on a more like maintenance basis CBD oil has proven very effective on anxiety and depression so it has been shown to reduce anxiety and patients there was a study done with CBD oil and placebo oil and the CBD it given to patients and I want to make sure I'm gonna read this so I make sure that I get it totally correct I don't I love to give you guys like the best information but like accurate information from the studying that I have done a 2011 study the test was administered to 24 patients with social anxiety disorders so an hour and a half before the test the patients were even either given CBD or they were given a placebo and it was found that the anxiety the cognitive impairment and the discomfort of the patients with the CBD was significantly reduced compared to the placebo group so the patients who actually ingested the CBD found that their anxiety that their cognitive ability and that their discomfort all improved right they were more comfortable like more cognitively able to function their cognitive function was higher and their anxiety was lower the so for for a study of this like this obviously more study needs to be done 24 patients is not a large amount sample size but it does lead us to believe that there definitely could be some really positive effects there now many people will claim of their own that yes this is what CVD does for me so this is just a small test that was administered to see if that potentially could be the case and they are seeing really positive test effects in that way so CBD also affects our serotonin system your serotonin system is actually what helps regulate your metabolism right your cortisol levels of cortisol is out stress hormone that causes weight gain right so it helps regulate your metabolism your reactions to stress so that's the serotonin system also your social behavior this is what we're talking about those anti-anxiety effects right those antidepressant effects your mood your cognition your appetite like these are all very positive things to be regulated and to help your body regulate because CBD actually targets the serotonin receptor that a one receptor it it can help with all of those things so a lot of people have said to me April why is Young Living getting in the CBD game right like what is going on there well as of December 20th 2019 CBD oil is now given the a-ok the agricultural Improvement Act was signed December 20th of 2019 so hemp was actually removed from the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 which means it's no longer an illegal substance under federal law now it's going to be over overseen by the FDA the Food and Drug Administration so you may be going wait a minute why was it illegal in the first place I'm glad you asked my history buffs take a tour with me let's go way way back so researchers believe that hemp might have actually been one of the earliest plants cultivated by man traces of him found it like a specific Japanese archaeological site that's over like 8,000 years old all right it is believed that humans started like actual agriculture ten thousand years ago so this could have been one of the first right plants that man cultivated hello very cool but more than that hip traditionally over the centuries over the millennia have been used up has been used for things like rope guess what guys Christopher Columbus on his ship his ropes were made of hemp because hemp made it all the way through it's very prolific in the northern hemisphere it was very prolific in the northern hemisphere growing wildly so it was use rope clothing paper guys the Gutenberg Bibles printed on him early draft of the American Declaration of Independence printed or written on him the final draft was on parchment but the early drafts were written on him also it is believed that the first u.s. flag was hand sewn with him and you Betsy so obviously it has like a very long history and in the Americas in the USA it has a really long history him was grown throughout the USA like commercially right as a cash crop and and actually King George required the colonists to grow it and then taxed him on it in order to support the crown but at least seven different US presidents grew hemp as a cash crop now him also grew wild here in the US in Jamestown hemp was growing wild and there's reports that like Native Americans were already cultivating hemp here in the United States when colonists arrived um also it's been used over the years medicinally as farm feed in textiles right all those things that I already mentioned for so long livestock cows chickens pay were grazing on him wild growing him and it was part therefore of the standard us diet right because all the animals were eating it and then our we're getting it in our eggs and in our chicken and all that and so the benefits are all affecting our body so April get back to the elite illegal ization what's going on there 1937 the marihuana Tax Act happened which taxed anybody who was growing any kind of cannabis hemp or marijuana why conspiracy theorists take note that the passing of the Act - is believed that it was literally just to destroy the hemp industry there's speculation that Andrew Mellon Randolph Hearst which you guys might be familiar with he was a newspaper printer and the DuPont family and if you're going wait I know the name DuPont plastics and nylon that they were all behind this marijuana Tax Act in order to destroy the hemp industry so that trees could continue to be used for paper thank you newspapers and the newspaper manufacturers that had huge stock in forests and the forestry industry and also the plastics and nylon industry which was very up-and-coming in the 1930s so conspiracy theorists go to town on that one I don't know the truth of that but it follow the money right ok so we go from hemp growing wild hemp being used by our presidents seven different presidents growing him him being used commercially right like all of this - there's a huge tax on it well then according to reports not only that the tax was was actually really opposed by doctors and pharmacists who then obviously they're being taxed on it they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa CBD hemp is really helpful for our patients it's not it could add rug and it's not addicting why are we doing this right and so they really opposed it it's still passed well then in 1970 that marihuana taxation Act was actually just adopted into the Controlled Substances Act so him marijuana were we're always kind of lumped together and they just got put right in the controlled substance act and guess what it made him on par with heroin and ecstasy as far as being a schedule 1 controlled substance so you in the u.s. we we couldn't touch it we couldn't do anything right well it was the ban was lifted for final product so you could import final products of hemp like clothing and things of that nature but you couldn't be the producer because that was a schedule 1 controlled substance so I mean I asked my husband if this would lend me any credibility in this situation at which one he said no but I thought it timely to mention that April's always been a pretty big supporter of him because this is my actual purse and wallet that I used as a teenager god I feel old right now this is 20 years old um I bought this when I was 14 I remember where I was and who I was with I was in ninth grade and I bought this hemp purse made in Nepal and a hemp wallet and I carried this literally it held up so well I carry this from ninth grade through sophomore year of college like until I got married I carried this for literally like what is that like five six years like six years I carried this in a hell so nicely quite honestly really really well-made product look at that it gets got this little hemp rope connector right here that this is all woven him on the the actual back it's lined with cotton but um this baby has held up it's a little crossbody satchel do you know what it was the perfect size for holding when I turn it when I was 17 I became a Christian and I got a Bible this is the perfect size from my Bible no joke and I felt like so so super blessed I was like obviously this is meant to be this Bibles from the Lord because it fits perfectly in my hip bag I have made two international moves and literally have almost nothing for my teenage years quite honestly like very few things no clothing at all which really do I want clothing from the 90s but I did keep this I have kept this for years and years and years lending a little credence to my hemp history here but ok so you couldn't grow hemp and you could not sell Hampton you could not do anything with him in the United States um fast forward 50 years 2019 the president signs V what is it Colin I make sure I use the right term agricultural Improvement Act it is no longer illegal to grow and sell and produce hemp products yay so people have said why is why is wild getting into this game we have been waiting for this to happen as an international company as a right as a company that provides product to all 50 states we wanted to make sure that everybody in the US could have access to this now um people have also said mmm April why are what's going on here is like you I want you guys to know that for me personally I have done research on CVD for years and I never pulled the trigger and here is why you guys know this sourcing is so big for me trusting that what I'm paying for is what I'm getting is such a big deal to me and that's why I chose to join Young Living when I got into essential oils because there were so many essential oil companies on the market I was buying my essential oils from Whole Foods and when I found out how unregulated that industry was I was like wait a minute so you're saying when I buy my oils from Whole Foods that say pure it only has to be like 5% essential oil and the rest can all be chemical synthetics and it still says pure yeah that blew my mind like how could producers do that well because it's a really unregulated industry and CBD oil is very similar there's so many companies springing up producing and in having CBD oil but I have no assurance of the sourcing I don't know if it was really truly drone organically if that workers were paid a fair wage if there's pesticides like you don't really know right young living with our seed to seal promise always consistently over and over again they put everything they're named behind the behind the production of their products from planting the seed all the way until sealing that bottle Young Living says look we're gonna do everything we can to make sure to bring the highest quality product to the market so Young Living is going ok here we go this is how we do this this is how we bring our people the best quality oil is that we make sure that we're taking care of the production the seed of steel standards way above and beyond the standards of any other essential oil company this very unregulated industry CVD very unregulated industry young livings way we can provide a really high quality product the highest quality product for our people organic hemp non THC organic hemp derived CBD oil infused with essential oils why why would they do that two reasons one you get the benefit of the essential oil and we've talked so many times that's why you're on this channel of essential oils and the benefits for your body in different ways okay but then too here's something I found so interesting and Young Living hasn't come out and said this but in my own research this is what I found and I think that it is really awesome CBD oil there's been studies done the beet oral bioavailability bioavailability is how your body can use the product okay the oral bioavailability of CD oil is somewhere between like 13 and 19% the inhalation bioavailability is somewhere between 11 and 45% with like the mean that you know the average being 31% so if oral ingestion the oral bioavailability of CBD is 13 to 19 percent and we know there have been studies done that essential oils increase the bioavailability of products so all of our supplements are infused with essential oils because you get the property of the essential oil that beneficial property but also it increases the bioavailability of whatever that supplement is so Young Living is going hey cv DOL is an amazing product our oils are amazing put those together and it's exponential the essential oils actually help the CBD oil to be more available to your body which means you use less with a greater efficiency hey yo thank you Young Living so I am super duper excited like I said I never pulled the trigger on CBD oil and the main reason was I didn't know who to trust there was never anybody where I went oh yeah okay you you're transparent about your practices your trans paranoid about how you farm I know where you're growing this I know who the supplier is you know what I mean nobody does that in essential oils or CBD Young Living is the only one that's doing that you know blooming doing one that's going look we're gonna control the whole supply process in order to make sure that there's no fudging anywhere because when you you guys know when you it's like a game of telephone right somebody starts it somebody produces it and then they pass it on and there's a ability for it to be corrupted in that and then the next person doesn't know that it's been corrupted and they think they're getting the original pure product and then the corruption potentially could continue and so other essential oil companies other CBD oil companies can say oh that supplier over there we didn't know that they were doing whatever practice that is undesirable we're just not gonna work with them anymore we're gonna work over here with these people now the only they will never do that to us because they put their name behind everything they own the farms or we have partner farms that work exclusively with us and adhere to our seed to seal standards which I set told you are above and beyond the industry standards like so far above me beyond so now that there's finally a source that I can trust for CBD oil I am super duper excited and you should be too Organic have CVD oil infused with essential oils this is going to be the utmost highest-quality CBD oil on the market and I am so excited so here's the deal if you've not yet joined Young Living if you're like mmm now's the time here's why this is

our first hit of cbd hookah here we go cheers everyone cheers hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis on today's vlog we are excited to be trying something new for the first time and that is cbd hookah we have partnered with floor cbd a company based out of miami florida that offers a wide variety of different cbd products including this very first time we've ever seen cbd she shot i think that's really cool we're not big time hookah smokers but we definitely have a hookah that is the stunning glass and anytime we've got an opportunity to use that we definitely jump on it what i love about cbd is that it's the most popular cannabinoid besides thc so if most people have heard about cannabis passively they tend to have heard cbd and it's also the component that's going to keep you relaxed it's going to relieve anxiety stimulate your appetite do a lot of the pros and fun things of cannabis without making you feel the negative effects of a higher thc hit what's also great about this shisha is that it is nicotine free and tobacco-free which means that you can kind of enjoy the entire whole process and ritual of smoking hookah without getting too stony and you also don't have to worry about like smoking nicotine or smoking tobacco which are concerns that i would have going to a hookah lounge and smoking regular hookah that's why i think we're most excited about trying the cbd hookah because it is a healthier alternative for tobacco users so let's talk about the two different shishas that we have yes they actually come in eight different flavors total which i think is awesome that's a lot to choose from what we have on the table is pink lemonade and blueberry mint and because it's us we're not just going to be smoking this out of a regular hookah device we are going to be using our beloved stood in glass gravity bong yes it actually comes with its own bowl for hookah here so yeah we're going to be packing our hookah really great smell to it it definitely has that like strawberry lemon tartness to it coal already ready and yeah how easy is it to load this up put the coal on already ready i mean again very similar to your normal kind of hookah you know contraptions but we can flip this one so let's go and get this kind of primed up oh it looks like the puck is burning the shisha is making its smoke so guys i think we're ready for our first hit of cbd hookah here we go cheers everyone cheers oh it's really nice and easy that all it takes is a flip to get a smoke going and i love the smell of this pink lemonade so much really light actually yeah pretty enjoyable it's not i don't know i thought it was going to be very overpowering but it's not a lot of the times when i would smoke hookah i would get headaches from the nicotine i would always think that like oh you know it's hookah it's not going to get me high so i can just like you know rip keep ripping this oh man it surprises you how smooth it is it is so nice to taste both the the kind of lemon tartness and the sweeter strawberry side of the shisha damn that kind of body relaxation without the kind of cerebral paranoia that comes with higher thc and it looks like you can just go rip after rip on this thing on the cbd hookah it makes it very easy yeah i feel like i i will never go back to smoking traditional hookah this is the way to go 100 because yeah the things that i love about hookah the ritual the social aspect even just the fact that you could just like smoke on something very chill and passively like that's what i want and that's what i'm getting out of hookah 100 cbd hookah all the way for life if you want to pick up your own cbd shisha we highly recommend going to flora cbd pick up your own and also explore the other cbd products that they have there flora cbd also offers topicals gummies oils and also that cbd dip for all of the tobacco users out there that really just want to like switch up for 2021

quarantine and chill thing is not working out with for everyone when it comes to the diet and exercise not being able to hit the gym so today I wanted to talk about CBD and weight management while many of the search for balance in our relationships in our work-life balance currently our stay at home work from home life balance our immune system and most importantly maintaining a healthy weight our bodies on the other hand are constantly in a quest for reaching homeostasis which internally maintains stability while adjusting to conditions that are optimal for survival such as sugar levels blood levels and also to regulate body temperature a perfect example would be running outdoors for exercise since most of us do not have access to a gym right now running outside is a great alternative your heart rate increases during running our muscles start working harder and need more oxygen your cardiovascular system is in charge of delivering blood and nutrients to your working muscles your body then responds by increasing the amount of blood your heart is pumping and that moves up blood from the inactive organs hormones are then released to signal your heart rate to increase so you can deliver more oxygenated blood to where it's needed throughout the run so as your blood vessels dilate your blood pressure will increase stay closed for your body temperature as your body converts food into enter doing this run it produces heat as waste product the heat then elevates to body temperature so to maintain homeostasis the blood vessels dilate to allow more blood flow to the surface to disperse the heat which leads to sweating and then the evaporation of the sweat cools down your body to maintain a steady temperature this is only one small part of homeostasis your endocannabinoid system works in such complex ways to maintain this homeostasis recent science has found that the endocannabinoid system does not respond to the endocannabinoids found in the body naturally but they do respond to external cannabinoids such as CBD so when introducing CBD to your endocannabinoid system it promotes homeostasis which and then turn reduces pain anxiety and controls appetite so how does it make me lose weight well scientifically it activates CBD receptors which then lower intestinal inflammation lowers anxiety so no emotional or stress-related eating we are all in search of maintaining that healthy weight it makes us feel better it makes us look better and most importantly it's very vital to our health now some people have the misconception that cannabis equals munchies and since DVD is harvested from the same shrub we automatically relate the two Stevie Dee on the other hand can be an appetite suppressant it has a great impact on metabolism in the human body by increasing the amount of activity the mitochondria has on ourselves which then lead to burning more calories as well as generation of fat cells by decreasing the proteins along with great diet and of great fitness routine adding CVD to I can give you that extra push in maintaining a healthy weight so during the quarantine right now I actually gained about seven pounds so about a week into it I started taking my Stevie Dee routine again and I incorporated Stevie Dee twice a day with running still not so much of the healthy eating but you know I have my candy here and there and within a week I dropped those seven pounds just by incorporating DVD twice a day to my daily routine the beauty of Stevie Dee is that there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to dosing for some people around five milligrams of CBD per day can be beneficial for others they need about 50 milligrams it's all really a trial and error remember to always start small and then increase accordingly but always be patient it can take anywhere from a couple days to a month to see the effects of Stevie Dee on your body weight loss pills can be very harmful for your body they can increase your heart rate you know heart problems but by adding CBD to your diet it's very beneficial and it's completely natural causing no harm to your body whatsoever anyways guys I hope that gave you a little insight on our endocannabinoids system and how CBD helps bring the body back to balance homeostasis and then maybe help you lose a little bit of weight or maintain that healthy weight that you always try to

guys and welcome to another ready review I'm Matt and this week we're gonna be reviewing hemp daddy's therapeutic hemp extract hemp daddies hip extract is a full-spectrum CBD oil which essentially means that it helps alleviate inflammation depression anxiety and helps with sleep so this is gonna be a little bit of a different review especially since this is CBD oil it's more of a supplement than it is actual gear so it's kind of different to gauge and I will give you my experience as best I can put it before working with hemp daddy truth be told I did not know a ton about CBD oil and its effects how it can help as a supplement but we had a chance to sit down with caleb simpson founder of hemp daddies he does go into full detail on the benefits of CBD oil and specifically how he himself came across it in his podcast episode of the reddy 80 podcast I highly recommend it we will link it up in the description below I had the chance to use this for about two weeks I was a little skeptical because this kind of stuff is something that I'm obviously haven't really used before especially CBD oil but I have to say has really helped with at least sleep that is the most immediate thing I've recognized I do feel a little less anxiety obviously we're up in Vermont so we're doing this big promotion there's been a ton of work as fun it has been and it is great it has been to kind of see the different mountains and just enjoy my time back in Vermont having the CBD oil to try out and get acclimated with and help alleviate some of my stress has been really really nice I would say that with this type of thing you might want to consult a doctor if you're thinking about getting CBD oil as a supplement keep in mind that it may affect different people different ways I don't think that I felt a very very distinct change but I just noticed certain patterns in my sleeping and just my stress level that I really do think this can be attributed to I did use the hemp extract twice daily for about two weeks I will say that it's kind of strange just drinking oil or ingesting oil but the mint flavor really does help to make it a little bit more enjoyable and it does taste like real mint it doesn't taste artificial or anything so it wasn't bad at all to take tailee in some cases I looked forward to it because it just makes your breath a little fresher if you get the mint flavor if you're someone who struggled with sleep or anxiety I would definitely recommend checking out hemp daddies I think it's really done a lot to help me out in the past two weeks and it could potentially help you out they do have a ton of information about CBD if you want to educate yourself and just get a little bit more acclimated to how it works I would definitely recommend that as well especially just jumping into anything new that you know might alter your brain chemistry or something like that obviously you're gonna want to read up on it they do have other CBD infused products they have capsules as well as a topical cream in addition to the hemp extract the topical cream is more for obviously like inflammation joint pain that kind of thing and the capsules are basically just the oil hemp extract just in capsule form that's it for my review of hemp daddy's therapeutics extract mint flavor don't forget to Like and subscribe to our Channel and check out the description

canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop save 10% on vaporizers raw rowing papers and accessories and much more with the code canna basics a truffle studios.com let's get started here's what you're gonna need you need some 99% isopropyl alcohol we're putting is about 1215 milliliters you also need some fresh cannabis flowers we're using about 50 grams of fresh harvested flowers you need some fresh to ruffle hours commonly called hells bells about to medium flowers [Music] you also need some rue de also known as common room it's an aromatic herbal plant you need about 15 grams of that and you're also going to need some camphor tablets you need six quarter ounce squares or one and a half blocks camphor tablets are available at pharmacies and also online if you'd like to learn where to get these ingredients and to see the full written recipe please check out our blog site for free on the link in description or here on the screen it'll also be helpful if you have a mortar and pestle and also have large mason jar with a lid now the first step is going to be to manicure and to chop your fresh cannabis I like to destem the buds and use the fresh soft flower portion of the buds and the smaller leaves some pain relief strains that would be excellent for this is Charlotte's Web and Harlequin among many others [Music] using a chef's knife to chop the cannabis makes it very easy to chop the marijuana into very small bits you want to stop short of chopping the cannabis into a pace so it's still easy to collect it from the cutting board and once you have a choppa scoop it all up and put it into the large sealable jar I find that a 64-ounce wide mouth mason jar is perfect for the amount of cannabis that we're using in this recipe today next we would do the same thing that we did with the cannabis to the Rue de plana rue de otherwise known as common rule or herb of grace is an ornamental plant and herb which is recommended by the person who provided this classic home remedy recipe it's used as an arthritis pain reliever much like the cannabis remove the large stems if you want and then chop the root of fine once you have it chopped we're going to put it into the jar with the rest of the canvas next up we need to mash our doctoral or hels belles flour into a paste but first gently press out any of the water that may be collecting with a paper towel a datura is a poisonous plant so do not ingest this or get it into your eyes however the FDA has recognized the medicinal uses of the torah' recently because of the presence of certain chemical compounds now find it's helpful to use a mortar and pestle in doing this but you could also use the back of a spoon into a shallow pan or a plate however you achieve it you need to mash the to medium size flowers into a paste then add about 250 milliliters of alcohol to wash the mortar and pestle and to make sure that he rats all of the datura paste into the jar along with the rinsing alcohol [Music] now add the remaining amount of alcohol needed to fill the jar to about twelve hundred and fifty milliliters now we need to chop or crumble four cubes of camphor blocks until almost powdered then carefully scoop it up and add it into the alcohol mixture into the jar now add the two remaining kaffir tablets into the mixture hold without crumbling them up these two whole ones will help us make an aggregate when we shake and will also help release the cap for a little more slowly as it dissolves into the plant extracts now make sure that you put the lid on the jar and tighten it very securely because now we need to shake vigorously for several minutes now the better you shake the better and faster this process will complete in the long run so stay with it as long as you can the mixture will begin to take on a greenish tint but we still have a while to go because now we let it sit for several days in a cool dark place and shaking it again periodically after several days five to seven days at least the mixture will darken and the green color will saturate into a neon green color after several days the topical is ready to use but you can continue with these optional steps to make it more refined and easy to use product so now you can strain it very carefully through an unbleached coffee filter to remove any of the plant materials this will make it easier if you follow the next step now the product is ready to funnel into a spray or roll-on container so that when you need it you can easily roll or spray it onto the affected areas this top pool can be used as needed on the skin do not ingest it because it will make you very sick also keep it well away from your eyes and children but it is a great for arthritis pain general aches and pains and in muscles and joints and other general topical useless and to answer this inevitable question in advance no this does not get you high it's a simple old-school home remedy that is not intended to produce any

quite interested in researching this there's some cool information stick around [Music] so here in Canada there's been a lot of talk about cannabis lately and there's plenty of stores popping up all over the place so first of all what is cannabis cannabis is the Latin term for the plant itself and there are more than one species of plant therefore each species of plant has varying amounts of the compounds THC and CBD amongst many other compounds within the plant so some will have more THC than others and others will have much less so the species of plant really does make a difference and there's many blends of various plants you can get so that you can get the desired effect that you're looking for so what does THC THC is one of the compounds within the cannabis plant it's a cannabinoid and it is it stands for tetrahydrocannabinol CBD on the other hand is another cannabinoid within the cannabis plant and that stands for cannabidiol so what's the difference between the two quite a bit so THC is that compound within the cannabis plant that gives you that feeling of being high CBD does not have that effect so one is psychoactive one is not psychoactive THC is psychoactive CBD is not so looking at how each one effects your sleep I found that pretty interesting because you know I've I've heard of many people lighting a joint before bed to fall asleep easier and they think that they sleep better but if that joint that you're smoking has THC in it then yeah you are going to fall asleep sooner but it's going to interrupt your REM sleep and that can be a problem especially long-term it can be a blessing or a curse so looking at it this way if your REM sleep is disrupted that means that you are not you're not dreaming you're not getting into that dream state and you're not processing your memories and emotions this can be a blessing if you suffer from anxiety or PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder and the next day you will feel groggy as well just just like you would if you had a hangover so that's THC CBD on the other hand now apparently too good to be true it can help you fall asleep sooner it can help you stay asleep through the night I'm not sure about how it affects your REM sleep or not I couldn't find any definitive information on that and it also helps you feel even more alert the next day so this sounds really good there's not enough research to say definitively if there are any long-term problems with taking CBD so the jury's still out on that one and just to add a little fly into the ointment not everybody reacts to either THC and/or CBD in the same way as the next person each person each of us has a different number of receptors for cannabinoids and so THC tends to lock on to those receptors more so than CBD and that's why we get that that psychoactive effect now if you can flood your system more so with CBD rather than THC then those CBD they will take up those receptor spots instead that are therefore leaving less space for any THC that might be in there CBD has been shown to relieve pain which can be very good a lot of people use it for pain relief and and for getting a nice deep sleep so that's all the information I could find on THC and CBD regarding your sleep at this point like I said research is still fairly new a lot of people will say oh there's no problem with CBD but I think you have to take it upon yourself if you're wanting to try it to use yourself as an experiment and start low and then work your dosage up I am NOT giving you any medical advice whatsoever this is just what I've read and since everybody responds differently to it it would be wise to start small so I hope you found this information helpful and if you do use it and you've had good or negative effects you know maybe just write that down share your information so that other people can also help decide as well have a super day thanks for watching bye [Music]", "iXOiyo5eYW0": "while we've probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and

delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber scriber welcome back thank you so much for joining so today we're gonna be doing THC infused lip balm so this stuff is really really nice and what's really great is you put it on your lips and you're always doing this during the day so you are getting your THC and not in high doses and you can reapply it any time that you like and you can make it in any flavor that you like any sense that you like you can add essential oils for other benefits that you may like to add to it and it's fairly straightforward simple recipe so without a further ado I'll get started alright so the ingredients that you're going to need is all first of all your THC infused coconut oil so I did a small infusion here if you want to know how to learn how to do a small infusion I have a video on that you can check that out and so we're going to need two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil we're going to need two tablespoons of beeswax pellets and you can get these at any health food store or you can order them online and you want to make sure that you get 100% pure beeswax and food grade because it's gonna go on your lips so anything that you get you always want to make sure it's food grade we're gonna be using two tablespoons of shea butter and again you want to make sure you're using 100% pure shea butter now if you want to add a little bit of tinted coloring you can use some food coloring but literally like a half the drop or drop because that's gonna stain your lip and you lip balms generally are for color you can use a slight bit of tint so you can use like an oil-based color or you can use powders or you can use mica powders if you've got those on hand for you could add essential oils or benefits whatever benefits that you'd like you can add in some essential oils or for our fragrance and then for flavor if you like you can add in a little bit of your favorite flavoring and again you want to you guys this is candy flavoring which and you want to use a very small amount so that's our ingredients for that we're gonna need for our lip balm now what we're going to put it in is I got these from all this stuff from the dollar store so I picked up these little tiny jars these are probably a little bit too small but can't be too fussy these I got in a travel kit these are actually the perfect size and they came with a few other few other bottles that you've gotten your travel kit so if you make other lotions or leave some things you've got those in there as well if you'd like and it has the two sides is a smaller one and the slightly bigger one which is really handy or the other is if you want a lip balm - what I did is I just bought a package they came to in a package of some no-name lip balm and you're just gonna twist it up what I did was I put it in the freezer first these are nice because this one will come these come right out screw right out and then you just want to gently remove that and then you can use to use something sharp to pull out the rest of it the other thing is being difficult just take a little piece of paper towel with something sharp here and stuff it in then you can just go around and clean it and there you go then just screw it back in you take it all the way down and we can fill it up and then you've got a tube then what you can do is you just peel off the label there you go now you've got an empty lip balm too so that's everything that we need to get started oh sorry and what we're gonna be cooking is a French press and we're gonna be doing it in boiling water on a pot so you want to get a pot of boiling water going you just want to fill up enough water that's going to just cover the your oil you don't want to go too high otherwise your French press is gonna Bop around in the water and can fall over so just enough water that's gonna cover your oil all right so it's pretty straightforward we're gonna put everything into the French press pour in your can of your can of oil I'm so used to working with can of butter use your can of oil your shave and then our two tablespoons of beeswax pellets our beeswax pellets and have your essential oil you can add in two to three drops and if you want to add some flavor I'm gonna add a little Mangal I figure orange mango is gonna be used I you picked orange essential oil because it's brightening so I thought that would be nice for lips brightening your lips giving some plumpness to them and brightening them up and I thought orange mango would be a nice flavor and it also goes well with the coconut does you have a slight coconut flavor from your oil and we're gonna add in the 1/2 a teaspoon a lecithin and I said less instant it's really good for your skin it's good for you as well as it's gonna help to emulsify and bind everything together lecithin is optional you don't have to use it as well as essential oils or the flavoring you don't have to use it you could just go straight oh natural oh I don't know how well that would taste good it tastes very coconut and canta canta canta butter ish we've got everything in there and we're just gonna put the lid on you want to put it just above you don't want it to sit on top you want to keep it just above your mix your your lip balm mixture and then we're gonna place it in our water then you want to place your French press in the water you want to have just enough water to come above your lip balm mixture you don't want to go too high because otherwise the French pass well bobble around and it'll fall over see and you want to keep the plunger I said above it look just slip that into the water it's gonna simmer for half an hour and when we get up back we'll fill it will fill up the tubes and the containers and get it set up and try it out and about every five or ten minutes you just want to come along and cut it and just do the plunger up and down just to kind of keep move things around or you can just take it off and just put use a spoon or spatula to mix things up already so our lip balm has been simmering here for a half an hour I just took the lid off of it and what you want to do is turn your heat off but what still leave it in the pot here and what you want to do is you just want to whisk it binding everything together you want to do it in the hot water because it does solidify very quickly so you want to keep it warm let it sit and let the air bubbles come out of it and then we're gonna get ready to pour so if you're using a little lip balm tube the easiest way to do it is to get a funnel that's right in the top and just pour it in and just keep an eye you just want to come up to the do your top of your funnel overflows just throw a little bit back in we can clean up the rest later just when I just a touch more what just to come over the little screw up and that's why I do it in in a little bowl here so that we can collect anything that pours over those we don't waste anything so I'm gonna just let that set up and we'll clean up the sides in a minute so that's a lip balm then very easy obviously for a container just pour it in so we're just gonna let these set up it's always I say it solidifies very quickly you can already see on the sides it's already solidifying and on the bottom so you're gonna let those just sit for about probably about a half hour to an hour until they completely sit or you can put them in the refrigerator actually with the lip balm you can just use the if you've got the French press still you can just pour it in you don't really need to use the funnel but if you're having difficulty then you can it's actually easier without the funnel you just want to fill it up - right about there so our lip balm is all set up now and it's firmed up in the container he looks just like store-bought lip balm I've got that in them in the container and then the one in the tube so it works just like chop stick let's see now let's try it and see what it feels like so my first time making it so wow that's nice damn oh you gotta try this out of this is really really nice alright so I hope you give it a try and let me know if you liked it if you do give it a try if you've got any comments or any questions please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'd love to hear from you and I think that's all I've got for today I hope you look forward to more videos to come and thank you so much for joining me you have a great day [Music]", "fs4YpfxgblI": "Well, Buenos dias from San Felipe Mexico\nguys! Hope you're having a great day. It's Sunday for us.We just enjoyed a nice\nbreakfast here at Vintage cafe and crepas.. And... Not bad at all! Pretty darn good!...So here's the interesting thing...I really have no idea what we're gonna vlog about\ntoday. Do you have any ideas? Just life I guess. And see what happens...Let's see what the brings...We're good at that!... Well somebody needs a haircut\nand we bought this here at the bodega. And there wasn't a price on the shelf. So....\nI ended up paying like twenty-five dollars for this. I was thinking it might be like ten. Even\nthough we have some at Beck's mom's house. We thought... Yeah! Let's give her a\nhaircut here. The interesting thing is going to be seeing how the return process\nworks. I do have a receipt. Okay! well it looks like we're just gonna get in-house\ncredit! And yeah.... 20, 25 bucks no big deal! Because we do come to this Bodega quite\noften. Because they have a little bit of everything here. You know a lot of the\nstuff in this store is a.... Looks like it comes from Walmart. They have\neverything from scooters, washing machines and I think a great value is\nlike a Walmart brand. This is something quite fascinating! Every time an employee\nbuys something like a pack of gum or a drink, they scored it with a shot a\nspray-paint. I guess it's an effective way to secure your inventory. Well concerns have been expressed that\nthe toilet paper we bought last time is a bit rough. And this is the stuff we got\nfor twenty one pesos. And I have no idea what is gonna be better unless I use\nprice as like a factor. I don't know! This stuff is ahhh.... 20 peso! Sometimes you just have to live on the edge when it comes to toilet paper. I really would like to\ncheck this place out...They look closed because it's Sunday...Volunteers without limits! We spend enough time here that we would like to do some volunteer work and sometimes it can be tough\nfinding out where to. But we were referred to this place but... It's Sunday\nand they're not open! We'll have to come back. Look at all those motorcycles...Wow! Beautiful motorcycles to. You know this place is always busy. We\nneed to eat here one day. I'm like totally not hungry now but they're\nalways busy..... Good stuff! Guys this is a really.... Thank you for shaking on me!... Nice day here in San Felipe and the dogs need to get out and play.\nShelby, she's just gonna sand bathe. The dynamic between these dogs is pretty funny because the Springer, Gabe he loves to swim. The Border Collie Sichael, he will\nonly go out about to his chest. And then he gets all jealous that the puppies are\nout there. And just.... It's just a big game with these dogs!\nAnd then Shelby just likes hanging out on the beach. So this is all just a\nlittle bit of hearsay from, I think it was like Victor and Lily. But I guess at\none point they were anticipating cruise ships coming to San Felipe.So.... Some of\nthese ahhhh... Kind of more resort skyscraper looking buildings were developed and\nthen it got canceled out. So.... There's a lot of half-finished hotels. I,  It's like\na double-edged sword you know! You think it would be great for the economy for some cruise ships to come in. But yet it would change the whole dynamic of the town and probably take away some of the charm! Well we're gonna round this afternoon\nout with a trip to the sweet spot.They're not always open but Monica yesterday\nsaid that they have really good margaritas! You guys are a salt on the rim type of\nperson or a no salt? I just love that contrast with the salt... Well you gotta get a little sampler platter to soak up the alcohol. This little dog\nis getting mighty hungry right now! She's taking a couple whips off just in the\nhopes that she'll get some food. I am so glad we ordered a little bit of food...\nBecause these guys, they snuck some alcohol into that picture Margherita's!...Oh oh! Mom's intoxicated! Fortunately grandma had some dog food in her trunk. We attained the monster! Mom what are you doing ordering a whole slab of ribs?...That's what we are having for dinner....We are hungry! Seriously this has to be the best\nhomemade potato salad I've had in a long time! I think mom just didn't want us\ndriving intoxicated. So she knew we had to like soak up the alcohol! Wow! And we also just totally hung out with\nVincent the chef here...He's awesome...Yeah....The Sweet Spot.... Worth your ahhhh... Stop here in San Felipe! Alright guys! I got to give you a shout-out on my youtube channel because this food is great! We have Vincent.... What's happening?....DeAndre!...\nDeAndre... Quincy and this is the guy that adds tequila to those margaritas.\nHey! Great meal guys! Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you for coming...You gotta love leftovers...I like the oranges...And grandma wants the oranges. I'm not safe to drive right now! That CBD oil must\nreally be giving her the munchies. Because.... Shelby has not let up.She is\nwanting all of what we are having... Our dog is a weed freak!...There's worse things to be in life.... But on\na very serious note! We have started Shelby be on CBD oil. Which is the\nnon-intoxicating, anti inflammatory aspect of hemp or marijuana whatever...And she has like an autoimmune condition with her spinal cord where it's all\ninflamed. And it has just been amazing! We've seen this burst of life come back\nto her personality! Like she's getting into shit and stirring up trouble. That's\nthe Shelby we know and love!...Like before she wouldn't be stirring stuff up! Like\nit really warms our heart to know that this CBDoil D oil... CBD oil is really\nhelping her. And if you guys have a dog with some type of an issue related to\ninflammation, I would highly recommend giving it a shot! And you can get it in\nall 50 states guys....

Hope you have an awesome day. See you next time! Bye!", "FN7gKQRqxrI": "sup y'all its mandu sampai back at you again with another vid today I'm gonna talk about the gospel that is hemp oil so I used to have really really bad skin I had perfect skin in high school and then once I got to college with all the stress of schools you know your life in my skin got really really bad and I had active acne everywhere I have I had a lot of scarring I still have some scarring but hemp oil has definitely changed that it's decreasing at a very fast rate which I am grateful for [Music] [Music] [Music] so for the last 30 days I've been using hemp oil as a cleanser and it has done Jesus's work on my skin and I know what some of y'all think and you it seems very counterintuitive however the more dehydrated your skin is the more oil it produces it's trying to save itself you know but hemp oil is perfect because it cleans the impurities Wow at the same time moisturizing your skin and by cleaning impurities it's like oil or like dissolves like so in our instance oil dissolves oil so the reason I love hemp oil is because it is on the comodo genic scale it's a zero which means it will not clog your pores so it is absolutely perfect if your acne prone another great thing is that it is rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and that just helps keep yourselves healthy because they are essential fats also if you have suffer from psoriasis that's hot that's due to a deficiency in omega-6 fatty acids so that can help alleviate that also can this shoot make me it bra sadly the answer is no it does not contain THC which is the thing that makes you really happy so that's that so this is the brand I use new tevia hemp oil cold-pressed I got that from Vitamin Shoppe however I did make a mistake when I first bought it I didn't know you had to refrigerate that [ __ ] so I forgot to do that so my recommendation for you guys is once you get it and you open it and you use put it right in the French so I'm gonna do a little demo for you guys what I do is I get this is called I pour a tiny bit in my hand and it's supposed to look like oh [ __ ] beep computer foot it's supposed to look like baby poop but very liquidy like the color to me oh I don't know if you see that it smells super nutty so don't be alarmed it's supposed to smell like a tree what I do is I just rub it yep rub it all on your skin very gently and when you first do this you're gonna feel all that grime coming off when I first did it I felt little little little pebbles it felt like on my skin which is pretty gross but my skin felt really clean after that and after a week of using it my clothes Calma domes on my forehead one way it smells really cool yeah you're just gonna rub it on your skin for about a minute yes perfect so after you've rubbed your face for a good minute and you look like a greasy Pig you're gonna keep that oil on your face for an additional 15 to 30 minutes and what I like to do is I'd like to go in the shower with the steam and just let my pores open and soak all those good vital vitamins in the skin and once you're done waiting fifteen to thirty minutes you're gonna clean all that oil off with a cleanser that you that you normally use what I've been using is this new gen green tea foam cleanser it's been good so far but yeah that's what you do and that was my PSA on hemp oil if you guys end up using it and it works out for you please let me know in the comments below everyone the skin is different so what may work for me may not work for you but I found that it's definitely transformed my skin for the better peace out y'all", "FnwUUaNNGuI": "in this video we're going to be looking at CBD oil and how CBD oil could effectively regrow hair make sure to stay tuned hey guys Leon here and welcome to the hair guard

we're going to get into the video on CBD oil cannabis has gotten a bad rap in the past but the latest research on the plant and its derivatives suggests that it may be useful more useful than once thought in this video we'll cover one particular derivative known as CBD I'll introduce CBD and the ways in which you may interact with the body I'll then further outline the potential health benefits of CBD oil including hair growth let's jump in so first guys let's have a quick introduction into CBD now can a video more commonly referred to as CBD is an extract from the cannabis plant CBD is the second most prevalent compound found in cannabis with up to 40 percent of the plants extract with the first being Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol which is known as THC now what is the difference between CBD and THC to understand CBD is important that you first understand what it's not cannabis more commonly referred to as marijuana or weed is a plant that's often harvested for its psychoactive effects the compound found in cannabis which contributes to this effect isn't CBD though it's actually THC THC is the compound which induces the high that uses of marijuana receive if CBD doesn't have any psychoactive effects though why is it so often used well the answer is simple CBD has many of its own benefits which are independent of THC or other compounds found in cannabis what about CBD and how it interacts with the human body well believe it or not the human body is actually adapted to the use of cannabinoids like CBD let me explain found throughout the body a cannabinoid receptors which a part of the endocannabinoid system these can be classified by cb1 receptors mostly found in the brain and cb2 receptors found mostly within the immune system these helped to stimulate and regulate a number of physiological processes including appetite mood pain and memory as you'd imagine the cannabinoid receptors aware plant cannabinoids like CBD doc but cannabinoids produced by the human body and synthetic cannabinoids can also interact with these receptors once these receptors have been activated they are then able to influence various intracellular effects a neuronal excitability so what are some of the health benefits of CBD oil well before we discuss the effects that CBD oil may have on hair growth let's consider it's more general benefits first is it reduces pain and inflammation since circa 2900 BC marijuana has been used to treat a number of medical conditions these include muscle spasms joint pain and other such conditions which trigger pain and while scientists are still unsure of its exact mechanisms there were a few studies which highlight CBDs use in the treatment of pain SATA vex is an oval spray which contains a combination of THC and CBD the drug is a purely approved for use in many countries and is often used as pain reliever for those with chronic medical conditions one study on the topic published in 2015 offers a bit more insight into the drugs uses and mechanisms the study consisted of 30 patients all of which had been diagnosed previously with multiple sclerosis or MS the goal of the study was to determine whether the drug could relax the muscles and as a result improve spasticity and reduce pain the patients were given an extensive clinical and neuro physiological examination before and after the trial the parameters which researchers used to gauge results included motor threshold motor evoked potential amplitude into cortical excitability sensory motor integration and H Mac stroke m-m-max ratio as the researchers noted the results of the study showed an increase of intra cortical inhibition a significant reduction of spinal excitability and an improvement in spasticity and associated symptoms as such they concluded that SATA vex may be an effective drug for producing symptoms of MS how well the researchers speculate that the drug works along into cortical pathways this suggests that THC and or CBD can relieve a number of neurological symptoms including pain the next thing is that the alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression if you suffer from anxiety or depression you know too well for the conditions abilities to SAP you of oil energy joy and overall mental well-being there are many drugs on the market which target various pathways in order to treat these conditions the most common drug classes include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs but did you know that CBD may also be an effective intensity and the antidepressant were there were many triggers for individuals who suffer from generalized social anxiety disorder also known as si D but one of the most common triggers is public speaking with this in mind researchers from Brazil recruited 36 individuals to test the effects of CBD on si D the study consisted of 24 patients who had never received treatment for their anxiety disorder and 12 healthy control individuals the subjects were then required to participate in a simulation public speaking test or spst to determine whether CBD had any effects on those of SA D the SI d group was split into two groups the first group received a 600 milligram dose of CBD while the second group received a placebo dose these were administers one and a half hours before the test and both the participants and the researchers were blinded to the treatment the group which consisted of 12 healthy individuals didn't receive anything as the results of the study showed pretreatment with CBD significantly reduced anxiety cognitive impairment and discomfort in their speech performance and significantly decreased alert in their anticipated speech these results are especially significant when you consider how the placebo patients performed is they displayed higher anxiety cognitive impairment discomfort and alert levels the results of this study are certainly interesting but is there more pieces to back these claims or one study published in 2016 showed the effectiveness of CBD oil in the treatment of insomnia in children with post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD but just as with the previous study there were still many questions left unanswered the most pressing question is whether dependency on CBD is a possibility as of now there is no evidence to suggest that CBD dependence or abuse is a problem that's not to say that the possibility has been ruled out entirely however so CBD is a pretty interesting medication it's quite popular at the moment but now we're gonna go into how it could be used for hay growth well it's currently no evidence that CBD can directly stimulate hair growth or tree pattern baldness that doesn't mean that it doesn't have his hair benefits though let's take a look at what we do know about CBD based on current research the first thing is that it may treat psoriasis psoriasis is a skin condition that consists of flaking inflammation and thick patches of skin this condition can develop on any part of the body though areas with high sebum content such as the scalp are often a target there were an array of treatment methods including photodynamic light therapy steroids and immunosuppressive drugs but as you can imagine these can come with their own risks and potential side effects the good news a literature review published in 2016 indicates that CBD maybe a future treatment option for psoriasis patients it's well known that psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that may trigger an interaction within the nervous system the endocannabinoid system is one such system within the nervous system this means that is possible for CBD to play a role in mitigation of symptoms there is still much research to be done of course it also may stabilize sebum levels now we've already discussed about the benefits of CBD oil for treating inflammation inflammation plays a significant role in hair loss and whether it's the underlying cause or just a side effect of another condition we know for sure that inflammation must be controlled in order to stop hair loss and even be grow hair but another factor that's often overlooked in hair loss is sebum sebum is the natural oil produced from the sebaceous glands which are founded inside the hair follicle a healthy scalp can regulate sebum production so as to ensure a well-balanced environment medical conditions including male pattern baldness may trigger an inbounds however so how does CBD fit in according to a 2014 research study CBD exerts SIBO static effects on human see besides the research was performed in vitro which means it was performed in test tubes to culture dishes etc in a laboratory setting the researchers use cultured human see besides which highly specialized sebum producing epithelial cells as well as human skin organ cultures to determine the effect of CBD on sebum production as the tests showed the administration of CBD sasebo sites and human skin organ culture inhibits lipid genic actions of various compounds these included arachidonic acid linoleic acid and testosterone but how exactly does this work well it appears that CBD activates certain ion channels namely transient receptor potential of vanillite 4 or T or P v4 which then suppresses sebum proliferation and expression but why is this good for hair growth there are quite a few dermatological conditions that are triggered by the presence of excess sebum dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis are perhaps the most common the build-up of sea burden can cause irritation inflammation and itching over time this may dislodge otherwise healthy hairs from the scalp or even the follicles and prevent hair growth if CBD oil can suppress excess sebum production as at the previously mentioned study claims this may be a significant breakthrough for sufferers of many dermatological conditions and finally it provides nutritional benefit in some cases nutrient deficiencies can cause hair thinning and loss this is particularly true when it comes to vital hair nutrients such as iron Neeson and biotin hair loss can also trigger a nutrient deficiency within the follicles as the follicles become inflamed and are unable to receive oxygen and nutrients they were acquired from the blood vessels CBD is full of nutrients such as omega-3 omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids as well as gamma linoleic acid or GLA these ingredients may help to promote hair growth but they can also protect existing hair strands fatty acids are beneficial in two main ways foremost they provide moisture to the scalp and hair they also protect the cuticle against outside damage too so as to reduce breakage and split ends and we can go even further and say that the amino acids within CBD lend themselves to the structure of the hair on the hair is composed almost entirely of the protein keratin and there's amino acids are the building blocks of protein CBD oils contents can ensure the protein is strengthened okay great so CBD is looking like quite an interesting thing to add into a hair care routine what about legality issues there's much debate worldwide about the legalization of the cannabis plant in its derivatives including marijuana and CBD oil let's take a look at the United States for example well thanks to the 2018 farm bill which was signed into law in December 2018 CBD oils obtained from hemp plants are legal at the federal level but CBD oil which are obtained from marijuana are only legal in some states you may notice that the qualifier this bordered above what exactly does this mean marijuana and hemp both terms which often used to describe the derivatives of the cannabis plant the difference however lies in the THC content marijuana by definition is any kind of his plant very high variety that contains greater than 0.3 percent THC by dry weight these plant varieties are known to produce the height that's associated with weed hemp on the other hand is any kind of is plant varieties that contains less than 0.3 percent THC by driveway and this means that it's a non intoxicating variety hemp derive CBD oil are more widely legalized throughout the world so how could you use CBD for your hair well there were two ways to utilize CBD topically and by ingestion to apply it topically you would massage CBD oil into a hair and scalp to receive the direct benefits of the oil there are many brands of CBD oil shampoos and conditioners on the market these products may take the deliverability of CBD easier and they can also make it easier to add CBD to a routine a shampooing and conditioning are likely regular parts of your routine already the next thing you can do is you could take it over lay the vast majority of CBD oils are produced as an older supplement so as long as the brand you've chosen indicates that it can be taken orally you may want to consider that option this method can likely provide with the greatest benefits in regards nutrient absorption what should you look for in CBD oil well if you're on the market for CBD oil then you'll need to pay special attention to the quality of the products you buy what exactly should you be looking for well the first place to start with is full-spectrum CBD the oils derived from hemp plants are often classified as I have the full spectrum CBD or CBD isolate full-spectrum CBD contains many more beneficial components including proteins fatty acids and flavonoids the same cannot be said for CBD isolate which is likely good to contain just CBD and perhaps a few traces components listed above unfortunately there is very little regulation of CBD all around the world in the USA for example CBD oil is not regulated by the Federal Drug Administration this means that the manufacturer is responsible for quality and accurate reporting so if the FDA doesn't back the claim to these companies how can you know that their labeling is accurate the only way is to choose a reputable company the putable companies will often provide the results of third-party researchers this offers an additional assurance to consumers now the evidence on CBD oil for hair growth is slim in fact no trials which directly studies the use of CBD for her health have been performed that doesn't mean that we can't draw conclusions from other studies on the cannabis derivative though we know that CBD may control sebum levels and this is important for a healthy scalp environment we also know that CBD oil contains many nutrients which can provide the hair with the Bluefish that they need so

today we are making this lovely gentle hemp and shea soap so you can see it's got a nice little sort of rustic white theme through the center and we've got a topping of some hemp hearts so this is a really nice easy bar to make and it's great if you have sensitive skin it's got a wonderful creamy lather from a lot of clay in there which is one of my favorite things and soap and the green color comes from just natural unrefined hemp oil which is naturally a very deep green color so this is a cold processed bar and I'm soaping it at room temperature which means that I've combined the lye in the water and let that come to room temperature over the course of several hours and not that the fats and also let those settle to room temperature over the course of several hours this is one of my favorite ways to make so it is so easy there's no fussing with thermometers and with trying to get everything to sort of settle at the right temperature because they'll just naturally settle up the same temperature which is room temperature couldn't be easier once you have achieved trace this is a really really simple soap to put together well blend in our clay and then we're going to take about a quarter of the soap batter and put it into a new separate Bowl and so that that's going to be this layer so that's a layer we'll blend our titanium dioxide into and then all you're going to do is put through about half of the green stuff in your mold the white stuff and then the rest of the green stuff and then because I wanted to really sculpt up the top and get some nice texture here I left it in the mold for about 15 to 20 minutes just to let it set up enough that you could really sculpt it and then I use a spatula to sculpt up the top as you'll see and then sprinkled some hemp hearts down the center and after that it's just saponify cut age and you're done so come on let's get started so we're starting with our melted fats and our live water so I melted these fats and made this live water about eight hours ago and so I've let them come to room temperature so this set this is just oh my one hundred percent room temperature soaking method where you just let everything come to room temperature it's great to do the sort of the melting and the combining part before you go to bed and then make yourself the following morning so we're going to add the lye water to our fats and this here this is pretty much the most dangerous part of making soap when your lye water is all concentrated like this so at this point I'm if you spilt it on yourself it would be like spilling a giant pot of boiling water on yourself not good now that it's in here it's heavily diluted and it gets less and less dangerous from this point on because as we reach tres it gets thicker and thicker and your spills become less and less messy basically you can imagine the difference between spilling pudding and spilling water right one will spread significantly further than the other so I'm going to give that a bit of a stir and then I set this aside I'm actually just going to pop this in our live pot and I've got my stick blender here and let's get this going to trace you all right we've achieved trace you can see that when I do this you just see a little hint of the drooling soap off the spatula and just leaves a trace in the top of the soap so I'm going to keep blending this for another minute or so and then we'll add the clay and then we'll be ready to divide this into two batches and decorate it you so this is gotten a bit thicker and that trace is just a little bit more obvious and now it's time to add our play so I've just got some white Kalyan clay here and at that I like to use quite a lot that's more than most people recommend but I've used quite a lot more than this in other recipes and I love the way it turns out so no worries so make sure you use your immersion blender to really blend it up so you don't have any clumps can stamp it down so that you're really capturing it you all right give that a stir I'm not seeing any noticeable clods of clay so we are ready to divide this in half so you certainly don't have to divide your soap batches in half but I find that I like to do the legwork of the mixing and the trace once and then do the decorating twice so I'll make one batch of batter divide it in half by weight and then make two different batches of soap from it so set our immersion blender aside and I'm going to grab my scale here and so what I've done is I've added up the weights of everything that's in this pot so that's all the fats and all the water and all the sodium hydroxide and so I have that number here and I've written it down and we're going to divide it by weight and this part is really important too got it divided by the weight do not try to eyeball it you will be wrong every time I know because I did it a bunch of times that way before actually learning my lesson you all right close enough that's within a few grams at least and so when you're considering which batch you want to do first there's a few things to think about one if you want to do something fancy and fiddly you might consider doing that batch first because the batch that is sitting will thicken up as it sits something else to consider is if one of them is going to be a significantly darker color than the other do that one last so that way you don't have to clean your immersion blender so with that in mind we are going to do the light one first so I'm going to set this aside for use later and we have our pot here and for this light soap it's going to have a wee swirl and I'm just going to make this an unscented hemp soap so I have a higher expand drink up here and I'm just going to put you know a little bit in here I'm not really fussed with how much it's probably about a quarter of the amount of batter and in here I have a little Pyrex measuring cup that's got some titanium dioxide in some olive oil and so this helps improve the incorporation of the titanium dioxide which can be quite clumpy into this half unfortunately because titanium dioxide is quite clumpy this is still not entirely smooth so we will need to break out our immersion blender to ensure we actually get a smooth blend alright I'm going to add a little bit more of this titanium dioxide mixture so that we get a stronger contrast soaps that get their colors from the oils that are in them tend to lighten up as they saponify so the amount of contrast that we're going to see here will likely drop significantly during saponification that is like both of these will be less green so we want this to be more white so that it really shows up against this when it's not quite as green as it is now and probably the rest of this might as well this part is really all about eyeballing in the amount that you're going to want to use is going to vary hugely based on the size of the batch of soap you're making so check the description box below and the accompanying blog entry for more information on that so we are going to grab our mold now the old soap counter shuffle and here and here so here's my mold and this is a mold that my dad made me and it's awesome and there are plans and measurements for it on my blog and I'll put the link to that in the description box below and somewhere in here but one my favorite thing about this is that for every one inch of the mold this mold holds a 100 gram batch of soap I know that's a pretty wonky metric Imperial conversion but it means that we have a 15 inch mold will hold a 1500 gram batch of soap and that's 1500 grams of oil plus the necessary water in line okay time to pour so this is thickened up a bit you can probably see it moving a little bit more slowly than it buzz which is to be expected alright scrapey scrapey scrapey and aiming for roughly halfway and then we smooth out so the reason I've used rubber bands stairs because parchment paper which is what this paper is not waxed paper is so delightfully nonstick that even tape doesn't stick to it and if you use tape your parchment paper won't pop and this is no good so we'll use rubber bands alright gently gently gently I'm trying not to dent the the green underlayer it's great this grapes great big I love these spatulas souks home so much the link to them will be in the description box below they are incredible I have like a veritable bouquet of them honestly if a man wanted to impress me on a date he should not bring me a bouquet of flowers he should bring me a bouquet of spatulas either batter actual flowers like baking flour men have done that in the past and that does work smoothie smoothies movie back out and then we're going to do our top layer of more green and remember to be gentle so kind of doing this from a low low height and just sort of very slowly scraping this down and you can't see anything because this pot is opaque I'm sorry you I'm actually going to grab yet another one of my beloved spatulas it's a lot smaller and I can really get into the corners here to start just smooth that down and so what I have for a top decoration for these bars some hem parts so I thought this would be a very suitable topping for a hemp bar so this is not quite as thick as I would like it to be because I want to sort of skooby skooby sculpt it up a bit before adding the hemp parts so I'm actually going to set this aside and we'll do our second batch of soap and then I will come back to this to give it the scoopy treatment that it deserves so soap mold aside now that it has been a little while we can decorate the top of our hemp soap and so what I wanted to do is kind of scoop it up and give it a bit of a a bit of a soap Mohawk and then run a seam of hemp arts down the center of it so I'm just using the spatula here to sort of press the top up and kind of flip it over the top a little bit shift this rubber band back give me a little bit more room to work grab those hand parts all right we will probably lose a bunch of those when we actually slice the soap and start to use it but that's ok some of them will stick and now all that's left to do is pop our lid on this and set it away to saponify for 24 hours so I will see you then so it's been about 36 hours because I ended up getting busy last night let's unmold these bad boys you alright this is looking pretty good but the sides here say you're got a nice white line through they're not even close to being even but that's okay and looks like I should clean my mold a little bit better because there's a little bit of a little bit of pink left over from a previous batch okay so I'm going to take off some of the excess bits over here set these aside for our scrap bin which I think with this one I'm probably just going to amputate the very end bits as tiny little slices anyways I'm not going to fuss about that too much so this hope is still quite sticky so I have a damp cloth here so I can wipe my knife down in between slices what I'm going to do is actually I took this to the side so that I don't catch any of those hem parts and drag them through the soap when we cut it see here we'll lop off our ends here and then go back divider up I'd say that looks like about half into quarters you and there we go there's some unscented gentle hemp soap thank you so much for watching please subscribe and check the

corporation August 9 2018 we have a CP for screw pressing we're gonna test again with ham today they have I don't know if you can see this very well but it is pretty moist it's a lot more wet than the stuff returned yesterday some of the stuff we didn't yesterday was pretty wet and you would have seen some really good flow rate this is on par with the wettest stuff of yesterday so I'm expecting to see a lot but even even being this wet if you look at this there's nothing coming through nothing now if you go to the other side of my hand no nothing's going through there so this is the problem that people have when they infuse material with the liquid is try how are we gonna get that liquid out you know we'll squeeze with our hands put it in soccer cloth and twist it and you really can't get almost anything out you know you can see my hands are wet but that's as good as it gets now the beauty of our screw press is it'll take out almost all of this moisture or an awful lot of it so let's see how we get on okay we're running at 135 psi we've got juice coming out now a really good flow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it sure that it's fall the side [Music] [Music] okay this is more for the benefit of video than anything else and the finished processing [Music] and I'm going to do a a weight analysis on this point oh six [Music] okay we finished this test we ran through that one bucket that I showed you just a few minutes ago there's a press liquor it's still kind of draining through obviously you're going to get some sediment so you can see that sediment right there this shows you how much oil we got and then if you go to here it's the idea of the cake and I think you remember how what that was here's an indication of the cake I think you can remember how wet that was my hands our boat this is dry stuff I mean I'll put up I think I'm going to get a paper towel and show you how dry that is okay here we are in sunny Tampa Florida and this is the result of that test we did obviously you saw it in the blue bucket the big one but it was 18 litres of material and afterwards we're left with just Alex about four liters four and a half meters of this the oil and I was about five liters six liters maybe this press cake now this press cake I think you remember how you probably remember how wet it was it was like glistening wet this right here barely gets my hand oily what we'll do real quick is I got some paper towel on here let's put some on paper towel what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna squeeze it in a paper towel or a see if I can please in a paper towel take it off okay there is a little bit of oil there I don't know if that's plant fiber oh there's a little bit of a glisten of some oil in there but that's hardly any so this stuff has come out super dry just like a teacher anyways that is what we're looking at so you get this and this oil right here get this then use our press-on material", "HezPikWxOKw": "what's up pop peace it's your girl pop mom 420 and we are back for another weed Wednesday welcome and as you can see guys I heard your request your commands and I'm here to serve and I am back in the kitchen doing a quick little DIY and

started so we're gonna start out with our magical butter machine shout out to add magical butter calm and all my pop peeps who have got theirs make sure you get out your magical butter machine whether you're using the first version or the second version today I have deep heart in my deep car box 7 7 grams of CBD I'm gonna put the notes in the bottom this is Charlotte's Web in Orange POTUS and like I said it is 7 grams I am using 2 cups of coconut oil it is a refined press it was the only thing I had in a house you know how I am I just use what I'm gonna use so make sure you soften or liquefy that before putting it into the magic butter machine I'm also going to be using a raw honey you're gonna see the second part of that video I have soy lecithin and I'm gonna be using I believe a tablespoon of that so the first part of this video is infusing the coconut oil if you pot peeps have never seen the video for coconut oil I did one a while ago but I'm gonna do a new one right now so this first part is the coconut oil so let's get into it let's take out the car CBD and if you are in a legal state and using THC that is fine as well I will leave instructions and the pipe notes below on how to decarbonise you have not seen it and just make sure you go now I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the two cups I'm also gonna put a range in the cotton notes below if you want to make more due to the time the video I only need a little bit of CBD honey because the video and we're gonna go ahead and get that swing left the time going and I believe I'm only using one tablespoon which is 15 MLS remember you use soy lecithin you can use a sunflower less of ten any less the ten is fine you use it because you want to keep the chemicals bond together you do not want them to break down so it keeps it together and then we're going to go ahead we have our coconut oil we have soy lecithin and we have our bud so we're gonna go ahead and put the head of that magical butter machine on then you can go ahead and plug that up alright you hear the beat pop beeps we're gonna go and take that temperature to 160 and we got it at that 160 and we're gonna go ahead and push to two hours for butter all right pop peeps we'll see you in two hours but in video world five minutes all right pop peeps you heard the beep it just stopped don't forget to unplug before taking the top of it up to be safe make sure everything is unplug and make sure you have your filter bag and some type of caching system and we're gonna place our picture back down because we're gonna need it again to blend in this next part of the CD pour the oil back in then we're gonna take two cups of honey we're at this point anything you have and I am measuring with a one cup it's extremely small but I need two cups of honey and this is easy to sit down and just squeeze there will be variations to this if you're making more I will put the measurements but this one is if you are doing 7 grams you are to use 2 cups honey after you got your two cups of honey let's go back to the temperature 160 and then we're gonna hit this quick clean the wind because you just want a quick zap to put it all together all right pot peeps after that quick 15-minute set to get time club before taking a head off cpp honey infuse with cannibal remember we've infused that can of oil mixed it with our honey and this is what we got

Network and today I'm going to teach you how to make an awesome healing salve now the first step in a good healing salve is to infuse the herbs into your oil and you can do this two different ways one you can put it in a jar and have the herbs in it shake it hmm a couple times a day for about three to four weeks well me I'm too impatient for that route so I'm doing the double boiler method so what we what we have here is a double boiler and you don't necessarily have to have a double boiler it can be as easy as setting up a pot with a bowl on top just make sure that whatever bowl you're using on the top is not aluminum so this huming sad we're gonna make today does awesome its you can use it for cuts bruises poison ivy skin irritations I've had friends who've used it on boils cold sores I even have a friend who just had surgery on his hand and he massages it into his hand every night so now oil you can use anything from an olive oil to an almond oil you could also use a coconut oil but as you can see it's a little bit different consistency it's also got a melting point of about 76 degrees so it doesn't do as well in hot weather you have to play with the beeswax make sure a little bit before figuring it out so today I'm gonna use olive oil and we're gonna use two cups now what you want to make sure of is that your double boiler is at a very low temperature you get it up to a boiling and then set it to low because you don't want to deep fryers our first ingredient is echinacea you're going to use one teaspoon of echinacea root now my kinesia stimulates the immune system it also has antifungal and antibacterial properties the second ingredient we're going to use is two tablespoons of comfrey leaf now comfrey speeds the healing of wounds and skin conditions it's recommended for external use because it contains a liver toxic alkaloid which the plant uses to fight off herbivore insects our third ingredient is two tablespoons of plantain leaf now this you're probably ripping out of your yard as we speak it's a weed not to be confused with the pedantic banana but it is it helps to stop bleeding and it has drying properties you can actually use it as a pulse tiss to pull slivers out our next ingredient is a tablespoon of calendula flowers now this is the most one of the most popular herbs to help with cradle cap and diaper rash it's a very mellow herb so it's safe with children it has anti-inflammatory antiviral and it's an immunostimulant next is a teaspoon of yarrow flowers which actually naturally grows here in Central Oregon now it also helps to stop bleeding that's an anti-inflammatory and astringent and aids and healing wounds and our last ingredient is rosemary leaf now rosemary stimulates your immune system increases circulation fights inflammation bacteria and fungi not only that when you're cooking with it it just smells good now what we're gonna do is we're gonna let this double boil for approximately three three and a half hours now take note of what the color of the olive oil was when I poured it in and then check out what it's gonna look like when we pour it out all right so our herbs have been infusing them all up in our olive oil for about three and a half hours and what I've done here is I've got a big measuring cup along with a strainer and then I've cut some cheesecloth so we're gonna lay that cheesecloth down in there and we're gonna take this and because this is a double boiler and there's still water inside of it I've wrapped the handle with the towel so that we don't get any water into our appointment so now what we do pour it through the cheesecloth and the strainer let that seep through get all that oil down there in that the cheesecloth and then we're going to take this twist it up and get all that goodness out of there now I suggest letting your oil cool for a while before you do this because this can be painful I've done it when it's hot and it's not any fun once we get all that goodness out of there we're gonna just discard our herbs now comfrey one of the ingredients actually in this little packet will help the decomposition of your compost pile so if you want throw the herbs in your compost pile it'll just help so now what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to clean this out to get the residual herbs out and then we're gonna put it back on the stove and heat it back up so we'll be back in just two Jim all right so we put the oil back in the double boiler and now we're going to use a quarter cup of beeswax I you can buy it in chunks and and shred it yourself but I prefer to buy the past deals because I'm kind of lazy so I'd rather not sit there and grown a cheese shredder and shred for a long time so anyway we're putting the beeswax into the warm oil and then we're just gonna keep stirring until it all melts and as you can see it does not take long these little pest deals know quite quickly very quickly you turn the burner off so as you can see they've already melted so now what we're gonna do is we're going to take this back over and pour grab my towel pour this back into whatever you're going to use to pour into your containers and their cable so while that's cooling for a minute I want to talk containers because you don't necessarily have to go out and buy containers like I do shallow charts work well if you have an awesome best friend like I do she saves you baby jars these work awesome as well you can reuse old lotion containers just clean them out reuse them back stick containers if you want something on the go and then your kids have paints once the paints are out clean them up and use them for little travel guys backpacks whatever school bags in fact if I can get my son to acknowledge me a bruh what do you call this say one more time loud okay boo-boo juice and he has a little thing of it in his backpack so as we're letting this cool we're gonna add a little vitamin E oil to it and that's gonna help with the preservation you only need about a half a teaspoon I'm gonna stir that in oh and for those of you die hard Todd fans out there I'm not replacing them he's not gone in fact he's my cameraman say hi Todd all right so no worries he will be back all right so we've stirred the vitamin E oil into that and now we're going to pour into our containers make sure to leave a little headspace in your containers don't fill them up to the to the brim now this yields obviously since you're using a cup of olive oil it's gonna yield about two cups so there you have it now you're going to let those sit solidify up and here is what you get with the finished product obviously we use a ton of it but that is what you're gonna get with the finished product nice aunt Minn or any wounds or troubles that you may have thanks for watching [Music]", "bfORGbe6f9Q": "how's it going on its Michelle lives in the karate honey and today we're going to be doing something super fun one of the things that I love

when we're including it in our bath bomb it is going to absorb into our skin and it's gonna help make it helps reduce stress it helps reduce anxiety it helps reduce inflammation it helps with your small eggs in the bruising in the joints so a lot of benefits for athletes or even somebody that is just super busy all day on their feet or he didn't you only have to be physically active you can be mentally active because CBD helps with anxiety it helps with depression so it helps with all sorts of stuff so we got the CBD and then you're gonna need some essential oils essential oils also help with determining what kind of mood you want to be in so if you want it to help you know brighten your spirits and invigorate you you can use sense like orange and maybe some flowery scents and rose up if you want things to relax you you can use things like lavender and cedar what if you want things to help invigorate you you can use sense like spearmint and eucalyptus so the sense that I'm using today gonna be eucalyptus because I just love the fresh smell of it lemon because again it is just a fresh smell um and I think it just ties everything together and adds just a bit of summer Flair and then lavender because the majority of the time when I'm doing bath bombs at the very end of my day and I need something to help lined me down so the lavender does exactly that and then we have all these dry ingredients and wet ingredients so I'm just going to get into it and let you know the exact amount of each thing that you need so here we are and we are going to use the CB distillery I split powder and I use about half of this product so I use half of this product and then we have three tablespoons of Epsom salt Epsom salt is also an anti-inflammatory and it helps with your muscle aches and strains and then we have 1/4 cup of citric acid okay and then we're gonna have 1/4 cup of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of baking soda not baking powder baking soda okay so that's all the dry ingredients also I have these very pretty shimmery mica powders and it doesn't stain your bathtub but it does add some color to the water and also to the bath bomb which I love because color can also you know affect your mood and so I'm gonna mix this really pretty green color and this pretty blue color cuz my favorite color is turquoise and I think it will be just very calm and relaxing so we have that and then we have our wet ingredients which is just almond oil and that's just super moisturizing and will help create the right consistency that we need for the bath palms and then so with the with the almond boy oh we're going to use one tablespoon and then we're going to use a half tablespoon of water and then with the with the eucalypt with all of these essential oils we're just going to use I like to get to really smell so I do like three drops of each all right so now that you have all the ingredients let's get started you have to start by mixing all the dry ingredients so here we go half a cup of baking soda 1/4 cup of corn starch 1/4 cup of citric acid and three tablespoons of Epsom salt all right and for the magic ingredient Seaview distillery I flit powder and I've already done a batch of these and I so I use the other half so I'm gonna just pour the rest of it into here all right now for the shimmer oh so pretty I just love shimmer so this color right here is the sky blue and I just ordered these off of Amazon and it came with a bunch of different variety colors so I'm not gonna use the whole thing because my I don't want it to over for wordpower the bath bomb so I just use about not even I think I use about a quarter of the powder and you use about a quarter of this powder oh so pretty alright so now we have all of our dry ingredients and we're gonna mix it so we're mixing it up and it's such a pretty color all the other powers make sure you get it nice and mixed up some people like to grind up the epson salt if you're like bigger chunks got some salt just so that it's easier to break down when you're taking a bath but if you're taking a bath in pretty hot water in a milk pretty fast so now I have a very pretty light blue tart turquoisey color and so my dry ingredients are all mixed up I'm just going to set that aside and put together are my wet ingredients so and I have this little baby spoon that you get from coal stoves after you try the samples so we have the it's a tablespoon of almond oil and you can use any type of oil you can use coconut oil you can use castor oil you can use a Coco oil whatever kind of oil you like and then we got a half a tablespoon of water now once you start doing mix it into your dry ingredients and you feel like the consistency isn't right you can always add more oil and water so here we are I have lavender and I'm going to do a two for party foul alright so three to four drops of lavender one two three what what okay and then we're gonna do some lemon mmm one two three it's so crazy how smells for me anyways bring memories back like certain smells remind me of Thailand de Flor whoops certain smells like eucalyptus remind me of eucalyptus always reminds me of weight cutting because I always liked that smell - to keep me focused and keep me invigorated while I'm cutting weight because it cutting weight can sometimes be quite stressful so I liked using eucalyptus to kind of keep my mind fresh and sharp alright let's bring back our wedding or dry ingredients and we're just gonna slowly pour this in - in and mix so you'll see a little bit of the dry ingredients start to bubble up because of the baking soda and that's exactly what's gonna happen when you put it into the bath and so with the bath bombs there's all different kind of sized molds but I would get the biggest mold that you can find because I mean my bathtub was super huge and you want to have enough ingredients for for it to be effective so you just pour and mix see it bubble up a little bit that's okay and you'll start to feel the powder get a little thicker alright here's the last bit of it and then we mix and mix and mix it so again the consistency should be like damp sand and once you have the right consistency you can go ahead and start filling up your mold your mold here is that is that right your mold the your mold yeah so some people they like to put like flowers some people like to put oatmeal um you like to mix it with milk some people like to put big chunks of lotion in the middle you can put us up like if you're making this for your friend or something you can put like a cute little surprise in the middle I don't know get creative all right so I got my consistency and I'm gonna go ahead and feel yeah so so when you pick it up you should be able to smash it and it will stick together so if you can smash it ahead and it sticks together that's the right consistency okay and I'm going to use my big mold in the in the and the molds that I got I got three different kinds so that the big mold is basically four baths and then the medium mold or for pedicures and then the small molds are firm miniatures so you just go ahead and fill it up feel a fill fill fill it up okay so once you feel that we're gonna Pat it down nice and tight hey gosh is such a pretty color okay so I Pat it down nice and tight one side okay and then you're gonna go ahead and do that to the other side fill it up Pat it down fill it up pat it down okay so now that they're both the both sides are filled up what I like to do is I just like to overfill it on both sides and then you smash them together so then when you smash all together you're just gonna turn turn turn turn turn and just keep turning it until you hear them grinding together and you have to give your bath bombs 24 hours to dry okay so if you have like if you want to double this ingredient or something if you have a group of people you want to make this for just you know double the ingredients but be careful when you're taking these out of the mold let her try for 24 hours so here's what the mold looks like and so I let it dry for 24 hours and then when you're done and I actually I like to put mine in the refrigerator just helps helps it dry up so now I'm gonna have some extra left over so I'm gonna put it in my pedicure one and again I'm just gonna I don't know maybe is this do I have enough powder left no let's do the manicure one see some when you take it out it is already pretty hardened so you can definitely take it out of the mold and set it aside to dry for 24 hours but if you're only making a couple I would just leave them in the mold okay so now we're going to the manicure one so this is perfect for like for me because I was wrestling yesterday and I dislocated my ring finger on my left hand and it hurts so bad and I didn't even bother to look down at it I already knew it was out and so I just snapped it back into place and that's probably what would have happened anyways if I waited any longer it probably would have start swelling so I snapped it back into place and it seemed fine but when I got home it started to swell and even today I don't know if you can tell but it's swollen this is my finger it's swollen so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use one of these bath bombs just for my hand and let my hands soak so that it pulls some of that inflammation out and helps reduce the swelling of my finger so anytime you're swollen up anytime like if you heat and cold or are really good so but for for instances like this you need heat so you can circulate get new blood circulating into that I went a bit too long but we're almost finished anyways so I got my bath mold set together and then I just did a little manicure one so that's enough and I have just a little bit left so when you're done putting in the mold and you want to use a mold for more you just get a tap the edges and then carefully take the top off and again carefully turn it over and then it should just pop out and it'll be a perfectly smooth remember guys give it 24 hours to dry and then what I did was I wrapped them up with some tissue paper I put some cute like confetti in there and put a little cute tag on there and I'm gonna give them to some of my teammates as gifts because we all beat each other up on a daily basis so it's only fair that I them something to help with their recovery I hope you guys enjoyed it remember I use CB distillery isolate powder for this CBD bath bomb if you'd like to try it all the ingredients are down below and if there's anything else that you think would be interesting for us to do as a fighter mom slash wife let me know in the comments below I hope you guys have a lovely day and enjoy your CBD bath bombs one love", "Olxqp-6huXI": "hello my lovelies hi and welcome back to yet another vlog on my channel i'm so happy you guys are tuning in none other than this beauty here she is the himalayan hemp seed oil cold pressed multi-purpose oil so this beauty i found in amazon i will definitely leave the link down below in the description box just in case you guys want to check it out um this i use as a carrier oil for my face as a part of my skincare so as you can see this comes in a net quantity of 250 ml it's a source of omega 3 plus 6 fatty acids vitamin e minerals which is great it boosts skin repair immunity and even weight loss this company has a set of specifications of claims that it's pure it's wagon it's 100 natural no preservatives and it's non-gmo which is a nice thing to know and as you can see here they have a target symbol in which they've pretty much bought all the details in it what makes hemp seed oil great for you it's rich in mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids vitamin e antioxidants zeros carbohydrates omega 3 and 6 which is very nice it helps lower cholesterol boosts digestive health helps reduce joint aches boost weight loss nourishes hair and skin and enhances immunity which is a set of but of benefits of the soil moving on flipping up the bottle they have got a composition in which they has told that it's just raw hemp that is cannabis cetavalene seed oil mind you and it's not of the stems and the leaves in the directions of use they have mentioned of how do you use it over the food and relish the nutty flavor along with its nutritional goodness for a wholesome meal they've also suggested to drizzle it over the dips sluds humans or pasta and believe him or not this multipurpose oil acts as a great nourishing agent for this hair and skin okay so they've also said that it's best consumed raw and not recommended for frying so you're not supposed to put it under any other heat it's non-gmo and gmp quality one more thing that i wanted to tell you about this is they have not mentioned any fsa ci um certification so i'm not suggesting this to be eaten or to be adding it into your diet or not because i have no knowledge about that or using this particular oil in in your cuisines so i would definitely not comment about that particular area whether you could use this in your food or not i am primarily making this video in terms of just skincare because i have bought this as a alternative for my juicy chemistry hemp seed oil and it was a very good product so i was just looking for alternatives and i happened to bump onto this moving on this is just a quick description about this product in terms of its manufacture it is in india madhya pradesh and they have also mentioned it's a proud product of india in ayurvedic proprietary medicine and this is of a net and this cost of 8.49 for a net quantity of 250 ml um and the manufactured date is of ninth month of 20. so it's going to stay for a solid 12 months since the date of manufacture so that was pretty much it of the description that it's a glass bottle so i'm just being a little extra careful with it that was pretty much it of the description now let's go to how does the look feel and what kind of a consistency does this have so i've just put it horizontally so that you guys can see it's quite a long um bottle uh it's a 250 ml glass bottle i'm just being a little too extra cautious as you can see and it's a very um typical color of the oil is this color of the bottle that you can see here it's a very smoky green and i love that um color of the bottle and it's got a bottle cap which is plastic and i'll show you how does it look with the help of a dropper so it may give more knowledge or clarity as you can see it comes with the typical plastic cork which you see in most of the um bills that you use is a topping so i'm going to show you with the help of a dropper okay so as you can see this is pretty much how it looks like i mentioned it looks just the same color as that of the bottle i have already made a video of the juicy chemistry hemp seed oil which i used as my first product of hemp seed and a hemp seed oil so i found this almost of the same quality i'm not sure about the intricate or the details of whether it's just the same or not but i can only tell in mia in terms of my experience of using it on my skin and i felt it was just the same so i finished my first juicy chemistry bottle of hemp seed oil so i filled it up with the um this oil so i it's pretty cool because this was actually the juicy chemistry hemp seed oil which i first purchased and it was 30 ml and it was a round of around it was a round of the prize or mrp of 600 excuse me the bottle is a little dirty um so i found it a little too overpriced i was looking whether there were any alternatives and i happen to bump onto this beauty and i'm so happy i found this product so right now i have preserved this bottle i use it um the moment it gets over i refill it so this is the first um set of amount that i put from this bottle onto that and i've almost reached halfway i'm still using it and i'm forever going to use this bottle until i just show you i'll just put a little drop of it and it's a very runny consistency oil just as i've mentioned in the previous juicy chemistry hemp seed oil and i feel it's really nice you don't need a lot like two or three drops just on the top of your skin does a great job after your skincare it helps it to lock the moisture or whatever that you've put on under the layer of this oil so it's a very nourishing oil beautiful oil for um oily skin people especially because it's got a zero comedogenic scale point which is amazing it's just so good for the so that was pretty much it about the description and the look feel and all about that product i just felt that this was a much much better bit that i could find online in amazon i'm so thankful i want to bounce back to this product and would want to use this forever so thank you so much for watching i hope you all like this video leave it a thumbs up if you did like this video leave it a thumbs down if you do not like this video i totally get it do let me know about what you

"TSgOkBoYzCw": "boy CBD healing bomb review what is up guys my name is Eden and I am the owner of Wella c-calm and welcome back to another installment of our review segment today I'm super excited to review a brand new CBD topical from our good friends over at koi CBD and if you've tried any coit products you know that they are nothing short of high quality and incredibly effective so I got some high hopes for the koi CBD healing balm so let's go ahead and uh take a look at some of these products so when it comes to the healing balm there are two options so there's the big boy such as this and this is in the box and this is the container it comes in and this big big bad boy has 500 milligrams of the koi prism true spectrum hemp oil doesn't have any THC in it so you know it's got some CBD CBD v c VG some cbn you know it's got a varying profile of cannabinoids without having the THC in it and then so 500 milligrams in this bad boy starts at $59.99 llc.com and then um if you want to give the healing balm a try and without you know it's forking over the 60 bucks they do have a travel size of the healing balm which on the anal has a 150 milligrams in it but that one starts at $19.99 so it's a great way to start out and experiment with the product to see if it's right for you and your personal needs because let's face it we all require different products different potencies and so you know we're all different so it's important to experiment and find what works best for you and your personal needs and if you stick around until the end of the video or actually if you just check down below you will also you will see an exclusive discount code that you can use to get 15% off your first purchase of the coy healing balm from Wella c.com so like I said guys the koi healing balm it's got the the koi prism true spectrum hemp oil so you know I kind of look at that as sort of like a broad spectrum kind of formulation because it doesn't have any trace it doesn't have any THC in it so you don't don't worry about that and also what's in it is it's got some essential oils you know it's phenomenal essentials you know let's take a look so it's got like some grapeseed oil yellow beeswax Granite coconut oil peppermint oil eucalyptus leaf oil rosemary leaf oil sweet basil oil spearmint oil lavender flower oil and that's just beginning there's many many more in there so I'm really excited to give this a try because with all of those essential oils in there you know you get some of that aromatherapy going once you apply it under your skin really relaxing then you also get the benefits of phyto cannabinoids from the hemp plant you know such as the CBD the the CBD v the cbn you know the varying cannabinoids without any THC of course guys it's I do want to keep pointing that out so koi a healing balm I'm going to use the big bad boy today because I just love the packaging guys like look at this right on the cap you know it's a wood engraved cap it has the koi logo right koi CBD logo right on it's just it's beautiful alright and you know just high-quality packaging a nice glass container with a nice wood lid you know it's it's solid all the way so you just open this up and ooh ooh so oh its shape so take it out the box so I actually had one out of the box already so you take that like so boom boom and what's really awesome you know it's got some the ingredients on there directions for use you know simply you just using a CBD topical or CBD salve this is what it's referred to as this is a salve does it's thicker consistency it's not like a lotion it's kind of like sort of like a Vaseline kind of consistency but it doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy for extended periods like Vaseline you know so it's really easy with SABS you simply just take take a glob on your finger I mean just rub it right on the plump the problematic area you know it's really effective for those large deep muscle groups that you've really got a massage deep so though you athletes if you experience an injury you know I was dealing with some shoulder pain a while back and reach for the coy healing balm and let me tell you it was really really effective for me so I'm excited to review this product with you guys so pop it out the box right here you know it's got the 500 milligrams of coy healing balm we're sort of sticker right there other than that you know down at the bottom it's got directions for use on it also the ingredients which is a win-win the only thing that I don't see on here that I would recommend for coy I mean I checked the COAS they're spot on there they're great but the only thing I would suggest for coy I'm not seeing it's just because they have it on all their other products is just adding a QR code right under the packaging just so you guys as the consumers can quickly scan it with your cameras on your phone and then you can just verify because it is important that you always verify but let's be honest guys when you're buying from a company like coy CBD quality is of the utmost importance when they're in their manufacturing process to see simply do not have to worry about it so let's go ahead and give the coy healing bummer ago ooh you know I could smell that eucalyptus the lat or the the peppermint oil in there ooh and then the lavender you know I feel like I could smell it is it like some lemon I feel like I could smell a little bit of a oh there is lemongrass oil I was getting a little hits hints of lemon in there ooh there's even some cinnamon leaf oil in there which you know I think would be great for you know kind of like a sort of warming kind of tingling sensation because let's go ahead let's let's actually stop smelling it and actually try it for ourselves so I boom so as you could see guys just a thick little ol glob like that I mean depending on your large muscle groups you can you can adjust it so just like with all SAVs and CBD topicals when you apply it to that local area it'll only provide the localized relief so I recommend pairing I call it the two prong approach I recommend pairing a topical for really outside your body in those localized areas and then also using a CBD t-shirt such as the Wella C full spectrum MCT oil tincture so then you get relief outside with the topical and then inside your body which is the whole body relief using leveraging a topical soul all right so let's go ahead and I'm actually just going to I'm gonna rub this right on my I'm gonna do it on my elbow and also my shoulder so you guys can see so as you can see I'm rubbing it on ooh right when you start putting it on that ooh those essential oils really start to go to work mmm it smells incredible I mean you know just those aromatherapy benefits just from those essential oils like I'm relaxed already guys um you know I could this should be phenomenal to put on you know right before bed you know I mean that's not to say you could use this all during the day because you're not going to smell nasty like bengay it's just gonna be really refreshing and actually so I rubbed it in um and yes so I mean my skin is a little greasy but it's nothing like Vaseline but I mean I just rub I rubbed it in a lot you know you really want to get it in there lather it in there but man it made my skin so incredibly soft and I always get this wow this is really noticeable with the koi CBD healing balm the koi naturals Wow so right when I start rubbing it on I always get sort of like a tingling sensation like I feel like that's the phyto cannabinoids you know the CBD and other cannabinoids that are present in this formulation are really going to work and stimulating my endocannabinoids receptors because we do have them on the skin and that's why CVD topicals are becoming so so popular is because you got a local you've got a specific area of pain that you want to really you to relieve you just rub a the koi CBD healing balm right on it and wow I feel the tingling and like even my hand like you know I can feel it like it's kind of low greasy but honestly like I just rub it in my hand so there's no waste and my hand like I can feel it but it's definitely absorbing rather quickly like I don't see this like I wouldn't have a difficult time grasping things you know writing on stuff so if you're at work and you have some pain that's like some inflammation that's quickly that's a you just pull this out of your your desk you know that keeping the full-size one of your desk or even the travel size in your purse or your a backpack and then you just pull it out whenever you need to relief and wow that that is really really good it smells very refreshing which I I'm a huge fan of this smell don't get wrong it's not you know a lot of topicals out there you know with the especially the lavender you know I feel like they smell a little more on the feminine side of things but you know this this the lavender the ooh the lemongrass you can get that absolutely phenomenal smell so the effects that I'm experiencing so what you know my elbows been kind of bothering me you know I don't have like tennis elbow or anything but you know I kind of fell on it and so but it's actually you know the level of you know I was just kind of kind of hurt a little bit when I was moving it it was just kind of stiff but you know it's really moving I mean it feels like it's loosing it loosening up a little bit um you know the CBD will really start to it takes a little bit P absorbed I mean it does go into work right away um but if you're experienced a high level of pain you know I would definitely give it about 20 to 30 minutes I'm once you put it on to just have really gauge the effects to see if that's right for you but scent I you know I got to give this smell a 10 out of 10 it's very refreshing you know so like I said you know that peppermint oil so it really so once you apply it on you know it immediately starts going to work you know it's kind of like it's sort of like a warming sensation but it's not like you know it's not as crazy as icy hot at all it's very it's very very mild but I do feel the relief taking place and you know I'm actually going to do is a little bit of shoulder pain and this is always my issue especially back pain the shoulder and back pain because I work on a computer all day on there for at least 18 hours a day so my muscles are really tight and stiff and oh my goodness like my neck especially that oh yeah I'm gonna put a little bit more on my neck and oh yeah see guys that I already feel it starting to really sort of alleviate some of the pain and stiffness in my neck up because guys if you can feel my neck you know there's a whole bunch of knots and everything so I would love nothing more than to get a full sort of massage leveraging this koi natural CBD healing balm ooh I keep saying that it smells really good but it's super refreshing relaxing guys like once I put it on I just feel relaxed and also those essential oils or leveraging that aromatherapy so when you're inhaling that you're getting that aromatherapy and then the CBD and the other phyto cannabinoids and the formulation are also going to work you know fighting off that inflammation and another thing you know even if you don't have specific pain you can also leverage this healing balm as a moisturizer because I didn't touch on that my skin is very very soft and you know I have an issue on my neck and my back or my neck and right behind my ears get really really dry I don't know if you can see the redness but I think oh wow that yeah that healing bump I would apply to every where I mean I it says I would not recommend putting it on your face necessarily David say that right on the packaging just to avoid your face and eyes you know because if you can get that there's essential oils and stuff that are in the formulation into your eyes I could you know kind of burn but you know it does it really that cooling sensation janeshia lee is really really good and it's kind of like a cooling warming sensation it's kind of like a little bit of both you know I really did notice that once I put it on my neck you know I it's yeah definite I feel it moisturizing because my neck was so dry incredible moisturizer you know I'm loving the effects that I'm feeling initially now I got it I got a wait a little bit you know to fully gages so I'll probably come back and let you guys know and about you know twenty to thirty minutes to see how I'm feeling and then yeah we can touch base on that because I do want to always touch on the effects you know granite they're all gonna be different from what you and I experience but I think it's important for the sake of this review that I give you sort of some insight on the effects that I'm experiencing leveraging the koi healing balm what's up guys so you know it's about been about 20 or so minutes since I first applied on the koi healing balm so I played it on my shoulder and also my arm and then also my neck because I had that muscle stiffness you know and also some stiffness in my elbow um and also what I wanted to test is um I experienced some some dry skin behind sort of like my ears or upper neck area and let me tell you it took away the dryness I mean my skin feels incredibly soft and also let me touch on that in regards to how it feels um the greasiness that you kind of felt initially that i discussed when i first put it on it's completely gone my skin is just looking healthy supple and just very very smooth looks very shiny smells good still on those essential oils that i listed off are still kicking and strong but yeah i was really kind of worried because i've experienced that way stabs where there's an overly greasy miss with it after an extended period of time and i simply don't like that because you know especially if you're at work and you got to play that on you got crap all over your hands and i hate you know wiping it on stuff because that's just a waste of the CBD so as you saw with the what I do with the koi CBD healing balm is rubbed on the elbow then rubbed it on my arms my neck and then also the any excess and just rub it into my hands and my hands don't feel greasy they're just incredibly soft and smooth so nicely done on that so I did what kind of want to um you know come back pause the video and come back and let you guys know sort of how the effects the effects that I was experiencing you know but about 20 minutes or so in so very very solid on that core I'm super impressed they definitely eliminated my concern with it being overly greasy but also like this stiffness in my neck you know it's still sword it's not like CBD isn't a miracle you know but it is in a sense but for me you know the pain is still there but the soreness and the overall like stiffness has really been subsided so I just feel like I have greater range of movement in my neck and it doesn't really hurt I don't feel like I just have like massive knots in my neck so nicely done and you know I'm definitely going to be reaching for this coin natural CBD healing balm the next time I have a migraine you know rub it right on my neck area and then about like my upper neck right at the bottom of my sort of head and then also leverage our tincture and I really think that would be a match made in heaven you know that's just one of the uses that you can use for the koi Naturals CBD healing balm flavor or scale of 1 to 10 that I would give it just based off the smell alone 10 out of 10 no doubt about it and then the effects that I'm experiencing you know my neck I feel like my neck is the one problematic area in my back that I feel the inflammation really kind of being subsided a little bit you know the pain still there but it's definitely it's providing me a level of relief that I would be happy with um especially if you're at work or something where any level of pain you know if you can mitigate that any even just a minut amount I think that's a win-win especially if you're in a work environment school environment where that can really kind of deter your focus so you know on the overall effects and I'm feeling you know sort of the well the skin sort of nourishing benefits that I got one just based off the softness my skin feel because it's been on my arm for you know about 20 minutes now to 2025 minutes my hands they just feel really soft smell great but they're not greasy at all you can pick something up and also my skin it's not greasy but I will say it's very very shiny and it's very very moisturized so that's great um you know being out here in Colorado it's a very dry climate so if you live out in a dry climate as well such as Colorado not in Arizona or something this would be very good just for the moisturizing benefits but the pain relief and the overall benefit and experience that I get rating it on a scale of one to ten I got to give that an eight out of ten this is by far one of my all-time favorite CBD topical as well and this in this instance a CBD salve it is my favorite one absolutely you know very solid score the packaging is beautiful I mean cool you guys knocked it out of the park on this one everything you need you know is right on the box the only thing that are the label two blocks beautiful packaging even more beautiful but you know the

fitness wellness and all things CBD this is my office this is my temple and this it's all green TV is it a banger what's happening this David it's all green TV now other people worry if taken see buddy is gonna make them grow fail a drug test well we talked about it in other videos I thought proofs in the pudding so what have I done over the last 10 days I've been taking see 20 50 milligrams every single day and here's what happens now I want to show you that I've completely clear system beforehand so I've taken a test in advance we're gonna check back in the overlay so you can see that you can see I'm being completely honest I'm clean as a whistle so we've got on the under cameras on the best angle so this is the multi screen drug test can test for many different things I'm gonna dunk in here for just 15 seconds so I'm just gonna so there you go that's my piss on a jar so two lines means negative so let's find out over the next 10 days if taking CBD we're gonna use sample vial for no fail so it's not branded yet you'll see if broad-spectrum CBD can cause you to have all failed drug tests that's it so that's it this was the benchmark this was me introducing myself as an absolute weirdo let's find out what happens when we take CBD oil we use 500 milligram what do you think 10 days well we found a drug test so I doubt right so day one go ahead I'm branded bottle for a no-fail CBD we're gonna take one full pipette to 10 more bottle 500 milligram in that means 50 mg per day which is generally in good allowance to take per day part of this testing option we're taking these drops to see whether or not will we favor drugs tests of CBD so just so you know we could do 10 days Nora okay Google what's the date today it is Wednesday the 14th of August 2019 there you go so this is day 1 I think I want [Music] [Music] 25 20:19 what [Music] so got this little bad boy here this is a drum turf the actually test for loads more things than just CBD doesn't necessarily test for THC and this is the thing people worry about is see video oil will bring up the THC metabolites that's what shows up on a drugs test and if you work in an engineering industry nursing medical science police force whatever the last thing you wanted to be pulled up for a CDT compulsive drug test to get them in the forces and sharp like that the THC if you haven't ever had a split or haven't been smoking weed that's the last and once you can use basic CBI so we wanted to show that RC videos see videos that we work with as flexi we need our remedy it's even a dispensary use the same source it's broad spectrum CVD that means it's been filtered for today from from the source and i want to do a little turn they test to show you whether or not it comes up on a drug test and i'm going to show that it doesn't what it's hoping if you see this video didn't come up on the drug test i want to go for a piss I'm going to take a wife otherwise technically a sexual-harassment to get anyone else to fill me I can correspond to to just shake your home health drug test kit mean tampered with right one step so that's before don't give the piss for 10 to 15 seconds and then we read it in five minutes there's the tester as you can see we're looking for this one here at THC [Music] and we'll leave that for five minutes so I've already seen it was all come for anyway it doesn't wait five minutes generally but if the second line comes forever that means is negative which is an absolute relief I'm gonna show you here I'm gonna check on the camera can actually see it it is the second from the left see th see to try and bring it down this is really hard to try and do it while focusing on the camera you can see bring along TC warmly cocaine is quite faint but yeah there you go so you can take your CBD for last ten days taking 50 milligram every single day 500 milligram ball that was the broad spectrum CBD oil from Fleck CBD so if you do sports and your industry then you worried about drug tests or it's showing up for THC test cannabis tests what CAC is there you go 10 days that's what happened didn't shove the drug test I wouldn't fail a drug test so now you know

and a half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis we're going to throw it in the crock-pot below and we're gonna let it sit in there for about four to five hours go ahead and strain it through the cheesecloth basic simple straightforward take that half ounce of flour throw it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes grab a smoke if you'd like forty minutes later that should be looking a nice golden-brown perfect just about ready let's go ahead and turn our crock-pot on to low using organic unrefined coconut oil eight ounces add the half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis stir and cover leave on low for 3 to 5 hours I did four hours stir occasionally double layer the cheesecloth for a finer strain squeeze or press it to make sure you get all that oil out infusion complete overall in terms of the process I'm liking this method the best it's nice you don't have to worry about keeping an eye on the flame if you have a gas stove top like me even an electric range you still got to keep an eye because it might get too hot and you don't want to burn anything that ease of the crock-pot I am feeling and I'm excited to use this coconut oil and some nice gummies you know I love doing it in a smoothie I'll do a video about that even though it's really simple just to show you how I do it let your imagination run wild throw this coconut oil whatever your heart desires thanks for

educate all of you on a few topics the first one that we will be covering is bee balm formulas and my wish is that you have the tools that you need to be able to share these formulas with as many people as possible and positively impact as many lives as possible all making an incredible living for yourself you can search high and low anywhere in the world and you will never find products like we have for you here at tan way and that is because what we bring to you RV bunk formulas combined with CBD be bong formulas are defined as secret formulas these secret formulas have been handed down through my family lineage from generation to generation the be bank formulas are rooted in the teachings of the great doctor hojin who is from korea he's a renowned herbologist who is known to have written one of the greatest medical encyclopedias of all time which is called the domi volcom this book is actually currently being studied by some of the top medical schools in the world because of the incredible information that he has to share regarding the human mind body and how to have the most optimal condition possible RB among formulas or once only available to the royal court this is due to the fact that they were so powerful that the royal court didn't want to share them so this is an incredibly special moment because for the first time in the United States and really in the world here at can away we are sharing our be bunk formulas on a scale that has never been done before so what is a be bunk formula you can really break it down to three simple key principles the first principle is a be bunk formula first and foremost has to be secret it has to have been handed down from generation to generation through a family lineage number two and one of the most important things that we have to understand is that be bong formulas are proper formulations anyone can take a whole bunch of herbal ingredients and put them into a formula and call it an herbal formula this is not necessarily herbology true or biology is the ability and the knowledge and the wisdom to take those herbs and understand them so completely you know how to take each herb put it into a formula and make it so that is completely bounced so although each herbal ingredient has amazing functions when you put it together that's when the miracle happens a proper formula has the ability to go into each person and because of the knowledge and the wisdom of that formula and every herbal ingredient they're able to go inside and correct all the imbalances in that person when you have balance it means that everything flows everything functions and that really is the key to anti-aging an optimal health which leads me to the third principle which is it works for every individuals condition regardless of your age regardless of whatever imbalances you may have regardless of the lifestyle you choose to live the significance of a proper herbal formulation is it is able to rebalance ones Chi and that is the key to anti-aging and optimal health so of all the important points that we went over today about beep on the most important thing to remember is that these formulas work when you hand out these formulas you will see the difference and you will hear all the amazing testimonies that will come and I promise you they will and I can't wait to hear about him", "Y87yxZsDQTs": "hello everybody and welcome back your burger canvas and this week's video I'm gonna teach you how we make CBD oil here on the farm but first if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button if you've already subscribed thank you very much so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil here on the farm so obviously first thing you're gonna need is CBD hemp flour now we grew this all year and this is about 3 and 1/2 ounces now they recommend magic butter machine which is what we're going to use they recommend 7 to 14 grams per cup of oil your choice of oil but the oil that I like to use here is MCT oil now this is fractured coconut oil to pretty much just have no coconut flavor and mono saturated fats what's cling on to CBD so those are pretty much the two ingredients in our CBD oil the next thing you're gonna want to do is after you weigh out your flour and you figured out how many cups of oil you want to use now typically I do two cup run and I will use about 12 grams of flour per cup I just like that ratio seems to work really well so you weigh it out on your scale and then you decarboxylate it now magic butter machine has its own decarboxylated flow and I put it in the oven at 250 degrees to 230 degrees really depends on where you want it how fast you want it low and slow I like to go with my D carb and you're gonna want to do it for twenty to thirty minutes so that's what we're gonna start off with so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil okay guys so now we're going to turn on the oven so first thing we're gonna do for our oven here is we're gonna hit the bake button we're gonna bring it down to 230 degrees Fahrenheit then we're just gonna hit start and now while it's preheating I'm gonna weigh out my flour and put it on this aluminum Flo so I'll be right back okay now that we've made our little container for our flour and today we'll be using our by ox flour that we grew this summer the next thing I'm going to do now that this is all good I'm gonna cover it up and more aluminum foil so you want to make sure that it's nice and covered because you want to keep all of those proteins in there and you really don't want to lose a lot of that flavor so to speak from the bud and then once we do that I'll take a knife it's almost like making a pie you know you're gonna want to cut a couple holes in it and that will let out any kind of moisture so now we're going to stick it in the oven for about 25 minutes okay so now we have decarboxylated our CBD hemp flour which is right here so this is pretty much what it looks like it just gets a little bit darker nothing crazy but it activates that CBD a and then what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all that in here so that was approximately 24 grams of CBD hemp flour now what we're gonna do is we're going to add two cups of her MC tu Oh now the reason why I prefer MCT will is because it's just the best carrier for this CBD you can use coconut oil and you can use olive oil and a bunch of other oils but MCT really holds it the best and it has the most mono saturated fats per serving so there is our two cups of MCT oil we're just going to add it right into the machine get that all in there okay and that's it guys with the magic cutter machine it's a set it and forget it so now we're going to go ahead we're going to walk this thing on we're going to plug it in okay now if you can see the buttons here and I'll try to pull it up a little closer to the camera you're going to be able to see these flashing buttons first you're gonna want to go to a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do it for four hours because this is an oil tincture and that's it now it's good to go and you'll see the light starting this is starting the process of making the CBD oil and the great thing is guys there's no food processor there's no mess you can do this a whole bunch of other ways but I really love my magic butter machine because this is a no mess set it and forget it thing so we'll see you in four hours and you'll be able to see the final product alright everybody so the CBD oil is complete now I didn't catch it in time but the whole thing illuminates like blue and red and pink and once it's done it'll start flashing so this thing is ready to take out so now we're going to go through the process of extracting our oil from the material in the magic butter machine so as you can see it is all over the place in here and so what you should have is a spatula of some sort I just have a silicone one which is what a lot of people use I guess for this machine I don't think it's necessary but what you're going to do is you're just going to try to get all this material off the butter machine as best you can you know you can drive yourself crazy trying to get it all off but you want to get the majority of it a lot gets up underneath it so that's pretty good for me then what you're gonna do is you're going to kind of like scoop the sides you're gonna want to get it all in there okay so we are probably going to get less than two cups so I'm gonna get my bigger because you're gonna have to take this now magic butter gives you they call the love glove and the micron bag this is to extract all the plant material so you want to carefully get all that will in there now you use spatula again get as much of it in there as you can you can see down in there there's still quite a bit so that's what I'm trying to get out right now it smells awesome you guys alright that'll be good enough for now so next thing you're gonna do is gonna want to get your your silicone glove on your dominant hand so for me I'm a right-handed person you need to pick it up and you're gonna squeeze that bag this is the best you can you don't want to extract all that oil out of there if you can see it still coming out of there okay and that's it there's your CBD oil and I'll show you the finished product here so that is MC t CBD oil now what I'll do after this is I will put it in a bottle like this food-grade you can buy these at Walmart or Dollar Tree for for less than a dollar and then I will use it to fill these cvd vials so that's it for today's video if you like the

"jWXqzj_TP0Y": "cbd oil was marketed as skin care products for everything from acne to wrinkles in any case is any advantage possible let's get into some facts about cbd oil and skin care what is cbd oil cbd otherwise called cannabinoids is a non-intoxicating component of marijuana or hemp plants cbd is removed as a powder and is normally blended in with oil like olive hemp or coconut all of which improve application and viability hence the name cbd oil cbd oil and skincare won't get you high because it doesn't have the mind-altering properties of marijuana's thc content it's extracted from the blossoms and leaves of the hemp plant whose thc's are standingly low it's important to realize that cbd is not the same thing as hemp seed oil which is another great ingredient for the skin the two are regularly advertised interchangeably however cbd always concentrated in cannabidiol and hemp seed oil only contains trace amounts of cannabidiol if any research has established that acne is an inflammatory condition albeit different components trigger acne we realize that anything you apply to the skin can decrease the irritation and help relieve skin this is where cbd comes in as some suggest it's likely to noticeably lessen breakouts especially acne related redness numerous studies have demonstrated that cbd oil has mitigating benefits when applied to the skin this makes cbd a solid ingredient for acne prone skin while it's calming benefits help responsive skin look and feel good research also shows that cbd can possibly decrease excess sebum oil production possibly due to its balancing effect on the flow of skin's oil however most researchers contemplating cbd conclude that the more definitive logical examinations are expected to affirm these underlying results since it originates from a plant it's not surprised that cbd oil has antioxidant properties the antioxidants in cbd topical use helps lessen the visible signs of aging by neutralizing free radical damage and decreasing the appearance of inflammation cbd anti-aging creams noticeably reduce issues like wrinkles skin dullness and reddy skin tone another advantage of cbd oils that has been found to have huge alleviating properties its significant skin calming and skin normalizing effects can help limit issues identified with skin sensibility including redness and reactivity since all skin types are

products all of which can make utilizing cbd simpler like with different types of cbd there are a few disadvantages to be aware of for instance bioavailability and ingestion speed can defer like of oral cbd topical cbd isn't the most ideal choice if you want to absorb as much cbd as possible absorption rates aren't great and it could require some investment for the cbd to arrive at top concentration using these products can be inconvenient and in the case you're not used to utilizing skin care bombs and other topical products becoming accustomed to rubbing a cbd treatment gel or

those effects that we were talking about shall we okay so I got the fact sheet out and this is for the CBD part okay you've probably heard old CBD is illegal not so CBD effects and the CBD oil contained in it are illegal for the following reasons non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 step one there have biomass which means basically their crop comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security because we did cover it it is imported we only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants mm-hmm products meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it must be industrial hemp and contained less than 0.3 percent THC last but not least our products are considered exempt from the CSA and DEA drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule one drugs then you're like wow so yeah don't use available haha extracts from the stuff stocks of EU European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it guys legal alright long as it comes from Europe as long as it's industrial and as long as it meets everything else which it does you're good good now you're like well okay that covers the CBD what's MCT though got some facts on that too alright so MCT or what is it is MCTS our medium chain triglycerides okay and there are fatty acids that your body can quickly and easily break down and convert to usable energy okay MCT oil is often recommended for people with medical disorders related to absorption such as Crohn's disease because of their ability to help your body make the best in the nutrients it takes in they added MCT to the CBD tincture primarily to ensure that you get the maximum benefit from the CBD that you're taking okay so basically the MCT stuff makes you absorb alright all of the CBD goodness in there which is awesome is CBD plus MCT oil used for a ketosis or part of a ketogenic diet swap pages one of the main reasons MCT oil is used on its own as a nutritional supplement is to keep your body healthy absorbing all the nutrition you throw at it a side effect is to keep your body in ketosis essentially that's a metabolic state where your body gets energy from fats instead of carbs this promotes a healthy metabolism and it has been linked in some

either bought both products and one works better than the other whatever it may be but I'm here to talked about full spectrum and why it is proven to be better for most of all of our customers typically whenever you're dealing with a full spectrum product you have a variety of cannabinoids within the implant that you're giving within our oil with an isolate CBD product all you are getting is straight isolate so all the entourage effect does not come into play whenever you're doing with the CBD isolate product so as I'm pulling this poker chip you see every single other cannabinoid that's coming with it that is a full-spectrum product but if you are looking at a isolate product this is what its gonna look like so as you can see only one cannibal is coming coming with it and it is just CBD so that is the easiest way to really describe the differences between CBD full-spectrum and CBD pure isolate products so if you guys ever do have any questions we're always here here at

medical strains at number five there is CBD crack auto which has a relatively equal balance of CBD and THC at around five to ten percent we like this one in particular because of its high heels fourth on the list is CBD critical mass which is an unusual name for a cannabis plant that is not designed for massive highs this is a genetic 80/20 ratio of indica to sativa which again provides a nicely balanced cbt to THC ration of once or one at between five and ten percent concentration at number three we have royal medic which can produce up to 12% CBD and THC at around 10 percent raw medic comes from two Spanish strains including one eater lacrimosa which is renowned for its purported medical properties and high yield in second place comes a strain similar to raw medic and that is CBD Otto blackberry Kush for those wanting to maximize the benefits of CBD without the excessive highs of too much THC this is one of the few cannabis plants where the percentage of CBD exceeds that of THC at eight and one cent respectively at number one and by far our best choice CBD cannabis plant is Auto cannabis light which has a remarkable 1 to 20 THC to CBD ratio with an approximate 0.5 concentration of THC yet an excellent 10 percent concentration of CBD it's a bit of a no-brainer if you are looking to grow a cannabis plant for medical as opposed to euphoric reasons perhaps you have a CBD

doctor reviewed articles on all things cbd and cannabis anyway back to the topic of using cannabis for sleep with the meteoric rise of cbd products in recent years one of the most common questions we hear on a day-to-day basis is should i be using cbd or thc to help me sleep we know from published studies that thc can act as a strong sedative in fact a study published in the journal of pharmacology biochemistry and behavior found that the more thc a strain has the better it will work in helping patients get to sleep the reason for this researchers suggest is the way thc interacts with cb1 receptors in the brain however this same interaction is also what's responsible for the psychedelic high that thc produces for many users a potent high can result in increased levels of anxiety and paranoia which is exactly what you don't want when you're trying to get some quality rest another issue with using thc for sleep is that it may have a negative long-term effect on circadian patterns a person with normal sleeping habits will start to feel sleepy based on their circadian rhythm which is essentially an internal clock that tells us when we need to rest when it's time to sleep the body produces hormones and chemicals that help settle the central and peripheral nervous systems into a state of rest under long-term influence of thc chemicals like melatonin can actually be overproduced meaning that you start to feel sleepy in the middle of the day this of course can entirely throw off the body's circadian rhythm and can result in erratic non-productive sleep patterns using cbd for sleep on the other hand appears to have fewer negative effects instead of acting on cb1 receptors in the brain cbd appears to work on 5ht1a receptors these receptors influence the body's reaction to the presence of serotonin which is the precursor to melatonin the body's natural sleep compound in a recent study published in the permanente journal researchers observed that cbd produced improved sleep in nearly 70 percent of subjects suffering from inadequate sleep patterns a separate study published in the current psychiatric reports suggests that cbd holds promise for rem sleep behavior disorder as well as excessive daytime sleepiness for these reasons it appears that cbd-based cannabis and hemp products may hold the upper hand among patients that are trying to improve their nightly sleep patterns it's also worth pointing out that cbd helps tremendously with things like pain and anxiety both of which can have a major impact on short and long term sleep quality of course finding a quality reliable cbd product to use for sleep is no easy task in today's oversaturated market whatever you do be sure to look for a reputable brand that offers verified lab reports with each product they sell this will allow you to get realistic unbiased information on what's actually in the cbd product you're using also be sure and take your time read reviews do plenty

a little hip pain get a little shoulder pain i'll let you know if it does anything for that or if it reduces any anxiety for me my initial thoughts after a day of use with these products let's start with the sinus plumber the sinus plumber is a good nasal spray uh it definitely cleared out my sinuses probably even a little bit better than the over-the-counter stuff in the store does even the strong stuff so i think i'm going to continue using this version of the sinus plumber i don't know about the the hemp oil if it did anything different but it definitely drained my sinuses a lot better than the other products that i've been using all right also my neighbor's gotta you gotta start mowing his lawn now all right now my neighbor's mowing the lawn and the ice cream man is around all right whatever let's let's get through this um hopefully this mic picks it up more than you hear the lawnmower in the background but yeah with the hemp cream i really enjoy the hemp cream it's got that cooling feeling i i use it again this morning right around the eye area i actually used it on my lower back last night right in that like sciatic area it helped me through the pain at night for that area so i like this i'm going to continue using this it's a little expensive so if you're using this i just i just wouldn't use so much of it i wouldn't be liberal with it just just rub your fingers over it just a little bit is all you need and then um yeah hopefully this is a better alternative than some of the the icy hot the icy hot kind of burns if i try to use it for pain and then you have some of the other stuff that's just cooling that maybe doesn't last as long i think this this lasts longer than the stuff i get over the counter these things right here definitely helped me get a better night's sleep i wasn't tossing and turning i actually slept throughout the whole night i think i went to bed early after taking these i don't mean too early i mean for early for me is anything past or like before midnight i'm an insomniac i'm i'm up till like two in the morning but these things help me sleep and not only do they help me sleep but actually i think it calmed my nerves down a bit so i was watching tv i was watching some youtube last night i fell asleep at an appropriate time i slept all night and i woke up at 9 00 am so i got plenty of sleep i woke up refreshed and then that's when i put on some of this hemp cream to to get me started for the day to try to reduce those headaches so yeah i would definitely recommend these if you want to pick these

supplement sector by storm the CBD market now worth more than sales of vitamin C and D combined made from an extract of cannabis that is legal and doesn't make you high CBDs effects aren't yet well researched but it's estimated 1.3 million people are already taking it for conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain leslie began taking CBD capsules for her pain and now runs this cafe in lancaster offering it in drinks and food i wish add a video to what i used to be like cuz you won't believe how I was yeah it's really really helped I think people just need to be aware that there are a lot of products out there that what there should be and you have to be careful where you're buying and what you're buying there's now blind testing by the body which represents the CBD industry's major players has revealed just how big a problem that is when this cannabis testing laboratory analyzed 29 widely available CBD oils only 11 of them were close to the potency that they claimed nine products were significantly stronger than claimed seven were significantly weaker including one costing ninety pounds which had no CBD in it at all and 15 contained other chemical compounds from cannabis which are controlled substances meaning those oils were technically illegal to sell I don't think a consumer can easily tell between what is a sort of cowboy firm and a reputable firm I think one of the things that we're looking towards with our policy report is that we would like a self regulated environment where there can be an equivalent of a kite mark standard where you know that if you buy a product with a certain kite mark on it it's been rapidly tested at an independent laboratory and it fulfills all of the required requirements of what industry says good looks like and the regulatory bodies agree with the government says we have always been clear about the legal position on CBD we advise a cautious approach to these products and companies should seek legal advice to ensure compliance with the law and ensure products are safe what's called a twin head filler the bottles come down here but manufacturers who are trying to comply say they urgently need a level playing field to rid the industry of cowboys how that lurks whether that's a new agency or whether that means being a licensed producer you know meeting a whole range of different criteria then that's what we need you're prepared to do that to get your business very much so I've invested a lot of money in this company and we've got a fantastic business here and it's you know difficult when you hear of stories like that where you know unsafe products are being put on the shelves even though the benefits and risks of taking CBD aren't at all clear it's still one of the fastest growing categories of well-being products yet reputable manufacturers are crying out for help from the authorities to ensure people do get something that is legal safe and contains what they've paid for Catherine Jones

products it's scented with relaxing herbal oils and smells really good again I'm Alex from the CBD oil source at WWE CBD oil source calm please visit our site for more products and information and have a great day thank you", "WOTXvwksUAU": "hello everyone today we're going to be making lotion we're going to be taking you through it step by step the first step that we're going to do is we're going to fill our sink full of very strong bleach water everything no matter if it's clean will actually pre wash it so everything goes in there with dawn antibacterial detergent and bleach everything gets bleached you want to put out paper towels and you want to put everything out on those to dry um then it doesn't matter if they completely Drive it's good to let them drip good then you will take ninety one percent alcohol hang on in a spray bottle and you will then spray everything down and dry it with paper towels the alcohol makes contact with the water and it causes you to be able to get every bit of water out of your containers and then you want to set those not under a ceiling fan and in a clean sanitary area on top of your paper towels until you're ready to use them and it's sort of good if you can do this ahead of time and leave time for evaporation okay here is an example we've just washed this pot it has a residue of water in it and we've added alcohol see it doesn't have the shiny appearance of any moisture the alcohol causes the water to be completely removed all right then we're going to set our jars out and I've got a little clip showing you exactly how to take care of your jars okay I have my jars here fresh from the plastic bag I made sure that I had alcohol with my hands we keep 91% alcohol in a spray bottle now I'm going to get over the top of them and I'm going to spray them then we'll let that evaporate and then these jars are ready for the lotion to be added all right and then after we've taken care of our jars let them set over there and and evaporate then we're going to measure it by our oils all of your hard all will go in a double boiler and be melted all of your liquid oils that means they're liquid now they don't have to be melted will be measured and put into another container of the sanitary containers every time you touch something that is not sanitary you must rewatch your hands and we alcohol your hands okay all right so you will put your liquid oils in one container you'll put your hard in a double boiler if you're using stearic acid and I know you'll be using emulsifying wax you'll put those together into a pot those don't have to go into a double boiler but if you overheat them they burn if you if you let them cool down to cool before you add them to your lotion you just have little knobs of stearic acid and emulsifying wax floating all through your lotion so they have to be warm and melted when they go in your oils for emulsification all right so the first thing you will do get your liquids all in one poll your hard oils and your stearic acid emulsifying wax on the stove double boiler dereck acid in a pot and your massa fine wax in a good thick stainless steel maybe copper bottom pot those you will hate gently slowly because we don't want to diminish their values for skin by overheating them and while that's happening you're going to measure up your glycerin and vitamin e your preservative in separate little containers and any other ingredients that's needed I will be adding a recipe for the I'll be adding a recipe ingredients at the end of the video right now we're going to talk about safety safety safety we must keep our hands clean there's two rules of thumb put on gloves but then when I put on gloves and I touch my face I don't feel it I forget that I've done it I don't realize so I just keep scrubbing my hands and alcohol in my hands in bleach water and don't dish detergent is how I wash and then alcohol and using paper towels constantly through the process because if bacteria is in your oils and lotion when you put your preservative in there it's not it's already got something it's got to fight right there so we want to make sure that there's no bacteria or germs goes into our product so another example of that is when you have a brand new bottle of olive oil that's what you want to use to make lotion not one that you poured back some into when you were measuring to make soap you want to have a brand new block of shea butter brand new contain our cocoa butter if you're using it you want all your liquids to be fresh bottles that have not been opened and possibly poured back into or there are 3/4 of the way down you want fresh intake oils that you're just opening up we cannot have bacteria when we're working with lotion everything is sanitary as possible as fresh as possible is the way to go all right ok so now we're going to get to the process of mixing it all together but I do want to talk to you about your water when you're bowling your water your water has to boil for at least 20 minutes if there's going to be a vibration during that process so you want to put way more than what you need to boiling so that you'll have the right amount when you get ready to measure and even in the pot when you're measuring it into your lotion pot and you're going to make lotion I always put a little bit extra because once you put it in you just see the steam coming up carrying your water away so because of evaporation I always add just a little extra to my water pot all right let's start making lotion okay so now we are measuring the water into a bowl sitting on a scale and we're measuring out how much we need our bowl will not hold all of it if you can see the steam from evaporation occurring as we speak so that means water is dissipating from our Bowl as we're adding it so get that to a flat ounce so that's 40 point one will throw the point one in for our extra so we write down 40 so now we'll dump that into the ocean making pot set it back on our scale and so now we have 80 in our pot and we need how much 160 160 so as you can see she is measuring 240 and by doing a flat amount it's just easier to do on a calculator so she's going to go up to 40 each time there she goes she's going to write down 40 I'm going to add 40 to the calculator because we can't clean this because it's my phone so now we have 120 all right so we needed 20 30 40 50 60 so we need 40 exactly more and then we're going to put in two extra ounces for evaporation okay so 42 more - yep 42 and that's because we're using a large batch if you are using a small batch you would add less extra all right we have our melted oils they are warm we have our liquid oils they are room temperature we have our vitamin E and our glycerin and our two preservatives that I use we have our water over here in the water pot and we're ready to go okay the first thing I'm going to add is my hot oils being careful I've kept these on low on the stove on warm excuse me once I got to melt it to being sure checking with a thermometer not to get them too hot so that I don't diminish their skin print properties then the next thing is our room temperature oils if you're doing a liquid oil only recipe you need to heat these oils but because the water is warm or hot and the oils are hot there was no need to heat these oils alright now we'll need the stearic acid I've kept get on the stove on low excuse me warm once I got them melted because it goes back to a hard state in seconds all right you'll pour that in and there goes lotion sit it back over there on the stove but off of a hot I jump and turn that off now if we look now we have little floaties of oil floating on the top of our surface see those sometimes you have to add more emulsifying wax then you originally thought you would need if that happens you just add a little bit of time until you get it fully emulsified but you also have to process this with your stick blender for a good period of time and so it was time to be watching and waiting for unsupportive five or unmod okay now we wait we're going to wait and as this cools we're going to keep an eye on the temperature but as this cools we will watch this for temperature and we want to get it down to 160 degrees for our essential oils and 140 degrees before our preservative goes in now I'm using unrefined organic shea butter and unrefined organic cocoa butter sometimes you will have things that will float to the top like little husk particles and things of that sort so this is a good time to get those out as well so as I'm watching for the temperature I will watch for things like that as well okay guys I'm going to bring you in it might be difficult for you to see but there is some floating oil cocoa butter particularly is one that's very difficult to work with for full of most of vocation okay so I've added one ounce of stearic acid and see how it goes back to a solid very easy I think let me pull this back now okay right there it's going back to a solid so you have to be really cautious with this once you ain't but you can't overheat it it burns I like to definitely have my stick blender on it when I'm putting it in to a already made lotion for the bulk of it not to go flat to the bottom set that on an off I've added an extra ounce if you're doing much smaller batches of course it would be much smaller amount all right we will measure our temperature again we're well under 160 so we could add our essential oils at this point right here is 140 and we're sitting right on it we're not going over so we're ready to put our preservative in so I'm going to go ahead and do that step okay so now we're going to add our vitamin E and glycerin after the temperature has been brought down some and I just like to not put it in when it's super hot and I use paraben and formaldehyde free preservative I try to keep things as natural as possible so jarm prevention because I'm not using what's considered a full broad-spectrum preservative trying to go more natural I'm not not using a preservative I'm just not using one that is acid rain to most of us and that's me pacifically I break out okay now I'm going to add my essential oils okay we're under 160 and now we're going to add our essential oils I'm using tumeric in this one so it's going to turn my lotion yellow being very cautious with how much tumeric you use if you use it giving things a thorough beating with your stick blender did you see that last little drop that fell out of my dish all right giving everything a thorough blending is very important okay so now we're going to fill our pour our pour spouts okay I bought these from a you can get these from Amazon I forget where I bought these and then somebody told me you can get them from Amazon um I like to use something with a handle that I can hang on the side because I'm going to fill this and then hand this over to b2b take it from that side so it won't drip on our clean dishes over there alright and for for us to start filling our containers over on the other table but then I can just hang that and it's waiting on me for when I'm ready to refill more so there you go don't leave any in there because it'll start thickening okay so we're tilting slowly bringing it back to level and going all the way to the fill line okay now to prepare our lids we're going to prepare our lids on a clean surface that has been bleached and alcohol and dried with paper towels fresh paper towels just opened up the plastic off of the roll cleanliness is next to germ free lotion mm-hmm all right so we're going to get them like that we're going to take our pump bottle and we're going to miss them just like that and then we're going to set them to let that evaporate an air dry okay here is our beautiful creams all laid out and ready to go these will sit overnight here on the table don't add the lids if you add the lids Moisture will come up and get on the bottom of the lid and then fall down on top of your jar and you'll have a water layer so they need to sit overnight until room temperature and then you add your lids alcohol your jars and add your labels all of these jars are four ounce jars I don't make bigger than four ounce jars because I use a more natural preservative if you want to use a broad-spectrum preservative then you can do larger jars okay I got just a little bit of the cream from the bottom of the container this is my night cream so this is heavier than my day cream of course 100% natural when it comes to know preserve I mean no preservatives that are full broad-spectrum with formaldehyde and parabens and no Vaseline petroleum fillers 100% oil that kind of thing okay so this is our heavy cream it'll take a little bit to soak in it'll lay on the skin just for a few minutes before it soaks in because it's meant for really dry skin I also make a day cream I'm going to give you the recipe for the day cream okay we are on wholesalesuppliesplus.com this is their batch calculator I'm hoping this video comes out good off of my screen I'm going to print the recipe and also add that clip to the actual just of the paper so if you can't read this we will add that in a moment so I talked to you the fact that we were going to do the day cream recipe so when you first get on the page this is the wholesalesuppliesplus.com you will add the the name of your recipe so this is day cream okay then we want to add our ingredients and we have shea butter coconut all those get melted olive oil can go in without being melted as long as you have melted oils you're adding in so at room temperature olive oil we have our water then our vitamin E and our glycerine our stearic acid our emulsified wax our preservative that goes in at a hundred and forty degrees so I wrote preservative 140 and essential oils that go in at one hundred and sixty degrees so I wrote essential oils one hundred and sixty just as a reminder for y'all guys and then we have here it shows you though that we have managed to put in enough numbers to make it all the way to a hundred you can add notes as into what essential oils you added or any of the cooking or tips so that you who excuse me to remember all right so we have our shea butter at 4% this is a light day cream you would increase the oils and decrease the water to make this a heavier lotion so we have 4% shea butter we have 2% coconut oil and we have 2% olive oil well let's say you'd like to add avocado right avocado right here and take a point from your olive oil since it's a liquid oil and add it right here so then you'd have 1% avocado and 1% olive oil on your water it's 75 point 4 excuse me 75 point four so the reason we do that is because on our vitamin E we have point three and our glycerine we have point three that equals up under the ounces category at being point three on your scales now if you would like to decrease the vitamin E or increase the glycerin or vice versa you would make sure you put your point in or you're going to end up with a whole one percent which is too much do your point here change it and then just decrease or add to the point four on the water remember we are adding slightly more water whoo excuse me slightly more water than it's called for because of evaporation just a little bit all right so then we're going on down to our stearic acid we're at 2% and our emulsifying wax we're at 9% now let me discuss that with you every company has a different percentage of emulsifying wax required to emulsified oils so I buy mine from Soper's choice if I use cocoa butter sometimes I have to increase it to 10% so but I know that I have seen on I think Brambleberry an emulsifying wax that it only required I think four percent to emulsify oils so you know yeah I might be wrong oh that it's been a long time but I do know that different companies have different you know how much is required to be used to emulsify your oils remember your step to wait and watch for floating oils to rise to the top that did not get emulsified blend well in case you didn't blend well good enough the first place if it happens again that they float up add more emulsifying wax while it is hot your preservative one percent I do not know of a preservative out there that requires more than 1% and some of them only require a half a percent but you will find a lot of wishy-washy answers as to how much preservative you can you should use on a particular price they'll say well it depends on your recipe it depends on your recipe I found that 1% always makes me happy and always takes care of everything alright on essential oils 160 I have put this in at 4% 4% is safe for everybody but children I pregnant women so if you wish to use 2% it's considered safe for children and for women depending of course then 2 on the type of essential oil you use if you add peppermint of course we're not going to put that on babies or fragile skin or you know blah blah blah especially you know 4% peppermint would be too much too you've got to limit that that's just too much of a irritate a skin irritant same thing you don't put citrus essentials in here lemongrass is not a citrus my favorite ones is rosemary lemongrass lavender and tea tree that's my favorite ones in lotion and I add more lavender than I do lemongrass I just a little bit of lemongrass and because lemongrass is over what overwhelming rosemary is about a middle of the road it's not as not as weak in scent as lavender when it comes to sticking in your lotion but it's no strong live aggress lemongrass is very overwhelming and will overtake the smell of your soap tea tea tree can only be put in at 1% in a lotion because that's all that's safe if a person rubs it over their entire body and a lotion is meant to rub on the entire body and even if you're selling it as a facial lotion people might rub it all over them so stick to 1% unless you want to put warnings on your labels all right so 1% is all that safe for tea tree for something you're going to rub all over your body ok so we've got 4 percent 1 percent 9 percent 2 percent point 3 point 3 7 point 4 - 2 & 4 now if we wanted to make this a night cream a heavier cream we would double the oils and reduce the water air we could also double the vitamin E double the glycerin but the rest of this would pretty much stay the same ok but this here now and on this on your lavender at 4% you can add a touch more lavender it's one of the most benign essential oils even if you're doing 2% you can go over a little bit you know with lavender okay so anyway so now how do we get these things to work because if I sit and take out my batch size volume and hit calculate look at all the zeros well let's say you want to make a 4 ounce tester bottle hit 4 and hit calculate and then you're gonna want to do it in grams because it's so tiny okay so there you can do a 4 ounce tester jar all right well let's say you want to do 25 for hours jars that would be a hundred ounces and you click calculate and there you go we've got 4 ounces of shea butter 2 ounces of coconut oil 2 ounces of olive oil seventy five point four ounces of water point three ounces of vitamin E and glycerine two ounces of stearic acid nine ounces of emulsifying wax one ounce of preservative and 4 ounces of essential all so there you go that's how you do it that's how you do it now uh-huh so now let's just take that and let's print it let me see there's a button for that print recipe and we got everything here where does the prop print this page it's not easy you got to go through a couple steps and hit print and there you go all right now if you just want to do you know four four ounce jars four eight twelve sixteen you could do 16 ounces calculate you see you just tell it how much you want debt what if you want to do this in pounds mark it over here in pounds but now it's gonna do 16 pounds you say and then there it is but I like the fact that you can look at it how much it needs to be how much you need announces pounds milliliters and Gramps because sometimes like let's do this here 100 oh I've lost my screen let's say I'm doing 56 ounces let's see if we can get some barriers calculate okay two point six nine well I'm just gonna bump it up to two point seven you see six 675 ounces I'm still on pounds point fifty-eight well I'm going to do point six you know I just I just try to even it out to what the scale would do when it's just too much of a variance then I look at the grams and I do grams for that one okay so there you go we'll put that back on ounces back on 100 I'm gonna hit calculate and there you go there's our recipe and I'm gonna take and and scan this for you and let you look at it", "WsI2zwisEH4": "hi I'm Caitlin Garvey and I'm with Delta separation now today I met watch that distraction here at Salt Lake City and right now what I'm going to talk to you about is the ethanol extraction process and I want to go over as much detail as possible as I can cover so I'm gonna start very first with kind of an overview of the process and I'm gonna compartmentalizes so you can look at the entire process basically in three large steps so the first being extraction this is achieved by our cup 15 or cup 30 systems the second being evaporation of the solvent and this is achieved by alcohol until systems or rotary evaporator as well and finally you have a distillation step and that is performed at our roll-film system which is behind me or a similar distillation setup now those are the three big primary steps to compartmentalize that a little bit further before I go into detail on these steps I want you to understand that there's to tertiary steps in between these three lines so between extractions our cup system and the falling film or evaporation what we need to do is we need to filter that solution so we're going to be removing out of particulates and in some cases even lipids in fact the second tertiary process happens between the falling film we evaporation and prior to distillation on the real film system here and that's decarboxylation which is the process of converting the acidic cannabinoids that the plant produces THC a CBD a into the ones that are useful for us as consumers and manufacturers is THC and CBD so that is the decarboxylation step and then usually the final step is a distillation as I said that produces a distillate so to go into detail here a little bit the first thing that happens is your biomass or your cannabis or Hamptons in put it into your lab what's very important is that you make sure this is milled and homogenized you don't want or batches to be inconsistent because this is harder to track data while process so most large-scale facilities the first thing they do is mill or grind and homogenize their batches so the first thing then once we've milled and homogenized is on our cup system we're gonna pack that biomass into a mesh bag then these bags are about 80 micron forest size and what happens in that biomass is packed into the bag and then frozen at this point I do want to make a distinction that ethanol processing overall can be done with one room temperature or warm solvent or ethanol but for most people in most labs it's most advantageous to do this cold so you need to chill your solvent most often to something around negative 40 degrees Celsius prior to extraction and this cold processing is also the reason we pre freeze our biomass prior to extraction so once we've had our bag packed we've got that biomass pre frozen and we're gonna perform my extraction so we've got our ethanol cold at that point in the cup system we put our bags in and we fill it with ethanol and we do an agitation this is the formal abstraction where the ethanol is gonna grab the THC the sea Dee Dee and the terpene compounds and this is very largely depend on the solvent temperature once that extraction or agitation is done the centrifugal process of the cup is then initiated and this spins that bag very quickly and uses that centrifugal force to remove the residual amounts of solvent from the biomass now once we've done that we have a solution here of ethanol and our cannabinoids are compounds we want our CBD and THC a actually in that example and at that point that solution needs to be filtered and another point that should be made here is that solution isn't fully saturated meaning it can hold more THC and CBD and because the evaporation process down the line is very energy intensive we want to make sure ethanol is it as saturated as possible so in most labs after that initial extraction what they'll do is they will really saturate that ethanol or they will use that same volume of ethanol to wash or extract multiple bags on a cup system for example so once that ethanol is fully saturated as I alluded to at the beginning here it needs to be filtered prior to evaporation and this is to remove particulate more than anything little bits of plant matter that were left behind from the extraction process so once we've filtered it through a nuclear funnel or lenticular filter of some sort at that point then we're good to move that on to the evaporation process which is going to occur in usually a rotary evaporator or Delta's equipment we have a fall in the film evaporator so this evaporation procedure essentially involves applying heat and vacuum to the system to get the ethanol to boil off the key concept here is that the ethanol is going to boil off but our cannabinoids are target compounds the things we want our CBD a THC a are not going to boil off at this point and we can collect them and REE collect our ethanol now as I alluded to at the beginning there that crude extract prior once we've collected it from evaporation prior to distillation we need to decarboxylate and what this is is it really boils down to just applying heat to that crude extract and this is most often done on a hot plate or in a large glass or steel reactor at scale what happens there is again the plant produces the acidic compounds thca and CBD a and what we want especially for consumers but prior to distillation as well as we want the non acidic form so this is THC and CBD the more recognizable cannabinoids so the decarboxylation process just applies just involves applying heat for a certain amount of time to get these acidic compounds to convert to their non acidic forms and then at this point we have a decarboxylated crude extract and this crude extract generally speaking is the Queen 60 and 70% potent or 60 or 70 percent by weight cannabinoids are CVD or THC and the final step in him is distillation and that's performed again on a machine like this one behind me this is the rolls mill distillation unit of deltas and what we're going to be doing here is very similar to the following film we apply even more heat and even more vacuum to boil off and separate certain compounds and at the end of this process we're left with what is very recognizable now in the industry and what we call distillate this distillate depending on if we started with CBD or THC biomass is approximately 90 percent or 90 percent in CBD or THC respectively in that distillate and then that cements the process some manufacturers will take that distillate and will isolate the cannabinoid compounds as well but primarily we have from biomass extraction filtration of the solution evaporation of the solvent decarboxylation of that crude extract and then a final distillation of the crude extract to end or result in a very potent cannabinoid distant", "ATvB4nB4ALs": "ah hi everybody sydney here welcome back to my channel today today i'm going to be going over the math on how to actually figure out how much thc how much thc or cbd is in your oil how potent it is um a lot of questions i know in the last video i posted honest let me be real with you guys really quickly i posted that video thinking maybe if i got lucky like 15 people would see it so it wasn't my best work just gonna put out there it was my best work a lot of you guys have not seen the video i got a lot of comments on it a lot of questions all the concerns mostly great comments so thank you guys for keeping it positive i appreciate that let me preface this by saying i'm not an expert i don't know all the answers i'm just a girl making cannabis oil in our kitchen just like a lot of you guys i do know a little bit of math on how to figure that out i know in the last video i said i was going to give you the math and i kind of tried to in the comments but you know it's easier to just see it done so that's what we're going to do today we're going to visually walk through this when i have my levo machine now levo corrected me that's how you pronounce it levo my level machine is sitting here i made a new batch of oil so we're going to be doing the math on this particular batch what i have in here essentially is a cup of coconut oil i infused five grams of cannabis into this oil it's very concentrated very dark in color i don't know the exact percentage of the flour i was using so i'm gonna just ballpark it in like the 15 range just because that's pretty average for cannabis so let's say it's 15 it's always good to also overshoot it a little bit especially if you're dealing with thc just so you don't really overdo that and then obviously you can trial and error the amount of milligrams on your own personal body to see where you're at before we continue to go make sure you subscribe to my channel thank you for liking this video and watching well thank you for liking it if you like it please like it thanks for watching and keep watching if you want to know how to decode and figure out how much thc or cbd you're actually consuming when you make your own oil let's freaking go y'all okay everybody so what i have here is my piece of paper a pen and then my phone over here is my calculator and let's just freaking go into this thing oh and hello let's just like take a moment and just look at the beauty look at her oh look at her so to start things out i'm gonna write down the amount of oil that i used so up here i'm gonna write one cup um of oil the amount of cannabis that i use which was five grams grams of cannabis canna and those are the two numbers i'm going to start with if you'd like to convert your grams to milligrams one gram equals a thousand milligrams you can write that on the side one gram equals one thousand milligrams that's just for further conversion um and if you want to find out like per tablespoon you can also convert that i don't know off the top of my head so i'm just going to keep going so from here i have my one cup of oil and my five grams of cannabis oh and i know that this is 15 let's say it's thc for the fun of it 15 thc if you're using a hemp flour you do the 15 or 20 or whatever percent of that in cbd is those are the numbers you need to start with those three numbers right there you have three numbers your amount of oil you're infusing the amount of cannabis that you're using in the percent of whether it's thc or cbd they're using into that oil to do that i multiply my five grams of cannabis times my .15 so because if you convert you move the percentage over two decimals and that converts it to the percent or to the decimal rather and that would equal because i can't do math five times point one five equals point seven five so zero point 0.75 grams of this whole 5 grams is actually my thc that's present in my cannabis so from here in my whole cup one cup of oil i'm now once i'm done infusing going to have 0.75 grams of thc so .75 grams of thc into my oil i want to convert this grams into milligrams so in order to do that i just cross multiply so i have my one gram at top per 1000 milligrams i cross multiply you get rid of the grams and so per one cup of oil i actually have and then i multiply these 0.75 times 1 000 i have 750 milligrams of thc so in this entire little guy right here because it's a full cup there is 750 milligrams of thc in here okay so if i want to know let's see i'm using this for baking per tablespoon let's say now i would just convert this into tablespoons so let me look up really quickly what how many tablespoons are a cup cup two tablespoon so there's one cup so let's write it up here in our conversions one cup equals 16 tablespoons so that's another conversion you should know one cup of oil equals 16 tablespoons i can again cross multiply cups to cups and then there's 750 milligrams of thc per i mean this was a long way around just like honestly just switching out the numbers but just so you guys are more visual with it 750 per 16 tablespoons and then i want to find out how much per one tablespoon one tablespoon at the top and we don't know this answer we don't know this answer that's what we're trying to figure out and then you have 750 milligrams per 16 tablespoons pretty much you want to make sure these are always on opposite opposite sides of the line so that when you cross multiply you can actually just um cross it out and that what's that's how you get your numbers i don't know i took math a long time ago this is just what makes the most sense to me hopefully i'm explaining it in a way that makes sense to y'all uh unfortunately i don't know if i am 750 oop 750 why can't i do this pretty much all you need to do is take 750 and divide it by 16 and that'll give you how much thc per one tablespoon so we're trying to figure out this number right here so 750 oh my god divided by 16. so there's actually 46 milligrams of thc in a tablespoon you can also further convert this and you know figure out if you're using a cup in like let's say your entire cup in a recipe and it makes eight slices then you can really go in deep and figure out how much cbd thc whatever is in your slice but other than that that's really the math um screenshot this i hope it makes sense to you guys i mean i made a video about it so again it's just a lot of cross multiplying a little bit of conversions with this up here and then really it's just this percent of whatever you're find trying to find th c cbd whatever it may be and making sure you just take that into account in your total amount of cannabis cool y'all and that's it i hope that that was really helpful if it wasn't if i confused you more i sincerely apologize i am not a mathematician i took math a long time ago i'm just trying to use what i learned in essentially middle school and applying it here but hopefully that explains things a little bit more if you like this video again please make sure to give it a thumbs up a like um if you didn't like this video whatever not sorry about it it is what it is you know i'm just trying to hear live life and make my freaking cannabis oily people so if you would like me to make something with this cannabis oil let me know in the comments below what you think i should make with it i tend to like to bake healthier things like paleo cakes and dairy free items and gluten free items that's kind of the stuff that i personally eat if you don't eat that stuff that's no big deal i literally do not care but also just let me know in the comments what you want me to make with this stuff because i'm planning on making oh actually i know exactly my sister's birthday is coming up if you're watching this in the very very very future it's already happened but maybe i'm gonna make her a birthday cake with it hope you guys enjoyed also levo thank you so much for providing me with this item if you guys haven't got yours all ready i'm obsessed with it i love using it it does make your place smell a little bit like cannabis but honestly in my opinion not as bad as like doing it in the stove top or in your own oven and it's freaking easy cleanup i just love how easy it is you can download an app you can control all the temperatures from your phone it's literally the best so if you're going to make the investment i highly suggest doing so if you want to buy one for yourself i'm going to link them down below so you can go purchase one i do not have a discount code just yet levo if you see this if you are watching i would love a discount code to give to my people so if that does happen and you're watching this again in the future i will update with the discount code below cool great y'all hope you all have a great day bye [Music] you", "n3EFvI1Ij4s": "[Music] hi there welcome back to the cannabis kitchen today we're actually going to make something a little more fun we're going to make some CBD oil back bombs so bath bombs with CBD oil are very relaxing even people that don't have pain issues or whatever really enjoy using them so let's get started what we're gonna do first is use this big bowl I like it to be a little bit flat just so I can reach better when I'm actually shaping the balls and you're gonna need this strainer I like to use a metal one I find the plastic ones break pretty easily on me to wait so we're gonna start off by running our dry ingredients right through this just so that there's no lumps and bumps that we have to get out later on it's just kind of a pain in the butt and that way we have good consistent back bombs so we're gonna start out by adding 2 cups of baking soda and we're just gonna run that right through use your hands it's not a big deal I always wear gloves I find the citric acid it's a little bit hard on my hands and just run that through get all the lumps through add your next ingredient so the next thing we're going to add is a cup of citric acid and this one is almost this consistency of like a fine salt so it does take sometimes a little more work to get it through the strainer but it gets through there and it's worth it in the end as you can see there's quite a few bumps and lumps and stuff in there so you want to make sure we get all that out and you meup with bumps at the end you can run as much of it through as you can if you have any leftovers you can throw them out but for the most part we've got all of it here so now we have other ingredients that aren't going to require the strainer but we have one more to do first and that is a quarter cup of every room powder obviously I buy it in large quantities because I make a lot of these but I have some linked because we're gonna run this through there now so all our dry ingredients are in here we're going to give them a good mix together and then we're going to add in a quarter cup of salt so the salt you can use is you can use Epsom salts you can use pink Himalayan sea salt you can use regular sea salt you can use dead sea salt sometimes the dead sea salt comes in pretty big granules and it kind of looks pretty but it's a little harder to get your hands on today I'm going to use fine pink Himalayan sea salt you can use this in your food too which is nice less sodium so we're gonna take that mix it around now if we weren't putting any color at all into these bath bombs they would it would be really pretty having this pink sea salt in here I don't know if you can really see it's got you can see all the little pink crystals in there but we're gonna add some color the air so I'm going to use this color I got from crazy colors it's a little tiny when I wasn't sure on the color so I just ordered a little one but um this is the royal blue this is from crazy colors and they do a very good job with their color it now color is really up to you you can use as much or as little as you want I don't think you need to go to bananas I'm going to use just shy of a half a teaspoon and we'll see how that looks they're very very concentrated so you generally don't need to use a whole lot which is nice so we're gonna just mix this all together it does look like a very pretty color it's gonna actually get a little bit darker once we wet put our wet ingredients in so you're just gonna mix this around until you don't see any white powder anymore just then we know that it's well mixed there we go okay so now we're gonna add our wet ingredients which would be CBD oil and scent so what I did I wanted something a little bit more earthy so I used a half of a tablespoon of patchouli oil and I used a half a tablespoon of sandalwood and amber the other thing you're going to need is some high strength CBD oil when I make bath bombs I like a higher strength because you can't use a lot of oil or it's gonna ruin your bath bombs they won't set so I like to use a really high strain so that I can use a smaller amount of oil so I use two tablespoons of CBD oil in this one I don't recommend using any more than that unless of course you're making a recipe bigger if you double the recipe you can double your oils so I have two sandalwood and amber the patchouli and the CBD oil all mixed in this little cup so we're just gonna pour it in just like that get all that goodness out there we go alright and we're gonna mix this around now so we need to mix this really really well there cannot be anything that's not mixed so anywhere where those dry ingredients get your hands in there and give it a really good stir this is definitely a hands-on type of project you can use your mixer I use my mixer all the time but for the purposes of people that may not have a mixer especially a stand mixer I'm just gonna use my hands and it works just as well it just takes a little bit longer there we go so we've got that all mixed up this looks pretty good the consistency is not bad as you can see it's a little bit dry when I squeeze my hands together it should stick and it's kind of coming apart a little bit so we know that we're gonna need some witch hazel you can use a spray bottle that tends to work the best or you can use just put a little bit in a spoon and just slowly put it in I have I'm just gonna use one without a spray bottle on it so we're just gonna add this a little little bit at a time I've got a little spoon here I'm just gonna spoon it in the thing with witch hazel is that when it touches the solution you can see it's kind of starting to bubble a little bit so it's very important that you start stirring it right away because you don't want to activate your bath bombs before you get them in the backside of it so you put a little bit in as spritzer works fine usually that's actually how I do it but I also go through a lot of witch hazel so might have it big giant bottles all right so this consistency looks pretty good so what we're gonna do now is we're going to get our molds so these molds I use quite often I actually have a press as well but that's a whole other story so your bath bombs will be about this big so you drop in the tub it's not too much it's gonna smell lovely and if you get to go you can also use I don't know if you've seen them but you can use the plastic Christmas ornament balls and you can get them at Michael's or they have to sell them on Amazon as well I have links to everything you need to make these including the metal and the plastic bath bomb molds on the Canadian weed forum website so if you go there go to the recipe section every ingredient has a link to pick it up on Amazon that sometimes the easiest place to find all your ingredients some are harder to find that other citric acid I find a little bit hard at least in my area to find locally so it's much easier for me to order it from a distributor or in a smaller batch on Amazon so let's get started doing our bath bombs so we're just gonna take a bomb we're gonna squish it a little bit flat you don't go too tight but you want it to be overfilled okay then you're gonna take the other side and overfill that as well so now you take your two sides you squish them together give them a little bit of a twist when you hear them touching you know that it's nice and tight and closed so now we gotta get this thing out of here so what I do is I use a spoon I tap on my mold both sides not too hard dent your molds and there we go flip it over pop the top off and there you go you've got a beautiful CVD bath bomb and here we go now if you want to be really tidy about it you can clean your edges off as well so as you can see on these ones they've got a little bit of what's called they call it in a Saturn ring which is a little ring around it but you can take that off as well I like to keep it on I don't think it matters either way so but we'll make one this one I'll make it and we'll clean off the edges a little bit just so you can see a difference [Music] that top they're so getting your outside or your edge off it's pretty easy you just push on your edges and they'll either partially fall off or they'll just get stick right back into your backbone so you'll still have that Ridge there but that's okay it is a little bit neater looking this way so what you want to do too is just keep checking your consistency if you're finding that they're not sticking together as well then you're going to want to adjust and put a little bit more witch hazel in if you need to now if you don't want to order these molds you all certainly don't have to there's lots of things you can use as molds you can make your own you can make them look like pucks cut the bottom of a Pringles container up or something like that you can use muffin trays although if you're going to use muffin trays I do find it's a little bit harder to get them out so basically what you'll need to do is once they're made you're gonna just leave them in the mold you're gonna let them set and then you're gonna take them out of the mold flip them upside down tap on the bottoms lift up the tray and that will release your will ear balls for you well I guess they would be more like pucks wouldn't they all right there will clean these edges again just so you can see what I'm doing here all I'm really doing is I'm just pressing really lately on this outside edge that just cleans it out just a little bit there [Music] perfect here we go so we got seven bombs out of this recipe but like I said you can double it triple it as much as you want if you're making a really big batch though you're gonna really need to keep your eye on the consistency you want to make sure that when you squeeze it and you pull your hand away that fat piece sticks together once you start finding that it's starting to fall apart a little bit more witch hazel and you do that any time it's not a problem at all and then you can make as many as you want so the other thing you can do is play with color or split your mixture in half you can do half white half blue or half pink and half green or whatever you like the possibilities are endless you can split your batch once you've made it before you add your color you can just split your mix into as many bowls as you want and add a little bit of color into each each about them and they look really pretty when they're done so what we'll do next is we're gonna leave these bombs to sit overnight 12 hours is about all you need if it's a little bit humid in your area today our weather is it looks like it's going to be a little bit rainy today so what I'll probably do is we'll put a fan on them just to keep them drying very nicely otherwise they take a lot longer to set if it's humid outside or if it's wet or damp so we'll put a fan on them we'll leave them overnight and then wrap them up and give them to our friends or keep them for ourselves or put them in the bathroom so to wrap them is very easy the easiest way to do it is to put them in some plastic wrap just wrap them up or you can put them by some pretty little candy bags at a dollar store they're very cheap I think you get I don't know 20 of them or something for a dollar and you can just wrap them up and tie up the tops and give away as presents especially Christmas coming it's a good opportunity to get some stuff made for people stockings so what we'll do now is I will go fill this bottle and we'll try one of these bath bombs just you can get an idea of what it looks like when it's they're all done in when they're in your tub so buddy I don't have a tub here so we're gonna use this big bowl I'll fill it with water and we'll drop one about bombs in and see how it looks all right so let's drop one of these bath bombs in look how pretty [Music] look at that disappeared so the water is a beautiful color it looks super nice you can see some of the oils a little bit sitting on top there are ingredients you can add if you want that to dissipate you would add an ingredient called polysorbate 80 that's a little harder to get your hands on if you need to just message me in the on the website in the recipe section and I will send you a link to buy it if you need to but all in all you're sitting in the tub you've got beautiful blue water you've got lots of the CBD oil we're just going to make you feel phenomenal you can't ask for much more than that alright so you got to see how we made the bath bombs you see how love out there when you're fit when you're finished with them technically you can use these right away but you do want them to be a little bit harder because otherwise they'll get a little bit denty and they won't look so pretty but if you are dying to have a bath and you want to try these out and you make them and you haven't let them sit that's totally okay if you use them for yourself go ahead and throw it in the tub and enjoy your soak and if not let them sit overnight they should have a pretty hard consistency when they're ready to go and you know wrap them up give them to friends saving for later whatever you like to do store them in a fairly dry area if you can it is they will keep a little bit longer if you rock them up even if you're keeping them for yourself wrap them up in a bag wrap in a zip wrap them up in some saran wrap whatever works for you but wrap them up keep the moisture off of them keep the moisture away from them Stormin mason jars I'm sure you've got lots of those around and if not throw them on the table and enjoy you're soaked thank you again for watching this episode of martinis cannabis kitchen and we hope to see you next time if you like this video

weary of one particular dragon we are worried about Peter because he's really scary oh he doesn't go for the kill but to survive in the den they'll also have to face the fire of four other dragons [Music] hello dragons my name is Michael Tkach and I'm Tim in skip and we're from Caron UK we're asking for an investment of fifty thousand pounds for 15% of our business we have the UK rights to the current portfolio products which are all made from cannabis sativa plant extract make how would you like to explain your story I am from the Czech Republic and I was working in the UK when industrial accident changed my life I damaged my arm and I lost several fingers on my hand amazing an injured surgeons transferred a tow from my foot to my hand during that times the pain was unbearable and the scarring was extensive visiting Frank from the Czech Republic brought me the car own appointment and another hemp products I started using them and their results was incredible so I like to share this experience with others and I approached current Czech Republic and brought these products to UK so we have 18 different products ranging from face cream shower gel hemp leaf tea and hemp seeds and they're all made from cannabis sativa commonly known as hemp we are vegan organic and totally legal as the products contain none of these psychoactive elements found in in cannabis but they're very high in the other elements known as cannabinoids which are currently proven to be beneficial in treating many different complaints we're passionate about cannabis sativa but we are plainly retail amateurs and we need the help of a dragon to guide us to manage our growth and fulfill our full potential thank you very much for your attention and we have some samples if you'd like to show what possible that we have the samples at the end is because I'm slightly worried if I have to take any of the samples I might make a wrong investment decision they have no suckers apical affect whatsoever yeah now they've reassured the dragons the products aren't mind-altering Tim inskipp and me Celtic arch can get on with the business of handing them out there looking for 50,000 pounds for 15% of their business selling cosmetics made with a cannabis extract but Pizza Jones is still confused about the legalities of the operation how can you convince me that this isn't a potential front for a big drug ring we have the we have EU sensitive all youth certification all the farmers are certified there's very strict law oversee these farmers what's stopping the company in Czech Republic the temptation to realize that they make a small amount of money on this but the real business behind the scenes is cannabis they grow into different blind entirely and it's it is illegal to grow different plants what Moe would make it restricted is the level of THC which is the psychoactive component of the hemp plant which it doesn't have so essentially it's legal it's not a restricted substance okay so I'm not gonna be an investor in some sort of illegal drug no absolutely not because of you're gonna go to our butter and you've given three different creams here the ones are bomb as let's bomb yeah and then these are its anointment is it all the same product sit no okay is this a cosmetic is it a medicine at the moment we marketed as the cosmetics we don't make her claims it helps people and we sell it out isn't that a major problem because a you can't tell anyone what the product does you just said it's an all-purpose hemp pointment I don't know if it's to moisturize and make my skin glow I don't know if wish to reduce pain for you know joint pain or injuries I've got this does have medical device certification in the EU in Czech Republic they have run the trials we are talking specifically about this product to get a medical device in the okay the point is that the evidence is that it does help in a very very wide range of different complaints and problems but we cannot say that we are going to cure any of this but you definitely can't say they don't have a medicines license to say that but what I'm saying is that you don't know what the products for who owns the company Karen know my friends in the Czech Republic your friends yes how much of the company do you own none none we'll check it probably nothing nothing basically our relationship is that macao developed some of the products in the Czech Republic brought them over to the UK and tell me what's your deal with this company they are my close friends so you've got to buy from them yes is there a minimum quantity of to buy no and your license with them is lost for how long - 2023 at the moment and can they terminate your contract early turn up now can I look at that agreement yes yes Tim what's your role in this business are you are you an equal share holder no I'm a minor shoulder at the moment the shareholders split how I only have 10% yeah I got a 90 and 10 I got a 60% of the company and we got another of my no shareholders which helped me on the beginning will be the start of the company and how much would they put in to help you from the beginning there was no more than 20,000 altogether I invest my owner over nearly 200,000 in in the business two hundred thousand pounds and what who's where has that been spent unwisely I did a lot of mistakes on the beginning I hired Ireland the warehouse ten and half thousand thousand square feet much big offices and hired people because I believe because I were watching the Dragons Den I want to do big it's all fall then there's Peters fault specifically no launching is for the SETI's well this is my time thank you so it's Peters that fall so he's not your favorite dragon that's good to hear so you made some mistakes in the beginning so how much would you write off of the 200,000 as a mistake [Music] a hundred thousand for sure right now you have absolutely no negotiating tools in here whatsoever on June the 3rd 2023 if you've done a cracking job you hand this business back to these guys there's nothing in here that gives you an automatic right of renewal from my point of view they will be only against themselves how they can do it without us after years well because you built their brand they've got a really really valuable asset over here why on earth were they renew mm-hmm job done market penetrated I'm not spending my time building somebody else's brand for them they won't be investing I'm out a lack of control over the future of the business has spooked Deborah Medan and it's left to KO suleiman wondering how an investor would get their money back my question mark here is the fact that you don't own the brand it's a distribution and there could be no exits yes well we believe at the moment the exit is to sell back to Karen check have you got agreement to that we are negotiate that agreement so you haven't got any grieve now look I'm not doubting the product amazing product as you say but you don't own the brand once you've created the brand the retail is what the brand I don't care about you I do wish you all the best because you're gonna make your friend rich I'm out okay touka Suleiman joined Deborah Medan in exiting over that controversial distribution contract antes Levani has some words of wisdom on the pair's plans to back up the potential benefits of the product products like this the most important thing is to show the effectiveness that it works you will need to do clinical trials and pretty much every region or territory that you launch it because it will have different licensing agencies and the cost of doing a clinical trial do you know much that costs in the UK to do a clinical trial like this about a hundred twenty thousand exactly to get them licensed will cost you a hell of a lot more you're gonna have to raise half a million pounds I'm at okay thank you okay thank you Michele Tim I'm concerned about the way that you've gone about setting this business up the hill particularly you where you've having friendships and in your home country is fantastic but what you should have done was if you had such a huge amount of money two hundred thousand pounds to invest you should have found a way to invest in the holding company in the Czech Republic I could have been potentially interested actually in something like this but ultimately you've brought a distribution agency style deal that I think isn't good enough so I'm out okay thank you Peter Jones's departure leaves Jenny Campbell as the last dragon standing is she able to see the potential for profit in a business her fellow millionaires have shunned so I mean this is a bit of a mess isn't it from where we're standing I'm sure you can see that you come into the den with a an exclusivity agreement you're halfway through and all sorts of issues on extending or minimum purchase levels how confident are you that you can renegotiate that exclusivity agreement on the book Alfie on a hundred percent confident okay so I think this is complex but I can see the belief in your eyes Mikkel and certainly you've come onboard to him with the same belief but I will make you an offer so I will offer you all of the money but because of the risk factors multiple risk factors in this deal I would want 25% of your business the garage for offer can we have a little discussion please go talk to the wall an eleventh-hour change of Fortune as Jenny Campbell backs her gut instinct with an offer but at 10% more than the entrepreneurs were offering they have a tricky decision on their hands thank you - for your offer be able to accept the offer [Applause] welcome to the cosmetic duo have given up a quarter of the company but leave the den with a 50,000 pound investment that's what we lost it I did say you shouldn't use their product before I can't wait to have a fancy yeah you'd like to meet Jenny as silly as possible it's pre share our excitement and our visions and maybe have a bottle of champagne yeah you", "Gu-fdHzzoc0": "hi everyone this is Judy Murray and today as promised I wanted to share a little bit about my experience so far with my brand-new hem fat and the South Devon defined self that has CBD oil in them so here's um the hemp app and I'm sure you've seen it around and it heats up pretty quick and so it's pretty simple to use comes fully loaded comes with two different containers full of the oil and also a USB charger so that's pretty cool I'm sure it's much like many of the others that are out there and it's really the product that I'm testing and also here's the south and you can see it's pretty green smells okay smells a little bit medicinal but still pretty good so these came last night and we my husband and I immediately began to test them and before we started using the product we both checked in with ourselves to see where we were cautiously and physically if we had any aches or pains or anything like that going on and then we each tried by taking a couple of hits off of the that pen and I'm not exactly sure if it's supposed to be called a hit or not but we inhaled a couple times I didn't notice anything really immediately although I did feel sensations in the brain and nothing much pretty much anywhere else in the body Stephen however had more of an immediate reaction to it which doesn't surprise me because his metabolism is so much faster than mine so he immediately said wow I love this I really like the sensation of well being that I'm getting i really like that in fact he liked it so much he asked if he could sign up under me and purchase his own hemp app which is pretty fun because I knew he would want his own anyways so I'm glad he did we took care of that then i had a couple of calls to make in a conference and we had we did a mini bio meditation session and our usual things that we do and then later on what I was feeling tired but it was really too early to go to bed it was probably about 7 30 and I noticed I was yawning and feeling a little cloudy headed so I decided to try it again and I did two separate sessions where I inhaled and I obviously don't take a really big inhale but a good-sized one and learn to heat learn to hold it and then probably after the second second inhalation that is when I really noticed the sense of well-being and just being at peace and a lot more clarity and I was no longer tired so I think that was pretty awesome and and that was the end of it for that last night you", "7Sz0Ns1XiAw": "this CBD oil is very different from all the other CBD arts so different that it's actually not even in oil and I tested the Ohio energetics full-spectrum hemp alexia for two months and here's what happened hi my name is Max and I recently interviewed work leading the founder of Ohio energetics and I also tested his full-spectrum hemp products here for the last two months the reason why I tested it first it was super hot in the summer and I didn't sleep well at night and second I just wanted to see if I take it regularly if I feel any overall health benefits so my first impressions of the products were that yeah has a nice packaging the CBD oil which is not an oil but it's very thick compared to normal CBD ODS it's yeah really like honey worse yeah CBD odds are more like oil what's interesting also the ingredients so besides hemp oil and CBD it contains also Moringa and acerola cherry the very special thing about this is that it's water-soluble it's a full spectrum and has a twenty times higher bioavailability compared to your standard CBD oil there are other water-soluble CBD products out there but this one from my knowledge so far the only full-spectrum one that is also a 100% natural one so other water-soluble products of gnu's synthetic or semi synthetic encapsulation but this one's yeah they use their own patented process and Ohio energetics to make it a fully in natural it with normal CBD oil you get the experience that just the more you take kind of the more effect you get but actually turns out that CBD works on a bell curve which means you take a little bit more you hit a peak a sweet spot and you had have a greater effect and you take more and actually you feel less effect until you take even more and get too second peak to a second sweet spot with the oh hi it's pretty interesting pretty crazy actually because you get a feedback in your mouth if you hit the sweet spot so the way you take it you put it under your tongue and you get a taste and beginning the taste is sour you take a little bit more and it starts getting sweeter and at one point it's just sweet so if you have the point where it's just sweet you either pick a sweet spot on the back row event I think it's just so cool that it's kind of a feedback mechanism inside this hemp alexia the way I take it personally and my own personal dosage is the following I took it in the morning was just a quarter of a dropper under the tongue and for me that really increases awareness and wake up feeling so what's totally new for me actually to take it in the morning cuz I always thought you know you just take it an evening to sleep but turns out you can also take it in the morning or during the day to just feel certain overall benefits from it so for me a quarter of droppers enough so I feel the first sweet spot quite fast and we'll set that that's a sign for a healthy endocannabinoid system and someone if you don't have to take that much to get to the first sweet spot in the evening and for sleep I also just take a quarter of a dropper to it the first sweet spot and it takes an evening it takes maybe 20 to 30 minutes to feel the effect in the morning it's actually different in the morning I feel it quite immediately but in the evening for sleep it takes yeah it takes longer for me to feel it I also took more to hit the second and third bell curve once in a while as an experiment at the second bell curve I often have to cough I don't know why that is it's quite weird and then the third I can't really tell what's the factors so I just stick to going to the first bugger off I don't have to take I don't have to use a lot of it just a quarter of a dropper for me and that's how I use it we'll also mentioned in our interview that you can actually take some of this hand Ballack's here under your tongue and then you sync it up with smelling at an essential oil so because you have terpenes in essential oils and every essential oil has its own terpenes or different terpenes and the cool thing is that if you sink those up in your brain through taking the CBD or under your time and then smelling at the essential oil you get different kinds of effect which is quite interesting so you can either get like a more sharpened alertness effect or more relaxed effect depending on which essential oil you smell with the CBD you will find more emphasis on that in the for interview with the world my girlfriend also trial tried it out a couple of times the fact that I could notice was that it really relaxed my muscles after a short while they stood her menstruation of cramps which I get regularly or once a month and I used it for that too usually I took a painkiller I just once once per month and this time I used CBD oil and step because I was curious what it could do yes it did I didn't take opinion the price for this at the moment is 75 dollars in the official energetics shop which might seem yeah it costs more than your standard CBD oil but I think you have to to really think about the effect cuz this has 250 milligrams of CBD inside and with the 20 times bioavailability you would have to buy 10 of your average 5% CBD hemp oils to get the same effect as you have with one bottle of these so I think the price is quite fair and you can actually save 60% on it if you use my coupon code Mac sack you can use it in the official low energetics shop which is linked down below so yeah you save some money on it and get some comma points for helping me because I'm affiliated with oh I and they pay me a small commission when you use the coupon code Mac sack and you also say 16 percent on it if you want to see the full interview with the founder of our energetics will Clayton check it out here on my YouTube and you can also find other bio hacking experiments and reviews on my youtube if you watch that for give it a thumbs up and thank you for watching", "07wu8tkSokc": "[Music] I have a silver haze here bud unfortunately your camera can't smell if I blow you probably can smell it already it smells like marijuana it looks like marijuana but it's not and we're the only people in the country rolling a hundred percent hemp cigars we're getting a tremendous reaction the hemp industry has exploded in Texas in the last few years there are flower buds oils vape pens gummies clothes ropes dog treats the list goes on hemp is a strain of cannabis the same plant as marijuana but it lacks the chemical compound that produces a high though there's been little research in the US on its usefulness outside of epilepsy treatment many use it for things like pain or anxiety in 2018 federal law was changed to legalize hemp products and the next year the Texas Legislature followed suit Tracy King Texas State Representative has made agricultural hemp an opportunity for farmers and locals here in Texas to continue to grow so let's give mr. King a Warren round of applause what my bill does is it says any type of hemp product is 0.3 percent or less THC and it can be grown in Texas used in the production of a whole variety of products that use him THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the compound in cannabis that gets you high it's also now what legally separates hemp from marijuana cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC is marijuana anything with less is hemp that small change has made a big impact the state crime labs can't yet determined THC levels to say if cannabis is illegal or not and some prosecutors started dropping hundreds of pot cases when the law went into effect many stopped accepting new cases that couldn't show that something that looked and smelled like marijuana contained more than 0.3 percent THC criminal defense attorneys watching this law take effect now have a new defense against prosecutors prove what you have is marijuana instead of him some lawyers are starting to advertise on this angle and doing so loudly legislators change the definition of marijuana to require them to move over 0.3% THC good luck proving that those are trees this is pop I'm Brian Wilson better known as Brian Wilson the Texas law Hawk and I'm a criminal defense attorney in Fort Worth Texas the state is in a bad spot right now this law well I think it had good intentions it affects everyone people are making these products to the people that are possessing them police that actually make the arrest and that's because they're having a hard time proving these cases the new law it helps out defense attorneys a lot because now we have a whole other completely separate thing to argue how are you gonna prove this case when you don't have a lab that can prove that it's over 0.3 percent THC good luck with that that's that's what I'd say to new wheelies so today we're going to quality forensic toxicology it is a private crime lab in San Antonio they are one of the ones that can actually distinguish how much THC is in the plant substance and the state labs can do that yet are you working on more fluids or urine so this is a bunch of tubes that are siphoning out different types of ions it's actually getting it's getting rid of everything it doesn't want okay it's only detecting the things that it does okay and one of those is THC look okay the instrumentation that we use for our clinical toxicology is not found in the normal drug identification laboratory in the state of Texas or anywhere really and so the day after the bill was signed we actually had the phone ringing in our office saying hey can you guys do this we felt it was our responsibility to see whether or not this is something that we could do well right now we have the clients in the law enforcement field those are the agencies that didn't really know where to go because the state lab has not developed a test that would adequately determine the amount of THC in a suspected hemp versus marijuana type case so without access to that type of technology that type of instrumentation the drug identification labs were kind of left in a bind while some private labs have a solution for plant testing now it can be expensive costing hundreds of dollars per case in some cities and counties don't want to spend more police time or more police resources on marijuana enforcement that means many cases aren't being prosecuted or are sitting on the Shelf waiting for the government crime labs as they struggle to catch up to the new law Houston's public crime lab is working on a cheaper solution to the new oth see problem that can be used across the state oh I get to wear a coat think we've got a method that looks like it will be reliably able to indicate whether there is more or less than 1% THC in plant material that sound like a whole lot but that's a big feat getting to that point we're trying to build something that's gonna go in probably 25 to 30 laboratories across the state Peter and other state labs plan on using existing equipment to tell if a substance is above or below this 1% marker although it's higher than the legal cutoff it's okay with law enforcement but marijuana cases in the crime lab are still going to take a lot more time and money than they did before and the labs will only be able to test plant material not liquids like Ana vape pen or edibles something that took 15 minutes now it takes hours so yeah if I'm spending time on marijuana that's time I don't have to spend on opioids and PCP and pills and all the other stuff that comes to the lab the whole thing is gonna be more expensive as well in any way you slice this the laboratories have to have more resources that just there's no way we can keep up with what was going on before this much less now it's really easy to overlook the impact that happens in these labs the problem is is when you discount thinking about the laboratories this is what happens did this it is a pinch point in the system that cripples everything else lawmakers were warned that pot cases were going to become a lot more expensive before the bill passed Peters lab and the Texas Department of Public Safety told legislators that they weren't currently equipped to handle this testing and it would cost the state millions we do not currently want to eat THC in samples and so we would have to go through a validation process and procure some instrumentation to be able to do that quantitation right remembers any questions all right thank you very much Brad the very ends the crime lab people came up and said you know we might need more money well that's not an unusual refrain during a legislative session from any state agency but I think a little bit of time and if the whole situation we'll all wonder while we were so worried about this in the beginning the state lawmakers pushing the hemp bill like kings we're adamant that it would not lead to marijuana legalization or decriminalization but some think that difficulties in enforcing this new law might be leading the state in that direction the number of new misdemeanor marijuana cases filed in Texas has plummeted many prosecutors are now demanding lab reports with THC levels before accepting a new case people are being arrested for possessing legal hemp because police think it's marijuana and cities and counties are grappling with how to handle the hemp versus marijuana problem in Austin the City Council has banned the use of any City funds to pay for marijuana testing and low-level cases ones they don't want to be pursuing anyway I think that us spending extra dollars to pursue these low-level cases not only isn't right but I think actually makes us less safe thank you guys it's not the devil's lettuce anymore legalization is coming in Texas a lot sooner than people think is it time to decriminalize marijuana in Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick says absolutely not more and more Texas and support decriminalization of marijuana to some extent but figures like the powerful lieutenant governor Dan Patrick are strongly against it still marijuana advocates are hoping to use the hemp laws fall out as momentum for change in the 21 legislative session how this plays out in the future is still unclear but for now state labs are working to implement testing private labs are breaking into the industry and new testing technology is emerging and hemp farming in Texas is set to start in 2020 [Music] [Music] tetrahydrocannabinol nope hold on I wrote it down tetrahydrocannabinol that's what it is I'm saying that one in a million times it's hard to say", "piHh621RU9E": "[Music] my name's Aaron nos fish and I wanted to show you a quick video on how to get CBD ads live on Facebook it works primarily well with topical products but it also works with dentures and edibles and other products and I'm gonna show you real quick how I'm getting those ads live how you can get those ads live and how some of the biggest brands in the game are currently getting them at those ads live before we go into that again my name's Aaron I've been in this ecommerce digital marketing space for quite a while now I've been doing a lot of Facebook Instagram advertising for the past few years it's been about four million dollars on the platform at a at a return and for example I have my Facebook shirt on actually today which I picked up from Facebook headquarters last time they invited me out there so real quick I own a company called symbiote sim like hone this with Matt cyber is the canvas consulting company where we consult people see the CBD or cannabis companies either early stage or they've started generating revenue and they want to scale and we help them do so this awesome logo was designed by Paul Booth he does an excellent job over at just brand it and I own one other company called lucid media and loosen media does advertising and creative services so we create awesome and compelling videos that are viral in nature and then we advertise those videos for you to drive a return this works we do this for both direct-to-consumer ecommerce companies with a social conscious mint socially conscious mission as well as for CBD products okay but you're here to learn about how to get ads live for on Facebook and Instagram for CBD products I'm gonna show you how to do that real quick first off let me go show you how you can see ads that some of the bigger brands in the game do have live currently and how you can replicate that success so this is pure canna I'm sure many of you are familiar with them they've sold their company just recently or acquired I think by heavenly Rx for over 90 million dollars or around 90 million dollars let me show you real quick how to see the ads they're driving go ahead and visit their Facebook page in this case it's pure cane a premier premium scrolling down you'll see the sections page transparency click see more and then go down and click go to ads library this is gonna show you all the active ads that this company is running at any given time so as you can see here let's look at what this ad says and why it's approved so this is a CBD topical product it looks like a roll-on gel or roll-on ball topical product what we notice first is in the caption this is talking about that product but there's no mention of CBD in here Peter can type your results topical gel topical gel that's what it is in shipping and it's slogan but again nothing no mention of CBD so where do these links go to let's find out click through that check this out it goes to a landing page on this landing page look what they're mentioning hip no mention of CBD not anywhere on this landing page so that comes to our first way to get ads live on Facebook for CB products you can run an ad that doesn't mention CBD to a landing page that mentions hemp and if you click through that landing page you can run that directly to your topical products or your CBD topical products on your website so you example you can see CB right here this is pure akina's actual website you get to have oils and capsules on here as well but this is their this is a collection page for the topicals and I could buy any other topicals right here so that's the first way you can get that ad life we're gonna go ahead and show you how to do that real quick in the backend this is a campaign a traffic based objective campaign and you click through the ad sets on this ad set I just have a basic ad set this is running to everyone in the US 18 to 65 ok this is just for an example jumping over here I have one that I got rejected in Wonka advocaat repeat approved let me show you the differences so if I go to this ad let me click Edit you'll notice what I did here I have a caption that is the exact that they have for their current product no mention of CBD although it does talk about CBD products I have a c-more URL and a display link this goes to that landing page that we just showed you but then I also have different links going here in the in the in the actual carousel ad so you'll see this link now I got this ad approved going to this link now let me show you that so you can actually run she just comes the second way to get CBD ads approved you can run CBD or you can run ads that don't mention CBD to topical CBD lean pages so this is actually pure cannas product page for their topical CBD ointment I'm not affiliated with with pure Canada I just wanted to demo how they are getting their ads live out there so this goes directly from the ad clicks through to their product page for their CBD topical no landing page in between so that's another way so that's the second way you can get it live but a lot of people think that's about it and that that that's pretty much the only way you can get ads live for CBD but frankly it's not true so with that let me show you a couple more this is pre mas I mean you heard a prema prema was started by one of the I think it was one of the executives from the honest company which was a billion-dollar wellness company I think they made home chemical or home natural natural chemicals for the home and a bunch of other products but so he started this company and if you look here again I'm just gonna go to their Facebook page down to page transparency see more then go to ads library you see this page is currently running as oh curious go to their add library look at that tons of CBD ads cool right okay so how's it working again what do we see no mention of CBD in the add caption no mention in the headline no mission in the description I click through this is going to their actual website primer Co but look at that Facebook - info - V - so this is a landing page built for Facebook Ads specifically by prema holiday magic what do we see here again no mention of CBD they're just talking about the products and the benefits of the products but no mention of CBD don't take our word for it cool great job primal you guys are doing great they have a wonderful brand and this is a great way to get ads now what you see here is they have a cream they have a serum they have a bath bomb and they have a skin therapy now those are all topical so you might say Erin okay that's great but those are still topicals I have a tensor product how can I get a tint your product live for Facebook well let me show you I'm sure a lot of you have heard the company feels feels that's probably one of the best websites brands and experiences in the game right now great job feels and I am very impressed by what these guys are doing and I'm sure you are too but before let me show you what's interesting about them is they have primarily only at ensure product I don't think they have any topicals or any other products currently to have at ensure product in three different shrinks and they have a flight of testers again let's scroll down Seymour oh they're running ads go-to ads library what do we see look at these ads Wow a bunch of them okay cool so what are they ads well two things you'll notice here one look at that pings IOT meet your match I'm sure a lot of you are dealing with the restrictions due to the FDA I'm not being able to make claims one great way to come out around that is use creative words that that aren't making claims that are not diseases and that you can offer solutions to you can use words like sue the relieve you can't use words like treat or cure and so be careful but learn from of the brains that are doing it what feels is doing here they're making up a word anxiety but what do we know we know they're talking about anxiety we know that the time about anger we know they're talking about relaxation that's what comes to my mind when I see that it's really curious but now what about this ad again no mention of CBD but check this out if when I click through to it what is it well it goes to Cosmo this fancy new CBD procs so I went from the ad that showed 10 chairs but didn't mention CBD goes directly to a landing page on Cosmo it talks about CBD literally in the headline well there's a product right there at intra product huh as we see we scroll through here now this is a this is a Cosmo writer talking about their CBD product of what we see down here is links to their product their there there and all throughout this page so if I go ahead and click through and just like that I am on fields Pro website this is their actual website not even a landing page and I can buy that product for attention right there crazy that's a great way to do it very few people in the game are doing this right now this is a strong way to do it okay so I've showed you a couple of different ways on how to get ads live on Facebook for CBD but that's not the only one so so far we've talked about you can get ads live for Facebook that go to our for CBD that goes to an ad that doesn't mention CBD that goes to a landing page that mentions hemp that redirects to a checkout or to a poor to a category page or the product pages that do mention CBD therefore topicals or an ad that doesn't mention CBD to a topical product page that doesn't Incheon CBD or you can go from a ad that doesn't mention CBD to a Lambie page that has all your topical products on it similar to how product primer does it and they didn't mention CBD at all on theirs and that's how they're getting theirs approved more easily or if you have a 10 shirt product you can do something like feels does where you go from your they add that doesn't mention CBD talks about the product or hints that it directs them to an article that does mention CBDs and talks directly about their product very clearly and promotes it very clearly that redirects to your website or finally there's a couple or actually a couple more there's two more ways you can get CBD is live and we talked about those another way you can do in some companies do is they either create an blog on their website that top that creates articles about CBD but don't sell directly CBD products they might say what CBD is good for why she CBD should be legal the benefits and the cons of CBD whatever kind of educational content now some people are hosting this on their web sites where they actually sell CBD others are putting it on other websites and redirecting to their CBD products that is a way you can get ads live there's nothing wrong with talking about CBD on facebook ads as long as you're not actually there's nothing wrong with promoting a CBD article on facebook ads as long as it doesn't sell directly the product so they can make it be about awareness articles or activism articles or what-have-you so those are articles you can get live and then finally there's one last way this works for all products and you can run facebook lead ads that generate leads for pre qualifying questions so say you have a soothing muscle CBD gel for four that you roll on or it's a South right you can run ads that say having trouble with your muscles or sore back question mark or whatever it is generate leads for people who qualify for these conditions or for these for these they or rather they're people that are not conditions that that would be you know be careful with that that would qualify for that that are interested in the solution that you're offering you gather their emails you throw them into an email marketing sequence and then that converts them that works for about any CBD products and most people that promote the fact that they can CBD ads live that's how they're doing it so what I wanted to show you with this is that you can get CBD ads live there are many ways to do it and there's many more that we haven't talked about once you shouldn't understand the mechanics of what Facebook does allow them doesn't allow you can come up with new ways to do this and that being said I'm a big proponent of information being free that's why I'm sharing that's a lot of people who might think I'm crazy for sharing this I believe that that this point has crazy healing benefits and that everyone deserves to experience that and I hope that this helps each of your brains do this that being said getting ads live is not the only thing to to making us successful it comes down to your creative it comes down to your targeting it comes down to knowing how to scale when to rotate your ads and when to come up with new creatives and we help companies do that every day if you're interested both in the CBD space and outside of the Seabee space if you're interested in that give me a message you'll see I'll put my link in the book yeah in the comments below on how to book a call with me we do consulting packages that start at 3500 a month and we have advertising packages that range from 5,000 all the way up to 20,000 a month depending on where you're at in the process now that being said we only charge money when we know we can make more money for you so give us a call and we'd be happy to he'll help the links are gonna be in the description in the comment section below and feel free to ask any questions and I will get back to you as quickly as I can alright guys well I wish you the best good luck and thank you for watching [Music]", "llUiZVO0TEE": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be making CBD infused coconut oil using a double boiler hem there are multiple ways to make diffuse oils and today we'll be going with one of the most common ways the double boiler method which is an easy and effective way to infuse health into the oil note that this method works with all oils and not just coconut oil olive oil vegetable oil grapeseed oil they all work so depending on what you're using it for you can substitute the oil you want to infuse so here you want to start out with a quarter of an ounce of buds or trim per cup of oil of course trim will not be as potent as buds so if you're using trim you can add more if you want the oil to be stronger or if you want it to be less potent then trim is a good choice as always I recommend using decarboxylated hemp to get the maximum amount of potency however here today I'm feeling lazy so I'm just going to add them directly into the oil and let it decarboxylate while it's being infused all I need to do is grind the pound then mixed with the oil in a bowl that can fit on top of a pot inside the pot I'll add about 3 cups of water this will vary based on the size of the pot you're using but you'll need to add enough water so that it doesn't completely evaporate after two hours of simmering but not so much that it'll touch the bottom of the bowl you want the bowl to be heated by the steam of the water and not the water itself for a consistent temperature I'll then put the pot on the stove let it boil and then turn down the heat so that it's slowly simmering and finally place the bowl on top of the pot the bull should fit in such a way that almost no steam is escaping from the pot although there should be enough pressure from the steam that a little will constantly escape the steam will consistently heat the oil up to 212 degrees a perfect low heat that will infuse a CBD in with the oil and not so hot that it will burn off any of the CBD if you saw my video on making butter note that both this double boiler method as was directly simmering in the water method are interchangeable when infusing I like this method more when working with oils because other than coconut oil most oils won't turn solid when cooled which makes it harder to separate from water so although this method will have a stronger flavor since there's no water to remove some of the terpenes and chlorophyll which gives flavor it is a lot easier to produce I stir it a little bit from time to time and let it sit for about two hours to properly decarboxylate and infuse now that the oil is infused you'll want to let it sit for a while before straining it since a lot of the oils are stuck to the plant material you'll want to make sure the oil is not hot to the touch because after filtering it through a cheesecloth you'll want to squeeze out all the remaining oil from the plant material to get every last drop and that's it the oil is now ready for use and you're storing the oil be sure to keep it in refrigerator or freeze it if you want to store it for long-term use", "YDLtEyb2ZuQ": "[Music] hey you guys it is your girl cleo rose and i am back with another lip gloss video so this time we're going to do something a little little a little bit different and we're just going to go ahead and get into we're not even going to do a whole introduction so let me tell you guys the materials that you need you need your bowls you need your coloring you need your spoons um these are the tops to the lip gloss right here um you need your syringe you need i'll explain these in a second you need your pipettes those are the the the tips to your lip gloss tubes i have four those are here i have just four squeeze tubes i'm going to be using great flavoring can you see it let me turn this lightning up sorry all right that's better so i'm going to be using the lorianne oils i have great flavoring we're using grapeseed oil vitamin e oil a hobo oil and this is going to be our special special ingredient i'm going to be using hempsie oil nut one thing about hemp seed oil is if you're going to use it as one of your essential oils in your lip gloss please make sure that it's organic and make sure that it is cold pressed and you can see right there it says extraction method cold press make sure that it's cold pressed and along with um that's what i had to oh i opened this sorry that's what i had to make sure about my hobo oil is that it is cold pressed you want to make sure that you're not losing any of the um you don't want to use like any of the ba you know the what am i look for the the the good stuff basically the properties that's going to help make your stuff pop make sure that you have your gloves and this is my versa gel from tkb trading okay oh these are what i'm expecting so i am actually a lot of stuff that i'm going to be making now is going to be with him oil and um i accidentally ordered the wrong size containers so i'm just going to use these as samples so anytime you guys put in an order you will get one of these with just like a sample lip gloss or like a sample chapstick or something of that nature it's just gonna be like a little sample so you can see like if you like the product then you know you can order a full size but that's pretty much how it goes so it'll be one random sample in each order i only pulled out three um just because i'm gonna make sure i fill up my tubes before i fill up these so i only put out three if i have more lip gloss than you know i'll fill up more but let's get into it okay so make sure i already cleaned off my table and everything with the disinfect wipes i already washed my hands make sure you are very clean and sanitary because that is the number one the number one um that's the number one step in lip gloss making sorry i'm going to also be tick-tocking at the same time so if you see my phone come across the camera oh we don't want to get copy written let me just turn this off if you see my phone come across the camera then just know that i am tick-tocking at the same freaking time okay so first things first you're going to want to let me move some stuff back so you guys can see we're going to put some of the lipgloss base into the bowl not a lot though just enough i think that should be enough right there too much so i'm known for doing that making more than what i actually need okay so we're going to start off with the grapeseed oil [Music] and remember i always i like my lip gloss kind of thick so if you see me go back in with so remember if i like my lip gloss a little bit thick so if you see me go back into your versa gel that's because i even added too much ingredient and i just want to like thicken it right back up but make sure and um another thing i like about grapeseed oil is because a lot of people if you use coconut oil a lot of people are allergic to nuts and you do not want those issues so grapeseed oil is also your next best thing and remember my lip gloss is still thick so you want to go in with the jojoba oil we don't need that much so we're going to use about that much right now if we need more than you know just a bit more and this one is and also these are more yellow tinted but like i said we have our colors so you don't necessarily have to worry about too [Music] much [Music] okay we're gonna go in with vitamin e oil this one has a dropper on it so i usually try to do about either like a half full dropper you don't really need that much let me eat just make sure you work it all the way through [Music] and another thing you don't want to use too much oil because you don't want your lip glosses to be too oily [Music] and look my lip gloss is still fairly thick just like how i like it oh this is another lip gloss this is starting to look like it's not [Music] okay so the next thing we're going to go in with the organic hemp oil so i have my syringe for this [Music] so we're going to use about this much [Music] you don't want to use like too much okay and i feel like i kind of made it a little bit looser a little bit of lip gloss space just to tighten it right back up [Music] and just make sure when you're adding you work it all the way through [Music] okay we're going to add just a little bit of more hemp oil not a lot though [Music] about that much [Music] really good consistency all right now let's add the flavoring this one's very cool [Music] this might turn a little scented just a little bit but it's all right i really do hope this green shows up now because i didn't think it was to turn this color [Music] but if y'all can see it's like a light purple it's not really showing up on camera but it's like a light purple type situation i think i should change this to like a purple and not green even i really wanted it to be green but [Music] yeah i think i'm about to change this to like a green i mean a purple yeah let's switch colors [Music] alright so i found purple green we can see for like another day but i have this dark purple so we're gonna go in with just a little bit from here [Music] [Music] though [Music] remember to stir your color is very slow because this is powder and you do not want it to splatter everywhere [Music] oh this is so cute [Music] i'm gonna call this one for the ring or something like something cute like actually comment down below what you think this color should be [Music] kind of dark but it's so cute i love it [Music] a little bit more color into this just to make sure [Music] all right i'm just gonna add literally a little bit check oh my goodness look at this this is so freaking cute all right i think everything's worked in and it smells amazing it smells like purple kool-aid so syringe and we're just going to kind of like pour this inside you know i usually like like suck it up but this time i decided that i was just going to put it in there myself [Music] stop it from coming down [Music] oh my goodness i'm sorry if y'all couldn't see me like filling this up i apologize but i'm just so stuck on the color and i'm trying to make sure i get all [Music] i don't want it to spill over and i'm just use this one for my coloring i can make sure [Music] [Music] so and this should be literally all of it [Music] all right oh my back hurts okay so let me put this back here and then that surrounds [Music] remember all right so remember when you're doing the pipette method you cut off the tips clear [Music] here so you have a cut syringe i'm gonna move this over don't worry about my desk i'm going to end up cleaning it up all right so this is what the syringe look like it's pretty full we're going to pop that one there make sure it's like on there pretty secure i'm going to pop the top on remember you can just squirt it in oh come on just squirt it into the bowl [Music] all right cool all right then put it inside the container go side to side and then [Music] fill it up [Music] don't fill it up too much this is probably gonna be more than like [Music] so here then you can go here and then if you have air in your thing don't worry about it but remember what i told you with the suck up method you have to push the air out side to side and then [Music] bring it on up all right we might have like literally enough [Music] so all right that's those [Music] stick that there i think i literally just made like four tubes stick the cap on [Music] sauce [Music] okay don't worry about this one because i gotta [Music] [Music] so okay and this is what they all look like [Music] this is so of course i gotta wash them all but um this is basically what the color look like it is so cute and this is hemp infused so it does have hemp oil in it i will put the description to what hemp oil does for your skin in the description box below but i cannot get over this and like i said i wanted to do like little samples so this actually isn't going to take a lot like squeeze if there is something here oh there isn't i literally made four [Music] so what we're gonna do is just take this little bit and just dollop it in it [Music] it's going to settle out if it needs a little help then of course you can just take a serene [Music] move it around [Music] and then [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's pretty much what it would look like on the inside and then that's it and then like i said these are all come on lip glosses that i just made they have or you in them they're super super cute they these will be ready to order on the site two

you must know this hello and welcome to the live without anxiety the channel where you will find the best anxiety hacks to overcome anything in your life we provide you the solutions that you can immediately apply to your daily life today we are going to give you the answer to the age-old question of whether to choose hemp oil or CBD oil for treating anxiety the answer may surprise you so what's the lien to know which one you should choose every bottle of all is different particularly with regards to those obtained from the cannabis plant in spite of the fact that they are frequently utilized reciprocally hemp oil and CBD oil have urgent contrast in how everyone of them influences your body and well-being so as to figure out which cannabis item is suited for you you need to investigate the difference between hemp oil and CBD oil in terms of ingredients in their making so let's jump on the differences between both of these smell and appearance wise hemp oil is of nutty flavor and has a clear light green color whereas CBD oil is of earthy flavor and has a golden color industrially hemp oil is extracted from cold-pressed seeds of the plant but on the other hand CBD oil is made from Leafs flowers and stalks of the hemp where canopy oil is found although both of them are derived from a common plant they have different properties and medicinal advantages but both of these oils may contain up to 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol also known as THC and you must carefully check the product before purchasing actually when we will tell you a main key difference between both of these you may disregard the other one keep watching to find out which one you are going to need now let's come to the benefit of both of these oils hemp oil is used as an ingredient for hair

seed oil is generally gainful as a body well-being supplement it's incredible for your hair in your skin and it's delicious solid expansion nourishment in any case it doesn't give much in the method for medical or restorative advantages on the other hand CBD oils are frequently utilized as tincture these are generally taken sublingually by putting drops under the tongue CBD oil is likewise normally utilized in cannabidiol items for example CBD chewy candies or CBD soft drinks CBD is looked for its scope of medical advantages which is incorporate alleviation from pain aggravation and sleeping disorder for those touchy to the high of THC simile offers the intensity of the cannabis plant without psychoactive impacts in an investigation of patients with joint inflammation or arthritis CBD adequately decreased pain stiffness and aggravation in other investigation of those with numerous fluorosis patients experienced improvement in a decrease stalling and muscle fits when taking CBD now the only question remaining is which one you should choose for treating your anxiety after going through many articles and blog posts we came to the conclusion that hemp oil has many advantages health-wise but for treating anxiety CBD oil wins the race CBD oil can treat social anxiety obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder it has anti-anxiety and anti depressant effects too so if you are having a hard time deciding which all you should go go for CBD oil is definitely what you are looking for this was our research on this topic we hope that you will

cbd oil when and why should you take it and what is it let me explain you and answer all of your burning questions today in this video and hopefully by the end of watching it you will really have a clear idea what full spectrum cbt oil is and why you should be choosing it and when so my name is nadia and i'm the founder of vicario cbd and i'm a holistic nutritionist specializing in cbd oils first and foremost what is the difference between full spectrum and cbd isolate it's quite self-descriptive but cannabis has over 130 different cannabinoids and by the way hemp is cannabis um it's just a type of cannabis and there's over 130 different cannabinoids cbd and thc being the two most popular and prevalent ones but there's a you know over a hundred different ones so when we talk about cbd cbd is one cannabinoid it's an extra they extract that cbd and it usually looks like powder so cbd is isolate is usually just powder versus cbd full spectrum it's exactly what it means it means it's a bunch of different cannabinoids um so cbd still being the main one 95 percent off full spectrum cbd would be cbt but there's also cannabinoids like cbdn cbg and a little bit of thc so cbd isolate would have 0.00 dhc however cbd full spectrum will have a little bit of thc it is usually a very small amount um less than 0.3 by dry weight um that is kind of like the legal um requirements but sometimes it's even less than like significantly less than that it will depend on your full spectrum cbd so uh if you're really worried about thc uh whether you are just taking cbd for the first time um like myself when i started with cbd i really didn't want to have any thc in it because i'm so afraid to get high so because i take it monday morning and i don't want to have teachers in it then go for cbd i sell it however if you don't mind a little bit of thc if you're like smoked weed a lot of times and you're like i really don't mind i'm not scared of it i'm not afraid of it um then that amount of thc isn't really significant enough to you know to get you high that being said um we still most of our oils at aquarium are cbd isolates um thea with cbd isolate being our most popular one um you can get it by following the link in the bio and using the code youtube um it has no flavor it's made with mct coconut oil and cbt isolate and that's it it has 0.0 thc so there will be nothing to worry about and most of our products still contain just cbt isolate however there are benefits to full spectrum obviously there is a whole concept of full spectrum cbd oil having an entourage effect that cvt isolate doesn't have so what is entourage effect entourage effect is when cannabinoids are working together um and so thc will help will it will make sometimes cbd stronger if it's in a right proportion so in full spectrum it is the case so um when it when we're talking about cbd qualities like anti-inflammatory or analgesic or um that it will help you sleep thc and other cannabinoids can really boost the function of the effectiveness of cbd itself so that is what a rush effect is so is full spectrum cbd oil better than cbd isolate well it really depends everybody is very different so you have to make your own decision there is no better or worse cbd isolate doesn't have thc in it so if you are worried about thc whether it's a drug test or just your own personal reasons then it's just stick to cbd isolate however if you're not worried about the liberty of thc full spectrum might be for you full spectrum because of in entourage effect can be better for pain management because um it will be stronger anti-inflammatory and stronger analgesic so whether it's arthritis whether it's headaches back ache or whatever that is cbd full spectrum can be better might be better and another one is sleeping noise insomnia cbd full spectrum cbdo can be more effective in um in case of insomnia and actually falling asleep and relaxing that being said i have had um some customers um report to me that they feel sleepier from full spectrum cbd than cbd or isolate and in that case you don't want to be taking it monday morning right um so let's say you're taking cbd oil monday morning you're taking it for stress you're taking it making sure that your energy levels are stable throughout the day um you don't have pain or sleep problems um then we i recommend sticking with cbd isolate just because thc can make you a little bit more relaxed um to compare it to just pure cbd as i'm saying all of this i just want you to keep in mind that we're all very different and we will all have a very different effect personally speaking if you ask me i will tell you that i don't feel the difference between full spectrum and isolate but that's just me some people feel huge difference and some people love full spectrum and some people love isolate so i don't think there's a right or wrong reason full spectrum is definitely gaining popularity um and we do have our full spectrum that you can also get in by following the link in the bio we ship in u.s and canada you can use the code youtube to get 10 off however i i will insist on saying that there is no better or worse just because it will depend on your lifestyle if um you feel like you're burnt out and you're really tired and you need you know three coffees to stay awake in the day um cb the full spectrum cbd oil might really like make you even more make might make you more relaxed and in that sense um it's a good thing like cbd will help you get over the adrenal fatigue and like will force you to rest so it's not a bad thing however you probably don't want that effect on monday morning and that being said if you are struggling with pain then i would go for cpg full spectrum another question i could commonly ask is whether they taste differently full spectrum versus isolate and yes they do full spectrum does have a little bit of a more like weed taste versus isolate um in a regular concentration doesn't taste like anything and if it's a high concentration it might taste a little bit better but full spectrum almost always has that tiny bit of a weed taste and smell no matter the concentration is so just keep that in mind so i hope you see how both full spectrum and isolate have a time and a place in our day i do highly recommend you trying both and seeing what which one works for you um comment below with which one worked for you better and if you see the difference and if you don't also let us know make sure to subscribe to our channel and i hope to see

don't know feel like it just need a really bad piece I don't know what I think about the smell it's evidence Onofre may be they may may didn't cut any fruit first Nelson our best certainly is not under free I feel it a little bit I think [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey yo it's Cristina with another TV stuff review and today I'm going to be reviewing hemp vana pain cream so it says it is legal in all 50 states big difference between hemp and the other stuff y'all it says pain cream Aksum um strength odor-free no irritation no burning non greasy it does say that it's paraben free and vegan gluten free and cruelty free and on TV so there's some directions on the side apply generously to affected area and massage them to painful area until thoroughly absorbed into skin repeat as necessary but no more than four times daily off and on the back just your typical warnings of drug Facts again on the side have on the pain cream absorbs quickly and goes to work instantly it's unique formula includes a proven active ingredient plus the moisturizing benefit of cold-pressed hemp seed oil for soothing relief to back neck shoulders feet wrists calves and more and it is made in the USA so I just got back from the gym I'm gonna go hop in the shower we did a little bit of total body today so I'm definitely going to apply it on my neck and my shoulders and maybe my wrists a little but and I did hurt my knee so I'm definitely going to be rubbing it on my knee as well so I'm gonna go hop in the shower and then I will be back to trying to sell out much I'll know what I think alright y'all so just got out of shower I'm going to rub at some of my new hip bone of pain cream on my neck and my shoulders and my lower back so they Jim we did upper body aches so definitely feeling a little sore normally I would you blue from deuterium or I have this stuff that I got into yoga supply box called yoga and it's super super good too so again I'm not a huge fan of the snow I let my daughter smell it and she said it felt like silly putty and hairspray so take a little bit just rub it on it doesn't have that minty smell that the icy hot and it's blue to do which actually that was actually one of the things that I like all right I feel it a little bit I think unless it's just the fact that I just spread collection I mean it's a little cold here in the bathroom but I think I feel it a little bit I'm so good at it give it a few minutes and see how it is just finished in yoga outside I'm definitely going to be rubbing my hip on a pain cream on my wrist a little bit and did a lot of inversions and I can definitely feel it already so I'm just gonna open it up I already took that seal off I don't know feel like I just need a really bad piece I don't know what I think about the smell it's evidence odor freak maybe they mean they didn't put any fruit fruit smells in there but it certainly is not odor free because it kind of stinks it smells like silly putty and maybe like cleaners or chemicals on a neem and now I'm just gonna rub it on again I would compare this to like doTERRA or icy hot both products again I love them not really feeling that cooling tingling I don't know if this because it doesn't smell I don't know why I would change anything but definitely by now I would have felt it with doTERRA or icy hot so we'll give it a couple more minutes we'll see if it works any better but I'll definitely be back to give you guys my opinion and what I think oh okay oh so I have now tried hemp ona a few times I have ripped it on my knees and as well as my ankles after hitting the gym I've done it on my wrists I've done it on my right elbow and also on my neck and shoulders and a little bit on my lower back so I really put it everywhere now that says that you can um not man sorry I would probably give hemp lot of pain cream 1 out of 5 stars not only do I not feel like it works but it's most I'm sorry but it smells awful if I'm being honest it's just it's not pleasant to smell when it's in here smelling it on my hands afterwards it's just it's not fun it's really gross so I'm not a fan of the smell I do miss the cool tingly feeling of something like icy hot or deep blue both of those work way better than this I really don't even know if I felt this working yes I rubbed it on maybe for a minute I felt a little something if I walked past a fan there's something like that but for the most part I didn't notice the difference I did not notice it worked but I'm curious do you use a pain cream and if so which one do you use and what do you like most about it let me know in the comments I would love to hear more also make sure that you subscribe to TV stuff reviews hit the little bell in the corner so you get notifications each time a new

rival its psychoactive sister THC you may know that CBD can't get you high but can using CBD make you fail a drug test find out on this episode of weed easy by the growth of drug tests that look for cannabis analyzed a urine sample and screen it for marijuana metabolites since CBD derives from the cannabis plant you might rightly wonder if I use CBD can it cause me to fail a drug test for cannabis on its own CBD actually cannot produce a positive result on a drug test for cannabis that's because drug tests that screen for cannabis are looking for just one cannabinoid and that's THC a or tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid or the inactive form of THC click the letter I in the top-right corner of your screen to watch our episode on decarboxylation to learn how to HCA becomes THC and why that process is so important so if you only use CBD are you in the clear well it depends if you're using a high CBD strain of cannabis you'd likely think it's safe but this can sometimes cause you to fail a drug test many of these strains still contain high amounts of THC which will still set off alarm bells on a urine screen however if you're using hemp based CBD oils or pills these generally contain just trace amounts of THC at about 0.3% these products should not cause you to fail a drug test as long as you do not consume extremely high doses a false positive on a drug test can occur with doses of a thousand milligrams a day or more with CBD products though most people consume about 120 to 160 milligrams per day keep in mind that many CBD products are unregulated and therefore may contain cannabinoids that could get you into hot water for that reason we suggest sticking to CBD products that are lab tested and keeping your dosage at a recommended level while using CBD on its own

lab I'm your host Gary Cohen and on today's episode I have dr. Philip Blair dr. Blair is a family physician and consultant in disease management for workers insurance programs he is also a retired US Army colonel who was a combat physician in the Gulf War and retired after 29 years in uniform since 2014 dr. Blair has been consulting treating patients and lecturing about CBD and how it can improve serious medical disorders Phillip thanks so much for coming on to the episode today hey great to be here I'm wonderful to be tapping into the UK and all of your affiliates and whoever you talk with yeah so yeah I'm based on a little island called the island man which is just off the UK but so yeah I've got a lot of UK listeners but also a lot of American listeners so you know we were transatlantic we're going to cross and even down in Australia in South Africa there's a lot of different people were going to listen to you today well I love to talk to those people as well and part of my international consultancy on cannabidiol actually takes me to South Africa Australia and New Zealand in addition to Japan and even Korea Wow so you know that's what we're talking about today's why is CBD not being used more and more widely and it's great to hear that yet loads of countries and people around the world want to use it so I mean I'm I'm excited I know you're super excited about CBD and and all the other cannabinoids so just sorry for listeners I'm gonna get a bit tongue-tied on that stuff today but the the reason I've just to give people a little bit of background I recently just got a little tub of it myself little spray to put on the tongue and from there I decided to sort of geek out more about it and I got to watch the scientist documentary about how it was discovered and that dr. Michelin and how in the story that he goes through and it's fascinating and so to sort of get us into this for people who don't know anything about it could you just explain what is CBD what are we talking about okay but let me first say that I am a family physician primarily that was my graduate training after medicine so I've been I did the whole nine yards delivered babies did vasectomies took care of infants children adults and geriatrics the whole thing and I was I was practiced that for the entire time that I was in the military until I retired in 96 then I went I started doing disease management starting in 2000 and then I'm trying to figure out mechanisms and ways to to hack the body and try and trying to get the outcomes that we should be seeing from current medical therapy but we're not really achieving those and so that's that's part of my course and and how I've been there now moving back to a cannabidiol this is a substance and it's commonly referred to as CBD and it comes from him now if we talk about the hemp plant there or the cannabis plant it's really of two varieties on the one hand you've got marijuana that contains THC on the other hand you've got the heme sometimes called industrial hemp that doesn't contain any significant amount of THC but it has most of the cannabidiol so THC makes you high CBD makes you healthy and fundamentally that is the principle that's behind it okay yeah so I think that's what I always like to just bring that up in the beam because it seems like that's the most common misconception like myth breaking number one is that it's not marijuana it's not the stuff that gets you high when you take the spray could so I can tell people no I didn't get high by spraying this stuff under my tongue so you mentioned earlier there too about industrial hemp do we get different types of hemp then well there's several different species well they're not actually species are called cultivars and there we sometimes separate them into cannabis sativa or one of some of the other varieties but it's and a lot of people will focus on that I don't focus on that the sativa is the most common variety and has the highest levels of cannabidiol and there are cultivars that come from the industrial hemp that or from the marijuana plant that provide different combinations of other substances what dr. mushy lumps calls the entourage and these are also very important there are the other cannabinoids that are in the plant is probably about a hundred that are in just this plant alone and there's many others have found in nature but there's also terpenes and these are small fat molecules that contain I have a different blend then the terpenes are the things that you are have strong odor that you encounter so such as pine scent or lemon or grapefruit they actually are some of these compounds these fragrant essential oils that are commonly used that have stimulating properties on the body in addition so within the plant there are also flavonoids and other substances and fight halls that are quite valuable to the body we just haven't really drilled down into these biologic substance in the advantage now the important thing and I want to get across is that that entourage that those extra substances are very valuable in terms of how the CBD is working within the body because that's part of that entourage that makes the really good effects that come from it so yeah it's we don't just want something in isolation completely we want it the other natural forming chemicals around it I guess it's the same as when people say you know eat real food because there's a different effect when you have real food versus a supplement for example and you've just got me thinking there then so when we try extract it you know the the CBD from a hemp plant then we are drawing in all these other entourage chemicals where we and it's not just somehow it depends on how the extraction goes what people that I've been working with the election oil company has been using a supercritical co2 extraction so they're using carbon dioxide as the solvent to pull out the cannabinoids and the fight halls and the flavonoids that come from it and that process gets the the greatest and the fullest extraction of that entourage at the same time whereas it doesn't contain any alcohol or toxic substances that are going to be irritating or cause any problem it's also very healthy for the environment as well ok so that's the top tip there already is look for co2 extracted CBD oil that's the what people need to look for I think that's a key and important thing but the other point that they need to look for is they need to look at the certificate of analysis that's done by a third party that examines exactly what is in the product that they're looking at so you want to know certainly how much cannabidiol is there you want to know if it contains any THC which it should not you want to look at perhaps some of the other cannabinoids that are present in it you want to make sure it doesn't have any toxins or solvents or any biologic substance though so that it has bacteria in it or heavy metals or pesticides and that should all be available when you're looking for a product so you know exactly what's in and then you're not going to cause additional damage as a result of it I just want to go back to I didn't and talk about cannabidiol the molecule it's a it's actually a small molecule it's a small fat molecule it's 22 carbons and so it's not a whole lot different than some of the oils that we take in like medium chain triglycerides or coconut oil it's very similar and the body processes through this fat metabolism mechanism and as a result of that it's it's you seeing a system that we haven't learned a whole lot about but it is key and important to the body's overall function in fact on some of the other molecules that you may be familiar with like omega-3 fats that are DHA and EPA are actually very very similar to cannabidiol and some of the other cannabinoids so that's fascinating way that I know that you're a fan of the low carb diets or the ketogenic diet and that's another reason out I I wanted to get you on because the reason I got interested in the keto world was because of seizure patients and going Wow okay so these these fat molecules these ketones all these ketone bodies they seem to be good for our neurology for our brain and what you're saying here is that the cannabinoid can have been oh yeah okay the cannabinoids in avonlea in a bird's they are sort of following the same pathways and that's you know I'm going to get onto that in later into our discussion about some of the common things to use the CBD oil in but you know for seizure patients so it's it's yeah I want to delve deeper into sort of that field later on into the discussion for sure but just pulling back into then just to finish off with the quality aspect before we get into that so taking hemp oil on its own is not the same as just taking CBD oil so do you I guess are you going to get a much smaller percentage of CBD in hemp oil if someone had to take it as a supplement or is it or the to the same right just if it's if it's considered it's it's hard to say depending it's what the manufacturer really wants it to be so if it's just hemp oil then it's not a whole lot different than olive oil you just you have to look at the individual ingredients and very very low concentrations of any cannabinoids that our president lots of good things there are some omega-3s but it doesn't have a high concentration of any of the cannabinoids that our president now oftentimes we so you have to look very closely at the label because some of the cannabidiol the CBD products are actually being labeled as hemp oil in order to probably get around restrictions and legislation and negative aspects that people associate with hemp so that it's more easily available and I can only explain it that way because you have to look at the label to find out how much cannabidiol is actually located in the product mm-hmm okay so talking physiology stuff again when I watch that documentary I didn't realize that the human body makes can Anna KITT Kenneth can Anna Boyd sorry I told you I was gonna get some guys on this one but yes if you could just explain for handling cannabinoid like molecules it's incredible this was discovered in 1992 and it's it's a comprehensive system appears to be a master controller for many of our other body systems and we really weren't aware of it unfortunately even though we have thousands of articles about this system over over 8,000 articles within PubMed on medical literature we still don't have an awareness by physicians and by the general public about how comprehensive and how important the endocannabinoid system is in our lives it controls and it regulates so many things are our appetite our emotions it handles the neurotransmitters our immunologic system and it's all regulated with a complex system that has its own synthetic material to create the cannabinoids and it has the degradation it also has transporter molecules and it has a number of boosters that work within the synapses of the muscles or in in the in order to make the cannabinoids work differently it's it's controlling the neurotransmitters it's it's regulating the immune system it's working on the hormones and of all places it's working on the gut fabulous in terms of regulation on normalizing the gut when we fast we turn off the endocannabinoid system in terms of that stimulation that may cause some disturbances it's also working on cellular metabolism it's actually shifting cellular metabolism in a very similar way as ketones do okay yes so we do produce them then the body produces a natural amount on its own and that's and a good example for people to visualize that is in breast milk apparently that when the baby's feeding on it and that's when they get that sort of breast milk i when they're so happy afterwards and they didn't they unlatch it's because if the mother has given them a good dose perfect example and you know the canal and the endocannabinoid system controls the implantation of the egg in the uterus as well so we're getting down to the very smallest fertilized egg and the impact of this endocannabinoid system but you know we can get it in the foods that we eat as well and I'm not just talking about cannabis I'm talking about chocolate and truffles um probably other foods as well and it's found in flax the flax cloth actually contains cannabidiol specifically - and that improves healing if you use the flax cloth as a bandage Wow okay I don't know that's a flax cloth for bandaging that that would be quite novel so we've got these these receptors all over over multiple systems our body as you said the gut the brain muscles all over the place and I do find it fascinating because when I when I studied physiology this system was never brought up at all which I find amazing because it is so influential as you said so I guess in what decade was that very I graduate in 2004 so that was the early 2000 so as you said in 1992 it should it I should have already been hearing about it at least reading about in the physiology textbooks that's right you should have and you should be hearing about it now but less than 5% of medical schools in the United States are teaching or informing any of the physicians or the medical students about it at all in fact most of the physicians that I talk to have no clue about the endocannabinoid system and yet it's so highly regulatory as what we talked about the neuro transmitters yeah and I think that comes back to why you're so excited about this whole system because you have a substance now or a range of substances that you can administer to a patient and get different physiological responses I guess out of them which is what we're going to lead onto in it later in the discussion right and what it what turns out Gary is very interestingly is if we can have an endocannabinoid deficiency in fact deficiencies of the balance of the receptors and the agonist have been found in almost all major diseases so if we're talking about depression anxiety PTSD different types of cancers Crohn's disease Huntington's disease all of these diseases actually contain disturbances in the endocannabinoid system whether it's low levels of a an endocannabinoid busy as the agonist or it's high numbers of receptors whatever the balance is it's dysregulated and the thought is that if we could rebalance on that system then we might be able to restore health to the body because the main purpose of the endocannabinoid system is just to maintain homeostasis just to maintain normal not to make you a Superman in any way and so is there any risk of toxicity like taking an overdose of CBD like I take too much and I get a a negative side effect from it all is the body just going to eat reject and eject sort of excess levels if I had to ingest it no there is no toxicity no no person has ever died or have been seriously injured as a result of using cannabidiol can you get side effects from it they're rare and and only on high doses yeah if you look at some of the human studies that were done as much as 1,200 milligrams were used in adults with for example schizophrenia and it had no significant adverse effects whatsoever it's certainly no toxicity it's potentially it could interact with some other medications going through some of the liver pathways but it I haven't actually seen that as the normal doses that I have been recommending for people and I can I feel like I can use normal doses that are less than 200 milligrams of CBD when you use a high quality product that has a full entourage a full spectrum within it and not using isolate type of compounds so money mentioned medications there that that would be one of my questions because any listeners here who are taking it or they might be taking other forms of supplements or medications potentially are there any sort of common interactions that are known about or that that sort of hasn't been highlighted or studied as yet well there's been a lot of questions that I get about and if but if you look at the science on it you find out that there is a relative interference through the livers and cyp or cytochrome 450 system for metabolizing drugs and it has a potential of interfering but only at high doses well over 200 milligrams that's when it starts to to result in that there's only been a couple drugs that have been identified as being changed as a result of using cannabidiol most of those drugs have been associated with epilepsy so you have are using neurotransmitter modulator type of drug like clovers am which is a common drug that's used for epilepsy that can raise using CBD and Clopas am can either raise the level or decrease the level of Clopas am and then it goes the that's true for some of the other anti epileptic types of drugs and i it's and it's also true for some of the neurotransmitter types of drugs that we use for schizophrenia and for parkinson's disease you know l-dopa is essentially is a neurotransmitter dopamine a substitute to give to people if you combine that with CBD you could potentiate at the neurotransmitter level so there there is some synergy that happens with on the other hand there is some very positive interaction as a result of using CBD with some other drugs like low dose naltrexone it actually amplifies the effects of in a complimentary way not to make it excessive but complement antidepressants SSRI type of drugs for depression on it compliments of those particular drugs although it's my firm belief that CBD can correct for my depression in a very short order within a matter of days and then the SSRIs are don't need to be used at all yeah and that's that would be exciting again just for patients here because usually again especially if we're talking antidepressants when someone gets put on them they tend to get put on them for quite a while not just a couple of years so and that's exciting for you too to say like no here's another six more even more Gary and it takes as long as six weeks for an anti depression to work whereas I see changes in people immediately by taking CBD they don't have to wait weeks they can see it in the same day changes in their mood and their behavior and their overall outlook on life fantastic you know and it's a natural substance again at the end of the day which is which I like and so just moving away from medications than supplements would when we were talking earlier about MCTS and other sort of fat soluble vitamins would we're taking CBD with supplements enhanced their bioavailability do you think so I'm just wondering this system is endocannabinoid system is it going to sort of wake up my selves that they're going to be more receptive or sort of yeah I'm just wondering is there going to be a synergy by taking this in combination with other supplements for example I think it CBD is essential that you're taking in Omega threes Omega threes are part of actually are incorporated in the endocannabinoid system they're modified and that's what their real benefit is and so combining them is really important but the to work synergistically and getting better effects in in other types of supplements you know I I think it's important that we supplement with vitamin d3 because we're just not getting the amount of sunshine that we need to the other is iodine we need to be taking that in a popular culinary approach is to take salt and take that the not include the iodine for taste factors but if we're not getting iodine from some source like kelp or seaweed then we're really missing on the essential need for iodine within our bodies it does appear to complement some in some diets particularly a ketogenic diet because it it looks like the two mechanisms seem to overlap and to amplify the benefits from both of those processes right down to the level of the mitochondria and shifting the metabolism in the mitochondria making it more efficient and less reactive oxygen species that will cause inflammation so your top tip earlier was taking a fish oil a good omega-3 oil with your CBD because they those two seem to work very well together and but since you brought up the ketogenic diet and working together that's what it takes me into that the the concept that CBD oil has has made the headlines purpose of recently in the UK with mother who had I don't know if it was just CBD or maybe in CBD plus THC I'm not aware but she had the government basically confiscated from her at the airport and her son required it to stop his seizures and you know they've made the headline news and everything here but when I did my geeking out and research about it I was just blown away like how effective it is for seizure control I mean children who are seizuring every 20 to 30 minutes you give them this oil and suddenly they can become seizure free it's just it's incredible and that you know and that's why I got interested in the ketogenic diet too about seizure control so I guess my first question is that as you said about the synergy between the two do you think there is a neurological like a brain benefit if someone was using heterogenic diet to have better neurology better brain health and taking CBD like the two together the ketones plus the CBD are going to just really help heal your brain well I do I mean I think there's pretty good evidence for it we know that the ketogenic diet has been used for centuries and we just haven't recognized it the number one has been talked about for weight loss and in the mid-1800s but it's also been very effective for diabetes epilepsy as we talked about but there's also evidence for multiple sclerosis in you and Alzheimer's disease and autism I mean all of these conditions respond to a high fat type of diet low carbohydrate um it turns out that when we make ketones we actually signal the body in certain ways we reduce inflammation the signaling of ketones goes right down to the mitochondrial level and to the DNA and modulating and epigenetic changes to the jinnee DNA to shift it to an anti-inflammatory manifestation within the body within the brain it does seem to improve functioning of the brain as I mentioned with MS and Alzheimer's and aunt too and it's using some rather unique pathways and it turns out that CBD CBD is actually working on some of those same pathways so you really are amplifying the maximum benefits that really a fret affect the cognizance the the clarity of both the thought process as well as what I've seen is actually visual improvements that that go along with gamma dial yeah and so you know but I was talking the extreme cases like I watched in the Ted TED talks with the seizure control but you know I think there are going to be a group of people who are on a low carb or ketogenic diet for just general preventing brain fog and just general well-being and that cognition effect you know I want to think well as I get older to and protect my brain health and so you're saying that here you think it would be good to sort of take like a maintenance dose of CBD oil if you want to also protect your brain for the long term I do I think it's essential for diabetics too but you we have inflammation in our body that gets turned on and doesn't turn off we've got to control that inflammation otherwise we lead to things like Alzheimer's and dementia or Parkinson's disease or diabetes worsening diabetes or kidney disease and eye disease all of these things have a basis for as inflammation within the body using CBD could regulate down play down regulate the inflammatory in the immune system such that we don't face those complications I mean a classic is atherosclerosis that is inflammation within the blood vessels and around the blood vessels if we could stop that process based on and based on what I've read and I've looked at it the CBD could stop that particular process and block atherosclerosis in the body and prevent heart attacks as well as preventing stroke okay so the main mechanism here that people will be benefiting from Suns like all these receptors are getting stimulated by by taking in the CBD oil and it's this massive body-wide anti-inflammatory effect that's going from your blood vessels you know near your heart to the back of your eye to in your muscle is and that I guess that comes into where the reported benefits of it art is for things like pain control and and joint pains too because it's that anti-inflammatory effect well that's part of it but it's also the neurotransmitters we have a mechanism where we we respond to a stimulus of some sort we released neurotransmitters the cannabinoid the natural endocannabinoid receptors are there that actually signal the the cell that is releasing the neurotransmitter to signal it to turn down the volume decrease the amount and it's called retrograde type of stimulation and modulation so it turns down the amount of neurotransmitters that are being produced and it reduces that the height and the intensity that's going on so it regulates and it's supposed to modulate the body in a proper way and and I want to just go back to something you said that you talked about stimulating the body it's not always stimulation sometimes it's blocking no it's quite a concert in terms of stimulating on this side and and depressing some other areas and so that's why I like to use the term modulation and so if you've got the endocannabinoid system being modulated and regulated then you can get closer to homeostasis and get away from these extreme cases where you have inflammation or you have irritation and you brought up a really good point about pain so particularly pain there's really two components you have the analgesic effect so this that's neurotransmitters that are going on but you also have the inflammatory phase where you have macrophages that are going into an area that are releasing cytotoxins or cytokines that are irritating and promote inflammation so CBD is actually working on both those lines number one you get that handle jisuk effect from the at the neurotransmitter level and then after a couple days you're really moving into the anti inflammatory area so that you're going to stop the inflammation that's going to lead to disease progression fibrosis and other damage to the organs and so that's small at the at the sites of damage so if you cut yourself at that area there's a whole lot of chemical activity going on like a chemical soup and that exactly and I did read I believe there was a study that was even looking at sciatica so this is now your nerve pathways from your spinal cord down the route and even in those cases there was a benefit from what I if I think I did did read up properly but that's that would also be amazing that we're looking at like central pain pathway so within the spinal cord and the neurology is is is is that been studied yeah I don't know if that is true what I want to read oh well it's being studied but unfortunately there are issues with getting the studies done in humans and and many of the review boards have not allowed human studies and having difficulty getting particular products it's being looked at it's been looked at in animals and there's a lot of what we call preclinical studies but there's not very many that are going on in humans everybody's waiting for a pharmaceutical product to be produced but typically a pharmaceutical products are isolates they're dealing with just cannabidiol and as we talked about before you really need a full spectrum in order to get the balance that you would like to have and the enhancement from the other substances that are located with the cannabidiol hmm and when you were mentioning earlier that when you when you ingested it's going to stimulate or raise the activity of certain chemicals but your bodies also can potentially use it to dampen or quiet down certain chemicals and that's just amazing to hear again that so we're taking this substance in and it is helping regulates helping at homeostasis that their balance that fine balance the body is always trying to and again just to think it's doing that over many systems you know cardiovascular system hormone system gut system so many systems which trying to allow the body to go right okay I'm I'm making too much of this or no I need an ad the tissue level right down to the cellular level so for instance CBD is an excellent anti-inflammatory great the terrific anti form and it'll protect the normal cell from damage as a result of toxins of heavy metals or from injury from chemicals but at the same time if we're dealing with certain types of cells like cancer cells it kills and it promotes the death of cancer cells it an amazing intelligence some people call it an adaptogen something that adapts to the particular situation and Institute and the right kind of response that we need for homeostasis maintaining balance in the body and maintaining health and when I watch that documentary I mentioned earlier the scientist that was the one study was brought up there about how effective it was for children who are undergoing cancer treatment and they just didn't have the the massive negative side effects so in that case their oncologist the cancer doctor was giving them CBD oil and she knew which was placebo or not is what they said in the documentary because she knew like oh wow this this group is just not vomiting and they're not going through all these terrible side effects but this group still is so she she said she needed mmediately which group was taking CBD so wasn't completely like randomized double-blind but it's much more than just um you know holding controlling the symptoms what I've seen in a number of patients is an enhancement of the killing effects of the chemotherapy along with the CBD as well as protecting the normal tissues I've had dozens of patients with cancer using cannabis aisle I really promote people using it during the time they have chemo or radiation because it's going to protect the normal tissues against those side effects with those side effects but also the tissue the normal tissue and it's going to enhance the killing effect of the cancer out of the chemotherapy on the results so is it accepted by oncologists are they either recommending it or they're happy for patients to take CBD oil I don't know of any who are recommending or are using I'm trying to get my foot in the door and talk with them about my experience but so often they're looking for double-blind controlled studies that which are very hard to produce and really require a pharmaceutical company with the deep pockets in order to do the kind of studies that they would be looking for on the other hand I try to I talk to patients and I try to empower them with the understanding that this these substances are food products and that they're safe they don't they're not toxic they don't have any significant adverse effects to them so that if they're taking a food nobody's really going to object to the food result with using a food and try to empower patients so that they are doing the research finding out from themselves for themselves and maybe bring in and definitely bring it up with their doctor but not succumbing to the the negative information that might come from a lot of physicians particularly even in the oncology area unless they feel that there is some sort of possible interaction but even then I've not seen a negative interaction with oncology and with the chemo and radiation therapy that of any concern on the other hand I've seen some great remissions people doing very very well recovering and maintaining a remission for a number of years well any patients are a little bit concerned or cancellations I guess they can maybe somehow contact you just to find out for some more information because yes people then that's why I went sit interview you know it's people like yourself to help to educate listeners and to educate people who are on the Hunts they're on their own ending equals one sort of research discovery of what they want to do with their own body and their own health so we've talked about seizures we've talked about cancer I mean these are all you know big medical events - and that another common one which you already touched on earlier was the SSRIs you know the antidepressant drugs so I see a another common form that why people want to take it is for anxiety and depression and you would say that it is good if you if you're prone to to those symptoms then a dose of CBD oil will be a part of your journey to help you recover oh absolutely you know I love to talk to people with anxiety because in 95% of the time I can control it and regulate it or they can using can dial and it happens immediately then I don't have to wait a while I mean they can get away from the benzodiazepines that the valium type of drugs that people are using that can be addictive and can have some significant side effects with it so using the CBD you have to adjust it according to your particular need but like with the product that you're using you probably need to adjust it according to your symptoms and then what I tell people is to titrate it or just increase or decrease the dose according to how you respond with it there is no toxic dose you can take as much as you want it is a food product primarily so use what you need to control your symptoms and conserve where you want to conserve for expenses expense wise and know that there are long-term benefits not only the immediate but there are long-term benefits that are going to happen physiologically within your whole body and yeah we haven't gotten to the dosage stuff I want to do get I do want to get into that because yeah when whenever it comes to a natural substance I always trying to think of what is the clinical dosage that's needed you know if I'm a big guy this is a small lady do we need different dosages or different situations as you meant and how we respond to it so what for the extreme cases I'm calling them extreme but you know for these children that were having these multiple seizures in a day what kind of dosage level are we talking about there so for kids and for seizures I have a general guideline of about 1 milligram per kilogram and and this is a bit of the exception I usually don't go by the kilogram weight because everybody has a different level of endocannabinoid deficiency and if they're deficient if we can replace that or modify that then they'll get back to normal however in this particular area it's really common to use the per kilogram so for most kids even adults one milligram per kilogram is a great area a great target for a therapeutic dose that I find 70 percent of people do respond to some respond less than that some respond require higher levels in certain types of syndrome they may require as many as 10 milligrams per kilogram but those are exceptional and I have only run across those on rare occasions and so it is not very very prevalent but for everybody I want them to start with and I recommend you start with the standard serving whatever is on the bottle and then but under it but but double the dose if they're not feeling like they're getting control of their particular symptoms and then double it again until they find a therapeutic dose that makes them that they can feel that they feel some of the changes it changes like a relaxation over the face and their muscles of the face irax relaxation of the voice where the voice will drop down an octave they might start talking faster they'll show some humor and conversation they'll be more socially inclined there'll be a rising energy that they'll have as well so a lot of the and there's also the analgesic effect if they're in pain you'll see a diminishment of the pain to some degree I also like to have them check their vision because um consistently I see an initial and dramatic effect with a sharpening and improvement and a clarity of the vision um as they're viewing distant objects so looking at trees and leaves in some distance out of window the colors seem to pop they go into more detail with it and there's not only clarity of vision there's a clarity of thought where memories improve a sharpen their thoughts are quicker and physiologically we also see changes in performance where they're able to tolerate an aerobic type of exercise much greater able to hold their breath for a longer period of time and diminish any type of soreness --is that you have from working out yeah so I listen to one of your previous podcast episodes and you brought up the vision aspect of lat - and you know I've only been taking my CBD oil for 710 days it's not really that long but the vision thing I actually think there's something to it I mean I've been looking into the distance you know over the summer now I live near the sea and I said I do notice that the mountain range across the ocean from us looks clear and when I look at the the fields and the animals and the fields it's there's something to it and I think you're aren't you you're definitely onto something there were you saying that it has a vision component to it so even if anything and yeah if you've got some visual issues why not just give it a try just just see what it does so you actually I call it the high High Definition mode so you go into HD into your visual now it doesn't last necessarily for all day but you do see some improvements and I've had to caution people about um you're correcting their lenses changing their glasses while they're on CVD because actually they tend to have to go backwards to their previous prescription because their eyes have improved yeah again just to think because your eyes are an extension of your brain and so here's the substance again that's helping the neurology the brain you know the retina whatever is happening in there from this chemical effect is endocannabinoid system I just find that fascinating or what we want good visual health so if you go good visual house it's it's doing something - neurology I just love that idea so but what about sleep how have you done with sleep have you noticed an improve sleep quality yeah my I would say I've got I wear the the aura ring for tracking and I would say my Bren is is is definitely better and less turning at night too so I've got two young kids and they do wake me up very early because they like to wake up early with a light but no I you know looking at that I would say to ya and more peaceful sleeps or less less sort of wakefulness during sleep and more REM are the two big things I think are basically what people report to me consistently now it doesn't put you to sleep in fact there's another one of these paradoxes is that it can actually be wake you up if so if you take it when you take it you can actually get stimulated so that you're alert your mind is going and moving but then it also improves your sleep so it's quite a paradox I ask people not to take it right before sleep within two hours because it can have that activating effect and maybe stimulate them so that they don't sleep another thing have you noticed vivid dreams this is a common affective CBD yeah and that well I think that comes into the that REM component I'm yeah my dream so I'll pretty good I'm normally a good dream or too so hard to say if that's different but you know that the data is showing that yeah REMS looking good so no sleep quality I haven't had not normally a bad sleeper but there's definitely something to it there too and I feel good in it you know my I'm so new to but that's what I'm so excited about the stuff to just as you eyes I don't know it's in seven to ten days I I think I can feel quite a nice different in my body and it's not a an extreme change either it's just this good feeling and you're just getting back to normal I mean he's getting to you you get to be all that you can be and your relationships with your wife and your children are really positive you're not blowing up you don't have the tenseness that goes on you're conversing you you want to talk to people you want to interact with people very very positive events that are happy you just you're just being human and what about what about empathy have you noticed yourself being particularly empathetic for people who are suffering or having difficulty normally empathetic because that's just my nature but you know what I would say is that so I did a neurofeedback training experiment earlier this year too and so there was also learning about meditation and and trying to put yourself in that better place you know the empathy place in the gratitude place and so you you know with meditation you're always trying to train to sort of be oh aware and know when you're being in that place and I would say the CBD oil enhances that practice so I would see a benefit of adding CBD oil with your meditative practice or if you were going through a neurofeedback training protocol we had the EEG on your head it would help enhance your neurology I'm seeing the benefits here to that effect I would completely agree I'd like to see more some studies done on it and like to hear more reports like yours because I I'm very I feel very positive about it it could make a big difference for people you know people who also with post-traumatic stress disorder have a lot of behavioral disturbances that they go on and CBD used at the same time of those experiences could block many of the adverse effects that come along with PTSD it actually blocks this reconsolidation phase that's involved with this broken record effect of remembering these little experiences at the same time they people with PTSD can't forget they have a broken mechanism for extinguishing bad feelings and with CBD that opens it up and so combining CBD with therapeutic in engagement and reliving those experiences could could dampen that block those PTSD back the effects and actually put these people into remission and so with your background in the Army PTSD is a big thing and I mean you've served in Wars too so it I don't know if you're allowed to say about is the US Army experimenting with CBD to help veterans oh and they've been experimenting with on PTA for PTSD in a number of different ways but there there is some limited studies that have been allowed by some of the universities on the East Coast particularly I believe University of Pennsylvania is doing some studies on it but there are not real vigorous studies going on and they look like they'll be years before they'll be able to be used in some way on the other hand I've got my own study that I'm doing for veterans in my area and we're using CBD and we're finding those particular benefits that I talked about where people are able to get their PTSD under major control in very short period of time a couple weeks and actually put them into remission so that are more functional in their society and their interactions and they're healthier all the way around so with your interest in the ketogenic diets who have you ever seen anyone taken exogenous ketone assault or an ester and take CBD oil so I'm just wondering if you can take an exogenous ketone and take CBD and get a little boost of some sort well I think you can nothing elaborate but looking at MCT so most of the exogenous ketones are in usually from maybe an MCT derivative and that can be used as are you using some shorter change or some saturated fats that enhances the absorption through the gut it goes into the lymphatic systems and as you know the lymphatic system doesn't go first pass through the liver so you avoid the first pass effect there's less degradation of CBD in that particular process but you're also providing the building blocks for ketones and you've got that particular benefit arm what's called the there are nuclear receptors called the P power receptors and the ketones are working on those in the developing ketones from using the MCT along with using CBD which is also going to activate and stimulate these people receptors it's slightly different variation but there both working on that nuclear component making epigenetic changes that really enhance metabolism and cell function while reducing inflammation and then with people who are doing fasting for tougher chief for cellular cleaning would you recommend they take CBD during fasting even though it might break fast I don't know or what they take it after fasting well I think it actually is in is enhance the CBD effects are quite enhanced with fasting on the CBD mechanisms seem to improve I noticed that when I'm fasting that there seem to be accentuated in terms of the particular benefit so lower doses are needed you're getting you know when you go into a fasting state there's actually a kind of a high that you you get with fasting a a change in your metabolism and you the speed of your brain processing and function probably it related to some of the ketones that are going on but but overall functioning and there's a dampening of the endocannabinoid system in in the gut and in the brain so that everything's working in in a very effective way in an efficient way and so combining those two does seem to show an enhancement and sensitivity and so you could be a major benefit and then adding some exogenous ketones or saturated fats could have the advantage of making that even more effective with the endocannabinoid system and using cannabidiol so what are your recommendations when are the best times to take it should I take it with a fatty meal or before a fatty meal or after a fatty meal it sounds like having some sort of fat is gonna help with the absorption level better exactly I believe that should be taking with fat saturated fat may be best so you get something like in butter or cream and then you but it also could come from MCT oil you're going to get an effective better more effective sorption don't have to take a lot that just perhaps a tablespoon is all all that might be needed in order to stimulate that improved absorption pathway and that you know I don't tell people that it needs to be taken at a very specific time or in a very specific schedule I mean practically speaking I like to help have my patients kind of figure out what's best for them what fits within their lifestyle if they have to go to school and they're away then they're going to be taking it when they have a chance to and I also want them to as a food product to take it as often as they need to to control their symptoms rather than sticking to a rigid rigid schedule so getting away from the idea that this is a pharmaceutical drug that needs to be taken on a specific schedule and then the combining with feet with fat some some saturated fat or some fat with a meal small meal but don't take it with a large meal unfortunately there with the relaxation that occurs where that can sometimes relax the esophageal sphincter that could allow for a little bit of reflux during that mealtime okay yeah well I've just experiment a little bit and just anecdotal stuff but taking it just before having some good coffee seems to me the coffee feel nicer too so I don't think it combines with the caffeine and it's working amplifying the the hormonal effects and the neurotransmitter effects that can caffeine stimulate hmm so when I was looking at all the different products available they a lot of it looks at percentages like I've got a 3% substance and luckily its co2 extracted too but could you just explain then as a consumer what what should I be looking for if I just won't say General Health is 3% and Apple should I have a 5% and 8% how do I know which percentage I should aim for I just focused because all the products are different they're packaged different you've got to do calculations to figure out how many milligrams of CBD so generally I'm looking at the number of milligrams of CBD and counting those and so and but it does make a difference in terms of the product because some of it is more bioavailable than others for instance the election all liposome product is is structured so that it has an improved bioavailability that maybe as much as five or seven times what you might find in an oil tincture and so you have to consider that so you start with the serving size that is recommended on there but double and triple in order to get the effect on the control of your particular symptoms you should get those effects and those benefits right away so if you're not getting those benefits you're not seeing any changes in yourself then you you've got to increase the dose or you may need to find in the product and from what I understand that it seems the best way is sublingual so underneath your tongue yeah do you get immediate effects by doing it that way I say main it is probably the most effective in through the the oral route um you get really good absorption through the mucous membranes and then then the gut is sort of second but you can also this can also be vaporized in the vaporizing delivers 95% efficiency and vaporizing there are capsules available and they take a little bit of time take a couple hours before you feel the effects of those particular capsules and then there's different forms that you're probably maybe using a tincture of some sort that's mixed in with another oil whether that's olive oil or MCT or mcg yeah that's what's on the bottle here and one other way you can use it as topically and I frequently encounter people who have an injury or burn or a laceration or painful area and I have them rub it right into that area of pain and get relief within a few minutes yeah well I actually have been doing that where I have a little mark on my skin here and after I've sprayed there's a little bit of residue and I just take dinner and I've rubbed it and I've noticed a change that was random I was speaking with my wife today but then she's like are you really seeing something I don't know you just you know you talked about your vision thing and now your skin and you know that's that that's the common thing that I get feedback is they say whiz this is this placebo effect you told me I might feel something like this I I think it's [ __ ] Bo it's it's just my imagination that these things are getting better I don't completely understand that when you have symptoms before and then they're go away after you take this food then why wouldn't you attribute it to the food but more often I get placebo that I've hypnotized them into thinking that they've made these improvements mm-hmm so it's good to know then so just coming back to understanding with the dosage why's that yeah I can play with the different dosages there's no problem I mean we're not you know the biggest dosage I think I saw but does it go up to something like 20% or 40% a tincture I mean are those only really use for those seizure patients those cancer patients is that what they need to take well there are some but I don't use I don't recommend high doses of CBD for cancer patients and the epilepsy I there are a few that have - hey take some high concentration but I always recommend a full-spectrum product and you don't usually get the full spectrum in those really really concentrated product so I'm I'm not enthusiastic about that and there's that's so rare I don't see those cases very often and but I do make I do just continue to adjust the dosage and maybe use some compliments compliments to the endocannabinoid system like the Omega threes or maybe some of the other cannabinoids that are available like baby carrier phlegm and which is actually it comes from broccoli extracts I mean correction that comes actually comes from hops and basil and oregano so it's one of those oils that we get in a lot of the foods stuff now in the study that I'm doing here we're combining it with whole body vibration so that it's a exercise stimulation that also goes into it so as part of the improvement of the individual they need to be considering all those healthy aspects like exercise diet sleep quality meditation all those things that we've known about and a good healthy diet hopefully incline people towards a ketogenic diet but you people have also had great success using a a vegetarian diet that excludes modified products that are have been adjusted or fabricated in some way so it you know this it just is good to know then so it doesn't mean the the stronger the dose that a company might sell the the better is going to be for an individual for general health they don't you don't have to think like that you can go for those lower percentages and and as you said just adjust and titrate and just see how how you respond and how you feel for whatever you're achieving so I just the last one I want to ask about is just diabetes then because that does seem quite exciting I mean I've had a lot of guests on the show who've talked about different about insulin resistance and diabetic control in there and so how does a CBD oil help someone who's got say type 2 diabetes or my question was even type 1 diabetes I was asking it some type 1 diabetes patients like with this insulin resistance do you know anyone who's taking CBD oil who's he's doing like a continuous glucose monitor check or something that what what does it actually do to their body well I dunno I have an eight-year-old child who's using CBD and he has had some dramatic improvement his blood Sugar's have dropped at 30 points he's general he's gaining weight after being depleted he has type 1 but he's in the honeymoon phase meaning that he still has some insulin production and he's been able to cut out his long-acting insulin and he just uses short-acting insulin along with a ketogenic diet because diabetes is a carbohydrate disease and you got to stop the carbohydrates in order to control the diabetes now obviously if you're taking insulin you're gonna have to be careful about that but any diabetic whether it's type 1 or type 2 should be reducing the carbohydrates to the lowest level CBD acts as to improve the signaling within the body and reduce the the inflammation and protect different cell types against damage from elevated glucose so it's protecting the eyes is with kidneys on the liver on the brain all of those areas are being protected whereas it's also shifting the metabolism so that there are actually more glucose receptors on the muscles that are active and taking up more glucose and leaving less behind inside the bloodstream there's a number of protective factors that go into this and I think that they are going to be enough to reduce the complications of diabetes that we would normally see even including atherosclerosis and you touched on that earlier about the research component and it's not really been tested in humans is this more the legality issue that in different countries that cannabis itself even if it's hemp or marijuana is being blocked at a legislative level that that's the reason these human studies aren't being conducted well in the United States it's actually being blocked at the administrative level the the current administration is blocking the law actually blocking the laws that an attempts to legalize the use of of hemp and hemp products that have come from the Congress Congress has actually passed two laws that said basically you can use industrial hemp with very little amounts of THC forever whatever you want to use it for and the Department of Drug Enforcement Agency is blocking that and reinterpreting the legislature law now they're not supposed to do that but that's what's happening at the present time and the DEA is insisting that Congress be more specific in their laws and congressmen have written the DEA said my goodness we have told you very specifically we don't understand so there's a barriers that are within the administration it's less so within the legislature is just getting those two areas to understand the the huge potential benefits for helping patients as well as the financial saving because if we substitute cannabidiol for a lot of our health care problems we would be able to take care of the opioid epidemic we'd be able to solve Alzheimer's disease and dementia we'd be able to preserve liens from traumatic brain injury get people back to work and functioning for PTSD and a host of other problems yeah well I think anyone who's been listening up to this point hopefully they're excited about it as we are and yeah I I would suggest to anyone listening to this try it out you know see how it goes I've had a very positive experience so far the the information you shared dr.

thank you hello again everybody and welcome back to your probe of cannabis in today's video I'm going to be showing you how to make CBD butter to cook with but first before we get in today's video if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you're new here to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you would please give the video a thumbs up to show your support so today we were making a very simple recipe on how to make CBD butter and first of course we're going to be using our hemp flour that we grew this summer out in the fields and this is our cherry wine variety we have plenty of it and it comes in at 17.4% CBD so I'm looking forward to using this in our butter recipe the other thing of course that we always feature and pretty much every single one of our cooking videos and we're happy to have a whole bunch more stuff to use now is our magical butter machine of course this is what our staple is to make everything easy clean no mess and it's just a dedicated cannabis cooking device the other thing that we'll be using today which is the first for all of our videos is the magical butter calm D carb box with thermometer this is going to kind of be a game-changer for us because I have received comments like is there another way not to use a 1-room foil or a household pan yes magical butter calm does make a decarboxylated or oven to 250 degrees at 230 degrees for about 30 minutes and now that's your preference on what your temperature is how much you wanted to deke our but the cool thing about this is it has an internal thermometer that you plug right into the box so you know what the temperature of those flowers are at all times now for today's recipe we're also going to be using magical butter coms butter tray mold so that we can get the sticks of butter right back to they were prior to making our CBD butter and in today's recipe we're just going to be used unsalted organic butter that we purchased from our local grocery store and we're going to be using four sticks of butter and approximately 26 grams of decarboxylated hemp flour and of course you could always add raw material to to get that CBD and it really depends on where you want it to be moving for today's purposes we're just doing D carbon so that's for today's recipe we're gonna go gather all the materials I'm gonna get the pre oven preheated get our flour into the box and explain to you what exactly you need to do to make CBD butter today we're gonna be making that butter and all we're gonna need to do is now that we have our D carb flour and again guys you know the drill this flour is in the oven for about 30 minutes at 250 degrees we're gonna go ahead and put all this flour in try to get all of it in you know the drill I can never get it all in then we're gonna get our melted butter and put that in again guys two cups of butter okay now that we have our two cups of butter and our 26 grams of D card flour we're gonna go ahead and turn on our magic butter machine so we're going to be doing a hundred and sixty degrees for two hours and we will see you guys in two hours so this time I took the liberty of straining the butter it's again no difference in any of our oil videos and you guys want to see how we strain that go ahead and check out that video I'll leave it up top so you can check out that video but essentially I've already strained the butter and I've cooled it down and taken the sticks out but I wanted to show you the simplicity of this magical butter tray because when you go to pop out your butter it is a literal stick of butter and that would that's what makes it really easy guys you can see the numbers imprinted at the bottom and it just makes it really easy to use in any recipe so you can look for this to be and a lot of our recipes in the future but that's all I had for you guys today I hope you enjoyed this butter recipe it's really simple guys and if you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below and I will gladly answer them if you haven't yet check us out on Facebook patreon Instagram and all other things including a bar website and if you guys are interested in any of our products you can always visit our be alternatives comm and our partnership with them and most of our flour can be found on that website that's all I have for you guys today I will see you in another video take care", "8H9zrtU3r2w": "hey everyone my name is jenna i'm coming in here to talk to you guys about anxiety today now personally this is something i've struggled with since i've been a small child and i'm sure everyone watching this video has dealt with it at some point in life whether it's you know chronic and you deal with it every day or it's something that comes up that's situational especially with all the changes that are going on on in the world i thought it'd be really kind of beneficial to chat about it and kind of give some tools and tips that have helped me my kids my clients um and all that stuff so let me dive right into it now if you're dealing with kind of anxiety that's right in the moment like you're really hyped up it's really stressful your panic and all that stuff it's really important kind of break that energy in which when you're in that moment in that mindset it's really really hard to do so something that i really focus on that helps me and you know i've given and helped my children with and all that stuff is working with your five senses so your sight your smell your hair your taste and your touch now for me um smell is really something that i go to so it's either either i'm opening up the front door and breathing in that fresh air or kind of working with an essential oil my favorite go-to is vanilla because for me it's just really calming lots of people like to use lavender but again everyone's different with what tool and tip works for them um also listening to something you know you know it could be chanting meditation or even hip-hop and your you know your favorite song that you just want to kind of break it down to and kind of like just get out of that anxious state and that focus where your mind's at um taste is also a really good one either it's um something healthy or something really comforting to you to kind of just instead of focusing on the anxious energy and thoughts going to your senses whatever is working for you also touch is a really good thing for me it's something always soft some people use kind of a hard texture or a rough texture to kind of break up that anxious energy to something else but you know i always say use what works for you everyone's different everyone has different you know stressors and anxiety and situational you know things that come up that bring it to you so it's really important that you kind of fill your toolbox with what works for you now if you're dealing with anxiety like every day whether it's you know kind of not not you're not in panic mode but it's more kind of baseline there and it just it's just what your your system is it's really important to kind of get out of that funk or that you know cycle is going back to the basics and when i say basics is really self-care basics now for me you know that's working on my my sleep working on my healthy intake hydration mindset and a few things that you can do with that is like when you're going to have a shower simple things not complicated and all that stuff but simple things when you're going to have a shower visualize that shower the water coming down is cleansing it cleansing your mind body soul and just really kind of washing away that stressful energy and just kind of letting it you know rinse cleanse all that stuff another thing is listening to meditations when you're you're when you're trying to sleep at night and your your mind's racing put on a meditation i always say guided meditation um because then you're not sitting there trying to think of what think or what not to think about guided meditation kind of makes you focus on their voice and what they're visualizing for me at night time i love somatic drumming that really and the guided meditation behind it it really kind of suits my soul also with hydration make sure you're drinking enough water that is easy to stay but you know it's really hard sometimes for people some people don't like the taste of water and then you can infuse your water with fresh fruits if you don't like that go to a pure juice and kind of infuse your water with that um what else healthy eating you know you don't have to dive in and be like clear out everything and go full hard in but you know have a smoothie in the morning if you don't like smoothies have a salad but just something basic to try to get your system back on a healthier path because living with that anxious energy all the time is really really hard on your system and your mindset um something that's really helped me throughout the year is this personal development listening to podcasts or um or audiobooks i'm not really like i can't really sit there and read a book i'm a mom of three kids can't i don't have time to do that but listening to an audiobook or a podcast while i'm going throughout my day really is helpful you know it kind of really takes me on a different path and it's also very healing um also you know exercise if you can't go out and you know lift weights at the gym or whatever put on a youtube go stretch it out put on music and just dance something to really elevate um your vibrations and kind of shift that energy anxious energy into something that anxious energy wants to move it doesn't really want to sit there too much if you're during the day um it wants to move so it's either dancing cleaning something like that um also really working on your environment if you're in a cluttered environment you know your system is going to kind of react to that if you have a calm clear clean environment your system is going to automatically feel a little bit calmer so again don't fully overwhelm yourself just take baby steps little baby steps because if you think of a ladder right i always give this analogy if you think of a ladder letters have little kind of baby steps to get up if you take those baby steps out of the ladder you're going to have a really hard time to get up there and it's not going to be stable and safe so take those little baby steps and appreciate acknowledge them appreciate them put your blinders on to other people and what they're doing and really focus on your journey and celebrate your baby steps um now one thing for me that's really helped when i was in a really anxious stressed out kind of i'd say dark moment in life um i was really looking for something to help soothe me you know i've tried lots of things and and it just wasn't working so i did turn to cbd oil and the reason why i picked thought cloud basically because there's so many cbd oils on the market right like you could feel overwhelmed of what to pick what's good what's not the reason why i picked um thought cloud is because right away you know i'm a researcher i went and looked on their website and right away um i saw it was reconfused now for me you know someone who is going to get um and going on my reiki journey and becoming a reiki master i saw the recant fuse i'm like whoa you know alignment okay let me look into this company and then i saw you know their reports and how pure and amazing their product is another thing that really kind of got me in there is the owner of the company leo he would go on on live on his instagram or make videos and talk about his day talk about things that he's struggled with and how he's overcome them um and it was really kind of i really enjoyed you know look i looked forward watching his videos every day and kind of connecting with him you know when you look at somebody in the eyes you connect to their soul and their energy and i just i felt like all of those things kind of aligned for me and that was the right company to go go with and i'm so glad i did because three years later i'm still using their products now the main reason why i'm using their products on top of those things are their products are good they work so it's kind of like you know a no-brainer there all those things that made me think okay let me try this company and then you know three years deep and i'm still going hard with them because it's something that i include in my daily practice with nighttime i take their nighttime series that really help kind of calm me and help me sleep so yeah i hope those tips were helpful um if you want to connect and reach out to me i'm on instagram my instagram is optimal journey i also have another instagram that's skin care beauty diy and also if you're looking into you know getting some thought cloud products and testing them out my discount code um for you to save money is discount code skin really simple skin that's it um and yeah so hopefully this video was helpful for you i'm looking forward to whoever wants to connect and reach out and just you know wishing you all the best and namaste thank you you", "cZjkY2GdW10": "what is the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil we get so many different questions like what is the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil and does hemp oil contains CBD oil these phrases describe different products so if you're asking questions like this make sure you watch this video so that you can learn the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil both CBD oil and hemp oil are unique products that benefit our health but do serve in different ways traditionally they come from many different parts of the cannabis plant and therefore have different uses and benefits with the CBD trend it has become more difficult to identify the true uses of CBD oil and hemp oil as many of these CBD companies have used the term hemp oil to market their products this definitely can complicate the space when it comes to the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil however most companies don't mean to complicate the market but rather companies have chosen to use the term hemp oil as opposed to CBD oil to avoid problems with the FDA as a tip if a company does market their CBD oil as hemp oil look for terms like CBD cannabinoids or hemp extract in other areas on the label this means the products contain CBD [Music] given this confusion we think it's absolutely essential to educate consumers on the differences between CBD and hemp oil the main active ingredient in CBD oil is of course CBD this compound is popular in the holistic wellness community its main role is to regulate our endocannabinoid system which is responsible for maintaining proper internal balance although more research needs to be done there is some professional support for CBDs usefulness in helping to curb stress to provide joint muscular and neurological relief and to support better sleep on the other hand what we historically know as hemp oil now more commonly referred to as hemp seed oil does not contain any cannabinoids like CBD but instead is a rich blend of nutrients including a high concentration of protein polyunsaturated acids and vitamin E it is also one of the few oils to contain both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids which are recognized as essential to the human diet these desirable but rare fatty acids are found in a ratio that is thought to be optimal according to some nutritionists the high vitamin E content of hemp oil is another beneficial attribute vitamin E is an antioxidant which helps to protect your cells from free radicals its impact on the skin make it a staple in the cosmetic world so how do you saw CBD oil verse hemp oil CBD oil and hemp oil come from different parts of the cannabis plant CBD oil uses the whole plant while hemp oil comes from its seeds more recently because of the growing CBD market hemp oil derived from the seed of the plant is now more commonly referred to as hemp seed oil CBD oil is made from a variety of parts of the mature hemp plant including its stalks and flowers in order to get CBD and other compounds from the plant they must be separated in a process called extraction most reputable producers use ethanol extraction or the co2 extraction process because neither involved the use of any toxic compounds during extraction useful parts of the hemp plant are usually pelletized and then a solvent like ethanol or gases like co2 are used to pull out the CBD and other vital nutrients the result is an oil with a high CBD content after this it is rigorously tested to make sure that there are no unwanted substances and the level of essential compounds is where it needs to be hemp oil on the other hand now refer to as hemp seed oil is made only from the hemp seeds and is created by a process called cold pressing this is similar to the creation of other carrier oils like sunflower seed oil or jojoba oil this method is used to help preserve all the raw nutritious contents of the seeds the hemp seeds which contain up to 50% their weight in oil Eydie shelled chilled and squeezed for their content the product is an unrefined green colored substance one of the main differences between CBD oil and the hemp oil is that hemp seed oil is usually made using the seeds of industrial hemp plants and does not contain any CBD or other cannabinoids like THC [Music] so what are they uses between CBD oil and hemp oil CBD oil is mainly used in the holistic or alternative wellness space to help balance the body's internal systems while hemp oil now considered hemp seed oil is mainly used in food and skincare products hemp derived CBD oil has high CBD content and low THC content below 0.3 percent this makes it great for harnessing potentially therapeutic properties of CBD without any of the high or mind-altering effects of THC many proponents claim that it can be helpful with a number of chronic conditions such as anxiety and epilepsy some athletes also use it to support exercise induced inflammation and recovery CBD oil is also said to be effective as a sleep aid today it can be found already in a variety of forms such as capsules tinctures and topicals as scientists continue to study the impact of CBD we can expect even wider applications in the future hemp oil on the other hand when derived from the seed of the plant has become a hit in the kitchen that is because of its high nutritious value it's been on the shelves of health food stores for quite some time now and is considered a superfood by many you can find it being used in smoothies and even as a nutritious substitute for olive oil additionally hemp oil is used extensively in the cosmetic industry it's a key ingredient in products such as shampoos conditioners lotions soap as it's fatty acid content helps to protect our skin and preserve moisture you can also find hemp oil included in some paints plastics and lubricants as a substitute for petroleum-based oil thanks for watching and if you'd like to try and see the incredible results of CBD oil for yourself check out the link in the description box

cannabis giving you a little bit of background of the summary of the story of charlotte's web as charlotte here is thought to be one of the great contributors to science to be able to really help support and really start a whole wave looking really at cbd for potential medical treatments so first off well who is charlotte figgy here and we see her pictured here she was a child with uh catastrophic type of epsilopsy she became a symbol of positive impacts that cbd can have on individuals particularly young children in this example charlotte had juvederm which is a rare form of epilepsy sadly she did pass away in april 7th in the year 2020 at only the age of 13. her cause of death is thought to be pneumonia but in that short life that she did have she did have a great contribution here to the cannabis industry so she had that rare form of epilepsy which is basically that duvet syndrome which is a kind of seizures that start very early on during the first year of life this is kind of showing brain wave patterns of a seizure child at the age of six was having a seizure about every 30 minutes so not only were they potentially very severe but they were reoccurring at a very short intervals so over two years her parents paige and matt had tried many different things they sought out a lot of advice and medical kind of advice from different doctors and they tried a whole bunch of different things you know diet alterations acupuncture drugs with really no changes from any of the above really sadly at the peak trout was having about 300 seizures a week or about two every hour and at certain times was not talking not moving and then doctors really were looking at some very experimental type options however half a world away matt the father was deployed to afghanistan and he was researching online and he found evidence that candice may help reduce seizures so it's kind of just he was in afghanistan and a lot of areas where potentially cannabis or certain forms of cannabis may have originated there's a kind of connection there we thank him for his service as well uh and this this leads us to the stanley brothers so how are they involved with charlotte's story well this daily brothers were marijuana growers in colorado and they were cross-breeding a stream of marijuana that's high in cbd and low in thc and remember thc is that psychoactive ingredient their focus was to breed down the thc and breed up in concentration the cbd they were able to achieve a cb level of about 21 while still mean maintaining a thc level under one percent and that's a very stark difference between those two cannabinoid levels the reason was not for recreational smoking which is typically associated with thc but for the potential for medical benefits so the stanley brothers were really seeking the highest grade of kind of medical cannabinoids and here looking at the cbd breeding that up in concentration while reducing the thc levels so we're looking at this kind of flower extract extraction so the mother went to a local denver colorado dispensary and purchased some high cbd variety cannabis the owner were actually surprised of the request since nobody really wanted it because it didn't have really any effect that high cbd level doesn't really have that psychoactive high that low thc and high cbd really lacks that recreational kind of psychoactive high thought to be potentially with what was called r4 at the time had a cbd level of 17.61 and a thc level under one percent of only 0.76 percent however it is important to note that even 0.76 percent by the current uh 2018 farm bill would still be considered federally illegal or marijuana at that point and the mother after taking the flower home extracted the cbd from that flower kind of extracted that particular compound now the impact of the actual treatment the day that she was given that charlotte was given the cbd oil treatment under the tongue she did not have a seizure that day which continued into the night and beyond overall it was a sharp decline in seizures it was very notable and again very positive here she went from having 300 seizures a week to only having one a week just from this cbd treatment she went from being on a feeding tube this is charlotte to eating on her own and she started talking and also walking on her own so this really was an eye-opening experience at large in the medical industry as well that cbd treatment may really provide a lot of potential when we're looking at seizures at this in this example so looking at does charlotte's web equals cw2a as this was according to the u.s patent and trademark office joe stanley filed a joel stanley's filed a patent application in may 2018 on behalf of his company also named charlotte's web so in the public documents stanley describes a plant type capable of producing 6.24 cbd content and 0.27 percent thc content so you're looking at these numbers and from what i just pre described say it's much lower but keep in mind here this is staying with or under that federal limit of 0.3 percent thc so of course the cbd conservation was reduced but still having 6.24 it's a very high producing cbd strain here and still staying with under that federal limit so the patent was actually approved in july of 2019 and if you search it on the internet you likely can probably find this patent the new cultivar c w 2 a was asexually reproduced via stem cuttings of vegetative and or flowering plants and cloning by the inventor and the inventors greenhouses nurseries fields and our facilities in colorado springs colorado according to the patent asexual clones from the original source have been tested in greenhouses nurseries fields the properties of each clone from its cultivar were found to be transmissible by such asexual reproduction the cultivar is stable and reproduces true to type in successful generations of asexual reproduction so this kind of disproves or shows here that it wasn't just a one-off plant it wasn't just one unique individual it is reproducible through asexual reproduction typically using vegetative propagation known as clones so plant patent specifics well the patent was issued by cw holdings as a plant patent not a broad broader utility patent so we want to be careful in the definition between those two this means it is good only for legal protection against a competitor growing the same cultivar from clone even though this may be overall limited protection it is groundbreaking and that is the first and only plant patent for hemp cultivar issued within the united states so this again shows you what the utility patent covers i'll give you kind of some descriptions here as far as looking at you know the utility patent this case dependent and kind of include all of this phenotypes cultivar just to give you that general overview here but the plant patent specifics here and just keep in mind that this is not a broader utility patent they were just looking for that kind of way of protecting for a competitor growing the same clone the value of having this patent here you know what's the advantage what's why would go through this process the patent doesn't prevent others from developing their own strain of symbol characteristics so that's an important note the goal from the breeder standpoint though is to protect the strain you have put time into and resources and developing protect your specific strain here the patent does not prevent a competitor competition in general but can provide an advantage in the market so that's why it's advantageous for them to go through and have that patent for their plant the specifics of charlotte's web so is a sativa-based strain with the state 13 cbd however the patent does state officially 6.24 cbd and that thc below that zero point three percent these unique uh and proprietary genetics are used by charlotte's web the company to create extracts for a variety of health and wellness products contrary to popular belief charlotte's web products are hemp derived and are non-intoxicating they lack any strong levels of thc new consumers should consult their doctor with any medical concerns but this i felt important to kind of address this story it did get a national publication and really gave cannabis really kind of ideas in the market to allow doctors to look at it further and really to investigate the cbd for its potential medical benefits and charlotte again sadly in her short life there was able really to kind of change radically change the cannabis industry in people's perceptions of cannabis which has led to hopefully continuation for it to be used to help other individuals going forward", "h77IaMCkN78": "hello everyone the shakir rivers thank you for clicking on my video so today I want to do a review on an amazing product so as you know the hemp oil and cream it's on Amazon I will be talking about what is hemp oil it's a benefit and how and why I use this early stage so this product I believe is amazing not only does it bring the hemp oil but it also brings the hemp cream which I didn't know existed is a hemp cream it's so it's a really nice packaging I love it it's specifically to trigger any pain so if you have pain on your joint muscles need neck back whatever pain you have you can apply this on the pain and they will have effect on the instantly are I sometimes have in the UM paint on my neck and I use this and the first time I use that was like no this was just in my head this is not real because no one ever told me about him cream so you know I bought the hemp oil it came tears I never know what's gonna come and I use them on my neck and then the pain went away instantly so I really recommend it it's like magic so what is hemp oil is that oil that comes from cannabis sativa and no it can't get you high I'm sorry to say can I get you high it does not contain tetrahydrocannabinol or THC I hope I said alright a

skin you can also use it for inflammation reduction it helps with perform healthy sleep or pain relieve anxiety and it has many other benefits why do I use em boy I use this hemp oil because for I helped manage with my anxiety I've been struggling with inside lists and I don't know one I just never knew it was a thing recently I you know consult consulting with a therapist and she explained to me that those symptoms are anxiety and it's okay a lot of people have it there's any people who don't know they have it if you therapy sessions and it helped me but the anxiety will come back

peace confident and it helps me talk with people it helps me present about big presentation you best believe I'm gonna have like 15 drops of this in the morning before the presentation because I cannot also not only do I take it orally I also apply it on my face in the morning as a moisturizer or before I put my makeup on but it's really good primer as well so yeah I really recommend this hemp oil not only does it bring the hemp oil but I also bring the hand cream to help with any pain so wrap it up I just want to say that everyone should have self-care everyone should be more involved

something a little bit different so over the last a fair few months in fact I have tried out a whole bunch of CBD products I love them some I love more than others some I don't like but anyway I have tried a lot of them so I thought today and I would bring a full selection of my CBD products and talk you through them whether that's because you've been wanting to try something out or you're looking for a good company that stocks them I have a whole variety of all different products that all have hemp and that will have hemp in them or CBD whatever right thermos and and just talked to you about my experience with them so yeah before I get started please make sure you give this video a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe as well I upload every single Sunday and every single Thursday and then occasionally but most weeks I also upload on a Tuesday as well and subscribe see themself in any of my future videos and let's get at it oh I don't even know where to start because there is so many of different products and I want to talk to you about I think I will start with the very first product that I have ever used and that was CBD and I believe it's this with all of these companies and most of these companies I have collaborated previously and all the products have been sent out to me as bloggers mail however I'm in no way obligated to make this video and I just wanted to talk to you through them and I have been genuinely using them consistently so I thought that makes sense but all the opinions are mine that I'm not taught to like say any of it and to be honest to V the companies that they don't know that I'm even making this video so yeah anyway and this is the first company first product I used and it's the owners hemp CBD don't know how to pronounce it with this basically oil pure CBD extract in hemp seed oil so this is the 10% pet 10 milligrams now with the doses I am so confused I'm living there try to exit so though this is the same the same thing but like a bigger bottle of it and that's 5% per 30 mil so you can get all different percentages so I will just show you if I can here so this is like you like a little whatever these things are cold I don't know then you just drop it on look it I never realized that it has the amount on it and yeah new so you drop these little drops into under your tongue actually it's not that much left in this one oh okay listen yeah so you do the drops under your tongue it directs you to how how much of it you should use but basically you should start off small and then go up this one it's like the flavor of it it's okay it's got that CBD taste which is not it's not like amazing but it's not terrible I have heard you can put these in things again put them in cookies you can put them in coffees I don't know how to do that I haven't done this I'm not going to tell you to do so I will tell you though that this doesn't taste incredible you may be a little bit put off by it I started using it to help me sleep to help me relax before sleep by know that people also use these to help like the muscle recover etc etc I am also going to do a little disclaimer here and say that I don't know a hell of a lot about the background of CBD and how much it has been tested like if you know things about it I important feel free to leave them in the comments down below and I know that I've tried it and done it helped me as far as I know it doesn't have any negative side effects but it about everything can have a negative side effect to some to somebody so yeah I just want to put it out there and see I started using these before bed I was like yeah this is nice it did help me get into it it just made me a lot calmer I had before before bed so I started with this and it in it it was nice I was like okay cool we're gonna stick with this but I discovered this also I want to say honest and our incredible there they have been there just a wonderful company I think they were originated in Brighton but now they're in calm or something and the branded miss lovely the products are really good the communication with them is good everything it's like spot-on so if you want to try out some of the products I definitely recommend them because they have been really really great then I've tried out these and these are the clarity CBD broad spectrum for capsules so they are basically just or the CBD oil but in an already already already measured up perhaps you for your Diaries describe it and it says that it's 25 milligrams per serving maybe yes milligrams of CBD in each capsule okay yes and take one capsule once to two times daily and so I started using these actually in the morning as just like a try try an error and I found these amazing they have I think I suffer from from anxiety and depression anyway but these have helped me stay so calm that I usually have like a a dip around lunchtime where I start to feel anxious and and agitated etc smooth sailing I've stayed on a really good level where I'm not I I struggle with like being overly o overly excited and then and then like sad basically as a really struggle to get that right balance this kept me on there on a really good balance of being like yeah I'm okay I'm productive I feel good that's age there is not like you know fireworks and there is not like tears and so yeah I found this really really helpful this company have been medium when it comes to communication which is very upsetting and because I think the product is fantastic so if they can up their communication skills and kind of just make sure that that the customers are happy then they would get to enough that the product is ten out of ten for me anyway then I discovered something else so this is something I wanted to talk to you about because because I I need to be honest with you so I'm in no way shape or form promote and smokin I think smoking is a horrible disgusting habit that I am very very very ashamed to say I have had for many years I have tried to quit and smoke in time and time again and every time I it doesn't last for me but last year I have decided to try vaping and I have tried these CBD little oils so they have no nicotine in them and they have 1% of 10 on a little bit of 1% of CBD per hundred milligrams so should be milliliters because the liquids are not sure that's very confusing and and they come in different flavors so you've got natural hemp I've tried a mint mango strawberry maybe something else I'm not sure do they help me calm down I don't think so do they they have they stopped me from smoking cigarettes yes they have is that much better for me I think so I mean anything that you're inhalants isn't good for you so I will never say to smoke in something because that you shouldn't be putting anything in your lungs full stop however have gone from smoking cigarettes a lot to being able to smoke something if it doesn't have nicotine in it today don't smoke nowhere near as much that may potentially have some good use in it I think that's really good it to me anyway it has helped me so I wanted to say it because I don't want to lie but I want to be very clear I I'm not promoting smoking I'm just saying that has helped me maybe if you want to smoke and you want to quit smoking maybe that could be an introduction to it however I also know that together the government is only kind of looking into CVD and really is it like how them how much damage can it does or more faith in rather than see believe it either way and so yeah I'm going to recommend it but I'm just saying it helped me so that's something you you know you're looking into then you have my my my experience here and you can do with it whatever you you kind of choose to do with it but yeah they're nice they're tasty and they stop this stopped me smoking I haven't had a cigarette in absolute ages and I haven't been craving any cigarettes so I think that's pretty good then the next products I'm gonna talk to you about these are fairly new products and they are also from honest hemp most of these products are from honest and because I bloody love them oh I thought I had another one in here died and I have like CBD products scattered all around the house so I had to like go around and tried to find them all and but anyway I started instead of stops taking the oil because I felt like it was nice but I didn't feel like it was helping me as much as I wanted and I still struggled with falling asleep so much and so so I thought oh I don't know I just stopped to kind of using it and then one day I thought why have these why don't I why don't I give these ago and oh my goodness so these are CBD sprays so it's oil but it's in this spray form you can see spritz spritz you spray under the tongue and I think it's up to like 25 sprays which seems like a lot but I think was this sprays it's not the up to 28 sprays to do three times a day this stuff is the reason I can sleep again I'm not even joking I started using it just to sort of see if it works this is too small and they keep falling through the grate and and yeah I I fell asleep I was tired and I actually fell asleep really calmly I have been using these for a a few weeks months now months I would say and I have been able to fall asleep I like a normal person and it's about 10 1/2 10 I spray these I sit there and within half an hour I've gone into a beautiful sleep I still struggle with waking up throughout the night and I'd still have like night terrors and stuff which is not great however the fact that I can actually fall asleep calmly it's incredible I actually enjoy falling asleep now and I haven't had that in years so it and I know these work differently for different people some people find out it works for them some people found out they haven't I would say a lot of these are trial and error and you might have to try a few different products a few different strengths maybe a little something as simple as a different way of consuming it could be best for you but it's amazing the peppermint want is my favorite and especially after you have brushed your teeth like it's nicer to have peppermint to taste in your mouth this is incredible and amazing and I can't live without this every single if if I could give up all my CBD stuff but keep one thing it would be this now it also comes in a regular hemp taste which is fine like again it's like not great but it's okay the other thing is it's really hard to make CBD taste good so the peppermint one I actually really enjoy I think it's really nice and the orange one weirdly I don't I don't love because I have the oils that are orange and they're really nice but in spray I don't like it so that's probably a personal taste as well yeah give them a go try different ones of these ones and see which one's work for you but I have I actually cannot get over the fact that I can fall asleep now after many many months of not being able to do so and I'm so calm and now I would like I lay in bed and I'm just like this is nice I'm good to Bethnal asleep I used to lay there and like be terrified and be like super stiff and like not being able to fall asleep because I'm too scared and now I actually enjoyed evenings which is lovely okay next product also one that you consume and also on from owners hemp there is I have like three more companies to go go through so do bear with me and I have eaten all of these so there are none left in here open it talks about them anyway and these are the CBD gummies and CBD vegan domes these are sweeties whichever way you look at it so they're probably not the best for you because they still have hey I manufacture didn't get wig and they have sugar in them so obviously you know give and take but well the gummies are lovely the domes are bloody delicious and they just I don't know I don't know how helpful they are no no the Jake and I like to like treat ourselves to one of these at lunchtime like post post lunch of a little lunchtime dessert and they're nice and tasty so maybe maybe that could be something for you maybe if you're like traveling and you want something that would give you a little bit peace of mind and you also like want some snacks this could probably be good although I would say probably can't eat too many of them I've never eaten more than like two yeah each three to four sweets path setting daily dosage of 15 sweets per day yeah you'll be fine so you can have a few of these and you know as you travel in or something like that they're really really tasty what else do we have that you consume I think that's it for consuming I think but we have some more other products ok let's get let's go on to these ones so this is a company I've discovered fairly recently and I have worked with them and I think it's pronounced you are you nation and this is the CPD body oil so it's oil that's awfully infused with CBD and it is a body product not to be consumed but this stuff has been amazing unlike I've had some muscles where I've exercised and just like rubbing this into my muscles it feels really nice and really calming and amazingly so Jake gets a lot of sushi he's broken his neck before and many many years ago and he has still gets a lot of pains in his neck and this really helps him I would just never watch TV and just like rub it into his neck and it really it soothes him it helps him it feels really nice it smells amazing so I think if maybe something like this if you have any injuries that are that are bothering you if for example I get like rheumatism in my hands I just rub it into my hands and it just feels really nice and really soothing so this stuff is amazing and I also have another body oil from honest and as well and this one it is just as lovely it's nice a bit different than the other one but they both smell amazing they both do it amazing jobs and as I said I love all the products in one attempt so yeah I also wanted to talk to you about this one because it's just something a bit different I will leave everything linked down below as well for you so we have those and from our you Lu swell us from honest and I have all their bombs and body butters was this one which is called the South I have one more from you Lu which I had used yesterday and I have no idea where I've put it and but it's but it's similar sort of thing and these are all kind of body oils they all have lovely consistency very um the very soothing these are quite oily so I would say like maybe not for your face but for your body is lovely this self when I was and I was sick recently and I I was using it as like a vapor rub on my chest and it was so nice and great for that great for dry skin for elbows and stuff like that you have the essential balm which looks like there it's like a little ball thing and I use this on my lips and it's really nice and soothing and then you have this amazing body butter oh they're all smell to die for and they're just really lovely lovely skincare and the same with the other one the other one it's a balm as well that I have so yeah loads of body products that a hemp and now has to offer a swell hand CBP has to offer so that's it could be something for you I've seen has loads of because it's natural has a like a lot of natural ingredients that are really good for you so yeah maybe worth trying these also if you're wondering what the hell is on this that there's that Oreo crumbs don't judge me you know you're in lockdown with everything is covered in Oreo crumbs anyway a couple more products and this one is also from honest hemp this is the CBD cooling gel and so I got send this as like pure products and I was like this is very cool I have no idea why I would ever use this because why would you need a cooling gel but cool whatever like a nice packaging you know we'll give it a go I'm sure come in handy it came in handy a lot faster than I expected one when you burn yourself whether that's from the Sun or from like accident and by accident obviously please try not to but if you accidentally do this stuff feels so soo then it's really lovely the formula of it's beautiful and it's just really nice and also I have had about two months ago anomaly and in case you thought a lot my skin looks beautiful and glowy I've had what is it called it is called really bother me what is it called one sec I have had various what is it called micro needling there we go so it is basically I'm not sure if you'd be able to see this but I had like skin taken off and to help your skin rejuvenate and grow back in make it really really lovely anyway um post dis treatment my skin was on fire and I was given like a solution to put on my face to help it but my skin was really burning as it is like a fairly invasive and treatment so I thought well cooling gel surely that's gonna help oh my goodness it was perfect it was exactly what I needed it just helped my face still stay really smooth but it just had that really nice kind of cooling and tingling sensation it's amazing so and yeah infused with peppermint and eucalyptus so when they get too warm as well you can just like put a little bit of it on your neck or something and to get a bit of like freshness I don't know how to describe it but this is lovely really really nice and then last two products are from doctor botanicals which I don't think I've spoken about before on my channel and and from them I've been using this hemp oil and moisturizer so you've got this is obviously like a skin oil that's infused with hemp and it's lovely smells wonderful and I put it on my forehead to give my forehead moisture and make a look beautiful and shiny and then also I use this moisturizer not moisturizer to coat a mask it's a very gentle mask actually this is a moisturizer I've been using it as a mask well there you go and just put a thick layer of it on my skin in the evening when it needs a little bit more moisture and soothing again and and it's really really lovely for that as well yeah I feel like I have talked to you about a lot of CBD projects as I said I've been using a lot of them both consuming them and putting them on my body and I am looking to explore more of them because I really like them I think that they're great it's a it's a great ingredient to have in your everyday life

up don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next time bye", "xl63tar39F0": "today i'm processing my roots or at least i'm getting them out of the ground if you're going to use roots you want to make sure you clean them really good these are there's just the main roots i didn't take any of the uh the uh the strings it was just too hard to get out of the ground oh my gosh it took me forever to get this out but these are nice uh thicker roots that i can uh def i'll definitely use um i will be close to the video on uh what i do with them um i make sobs and i uh actually eat them i use it in uh with coconut oil and i put in my coffee every single day except saturday and sunday which uh i give my body a break but it does amazing things and i will share that with you so don't throw away your roots keep them bad boys they got to be uh dried hung up and dried and then i'll cut it off bro that good stuff is all right happy growing everybody since uh you have now washed and dried your roots they need to be really washed and dried and if you have grown organically if you've been using salt-based um nutrients i probably wouldn't do this if you're going to put this on your body or in your body you you want organic roots are filters for your plant and basically it's in your soil it's bringing up in into your roots so make sure that uh you are organically based what i do is i break my roots down i've got me uh these fisca big o clipper dills but basically you just cut your your roots down into the smallest pieces you can get and then what i'll do is i'll put mine in this uh mortar and pulse stone granite whatever it is and try to get this as powdery as possible so you're going to have all sizes um whatever you have if you have a little um ninja food processor thing that'll work too but you want to get it as fine and as powdery as you could possibly do i don't know these words um the words uh the scientific chemicals that i'm going to put up on the screen so you can see it but one is for protecting your liver and the other is um a cancer killer and what this cancer killer does it sends a signal to the to the cancer cell tells it to commit suicide it um hypothesis i think is what um what it causes and that's like say if you have a a tadpole when a tadpole turns into a frog it sends a positive this chemical to the tail to tell it to die and then that's how the frog will lose its tail basically does the same thing to a cancer cell cancer cells don't have the trigger that tells it when it's damaged to kill itself it just doesn't do that so what this does will do that i am not a doctor i i can't tell you um i don't want to tell you you know eat this stuff um how i do it is uh you need get a get from you know talk to your doctor if you're if you're in a situation where you got cancer or something i don't want it to ruin anything like say i i can only tell you what i've been doing um i put it in in coconut oil and then uh once it's extracted out i pour that coconut oil into a little jar i take take a teaspoon every day in my coffee except for saturday and sunday which i give my body a rest so i work i have it in my coffee i just put a scoop in there and then you need a creamer of some type like a powder creamer that it'll attach to easier for your body absorb if you're going to use in sauce i take that same um coconut oil and i will put it into my assab bomb making process um like i said i'll put the chemicals up what we're looking trying to extract out of there um i they're crazy words so um two ounces or two ounces of this you want to cut this up in two cups worth into your i put it in a crock pot your own crock pot here along with about four or five cups of water two cups of organic coconut oil um i like the organic um i don't think it makes too much of a difference it's just the carrier but i like coconut oil it uh it hardens up um if you put it once this is done you're going to cook this thing for 12 to 18 hours i go 24 you make sure you replace the water as it you know evaporates out simmers out but you want to um the oil will stay and that's what's going to collect all your uh your chemicals that we're looking for um like say i'm really after two um but you know we don't know what the uh what the other ones do um but for solves and stuff it's absolutely wonderful it's great stuff don't throw them out keep your roots so you're chopping them up roots coming off they're going to be all sizes i break them down and i got some big ones small ones i'm going to use this to grind it up and then put it in my coconut oil and i say i'm gonna do it for 24 hours i will put those chemicals up so you know what they are if you have any questions you're welcome to come to our uh facebook group it's

are on episode 17 of the podcast we are live from Detroit and we're here to talk to you about the effects of cannabis topicals I'm Jen and I am Earl and this is the podcast episode 17 Wow we are getting up there is exciting it is we are here to take different cannabis topics about canvas products about cannabis itself and we go out we study that topic and we talk about the topic so we can have a well balanced understanding about canvas and campus tommy's yep so we take a new topic every week we talk about advocacy science a lot of history isn't history some do yourself yup a little bit about the business some business stuff we get into politics science science science is the big thing science is a big thing every I feel like every episode has some science and I yeah I do I do I do I feel like this that's very very important and we get into just like you said just a little bit of politics you're just a little bit of politics we have a lot to cover to them we do I'm excited let's go right into it I'm gonna go first with my new story I love my news story today and by the way our nut news is sponsored by tickety app.com teddy is going to be the first app where you can journal how cannabis and cannabis products affects you and you can also share that journal but also 5 products based upon the desired effect that you want yep so go to tickity app t IG g i-- t y app calm and put your email in you could be one of the first users to actually use the app and hopefully it launches by April 20th onsen Nook knows no she's gotta have one okay seth rogen have you heard about this he's launching a new weed friend cuz of course he is called a houseplant really launching it and Columbia with his partner camera versus partners name but read the article it's in there and they're doing houseplant sativa houseplant indica and house plant hybrid those are going to be their brands they start Hospit whoa whose supper alg\u00fan who's that he comedian he's a white comedian he's in a lot of movies um so he was then what's the one with the fraternity you know you were watching the girl 1 oh I think that's him is that the main character guy I think his name yeah ok I think that's him ok ok ok ok he's in a lot of stuff yeah he's pineapple Express ah ok ok ok so you play a lot of papaya yes every movie he's in he's related and he's a stoner in it in some aspect so it kind of makes sense that he's doing it so I thought that was a lot of fun stuff so a lot of celebrities and kind of do some branding and all that jazz yeah if you're gonna do some branding celebrities also do some social justice advocacy as well okay be about your business don't just come here and make some money come on coming here and also help the movement yes yeah I would agree cool that's a good story this yeah so I'm gonna talk about one main topic and then we're gonna blaze through perfect different ones I like that so the first one we talk about is the Michigan Commission all right we talked about it before Bobby found his show it's about driving while high okay so the Michiganders a commission on michigan's commission the state should the state should not set driving limit of marijuana that was the outcome of this commission okay so governor Snyder had before he left wanted to have a commission where people will go and study the effects of cannabis and see if there was a line on how we can measure all right well this is if you pass disappoint you are too impaired to drive so kind of like the alcohol limit of being point oh eight yes they're trying to find the marijuana limit right now trying to find this numerical number that just doesn't exist say cuz what affects you is gonna be different than me exactly there's not like a percentage Colorado is trying to do that they're trying to get people to volunteer to drive hi to some yeah well and that's this I don't think it's ever gonna I think cops won't have to do cop work yes you're gonna have to be able to see if someone is at driving recklessly pull them over have a conversation your sobriety test and then determine if the person is impaired or not mhm I don't think you have to have this numerical number cuz when you do that it's just it's it's setting a scary precedent because I could be over the limit just because I am a heavy smoker yeah and I got up in the morning and I went to work and I got pulled over and they decided to test me and I'm over the limit because I'm a heavy smoker yeah I agree so I I mean I I just think this was uh just to see a logical response I like that that's cool to how we are putting together marijuana policies yes made in Michigan it's I think that I mean we get a little bit of politics a lot of politics we talk about just feel like know what is you talking about but this is just like it's just common it just makes sense right I agree so that's cool yeah none of that all right but if you are driving reckless you still could get but that's yeah I was gonna say and that's kind of like with everything you know just drive safe and okay yeah I agree and I think what you said earlier was uh the first time to cover the story was just like get my way I'm gonna place through a couple articles you got the links in the show notes you can read the four articles for yourself next one is coming up March 31st fifty unlicensed stores we have to shut down yeah which they they had about two years I was gonna say they had plenty of time to this is now seems to be a very firm March 31st so which means it probably about a hundred retail stores or so okay or provisional centers put it in perspective at one time there was 300 yeah that's in Detroit so not just Detroit like now the entire state's gonna have a hundred so there's a limited access yeah for a little bit but if you know someone will not so know someone there you go all right cool all right um local crime data shows this is from Boston 25 News local crime data shows recreational pot shops are good neighbors yes I've heard about this where in places that there's pot shops the local area actually has a decrease in crime holy shiz like who would have guessed wait a minute mean that is the biggest argument is that all marijuana is coming here let me I'm going down it's just like listen this they've trying to put fear in you so that they can control you and manipulate you okay so don't fall for that all right let the love walking love not fear okay yeah it's a lot more beneficial towards life but yeah this so this is a great article to debunk that and even an upcoming presidential elections they gonna use the same thing yeah crank crank crank what this is a great article he's proving that it's the White House and federal scientists are pushing the myth that marijuana is laced with fitna so yeah there was myth kids fear trying to control people that a lot of marijuana out here that could be given out to kids at Halloween could be the lace with a sorry that's mine yes 30,000 chicken $30 if I gave your child that please tell me cuz I want it back or you gotta pay for it so up to some shady stuff in the White House under individual ones administration so I'm just saying oh say no yeah another one I want to say no for president individual number one people are lining up to grow marijuana research but President individual number one Justice Department won't let them Oh meaning that the DEA was just about what we need more research me Maurice everybody need more review we know more about marijuana than we do pubic hairs okay well you know enough about this okay but you keep crying about research but now there are causing institutions who are trying to do research but they are slowing down on applications so read the story kukuku marijuana cup marijuana come I'm trying to place through this okay the legalization of marijuana go marijuana legalization vote canceled due to lack of support in New Jersey Senate we talked about in the past yeah that New Jersey is going to be one of the next days that have recreational no it died is not over but retarted was very interesting because there's a lot of actual proponents against the bill because it actually includes social justice provisions oh sorry it was like automatic expungement there was an application process that will actually include people who have been disproportionately affected by the war yes but people push back the kiss that oh man okay medical license growers in Oklahoma are it is booming in Oklahoma pretty much gonna open up in pretty much in Oklahoma for medical marijuana if you have twenty five hundred dollars in your bank account you can utilize it really it was that free there's over 1,200 right now crawl licenses have been issued that's awesome their program has been up and running for nine months that's awesome put in a comparison with state of Michigan we've been doing this for almost three years we've gone at two in a December we got three years going on we have about less than one hundred girl Isis there's over 1,200 and Oklahoma right now it's like a thousand retail store licenses and their market is like like the size of Detroit right it's just crazy so Oklahoma Guam they actually are going to legalize cannabis is actually at the governor's desk he'll be the first u.s. territory read that one and then legalizing activist push marijuana industry to uphold social responsibilities please read this it is very important that we support businesses that are also supporting social equity and social justice so that businesses actually do do that please be conscious other people that you do spin your dollar with because if they don't care you should not carry it it um and on I say Mel men hold ninety-three percent of Canadian cannabis boardroom positions men hold ninety-three percent of that so Thomas Leggett it's not just colored this is men and women as well once I have an opportunity as well I have a seat at the table and make a difference in this industry yeah man actually I'd be a lot better a lot more women we're actually women are pretty smart yeah last thing man wanted okay help the DEA here people wanted the DEA someone they need someone to burn 1000 pounds per hour okay yes the oppose it oppose right now they're in need they need later or something that can control and burn up to 1,000 pounds a week this was putting out time on what you're spending your money and resources on who could I know giggle a steak cheese alright give it to Oklahoma that was the nut news please read the links as now I'm talking slower alright are you ready for the main topic we are ready for the main topic cannabis topicals we are gonna talk about this topic was I thought when we talk about the topic you know we're time okay we've got a lot of questions about topical this is gonna be a topic oh cool topic all right oh my god I know when I was researching I was like [ __ ] like I was still researching this morning me too yep and I up to like a couple hours and I was like I need to cut this yeah it was just like okay we have a lot to cover we're gonna try to get into this please bear with us but yes we're gonna talk about the effects of cannabis tapa cold we got some topicals to show you guys - yeah top of course with testimonials we got a whole bunch of things let's start off with I guess kind of cannabis topical 101 all right what are cannabis I was gonna say topical so it's something you rub it on your skin like lotion cream sauce like bath bombs almost so things that you put externally yes and there's an image for that too now if you warm so dad echoes can't forms a topical so a lotions creams bath salts bombs so you can infuse any of that with cannabis and then there forever becomes a cannabis topical okay so that's what we're talking about I think the next thing is to talk about kind of how does marijuana infused topicals actually work yes and we're gonna do kind of like a literally a 60 second review on this please check out episode number six in our cannabis therapy series about how cannabis affects the body we actually get a lot into the endocannabinoids system but pretty much real quick we have an indica system that's one of 12 systems in our body that goes along with the cardiovascular system this skeletal system the endocrine system look at that I get a little proud alright cray cray so the endocannabinoid system is is is responsible for bringing our body back to balance between all those systems okay and for example use the example okay you get off balance because you have maybe there's a lot of activity within your brain so you have seizures so using cannabis can help bring that activity don't be balanced and that's how it actually helps you not have caesars so that's kind of how it works so even though we produced endocannabinoids we can also accept outside cannabinoids right and those ice outside cannabinoids from a plant we call photo can happen oh yes so we have an endocannabinoid deficiency so we have a low level of endocannabinoids which means we're kind of off balance we can increase our cannabinoids by receiving outside cannabinoids and those from plants are called fuddle cannabinoids and those actually found in cannabis yes it's also important to know we have receptors that's how we can kind of find she didn't like my first analogy last week but analogy is we have receptors all over our body in our skin and that's how outside cannabinoids signal actually they plug into those receptors and that's how we communicate mm-hmm so the ones that we're gonna be talking about are the cb2 receptors cuz those are on the external organs yeah so you can have cb2 receptors on the inside of your body did you know that when it's on the outside of your organs and your skin is technically an organ so that's why we have them on the outside that's it there's one of systems the skin system is a skin system so I wanted the organs it's an organ is it really yeah your skin isn't into the largest organ on your body I might have made that okay I know it's an organ though and so that's why it has cb2 receptors and that's what actually I mean it makes it was amazing you got a cut and it just like it starts to kill it so repair itself and it's just I got right it just has this system yeah God is yeah what a creator all right going on - all right so how THC and CBD work together yes so we understand how it kind of works with a body not byte graphic and yes thereby graphic is actually kind of talks about the entourage effect okay and the analogy is that the sum of his parts is not greater than a whole okay the whole is greater than the sum of his parts you take a bicycle there's over 800 parts you could break that apart but if you just take the handlebars you know imagine giving your child for Christmas you know I'm gonna get you a bike and then you know opens up the gif and it's like handlebars and it's just like that's it one mono with this you know me but when you put those handlebars with all the other parts now she's you know I'm pretty happy girl right oh my goodness of course it was pink all right so so that's how it works oh so when Tom I see THC and CBD it also works as an entourage effect and when I say entourage effect THC and CBD are cannabinoids that are found within the plant booze also there's a hundred different cannabinoids hundreds I was also terpenes and there's also flavor noise so all that work that all that is part of the a hundred pieces of that bike and when they all are together you get the full effect when you isolate them they're not as good so that's how THC and CBD work with it and we're gonna move on to kind of why would you need time for those pretty yes it's like what are the usage of them I think so some of the conditions and system are symptoms if you have this if you have arthritis if you have chronic pain from could be a sports injury you have inflammation if you have neuropathic pain that is huge with a lot of a lot of medicines and a lot of therapies now are not really helping my kid we have really pinched nerve zoom out of nerve right so if you have that are just kind of like you're stuck with us right burns severe burns a skier ear taste secure skin irritations that skin irritation together skin infection skin cancerous you have anything else you've got fibromyalgia I didn't want to say that out loud because I didn't pronounce it thank you yeah fibromyalgia that's like the constant page pain that you feel Lady Gaga has that so if you've heard of it before that's what Lady Gaga has it's new joints it's just constant pain all over your body they don't really know what causes it but it's just you're always in pain there's really nothing that helps it okay yeah so if you haven't this and you're in that position you know we're gonna give more information but think of this is why we're talking about canvas topic and I also saw that it helps with headaches yes I think that topicals are helping with headaches surprisingly and let's see what else p.s psoriasis I was gonna say that too I'm really good at pronouncing those was phonetic so yeah so those know if you have I mean keep paying attentions because that is kind of what this is for okay we're gonna kind of talk about the benefits later and how this actually can can relieve you but this is who we're trying to talk to about even if you're not about you know using smoking cannabis topicals could be a solution yeah I mean so like think about if you use icy hot all the time yeah this is a replacement for icy have almost only really we have a topical that we're gonna show today that I use for pain relief all the time that's what's on has pinched nerves in his back he's got a really messed up back and herniated discs and he uses this and it works better for him then I see how it ever does what's up and we're gonna do arm so now we're gonna do some testimonials too but like say okay we talk to you right now you have arthritis you're interested in topicals that are infused by cannabis where you get it from how do you find it not you're in a pursuit of looking for this and if you're if you're in a legal by state or a medicinal where they have medical marijuana or records from marijuana there are retail stores where you can acquire this or if you aren't in a state where's medical you can have a caregiver you can access that but unfortunately may still limit access it is to one of the most beneficial ways that people can actually receive relief so that's why I also wanna talk about do-it-yourself - yeah some of the do yourself stuff would be olive oils coconut oils and alcohol are some of the easiest bases we're gonna do a show at some point and show how to make it but if you just had you know found some cannabis trim just got that donate from someone you put that in a crock pot with some olive oil or coconut oil or even alcohol let that cook for about eight hours on warm and then strain that there you go that's what that's it you know it's like you could do it yeah and then and then when it comes to to dosing when you're actually using that I'm the great thing about the topic OHS is that they're not psychoactive not you're not gonna get high so you can if you put too much on it's just like putting on too much lotion just keep rubbing it and you'll be perfectly fine you're not gonna get high from it not and I shall just call myself because it's not that it's not psychoactive it's not it you don't feel yeah the impairing yeah it's not it's not impaired because we still have the receptors and it's going you still want to have to get relief yes is that in since its psychoactive but you're not high you can drive you're totally fine all right you don't feel messed up so somewhat dosing is not like no if you're over consuming I add about something like that there's no peak point exactly so you kind of plant as much as you need to to get to the point where you want to be and there's like no you can never like overdo it so like if you do it in an hour later you do it again you're you're fine it's not gonna be addictive or anything you could just take a bath for hours and just soak yourself in all right so say you actually find somebody's topic was right now there's some there's some warnings we actually want to kind of yeah warn people about what to look for we're coming out to look for because not all products are the same mm-hmm they're so in the reason why they're not the same because right now there is no standard of labeling all right it's not like there's a FDA regulation right now on these type of calls there are actually gonna come up with rules but even if you're you know just in a medical state is just you may say this hasn't been infused by cannabis so you want to watch out so you make sure you do have a clean a safe and we want to talk about some ingredients kind of boiling I think artificial ingredients and colors you kind of want to avoid that yeah there's no real reason to use it like it's gonna look how it's gonna look you don't need to diet right they just kind of let it be natural price I think that's the key you just want to look for if you can pronounce the name that is actually on the ingredients or listen in the event just I wouldn't I wouldn't use that topic where you're kind of defeating the purpose of looking for a natural way to get relief yeah so yeah I think that's my kind of no petroleum fragrances chemicals minerals all those things scent synthetic ingredients haja native ingredients all those are counteractive right to what you're trying to achieve so you do want to read the labels and watch those as well and then look for out the natural basis cocoa butter shea butter extra virgin olive oil and I think I said no those were the only ones I put on my skin yeah like you can feel like other types of oil but like you cook with that true true true and then also on some labels you can you can see how its processed - mm-hmm so if it's you you want to look for things that are whole plan yeah we talked about the entourage effect talked about the whole bicycle so things I say full spectrum yes things I say whole plan or total plan those are the topicals that you're gonna receive the most bang for your buck right okay so I think that's key and then if it's quality tested that's a plus but if again if you if you can make yourself then you kind of know if it's where came from cool alright now let's go on through discovery medical and therapeutic benefits from camera stop yes ah now we can put up the medical benefits of TAC top of clothes from Natalie you put that one up antibacterial I did not know that it was anti I always like thought it would be because kind of like makes sense that it would be yeah it's like it's marijuana but I never really knew that antiviral anti-tumor you know analgesic analgesic no analgesic okay yeah GES I gonna do J no don't okay something stuff yeah okay pain reliever anti antioxidant then also you can pull up the next one Nelly benefits topicals anti-inflammatory pain reliever Nero Nero controller so there's a lot of benefits of topicals yes antispasmodic you kept skipping happen I'll choose my words wisely and you can see these two so we're kind of pulling them up and they're probably going through a little fast but if you go to g3 Omnicom /resources this is on there yes we have a whole handout for how cannabis topicals affects you yeah thank you for that plot shameless plug by the way number one kind of talked about the top nine no I just want to say one thing so he said the CBD and THC I forget it's important to have a whole plan so if his TAC if someone's advertising as a TC topical it doesn't make sense just isolated TAC top right it really does then you need the whole kit and kaboodle yeah whole point it is just CBD it's not gonna be affected this is a lot of testimonies of just CVD isn't it's just not gonna do anything but you add a little bit TAC voila okay that's what happens all right so top nine benefits by treating or reducing conditions I don't know nine benefits of cannabis tableaus you put that slide up for us Natalie which one the one that I just keep laughing at is enhance the sexual pleasure because you can use this as lubes so I'm glad you brought that up because the only wraps you're gonna do are showing talk thing we're gonna also do some semi pro tips I have my tip my testimonial is about this it is stay tuned I was like that it provides localized pain man yes so if your email elbow someone you can't really say okay I'm eating this go to my knee it's the same thing with like painkillers you can't be like help this spot a spot yeah but like with the topicals you just rub it on and exactly just your knee so neck all that jazz I'm skins cold sores keeps your skin youthful I like that's I didn't know that but that's cool yeah

ingredients that's smart so some confidence there's only so much you can put on a label like right especially like when you see some of these they're so tiny you can't you can't fit everything yeah yeah so if it wasn't lab tested try go to the website and Lao those brands also put their ingredients there processed and don't be afraid to reach out I would say yeah you know it's like you really can't find it and you really want to know just send him a message true why don't you say and then they don't answer they don't respect your dollar then don't bother I keep it moving all right I like that all right any personal testimonies you mention a little bit earlier yeah so I really like the and we're gonna show it here the miracle cell from Esteban's it's like really nice so you can use it anywhere and like like I have bad knees okay and I put on my knees and I don't even notice um it's just it's really about Hamas so say you got you got the South you PI on your knee about I would say probably about an hour at least Wow at least in like it lasts that less Oh media as soon as you put it on you don't know immediately as soon as it touches your skin and you're like rubbing it in you can feel it like I can feel it on my fingers that's what's up you know I mean it lasts for probably about an hour that's what I've noticed I usually fall asleep but you said John Johnny Johnny John uses it so yeah he's got her knee disks up and down his back and then oh my god I can't he says it all the time but I'm sorry but he's got he's got like split discs and split nerves and like all this crazy stuff and so like I put it on and he doesn't know what it's like he can't feel part of his back so when I put it on it but he can feel like pain um he like doesn't notice and he's like actually able to sleep comfortably oh wow usually I have to like put like a big like you know like this huge I see patches on his back and now I can just use some of the sound which is a lot easier that's result because I'm smell as bad yeah like you can't notice the smell like you walk around with IcyHot and you're like wow that's I see hot stuff you don't even notice that we're gonna show so many topicals in a minute as well my testimony about topicals is that so we did a show on Valentine's Day called fuel your passion and they're not show those like you can't put coconut oil or olive oil you know I'm down there and I just you said yeah I was like okay you know let me see how low infused olive oil 9 pound hammer olive oil and you know we haven't dinner all that stuff and you know I figured about to get to the next stage for the night you know I'm doing anything and I want to hit one the bathroom and just apply some olive oil infuse on my wing way I did so apply my wing wing it didn't say that I was gonna see you know what was gonna happen you know I want it I want to unbiased feedback okay I didn't want it like say something and then it's like you had that placebo effect and this is like so long story short and it wasn't a short story by the way if I was to get a Google review for my performance that night I would have got 5 stars I got 5 stars and I have not even released a sequel weapon and a secret weapon was the infused olive oil I tell you right now it was it was it was which would your wife agree with you yes okay yes she I feel like that's the most American part to me like I could give it a minute okay the Google review or would have been her okay all right it would've been all right no not me personally of course I'm talking about you know one minute all right so yeah so that's my yeah I I will testify fact topicals really do enhance sexual pleasure cuz it increases like your sensitivity yeah and I'm gonna be kissing to the bloodstream through there as well cuz think like sexually I know it's just terrible but STI is that's how they're transferred it's because they're you have openings to the pores yeah so yeah it was a great yeah it was my secret weapon super weapon so hey pro tip semi-pro my star Austar team - all right cool you can move some wife's at home like shaking her she watches this show I'm actually using that I have that you know you can be some army you never bad right you don't watch my show oh I'm holding it I'm holding it I'm just waiting for my mommy's you come at me I'm like mo you don't have a watch my show you don't love me yeah I'm gonna say it was okay what she probably watching right now this one yeah alright so we're going on some questions and answers yeah maybe yes bother pulling these up do you want to start showing some ones oh wait so as she pulls up questions and answers I am going to do a little show in toke [Music] so this is the cell that I was talking about that we use you wish we had smell-o-vision I know it smells so it smells kind of like like beeswax if you will yeah it smells really really nice it's super in the scene you see that definitely recommended so he makes um honey if to which is why I think it's funny he has these calves yeah yes oh he's that do it yeah cuz actually smells like cuz that yeah I thought you got it yeah so yeah don't ever that's cool we got some primo buddy alright from my friends over a primo buddy now you're honest and saying why is it looking backwards so this is olive coconut oil so this is coconut oil that can be used as a song as you can see this is green and it's thick you can smell this - smells good right there hi Janis okay so you could take this and you can apply it alright on your skin you can see it's not uh it's oily but it doesn't turn your skin green okay my mother had the most non painful thumb ever all righty do you need a hand good next thing I'm gonna show we talked about skin cancers so this right here is Simpson oil still about promote buddy this right here as you can see a little bit tar this is tar right here only but as you can see I'm apply some of this on my it does leave a little wow green which one is that yeah so this is what Rick Simpson oil he had skin cancer he applied this on the area where he had cancer and with that I believe was within a year that tumor and that skin infection was going on so marijuana its medical so this is uh again this is again it may be nighttime if you want apply that unless you like that look you can have that green that's gonna be a new style yeah the twenties all right so this is olive oil so see this is more liquidy it does have a little bit of a color but I'm also like super super light so that's not good so people I was gonna say well I think would definitely make you burn so maybe through like a bomb or through so it kind of rubs in nice though you can't really tell anymore yes my fingers it's definitely and I like spreads smells alright and then the last thing is the CBD oil here oh this is pretty oh this is bright now it says total plant right oh it says total plant I can't really give you any feedback on my own what do you just like sprayed on you yeah what is the actual spray they're kind of saying it's a oral spray but you can also comply as a topical okay yeah so you just kind like a weird double to show-and-tell yeah it's a spray just pointing at your mouth okay couldn't you haven't used it yet no no I don't know cuz it's so CBD but its total plant so yeah and that's yeah so we talked about if it just says CBD they're using it as a marketing tool it does say total plant which means okay must be other cannabinoids or are the flavonoids with that as well but I don't know but this is something I do offer to my patients as a caregiver if they do so choose and soon as that tickity app is up and going will have my feedback they have feedback because that way the patients can actually journal um how that seed oil affected them and then they can rate the different effects from scope and I can then give better recommendations for the people so cool alright now there's someone talk I like the show and talk was any questions no there were no questions no no I know hopefully be just being is so informant we are so informative know that we're smart they're good key takeaways key takeaways um so my key takeaways where I actually have never known anyone to have sex using any kind of cannabis related topical so that's cool that it actually works cuz you've read about it online yeah but you never know if it really works so it's cool that there's like a real person I was daring enough to try and that's what she took from this a whole episode that's everything that we know that's my key takeaway I think mine would be all the benefits but I think also I would have thought okay maybe just a TAC or something like that or CBD was cool as a topical but it's the whole plant still still pleasing that's kind of like that's like a whole theme that we're seeing is everything that has a benefit from cannabis like the whole plant is what you really want right which was why I was so hard for people to actually try to patent certainly because you really can't patent a plant right you try to patent some of the extractions of the compounds and if you just extract one compound it's just it's just got handlebars right bicycles so cool we're gonna blow on never do that oh oh man we got everything done so we got the thanks to everyone before we go into things I do want to say we're into our topic

you guys uh a lot more than i than i have been and i hope this live stream is actually working i normally have a totally different hardware setup um for how i would do anything for youtube but it looks like my mic's coming through i'm just gonna hope and pray that it is working um so hey everybody i just wanted to get on here and just do a couple of um updates about what we're doing at curious about cannabis and yeah just share a little bit about kind of where things are headed and to let you know that in general i'm going to try to start doing live streams um beyond you may have seen previous live streams that i've done where i just play old uh podcast videos and so i'd gotten some requests to um you know sort of set up a 24-hour stream of of podcast episodes and i've done that a couple of times but um i don't have dedicated hardware to run that all the time but beyond that i'm going to try to start doing live streams where i'm just connecting with you talking to you directly as i'm able to so we'll see how it goes so first of all i want to say that um you know those of you that follow us on youtube if you don't already follow us on instagram i really recommend you connect with us on there because i do make um live streams and posts on stories and stuff a little more frequently there and i honestly share most of my news on instagram because that's where a lot of the kind of cannabis industry is is hanging out but i'm going to try to change that um to let you know a little bit of what's been going on and why there haven't been some posts in a while um i've been teaching quite a lot so our um our curious about cannabis workshop series launched just a couple of weeks ago for this year and i used to teach these workshops locally in person here in oregon for years since at least since 2015 and then of course 2020 hit and had to kind of reevaluate everything in life as so many people have and so we made a really big pivot towards virtual education events and i was very very skeptical and cynical at first but it seems like it's going well so now i'm really really excited about it because it's enabled me to connect with people all over the united states and in canada mexico all sorts of other places and to really have the chance to dive into all sorts of details that i can't get into in podcast episodes or you know kind of casual conversation and um yeah so our first cohort um is underway with that workshop series and we just had a really great um guest lecture from dr anna schwabe it did her phd uh dissertation work looking at genetic chemical and organoleptic variation among uh cannabis flower super super super interesting stuff and she was gracious enough to stay a little extra and talk with my students and myself and answer questions just really really great experience next week we've got kyle boyer coming in to talk about lab testing murphy murray is going to be coming in to give us lab tours and talk about extraction we've also got dr arno hazakamp who's um you know basically one of the first researchers to present this idea of chemovar or chemical variety he's just published tons of research on cannabis since he started studying it professionally in 2001 i believe a major name in cannabis science research but he's going to be guest lecturing in a few weeks and then we also have dr linda clumpers who's a clinical pharmacologist that'll also be coming in towards the end of the workshop and guest teaching so just tons of great guests that have been really really gracious and giving me their time and energy to help make the workshop awesome so that's all been going great if you are interested and you didn't get in on this first cohort i will be opening up the next session uh the next session's registration window is going to open next week so if you go to cacpodcast.com learn you can find information about those workshops and some of our other educational events that we have going on i think they're extremely unique compared to other stuff that's out there and i've had students tell me that you know ones that have taken a lot of the available cannabis education stuff that's currently out there they tell me that there's nothing like what i'm doing out there and that the content that we're going into goes far more in depth and one student told me today it just gets in the nitty-gritty of all of the science of all this sort of stuff and kind of shatters some maybe some preconceived notions you may have even learned in other um cannabis education uh courses and stuff like that a student told me today that he's just got uh more and more questions and i was like well that's a great sign that you're learning um so yeah those workshops have been really really fun and so they are intensive they're six weeks long each um but if you're looking for like the really intense cannabis science you know course um uh check it out curious about cannabis workshop series there's two parts it's 12 weeks series total and each workshop is six weeks we also have a beginner's workshop that is launching in april um the session first session starts on april 9th and if you or someone you know is totally new to cannabis i mean starting out at ground zero basically this workshop is made for them it runs a month long and it covers all the general basics that you could expect you know uh addressing you know just what is cannabis what are all these cannabis products what are these terms that are being used and dispensaries and stuff and how do we think about those terms how does it connect to science or doesn't connect to science in a lot of cases um and how does cannabis and other sorts of cannabis products in general how do they affect the body and are they safe those are some of the basic questions that we go through um it's only a hundred bucks like i said it runs a month um in general the way i see it is if it can save somebody from buying products that aren't actually in line with what they're looking for then they will probably save quite a bit of money that would pay for the the beginner's workshop many times over um so yeah if you know anybody or if you run a dispensary or anything like that um check this workshop out and and please send people there i'm hoping to get the cohort um built out um by the first week of april and we'll be off to the races um some other things i wanted to talk about that we have going on that i am excited about um so if you're into the crypto world then you've probably heard of nfts if you're not in the crypto world you've probably heard of nfts because people are starting to write articles about them quite a bit um nfts non-funchable tokens you know are basically digital assets um the best example to describe them would be like in a video game if you're buying uh um some sort of item in a video game uh that's essentially an nft um although up until now they haven't really been on blockchain and if you're not familiar with what blockchain is it's essentially just a really nice ledger that keeps track of the flow of information and digital goods so cryptocurrency got really really popular and operates on blockchain but uh blockchain is a lot more than cryptocurrency and nfts are really highlighting that and so some common examples of nfts there are like virtual trading cards like mlb and nba have both started producing digital trading cards um as nfts um additionally there are kind of these virtual worlds that you can join where you can buy land in these virtual worlds and develop uh virtual structures and things like people build digital art galleries for instance to showcase their art people build um uh arcades even casinos all sorts of stuff uh decentraland is the most um probably most popular example of of these kind of like metaverse systems but they utilize nfts in all sorts of ways like i mentioned they have art galleries and people post their their digital art as nfts in those systems but also nfts can be applied to things like contracts and intellectual property and i'll be really excited when people start to understand the value in that because nfts are huge for content creators and artists but they're also going to be really huge for all business i mean the the audit trail aspect of blockchain is unparalleled i mean it's just something that if you read enough about it it'll click why blockchain is not going away and how more and more we're going to see more things get on the blockchain and likely we'll see a future of the internet where you have the on-chain internet and you have an off-chain internet and the off-chain internet is sort of uh this more murky side of the internet that's doesn't have this kind of level of audit trail and everything uh more what we're used to right now and then you'll have the on-chain internet where everything is tracked and there's no way to really uh fudge things which might freak people out um regarding like anonymity but the great thing about blockchain and cryptocurrency and everything is that uh even though these audit trails exist um there's still plenty of ways to stay anonymous in using things on blockchain so when people see transaction histories they don't see your name they see this long string of random characters that represent your wallet um and the other wallets you know that things have been moved to so it can be used for anonymous you know internet uh transactions and that sort of thing um or not and so anyway if you're seeing all this hype about nfts that's kind of what it's about is it's you know showing that blockchain is way more than cryptocurrency and digital assets in general are are starting this move over uh to nfts and it's huge for content creators like myself because it gives us a little more power uh to do very interesting things with our art and um also provide a way for our fans to potentially make money um off of supporting the things they like so with all of that rambling out of the way curious about cannabis has launched our curious about cannabis canna card nfts we have well over 100 of them right now waiting to be released and as far as i'm aware we are the very first um you know company that's producing educational cannabis content in the form of nfts and we're one of the first groups that's making cannabis content all at all as nfts at least in some like systematic formalized way there are people that have made spinoff you know little nfts out of photographs and stuff here and there but you know we're putting together a pretty uh substantial system on how to use our cards and these these can of card nfts they basically look like um pokemon or magic the gathering uh trading cards in a way that's kind of how they're modeled um but they're digital some feature photographs or artwork some feature videos um so some of these cards it's almost like uh you know like in harry potter uh the trading cards that they have um you know the the wizards start talking to them and stuff well these some of these cards you know are kind of video format and kind of have that that feel to them uh where i might be explaining some concept about cannabis or whatever and then the cards themselves have educational information about whatever topic's being represented by the card on there and so these cards are you know they're collectibles uh some of these cards are only minted once so they're literally one of a kind others are minted in groups of like 25 or 50 so that's how you get your commons and your uncommons and your rares but beyond the fact that they're fun little cards that have educational information and they're collectible they're going to have very direct tangible value because we'll also be using these nfts as discounts for merchandise discounts for events and tickets to exclusive events so up until now we've had our patreon and we have a nice little community on there people that have been supporting the podcast and all of the work that we do um and we always you know give out discount codes and stuff to patrons to give them free stuff for discount stuff for instance all of our patrons got into the first uh cohort of the curious about cannabis workshop for free not everybody actually took advantage of the opportunity to take it for free only a couple people did but they had the the opportunity to do that which was an 850 value some of these can of cards uh will have values that um range anywhere from a couple of bucks to two thousand dollars or more um so if you like what curious about cannabis does what we've been doing and how we've grown and you can kind of see how we're evolving then these cards could potentially bring quite a bit of value to you if you're wanting to take a lot of our workshops we also have a ton of self-paced courses that are going to be launching next month that are you know in general is trying to give people as many ways to learn about cannabis as possible but if you're interested in gauging and engaging all of those things um then you may want to consider trying to get one of these nfts um especially some of the rare ones and you won't necessarily have to buy them um we will have opportunities like uh giveaways um plus there's a kind of a whole game associated with these can of cards that i'm i'm not going to go into completely yet because we're still rolling it all out and everything in due time but essentially there will be um challenges that you can complete some are free some not the challenges that you can complete that will give you the rights to claim uh certain nfts with higher values you know so for instance if you're wanting to take a workshop you don't have 850 bucks to spend on getting into the you know the month and a half workshop well another approach you could take is trying to complete one of these challenges that may give you access to one of the rare can of cards that you can use to get into a workshop for free that kind of thing and so you know you may spend however much uh to get through the challenge like for instance one of the challenges will be you know taking a self-paced course on the learning platform which in general would be like 15 bucks or something you know you go do that but you also get access to one of these nfts which then gives you access to other stuff so in general it's not going to be for everyone but for those that are kind of into crypto and do like what curious about cannabis is doing and you want to see more of what we're capable of next we're kind of taking things in baby steps as we kind of organically grow here but if you're you know really really interested in in these workshops and everything um keep an eye out for announcements about the nfts and and what we're going to be doing with those if you want to learn more and kind of see some of these nfts you can go to openc.io so that's o p e n s e a dot io and that's the marketplace uh that where we'll initially be launching these and if you search for can of cards are curious about cannabis can of cards because there's a couple people have tried to do some spin-off kind of can of card stuff but as far as i'm aware we're the first and we certainly have the most uh nfts that are called can of cards but you may come across one or two others that use that name but if you search for curious about cannabis you'll find us and you can see uh some of the uh cards that we've put together um and and kind of get a feel for those you should see the one with the video embedded in it there's also a couple of signed cards um i have my signature on them um all sorts of stuff on there and we're going to be collaborating with artists and photographers and stuff in the canvas space to highlight um other people's work and in general um you know going through this process we've learned a lot so we're also gonna be helping cannabis companies get their own nfts made so if that's something you're interested in if you're an artist in the space or if you are if this is all interesting to you and you want to dabble in it um you know that's something that uh you can reach out to us about and um you know depending on the situation i might be able to to give you a little assistance there or we can collaborate and get your art on a can of card and the goal with that is that we'd be uh splitting any revenue that that comes from the cards so it's not like you'll be giving me my giving me your art and then just being thrown to the wayside uh anyone that we collaborate with on these projects um you know we plan on trying to split things pretty much right down the middle uh in most cases um so if you're not wanting to take on the infrastructure of nfts and you've got cannabis related art and that sort of thing that that might be useful reach out and we'll see you know what makes sense to do um yeah with that um another thing i wanted to announce is that it you know like i said at the beginning in general i'm gonna try to do more live streams um they'll be very casual kind of like this you know i don't even have my green screen uh my chroma key stuff running so you just see my green screen behind me you know these live streams will probably take place usually right after i'm done teaching and so i usually have a lot on my mind then but um yeah so be on the lookout for these live streams one thing i would like to talk about right now is delta eight thc a big subject um that is really really getting hyped especially after i think a new york times article came out not too long ago about it but i was recently interviewed on a podcast called brave new weed and um on that episode i think it's their most recent episode you can go look it up and listen if you like um but uh and we talked all about how delta 8 thc is generally made um how i'm getting a little thing here telling me my mic's too loud sorry if i've been yelling at you didn't mean to um you know basically how delta h thc is made how what we see in labs when we're testing these products um what sort of safety issues might be involved and what consumers need to know before they consume them and some of the main takeaways so once again go look up brave new weed and listen to the whole conversation i was also stoked that um apparently raphael machula heard the episode um and and sent an email out um you know um saying that he liked it and everything i was super super excited about that um one thing i need to do in one of these live streams is i um i had a back and forth with dr mushullum last year and just asked him some questions through email and stuff i would like to interview him on the podcast at some point but he's not always in great health and so it's that can be challenging but at some point i need to read his responses on my questions i think that might be fun but in that episode some of the takeaways and i'll just take a couple of minutes here and then i'm going to jump off but delta 8 thc molecularly exactly the same as delta nine thc except that a double bond is located in a slightly different place within one of the rings of the molecule and that is exactly the same same chemical formula um same 2d structure just like i said there's a double bond in a different place and for the chemists out there if you're familiar with the carbon numbering of the thc molecule i don't even have to explain this to you but the double bond in delta 9 thc is at the nine location uh the double bond and delta eight thcs in the eight location um and this is stuff you can see very clearly in the curious about cannabis book um i don't market myself enough so those of you that may not know uh there is a curious about cannabis book yeah you can find it on amazon barnes noble cacpodcast.combook but we actually talk about in that book how uh you know how chemicals are numbered where the delta nine comes from how delta nine compares to delta eight etcetera etcetera um but delta eight is basically the same as delta nine with the exception of that location of a double bond in the molecule but that small change results in fairly big differences in how the chemicals affect the body delta 8 seems to have similar receptor targets as delta 9 with weaker affinity which um kind of fits what people commonly talk about with delta eight that it's uh not as potent as delta nine in terms of intoxication potential and that sort of thing um and there's been a fair amount of research on how delta 8 could be used um therapeutically because it was looked at for a while as being this possible alternative to delta 9 um that wouldn't get people as high but you know they could still get a lot of the potential therapeutic benefit like anti-nausea effects um possibly even anxiety relieving effects a lot of the same stuff that has been known about thc so that sounds great right you've got a molecule where you're getting a lot of the benefit of delta 9 thc you know if you're not getting as high and it's available in the hemp market so um what's not to love well the problem there are multiple problems one there's a legal issue and we'll get to that in a second um but there's also a safety issue a lot of people assume that delta eight thc is extracted from cannabis for the most part no that's that's not the case now that's not to say that people are not extracting delta athc they certainly are but let's put this into context most of the delta 8 thc products that are on the market are in the hemp market generally you know i've tested i don't know how many samples of cannabis i've tested in the lab thousands upon thousands um delta thc even in thc rich cannabis cultivars shows up in extremely trace concentrations fractions of weight percents when you start talking about cbd dominant cannabis it's orders of magnitude lower um and delta 8 thc in general is kind of an artifact of delta 9 thc because it's it's not enzymatically produced by the plant it's uh the plant produces thca that decarboxylates to thc and then um over time that double bond moves around in the molecule and you've got a little bit of delta 8 thc in there so in general if you wanted to extract if you wanted to make a delta 8 thc product just from extraction and refinement you're talking about having to process absurd amounts of biomass of hip biomass that would just cost probably millions of dollars in between the the extraction process and the refinement process and everything to get um to where you've got some nice bulk delta 8 thc and clearly based on the pricing of delta 8 thc products people are not spending that much money to make it excuse me so what's going on well the way that most delta athc is produced is uh primarily from cbd cbd is isolated out of out of hemp that cbd is put into acidic conditions um usually with acetic acid or sulfuric acid and it's kind of left in a sort of broth like that for a while and cbd will change into delta nine thc and then eventually the delta nine thc will change into delta eight thc and you know you generally um through testing and other things you you know kind of follow that trajectory and um pull the you know stop the process once you've got quite a lot of delta eight thc in there and then often that product then gets um you know solvent purged out they'll then distill it and refine it into these delta eight thc distillates and it's that term distillate i think really confuses people because when you call something at distillate it hides its origin um because you could distill uh raw cannabis extracts you could distill a synthetically derived cannabis product in this cannabinoid product in this case and it's all called distillate and i think that's kind of what's delayed people cluing in on the fact that most delta athc on the market is synthetically derived um if you want to don't want to call it synthetic it's at least semi-synthetic i mean they're taking one chemical and making another chemical and the problem with that is that you get um well the chemical synthesis process is not perfect and so you get unintended by-products and if you listen to the curious about cannabis podcast i made a really silly uh kind of promotional thing for one of the episodes uh that was kind of like a game show and it kind of poked fun at this problem that people were trying to pass off delta 8 thc is an extract and then when they go and look under the hood they see all of these weird uh peaks representing um on the on sort of the analytical graph that would be called a chromatogram they see all these mystery quote unquote mystery peaks that represent these chemical byproducts thc isomers that we don't know what they are xothc delta 10 thc whatever thc most of these things we don't have reference standards for it's very hard to solidly identify so not only is most delta 8 thc on the market being synthetically produced but depending on the producer it can be very impure and depending on the analytical lab testing it um this may not be always obvious labs vary in quality quite a lot depending on where you are and what regulations there are and stuff and so i remember back in the day when i was doing cannabis testing in oregon before there were any regulations whatsoever there were labs we were competing against that were lumping together delta 9 delta 8 cbn anything that was related to thc they'd lump it all together just call it thc same sort of thing happens with delta eight thc depending on the lab sometimes uh they'll take all of these mystery peaks and just add them all up and say yeah that's pretty much delta atc um so unless you're actually looking at the raw chromatogram that the lab produces sometimes even the producer may not know how impure their products are um so just to summarize delta a thc mostly synthetic um there's a chemical byproduct problem we don't know what these chemicals are exactly that are kind of hitching a ride and those uh byproducts can range from two or three to five percent of the final product to as much as 10 15 20 30 i've seen delta 8 uh distillates that were really only about 30 percent pure with huge isomer peaks i didn't know what they were um and you also have the fact that some producers are manipulating test results i mean if you have a pdf editor you can go through and change what a pdf says and in the hip market that you know where the uh the testing world is in some places kind of still the wild wild west um that can be more or less easier to do so there's several major problems um some of which are specific to delta eight and some of which aren't um so you have all that then you have the legal issue that i mentioned so is delta athc legal uh synthetic delta athc is as far as we can tell not legal um and this is not legal advice i'm not an attorney i don't have legal training blah blah blah disclaimers um but the dea has clarified that synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinol meaning delta 9 thc and all of its isomers the thc class of compounds of which there are at least 30 or more that we know of all of those are controlled thus illegal in a very big way um the pushback from the hemp industry is folks say well but delta hthc is naturally occurring in hemp it is it is a natural phytocannabinoid and yes that is true but these products are not hemp derived they're derived from cbd which is derived from hemp but that is not the same and there's a big difference between producing a an herbal extract and producing a synthetic chemical regardless of whether that chemical occurs in nature or not if you have synthesized it it is a synthetic chemical and there are certain safety purity issues that come along with that that i've already highlighted so that's why this is kind of a no-brainer from the fed's perspective in the united states of course it's illegal is there much enforcement on this no are people taking advantage of this kind of lag of enforcement hell yes they are to the degree that there are companies that are spraying delta 8 thc on hemp flour to produce smokable flour that will get people high this is such a short-term vision i don't understand i do understand because human nature they're always going to be those people out there that are going to do stupid things um what all i will say sort of my mantra lately on some of this because i do a lot of consulting around cannabis quality and compliance and what i will say is that a lack of enforcement is not evidence of a lack of violation so just because the dea hasn't come after you just because the fda hasn't come after you um it doesn't mean that you're not doing something wrong and it also doesn't mean that they're not going to come after you later and possibly even retroactively apply um laws later so you may think you got away with it five years from now and they can still come down on you because a lot of these delta 8 thc products are very public a lot of these companies are very public about what they're doing and trying to rely on the gray area for safety i think that's incredibly stupid to do i'm sorry if that offends you um but just coming out of i i don't like the laws around cannabis and cannabinoids as they are i would love to see cannabis descheduled completely um and just totally take care of this issue but we're stuck with things the way they are for now and right now the way the controlled substances act is set up this is the way it is this is the feds have been pretty clear on how they read the law there's not really room for interpretation here uh even though a lot of people may argue that there is i really don't think there is uh in general you've always got to read laws as conservatively as possible because that's how they're going to be applied and interpreted not as liberally as possible that's just wishful thinking um so are delta athc products legal technically on a federal level no they're not not in terms of the controlled substances act um will people continue to get away with uh selling delta eight thc products for a while probably um i don't see indication that the dea is going to take action uh immediately but who knows um and i kind of expect that they will take a couple of bold moves at some point to make a statement that will kind of help balance the market a little bit likewise with the fda our cbd products legal that's a real gray area because the food drugs and cosmetics act says you can't put drugs in food or supplements cbd is technically a drug the fda has said in some of their warning letters to companies that they you know that's how they interpret the rules and even though they are continuing to take comments and and try to figure out how they're going to regulate the cbd industry technically according to the way the law is right now um cbd products sold as supplements and foods pet food cosmetics those are all technically they technically contain drugs once again i don't like that i don't like that that's the way the law is i think that lawmakers when they were writing the latest version of the farm bill and all that they should have been a lot more careful with their language so that we didn't have to deal with this problem and now congress is kind of trying to fix it by trying to get new legislation passed that would make exceptions for cbd uh to get it recognized as a dietary supplement and a signed uh grass status generally regarded as safe but right now that's not the case um it's just there's this lack of enforcement issue but like i said lack of enforcement is not indicative of a lack of violation and the fda is very careful about indicating in every warning letter that they send that just because they don't bring up a certain issue in a warning letter doesn't mean that that company has not violated other things they haven't mentioned this is all to say you know to those of you out there wanting to get into the cannabis industry want to get into to hemp and everything just really got to be careful and recognize that things are changing a lot and there's always hype around new laws there's so much hype around the farm bill and what it's going to do for the cbd industry that was just unfounded um and you know like i said you've really got to read laws conservatively because that's how they're going to be interpreted and applied most of the time a great example of this related to the farm bill is the issue over total thc is the reference to point three percent thc is that uh delta nine thc like the farm bill you know defines it or is it total thc that it incorporates thca the way that i read the farm bill it seems unambiguously that it is certainly total thc because the law as written states that that thc value has to be reported um as a post decarboxylation value which means total thc now does it explicitly say total thc no it doesn't have to though post decarboxylation that is a scientific term meaning after the carboxylic acid functional group has been removed from the molecule okay well um how do you calculate that like if you're doing liquid chromatography where you're actually seeing thca and thc separately the way you do it it's scientific mathematical thing divide the molecular mass of thca and thc you end up with a correction uh factor you find out you know thc is uh 87.7 percent the weight of thca the difference between those molecules the only difference between them is thc does not have the carboxylic acid functional group like uh thca does so you're just accounting for the loss of weight from basically that co2 molecule popping off of thca i don't see this as controversial i don't see this open to interpretation and i think when this gets challenged in courts um that's the way it's going to be read i think it's pretty clear that if you take the literal word of the farm bill and um you know as it stands right now title vii and the language of the controlled substances act which was amended when the farm bill passed to provide allowances for him it always brings you back to this post-decarboxylation requirement which means that it doesn't matter if um your product you know uh would would pass scrutiny under 0.3 delta 9 thc you've always got to assume the thca is going to be decarboxylated and and then add those values together so the actual formula just to make it clear for anyone that's watching or listening you just take thc your thc value and then you add it to uh you know put in parentheses your thca value times 0.877 which represents that 87.7 percent molecular difference and so you correct your thca for decarboxylation then you add it to thc um there's no other way to do it i mean that's that's all it is now one uh aspect to this that um folks may argue as well what about the fact that decarboxylation is never perfect so does doesn't the correction factor of 0.877 um exaggerate the decarboxylation potential i don't know i mean sure decarboxylation rates will vary for sure is it possible to totally decarboxylate thca it depends it depends on what you're doing with it and as i just pointed out with um like the delta eight thc issue i mean people are making are getting into synthetic semi-synthetic chemistry and everything and when you're getting into that world you kind of do have to make assumptions that people are going to completely decarboxylate and take that into account and i'll also point out the usda final rules clarified this issue and even put the formula in there so it's clear that the feds are reading this the same way that i'm reading it uh at least from my perspective that's that's the way it seems to me they haven't indicated in any way that i'm off as far as you know how i'm reading those words and i'm so you i'm very accustomed to reading legislation like i said i've just worked in quality management compliance for so long uh you just get used to understanding um you know how words are being used in laws and what they mean and how you know the writer that was writing the law you know what they were uh you know trying to get across and so it makes this kind of quick and easy if you're used to it but i can understand those that like don't read laws very very commonly they may not know certain things to look for nuances to to check and everything but you know uh the reading of of the farm bill and the control substances act makes it pretty clear that 0.3 percent uh value refers to um total what we often call an industry total thc or post decarboxylated thc um it is what it is uh i do think that when the farm bill is um revised i think that the definition of thc will be changed to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols all thcs all isomers it'll close the delta eight loophole um i'm not saying i want this to happen i'm saying this is the practical outcome that i expect based on my experience and based on my scientific knowledge and and other you know industry knowledge about all this stuff i don't really see it going a different direction but we'll see but i i expect that will change the definition of thc to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols and i think they will also bump up the 0.3 limit as a compromise with the industry they'll probably say okay you want us to bump up the 0.3 limit fine we'll do it however now more things count as thc and so it's it's gonna be kind of a double-edged sword uh sort of thing but um it's really not gonna affect things too much because these compounds are in such trace quantities uh concentrations like like delta thc for instance um uh and it's possible they could even change it to cannabinols which would also include cbn but i don't i kind of don't think they're going to do that i think they'll define it just as tetrahydrocannabinols they'll raise the 0.3 limit maybe to 0.5 or maybe to 1. i kind of don't think they'll go as high as 1. i think they'll they may go to 0.5 or 0.6 i think has been advocated for um but then a lot of these regulatory gray areas will be gone i also think that the next her revision of the farm bill if legislation doesn't pass beforehand uh there'll be something in there that clarifies for the fda how to think about these compounds whether we're going to give them treat them as generally regarded as safe uh how do we interpret these things in context of the food drugs and cosmetics act and when all of that happens which will happen in the next two years i think if i have my timing right how i'm thinking about this all of this ambiguity goes away and then i think we will see a new era of enforcement uh by the dea and the fda throughout um the hemp industry and all all cannabis um markets to some degree depending on how each state's laws are set up to protect themselves um yeah i don't know i could be totally totally wrong and that would be cool if i was but um i kind of don't think i will be um so um i did a recent podcast episode on the curious about cannabis podcast with david heldruth jr which i haven't gotten on youtube yet i need to catch up it takes longer to get things processed for youtube so that's just the way it is but we talk all about these issues and kind of how to prepare for the future of cannabinoid markets in the united states particularly and some of his companies have been working with the dea and the fda for quite a while um to understand how they're interpreting things and that conversation just told me that everything that i've been deciphering from all this seems to be on point based on the messaging he's hearing from the dea and the fda um so i don't know that ramble is just basically to say hey be careful out there and don't assume that just because you're getting away with something now that you will forever and it's generally not a good idea to build a business model with such short-term thinking in mind and for consumers out there be careful about new products in general um something we talked about in the workshop uh our live classroom session today in our workshop it's about contaminants and how uh as time has gone on you know cannabis flowers killing it in regulated markets as far as um you know being very clean and everything but when you get into extracts and concentrates and products made from extracts and concentrates you just enter a different world and the safety issue is just all over the place because when you think about safety of cannabis products you're not just talking about cannabinoids and terpenes you're talking about chemical byproducts you're talking about additives diluents excipients all sorts of different issues packaging hardware are metals leaching into your extract out of your vape pen i mean there's just a lot that goes in there so i don't know this is a live stream ramble so i just hope this has been helpful um stay safe out there don't assume that just because something is cannabis derived that it's safe it might be um but we got to be

doozy and bad that's what matters so I want to thank all of you that are new to my channel because I've had a lot of new subscribers and also all the people that have been here for a minute thank you thank you thank you so much for subscribing to my channel I cannot believe how many people have been watching my CVD video and my lien video um that was not supposed to go the way that it went the first time I did the CVD video that was just more so because a company had reached out and they wanted me to try their products I wasn't paid for it they just sent me the products and I've been wanting to try CBD products anyway so I was like okay I'll do it but that video has taken off and then also the lien video you guys really ripped me a new one with that one that was more so just for fun I like I had no intention of actually trying lean it was a joke it was literally a joke I know that that's not real aim I know that I I was corny I know that I know you guys you guys don't have to like rip me a new one every time you watch the video but thank you to everybody that's been watching it and commenting and supporting even if you're a hater and you're trying to tell me that I'm stupid or whatever you know I still love you I still love you follow follow what I decided to do since you guys love those videos so much I am still gonna do my business videos but those are gonna be more vlog style and I'm just gonna show you more behind the scenes because that's what everyone on my Instagram has been asking for anyway they always keep asking for behind-the-scenes and then I'll of course you guys on here you guys still a lot of you guys would still subscribe for my business stuff so I'm just gonna keep it to business and so I'm just gonna keep it to the vlogs and we'll try to at least one a week showing you some behind the scenes of whatever is going on with my business and then also I'm gonna try to do at least one CBD video a week I have a few products that I've been in trying out so one of them I'm gonna talk to you guys about today and I don't know what I'm gonna call this series yet I don't want to say that I'm like an expert on CBD just yet this is more so like for people that are new to CBD we're here okay we're here like we're doing this together we're trying this out together I don't know what I like and dislike yet I don't know which brands are my favorite so we're gonna figure this out together okay want to make sure that my reviews are actually helpful and not just stupid maybe this will be like CBD Diaries I don't know like I don't know CBD Adventures of Donnie so today I have this neutral hemp CBD and so they have a variety of products and I have a few other product from them that I'm gonna test out and tell you is about later they did not pay me for this either I they did send me the product for free to try I did not agree to like say positive things and I also did not get paid but yet they gave me a few things they gave me like a spray that you can put like an oral spray I guess like almost like a breath freshener or like any other spray you would like spray for medicine I guess because you guys know have you guys ever tried this throat sprays when I was little and I would get sick my mom would use give me those like throat sprays that would help soothe your throat so that's what I thought of immediately when they sent me this I was like oh this is like a throat spray but it's not so this is a oral spray we'll talk about this in in this video and what it does and how it actually works and then they also gave me these anti stress CBD things and these are like aloe it seems like a low dosage yeah these are like a low dosage on the spot you just pop it in your mouth if you're like having I don't know like a panic attack maybe I don't know you need some adult anxiety looks like I don't know yeah so they gave me these I'm gonna see how that works out if I really like it or not and then they gave me like a smaller oral spray that I can use on the go you know just in case my anxiety gets really bad that day I'm just kidding you can use you can use CBD for other things than just anxiety yeah just I'm just being stupid okay so anyways and luckily I don't deal with anxiety like I used to thank God I got is good but anyways but if you do have an anxiety I'm sure that CBD really would help okay so getting it let's get into this product and then I'll expand on that so the products that I'm actually going to be talking about today is their joint cream or it's in joint balm for pain and aches and whatever that you have in your joints this is how many ounces is this 10 ounces no it's one else this is one else this little jar right here I'll put the information in the description like I'm pricing whatever but when it came I was like okay cool so when you open it you guys this is what it looks like okay it's it wasn't even full like this is how it came I barely used that much so like that hold it that you see it comes like that like that it's not full when you get the jar and then also it smells like mr. Lathem I think that's how you say it it smells like old people okay like really medicated like do not wear this do not put this on before you leave the house because you will not smell cute at all this is something you use like before bed or it's gonna be a home in the comfort of yourself it's not something I will put on and then go out wear it because you will not smell that good but long story short what I use this for was I had like a really long day mind you like I said March and April word doozy okay we're still in April it's still a doozy okay like I'm ready for me but I'm not gonna lie like I have some days where I've just been tried and a lot of times when I have stress or anxiety whatever I like I said I haven't had issues with that in a long time but I will say this month this last two months or whatever I've had a little a little flare-up and that's what you at college but so anyways so a lot of times I internalize things and so the stress comes out of my body so after I've had a long day or whatever a lot of times if I have any aches or pains if it's not from working out it's normally because of stress so and I feel it like I literally will feel it on my body like in my back especially and then I'm noticed in this area a lot for me lately and so I was like excited to try this because I thought like you know it'll just help me rest better I just wanted to rest because I when I go to bed after a long day and then I wake up the next day and I don't feel fully rested you know what I mean because it's the tension in my body so I was excited to try this right what I did was I just took this and literally just rubbed a little bit of it and it rubs out really good I will say that like it's a I don't really want to touch it you guys I would do an example I don't want to touch it cause it smells that strong but yes it it rubs out really really well I'll just say that like a little goes a long way I didn't have to apply a whole lot and so I just rubbed it in all the areas that were aching and make sure everything was covered or whatever and then I just slept in something that I didn't mind smelling like this and then I just I noticed after about an hour my whole body felt fully relaxed if that makes sense it didn't take that long for me to start feeling it but I'll say like after hour I was for sure like relaxed I really really liked it you guys I got surprised because I didn't know if I was it was gonna work that well especially because it was like just topical it wasn't something that was taking internally because I I don't know I'm just somebody that believes like you with anything like if I'm ever in pain or whatever I'm always in my mind and I'm like the solution is going to be something that it's at my body before it's outside like every time I use anything whether it's eating pad or whatever to pick something on the outside even with it when it comes to my skin now the answer is never just you know external like I always feel like I need to keep something internal so I was really surprised and this actually worked as well as it did but yeah so if you are somebody that it's like ever dealt with body aches or you just have a lot of stress and tension in your body I would definitely say try this out try this out like like I said the only con is just the smell other than that like I said this dies I'm okay with it because a little goes a long way it definitely works this works this has 200 milligrams of CBD in it I'm still not sure you know completely of like what the different milligram like I course I can tell the difference when it says oh this is 200 versus 900 but I don't know how much of the difference that makes inside and the feeling just yet so I'm gonna compare it because 200 okay that's another thing I want to point out on this oral spray that they gave me the milligrams are 900 so that will actually probably be a good thing for me to test the difference like now take some you know and see how that affected any different versus some of these other things that they sent me because these are a lot these are a lot less these other items that they sent me I definitely love this anyway so that's that's the point of this video I loved this bomb and I want to try more external CBD things and see how that goes I've also been trying this hemp oil on my skin and I'll do like a whole other video on that if you're somebody that's interested in hearing about hemp oil for skincare and clearing your skin if you have acne and all those things so I'll do a video on that and kind of explain how that worked for me so I hope you guys liked this video I hope you guys liked the structure of this one too I tried to make it more informative and really give you more information about the product itself so that you can like actually enjoy it but I want to make sure that it's also fun we might be doing some other fun things with this series ok so just stay tuned I'm all about wellness and making sure that you know mentally you're good as well as like internally and on the last CBD video I did a lot of you guys are pointing out the diamond CBD brand is not good because they lace their CBD with other harmful things so please please please I apologize for even talking about that brand because I had no idea I have no idea at the time and so that really taught me like I need to do more research on those companies and one of you buying anything else from them and I'll be sure to be my research before using or promoting any other brand that you know is CBD like I will do my research and make sure that they are like they have good practices so this brand they are a good brandy I haven't seen anything bad about them just yeah if you didn't see something please let me know in the comments I'm sure you were going to anyway but yeah so thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video goodbye [Music]", "o_dsXDzx9nI": "[Music] every once dr. Rick this unboxing is going to be on topical medical cannabis use and I got three things - one of which I picked up in Colorado or at least I used in Colorado when I took a hiking excursion team up there I tell you I didn't know how to use that this was a couple years ago and a married medicinals is pretty decent it is it's a pump the pump you just spray once I'm gonna pump once and it comes out has a cream you between your hands and you put it on your back and you see that you feel the effects of the menthol you might have might not feel the effects of the CBD so all of the camp medical cannabis products in Illinois have to have a biochemical profile and that essentially means that it has to be broken down as far as all of its cannabinoids and the most important ones for figuring out how to purchase what is the ratio of CBD to THC now this one happens to have all CBD so I believe it's zero THC which I'm not sure how they came up with that because it is medical cannabis and there has to be some form of THC but I haven't called the company yet anyway this is all CBD I do not think that you'll have the psychogenic effect that smokers and vapors and edible or concentrate users will have because again no THC but just remember CBD cannabidiol which is a cannabinoid cannabinoid is just fractionation of the plant in the active ingredient of the plant CBD does get to the blood as far as stimulate the immune system with cb2 receptors on the immune system and it does get through the brain to stimulate or work on cb1 receptors of the brain so it does cross the blood-brain barrier but as far as giving you the psychogenic effect probably not now I felt when I this is my story when I finished a big hike we went back to the chalet in Colorado I took a shower I put this stuff all over the Summa because I was sore from that hike or from that ascent I figured I'm in pain so I might as I'll use the whole thing so I've covered myself like a moisturizer and not a good idea because of its menthol I was cool overly cooled for at least two to three hours now the other question somebody will have is well maybe that was a CBD and maybe I don't know but I would only use this sparingly so you should essentially just pump it you squeeze it out onto your hand it does have menthol so you have to watch your hand watch your hand to eye contact and then you put it on your trigger points of pain I would use it limitedly to one spot one region one area for at least five nights or twice a day for five days whatever you choose try to do that without any other variables to see how it affects you and just in case okay for some of you who are super sensitive or using THC at night streetwise or recreationally wise you do have to assume that there might be some entourage effect between the topical that gets into the skin and your THC that you used so just be careful it might accelerate the in the effect but you should always have your rescues and that's why I have these rescues here so your rescues will be the anecdote half of a half of the lemon or a full lemon squeezed black peppercorn black peppercorn ground up I usually just take this grind it up and are tell my patients that obviously I didn't break it yet tell my patients to grind it up and then put it in the lemon juice that you just squeezed and take that in now there's no overdose of those two things so you don't have to worry about that but it's supposed to neutralize the effects of the THC essentially it blocks like like these two things these are hemp-based CBD and CBD dominant medical marijuana so both of these you can probably see and if I felt here there you can hopefully see that the content here is dominant least CBD there is some cheatsy here in the hemp based product it doesn't have to say THC CBD breakdown because it's over-the-counter so you'll just have to assume that with the amount of CBD in here that it will neutralize your Tac so what these things do THC is the part of the plant if you take it at night or you take the whole plant part of the plant that gives you the psychogenic or makes you a little high dizzy forgetful fatigued so some people that might be good for PTSD sufferers but for non PTSD sufferers or people who are older trying to take care of rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia they're ready off and fatigued to begin with so we don't want extra that will rescue you it takes the THC which is supposed to be converted into something called eleven hydroxy THC another metabolite and it stops that so it'll helpfully help you get rid of your hai effect within 30 minutes I think again you can't really overdose on the natural things you can't really overdose on hemp you might overdose on the low THC medical CBD but that's the rescue should always have it around or you can just sleep it off or have a friend hold your hand so now into the topicals so we'll start with we already started with the topical cooling effect of all CBD that's Merri medicinals this is pain be gone I already opened that up so I it's technically out unboxing this is pain begun this bomb is mostly THC but here the exact breakdown and the type is so tiny I can't read that myself without my glasses so I'm squinting THC a hundred CBD zero so it's just the opposite this is all CBD all right out that you see that but if you can read great this is all THC pain begun and this is how it looks if I can open this up I just try to open it this is how it looks so that is a bomb it smells a little bit like marijuana but I'll just smell I can smell the oils I don't know this oil this is I have seen some people online make their own the only problem with making your own is that you can't have a problem with getting the exact percentages or by physical profile or by chemical profile so I don't know if it's and the THC might not be activated so you have the THC has to go through this complex process of decarboxylation to be activated you might not get that if you don't heat it properly I'm hoping that the companies have done their job so you will get the CBD product if your make it on your own through the skin but if you're looking for something else it might not get there so again this is mostly THC this is mostly CBD and finally this is lotion this is about half and half 100 of CBD and 100 of THC so this is half an F so this would be if you look at my video previous video on Ken at cannabis colors this would be red this will be indigo blue and this would be green because it's one to one if you can see that great and this one in addition to it being one to one it also hmm this doesn't even smell like cannabis smells like a spa this is nice oil but this also has Cayenne so it could be that the Cayenne I don't you can get the color of that that's kind of too much light in here maybe that you just got it but this is kind of salmon colored it smells more like the Cayenne than anything or the oil but this is hot this is hot this is neutral and this is cold so just these are options and the way I would play this would be that you use again you pick your five days straight and if you can use topical I really don't think you have to worry about even with the mostly THC one don't have to worry about it crossing the blood-brain barrier making you hide but use the red or a rescues if you have to I believe that if you do this two to three times a day if you like hot because you have a trigger point and you want to try it and try it there same amount two to three times a day for about five days straight if you want cool because you have hot flashes at night and you also have a trigger point or you have arthritis that's hot then use cooling to your area of attack but again two to three times a day five days straight no other variables to see how you effectively change and the other variables would be don't take any extra medicine take the usual but don't taint again an extra don't do anything new with your diet don't do anything new with your exercise and the same thing with the one-to-one you can potentially get a little bit because of THC content in here remember it's one THC to one CBD you can potentially get it to cross a blood-brain barrier but again if you use your rescues and you're really good you should be okay so if you notice good reflects with the use after five days of your experiment then cool you can use it anytime you want I usually use this as a supplement to my patients who are doing it orally using the concentrates orally or using the vapor smoke they'll have their protocol as far as what to do but during times of really bad flare-up I say don't change your formula as far as the vape smoke or concentrate but add this has an extra pain reliever locally so it doesn't add to the CBD that you have internally or add to the THC that you have internally it just gives you extra relief this is also very good for skin reactions those of you have psoriasis or eczema really nice I'm going to try it on a patient that has Lyme disease and is showing some psoriatic changes which were thought to be psoriasis but I really think it's Lyme so I'm gonna have him use this as well and we'll see how he turns out but hopefully you'll like this and if you have anybody that's on the fence as far as not exactly getting what they want from their oral or their smoked or their vaped and they want extra without having too much of a high affect then pass this on to them the other thing too is this can be a little expensive so you have to use it sparingly so as I mentioned I think this is for my patient I'm a caregiver for this thing is like 40 to 45 bucks this one I think it was same this one 30 bucks so they they go fast so you have to use them sparingly and again you have to wash your hands after you use these just in case you have to rub your eyes and one more thing the final note is that when you put this on topically you might still turn positive if you have a drug test so I know it you're not supposed to have that much THC in this thing or this thing but you can still turn positive now I don't think you're gonna have to worry about that but just plan on it and I addendum if you have it on your skin and you go and hug somebody that's a do T driver you can technically pass it on to them or if you hug a less than 21 year old you just got them to absorb too because they'll rub off on them technically even if it's a couple hours later can still rub off so be careful about your exposure past this video on if you like it otherwise subscribe to me

have a video that I have yet to put up it's like more of like a bougie face mask it is the zombie Hannah cure facial because it makes you kind of look like old and it just like makes your like faith it's kind of hard to explain and you literally look like a zombie so because I have that bougie ER version coming out that I would do a super affordable face mask I got this at Walmart and it was like two dollars and fifty cents so it is the uncle buds organic hemp oil rose gold face mask I know like CBD oils and hemp has been around forever like hemp lotions and stuff like that but I seen the whole line at Walmart and it's just interesting like nowadays you see the stuff and before like you know you couldn't even find him lotion unless it was like at Sally's or something I thought I would try it out and I was looking online and it I it says rose gold face mask and I thought it was gonna be like you know those like face masks where they get kind of like jelly and they have like like a sheen of color I thought it was gonna be like a pretty rose gold like the packaging but apparently it's not it's like a creamy just like white it says that it revitalizes it hydrates and it tightens this is the power of hemp oil to hydrate and refresh your skin made with pure organic hemp seed oil Moroccan rose water full of antioxidants to help protect cell damage soothes skin irritation and remove oils to help control breakouts so it sounds good but we'll see this put an even layer onto your skin onto dry skin which I have dry skin right now I don't have anything on my face do not apply around eye area leave mask on for 10 to 15 minutes it's cruelty free and paraben free it smells good it kind of smells like sunscreen a little bit umm if I was gonna compare it to anything I'm going to put this on my face wait 15 minutes hopefully I have any irritation or anything because I have really sensitive skin this is the consistency of it right here the color it's like white and creamy I'm gonna try to put this on as cute as possible okay so I have Surrey with a set timer for 15 minutes and it feels very cooling right now now an honorable mention is this Tony moly peach punch and this is a cleansing water the stuff smells so good and I feel like it like refreshes my face and it just makes my skin feel like super fresh and hydrated I don't feel any itching or anything on my skin like no irritation so usually after face masks my skin is kind of red so we'll see what happens I'm gonna get the packaging really quick so I can read the ingredients just water I'm not gonna try try to even pretend like I know how to pronounce all this stuff um cannabis sativa seed oil and in in parentheses it says hemp seed oil and that's like one of the main ingredients because usually like if it's the main ingredient and they'll have it unlike the first four first five ingredients so that's really good because that means that there's like a good amount of that in here rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water and then use as often as you wish so usually like if something is more abrasive or like has ingredients like active ingredients and stuff you could only use it like a few times a week this one says you can use as much as you want so I'm kind of interested to see if they have it in like a bottle form or like a jar because if it works good I'm gonna I'm definitely gonna get some more it would probably be more beneficial to look on their website just because like they had their stuff on this little like kiosk at Walmart the one use facial masks I seen that they had a lip um they had a lip balm and they had like a lip scrub so I'm definitely gonna go back for those but yeah this one just I was looking for a face mask and this one caught my attention another thing that I wanted to mention is I don't know if you guys are into this stuff but I really am into like paranormal stuff and true crime and I started a podcast and I'm going to be posting my first episode of the podcast pretty soon so I will link that below if it's up before I post this video then it will be in the comments but are not the comments will be in the description you guys are into it check it out um my first series of my podcast is going to be focused mainly on true crimes so like disappearances murders um you know just stuff like that and then I want to definitely incorporate some other types of stuff that I'm interested in so I will post the links below and then in the future videos I'll definitely have some stuff up and I'll post that in the description bar below it's definitely jiying I don't feel like it's tightening up or anything it's funny though cuz I'm like how did I get so much art here but like not enough right there but yeah it doesn't feel like it's tightening or anything but I can definitely feel it drying it's not itchy still I'm like that I'm huge on that if I say itchy like four times in this video it's because I really do care if something's itching my skin it really bugs me okay so my timer just went off and I am going to wash this off and I will be right back okay I'm back I just washed it off and but like my skin does kind of look like rejuvenate it and definitely feel hydrated I feel like it revitalize my skin my skin feels nice and soft and it's not irritating whatsoever I could feel the masque tightening but I can't really feel like I can't really say that my face feels more like firm um that probably will take effect like if you used this on an everyday basis or something like that but I definitely am interested in trying more of their products and if you guys were wondering about this mask in particular and you see that Walmart then go ahead and pick it up because I think it's a really good mask I like natural products and this mask has all natural products and it's cruelty free so that's a huge plus for me and if you guys liked this video give it a thumbs up thank you for watching subscribe to my channel if you're not already subscribed and let me know if there's any skincare you want to see on my channel I like try new things so I definitely will take whatever you say into account and give it a shot thank you for

Yeah, because we always have stupid discussions like this Is it gonna be on the, yeah we'll have a link down below, and there's a reason we like iherb.com, they they fit with our perception and our Approach to handling pain don't they Brad? Right try to do it conservatively in a manner that Doesn't require opioids, right doesn't really require any medications. This is all over-the-counter stuff There's no downside to trying this stuff. I mean, it's not gonna have any side effects It's not addictive, it either is gonna help you or not I guess with the exception unless for some reason you might have a skin reaction, that would be the only Downside and iherb is the largest online store for natural products they have 1,200 brands and They have over 35,000 products and Brad and I are gonna go on there and count them tonight to make sure they have 35,000 That's our old joke The second thing we like is because we're all very conscientious of price Their price is usually 30 to 40% less than if you went to a pharmacy or a health food store So we're all trying to save a buck, and if you use the links below to buy any of these products You'll get another five percent off. You know we make sure Let's give everybody a bargain and the last thing I really like about them Brad is they kind of built this business with the idea they're gonna have these perishable products, they built a warehouse that's Climate-controlled, very clean, they have a rapid turnover products You don't have to worry that these things have expired at all and they go so the shelf-life You don't have to worry about it being on the shelf for four years. They grabbed it off the floor Or that it's sitting next to a can of motor oil They got it all figured out Alright, so Brad and I did a video previously on pain patches, and we might allude to them again today But these are some of the products that they have for pain patches, why don't we just kind of put those off to the side But we also have the ointments and the creams, and I had to look up What's the difference between an ointment and a cream and apparently ointments have a little more oil in them, And it makes them a little more greasy Greasy? That's how they describe it, very good, we have three types here Well Bob before we go any further. I did notice there's a few people If you are new to our Channel, please take a second to subscribe to us We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit, pain-free And we upload every day and also go over to Facebook and like us because Brad and I like to be liked there you go Alright, so we got three products. Yep, and you've tried all three, Brad? Yep, all three of them, alright and I tried two of them because you had the Tiger Balm So I couldn't try that, but my wife tried that too though She did okay, so let's kind of give our opinion on these two so this is the T Relief and Topricin pain relief cream they have really no smell to them, right yeah that that's what I liked about it Yeah, so there wasn't any of that and sometimes people want the smell, right they want the fragrance But in this case especially like if I'm at work or something like that and working with patients closely So I put them on my knees just to see. I worked out with them and that was fine, too It didn't really leave a stain on my clothing or anything so Where did you try these? On my low back, and I like this one right here, The T Relief I had good success with it and I keep it in my bedroom so that If I got some I back pain I use it and it's nice because before work I can go to work with it, and I don't have to work with patients. There's no I wouldn't say it's an odor but some of these you got that menthol smell. Yeah, again I like that but again I don't want to work with somebody that might be a little bit sensitive to it Here in the medical field you don't want to put cologne on because some people are allergic to it Or they don't respond well, so you want to be very neutral. Yep, so that's that's why these work great This by the way just to give you some price comparisons This is like $12.71 from what I saw on their site This was $9.99 this bigger one here and the tiger balm was $6.80 I think that was this one six dollars little bit more concentrated. Yeah, so all of them they're fairly inexpensive and Now your wife tried this one? Right. Yep. I used the one on my back I had better luck with that, but this actually you get that menthol cooling feeling which helped But again for the reasons. I just started discussed this has that menthol fragrance, my wife used it She had a bad cold so she put it on her throat She had a sore throat and whatnot and you know slept with it overnight and whatnot and that always feels really good Yeah, it gives you that, so I think it's just like with the pain patches Brad It's a really personal thing you're gonna find one that works for you now I looked at the reviews on these and they all had pretty good reviews There's a lot of people that do like them, and we look at these as tools They are not gonna take away your pain Cure it is what I'm trying to say, but we we kind of a formula here You know what we say is you have temporary relief Plus movement so if you can figure out some movements to do because usually a lot of times movements will sometimes heal your pain, right Temporary relief plus movement can equal permanent relief So let's say take the neck let's say you're gonna take some of this cream you're gonna rub it all over your neck and now the pain is diminished enough that you can try some movement within there, some neck rotations Generally with necks we often start off with you're gonna do chin tucks Put the cream on And then you're gonna do some chin tucks like this, and then eventually we want you to work on doing some extension like this This is very actually relevant to me today Brad because I was getting sore right in here, and I was doing these this morning Okay, I should have put some cream on, and it's actually just has loosened up now, Because I was doing a lot of these. Yep. So it worked out really good, for some people That motion doesn't work very good, so for some people you do the chin tuck and side-bend to the the side of the pain So the pain's over here? Chin tuck. Bend to the side. This is the direction I tend to go because I get pain on this side, because I tend to lean like this all day So you want to balance it out For some people it's rotations Brad, and even if it hurts one direction just go in the other direction right now And you can even give yourself a little stretch back in the head and always in really good posture, gentle stretch A little stretch is good might as well crank a little harder. That's not the idea Do your fingertips only and stretch you should just feel stretch pain any sharp pain with any of these You don't want to do that, so again hopefully this is gonna allow you to do this comfortably again It's one of the tools you're gonna have to cope with the pain Again if you can get away from using medications And you can just use these this is a big in the plus column, right exactly Another one Brad would be the shoulder, a lot of people have shoulder problems, you could rub the creams on there and then We're gonna want you to try some Movements with the shoulder, one of the ones that we often start off with is Extension, so you actually It really helps to take like a broomstick or this is a PVC pipe or a cane and My thumb is down here, and I'm gonna start working back like this and again, you know the cream or the Ointment hopefully takes away some of the pain And this should be a painless thing too, you can go up to the pain, but no further, you know a little Stretch kind of a pain is fine But if it gets that sharp pain, then you're going too far and you need to back off a little bit You know and it might be a forward flexion thing You can work on forward flexion too so let me go this way, so I'm gonna go ahead I'm grabbing below here, and I'm gonna start working on flexion here. Yep working into that direction Let's say this is my arm that had arthritis perhaps You can just grab your hands together and let the strong arm or the good hand help the weak one And we just go up like that until you can go, and you can do 10 to 15 repetitions And then leave it rest and come back an hour or two later and work it again And then one eventually you'd like to work on and is you can take a strap or a belt works out good too You can hook your hand in here and take it around like this, and I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna work on pulling it up like this and this seems like a strange one to be doing But it really actually is one of the ones that you want to use towards the end where the shoulder's getting better To really complete things, you can see if you're having problems reaching back You can compare like if this one's way up here, and this one's right here You know you got to get that one up there too eventually Again just Consider it. These are tools They're inexpensive, and they help you get through the day, and that's all really sometimes We need to do is manage the pain enough to get through so and then eventually improve And you know the body wants to heal itself We just need to give it time and work with these to get through, a little assistance. Alright thanks everybody for watching. You", "qA2iUMLWKwI": "what's up y'all as you can see this is not an unboxing this is more of a strain review a CBD strain review from five leaf willness but I dropped that y'all know me first things first I got to put some smoke in there and I do that [ __ ] with the combo so Cheers in much love y'all that's how you start a video now I'm ready alright this is how it comes well it comes in a box but it comes like this bubble wraps vacuum seals and then in the vacuum seal there's a letter in there a statement that says notice to law enforcement authorities what is considered in this package might look like marijuana but it's actually legal industrial hemp flour so they give you a little statement there so the police if it gets you know opened up thinking it's marijuana this is legal in all 50 states we'll open it up and we'll do a little strain review just five different strains in here a little and then here's the little packs and some eighth which is oh no this is 2 grams to grams to grams to grams and then three point five which is eight alright so I also have a letter here that they sent and it says thank you for doing a strain review for five leaf Wellness in Chattanooga Tennessee in this package we have included five strains seven cherries which contains 14.6% CBD trump which contains 17.5% CBD Hawaiian Hays containing twelve point seven CBD and let's see sour sauce fourteen point eight CBD and then the last one is sour space candy at twelve point eight CBD and it says all of our strains are compliant with the 2018 farm bill meaning that each of our strains

wellness.com alright so I got a little bubbler here and I'm gonna open these up show you well show you what they look like tell you what they smell like and then tell you what they taste like so first one I see well let's go off the list seven cherries let's see seven cherries is indoor and 3.5 grams 4.6% 14.6% you see smells kind of fruity that's what it looks like hopefully this did get a nice little whatever so there we go I am that's how it works all right so we'll pull off a little chunk of this put it in this bubbler and see how it tastes and what I'm gonna do just kick this slider instead of a torch lighter and stripe this is seven cherries cheers y'all it's definitely not bad it's a little earthy but that's what you expect from a CVD strain at least that's what I expect so there is a little sweet taste to it but yeah not bad and CBD is is good for medicinal purposes we've got a lot of good things that it helps you know anxiety stress depression so CBD is a wonder drug I wonder plant alright next one that we see is truck which is 17.5% THC I mean CBD I'm sorry there's no stairs no CBD no THC alright so here's the Trump smells about the same has a sour smell to it it's a little dry flaky oh yeah oh it's sticky though it'd be like but there you go I don't know if you could see just pull off a little chunk of this see how this tastes let's say I break so pretty good by hand it is sticky all right so let's try this one out this is the Trump at 17.5% CBD and 0.3 percent THC so Cheers well I'm gonna have to do that one again because I suck it off to to do the month of a bag we'll put that away and we'll get the bong out and do some real reps [ __ ] that Butler here we go boom crumble it up put it in the ball it's roast it cheers and much love yeah yeah that's definitely earthy just like most CBD strains man I have to take another one just a double check this one Justin it's uh yeah it's earthy Cheers okay that was better that had a smoother taste to it yeah there's not much flavor on CBD flour I'm gonna tell you that now I want taste like the last one so my weight with me being honest like I always am I would just go for the highest percentage and the one that that looks the best in the pictures while you're ordering that definitely mellowed me out let me go for the next one which is mm Hawaiian haze and this one is 12.7% CBD and less than 0.3 percent THC all right it honestly it has the same smell as the other three kind of smells this one kind of smells a little bit more funky like like cat piss maybe so I'll try it out like I said this one is so 12.7% CBD oh this one don't crumble up quite as good as the last ones it's a little more sticky the bud is a little more dense and it breaks down wave fluffier so let's get it let's try this one out this is Hawaiian haze Cheers it much love y'all alright that was a little more smoother honestly yeah I think I enjoyed that one so there's a whiny he's quite taste quite better than the rest of them so far and it's like I said I don't know if I showed you this one you see this is what it looked like a little more dense alright what's next my haze at twelve point seven now we have some sour sauce at fourteen point eight fourteen point O says to says two on the back but it's eight on here so I'm sure it's eight okay this is like a little purple you lookin bud a little darker still has the same smell yeah still has that sour funky smell you know it's hard to explain you know you know you know that's that's all I can say if you smelt like a funky sour let's go ahead and put this fat noggin in the bowl this is some fluffy stuff this stuff breaks down and flows up in the bowl let me show you what it looks like sour sauce all right here you go yeah if they had that same smell

my bad y'all let me roast the sour sauce first and tell you how that [ __ ] is CBD is some good [ __ ] trust me I had a little different aftertaste yeah little sour I think the the Hawaiian haze is my

interchange because that's what I just along with these reviews choosing much-loved yeah this one is 12.8% CBD chief Oh that wouldn't taste real green at the end like uh well I think I like that one I

a premium skin care line by irwin naturals erwin is a big supplement company i tested their cbd oil in the past it was okay but it was a c-score from the labs they had a little little too much but overall it was a decent full spectrum cbd had a great price here i'm to give you hydrocannas lab results the cannabinoid breakdown the cost breakdown in my opinion let's drop those uh lab results right after my intro and disclaimer my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer lab results do not guarantee all products but a cbd company will test the same many cbd companies produce inconsistent or entirely fake cbd i use affiliate links to support these free lab tests these are my honest opinions this is not sponsored i pay for the products and i pay for the lab test all cbd is blind tested to give you truly independent results you're welcome visit cbdxamen.com for official lab tests and more this is not medical advice enjoy hydrocanna claims for 45 dollars you get 600 milligrams of cbd the independent labs found 12 to 19 more cbd b scores okay all right hydrocanna claims this is a full spectrum which should have cbd thc and other cannabinoids no but labs say not really let me break down what's going on here in the gram breakdown hydrocanna claims about 4.25 milligrams per gram that's a about a milliliter dose and we found closer to five milligrams of cbd which is fine that would be a lowish cbd dose for a pain cream but this is just a body lotion so that may be enough to make your skin a little happier however this is not a full spectrum the 0.05 milligrams of thc found by lab b was below the level of quantitation which means lab b detected it but they could not accurately quantify it lab a didn't even detect it at all and then labbe found some trace levels of other cannabinoids that lab b did not this is common they have different detection rates and the trace levels found here are basically meaningless this to me is just a cbd oil or topical the price the price is 6.7 cents average for topicals is about 17 cents so this is actually good especially when you look at the the bottle i was expecting this to cost way more the presentation doesn't get much nicer than this looks high-end high-end beauty something i would know nothing about but the uh this the dispenser mechanism is premium the labeling the uh opaque little top here is nice too and then the the box when you open the box there's a little nice bird that says all the magic you need oh and then the on the back side it says is inside you clever then the uh the body lotion is silky and it smells fantastic goes on clear there's a little bit of spice smell to it tiny bit of floral smell i think uh i smelled the turmeric a little bit but it smells good and it's a citrusy smell it smells kind of like citrus spice it's uh super good hydrocannon claims that the real secret to this is something called c60 fullerenes it's got some research on it as an antioxidant which is nice for skin health they claim it's been an essential part of japanese skin care i don't know about that but it feels nice now normally when i see a product that says full spectrum and then i found out it's not full spectrum i say run for the hills that's probably what you should do but aside from the lies this is one of the nicest cbd creams that i've come across it smells good feels good my skin feels nicer and this is why i tell you to pay attention to my lab results and not my opinions i can't recommend this fake full spectrum cream but i like it i'm going to use the rest of it run", "5MXhjRljHKg": "hi everyone my name is Lauren Gao and this is life above the clouds and today I am going to show you another great method of making a cannabis infusion you can use this with olive oil which is what I'm going to do today but you can also use coconut oil or butter right now I have a piece of cheesecloth here that's folded in half so you make sure that it's double layered and I also have a little strip that I've cut off already and here is half a gram of decarboxylated cannabis so I have my cannabis in the middle of my cheesecloth and I'm just gonna fold it up like a little present so make sure that it overlap and this little packet so I'm just gonna take my little packet and tie it up with my piece of cheesecloth I'm just gonna stick it in to my jar and I'm gonna fill it up with oil give it a little shake make sure it seals and here I have a pot of water it's not quite boiling yet we want it to be at 200 to 225 degrees so I'm just gonna carefully placed it in clear you also don't want your jar to be touching the bottom of your pan or your pot if you have another lid from another jar you can place it underneath there you can place a dish towel underneath there I actually have this really great metal basket that came with my pots and I have the water about halfway just one enough cover the level of oil in your car so we let this go for two hours I pulled it out and let it cool down and now it is time to unseal this we're just going to fish out our little packet squeeze out all the oil we can see this is about as much as we can get out of this guy and there you have it you're finished oil so you can use this oil by itself like you would any olive oil you can use it to cook with in your pan you can use it to make salad dressings or you can use it to bake with which is the first my favorite thing to do if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up

make videos all about like holistic living intentional conscious living you know well-being and just like livin life holistically essentially and I wanted to make her super super quick update today on my mental health journey I know I've mentioned this on my personal Instagram page so follow me if you're not following me already a godly afro um but I'm not sure if I've mentioned this on my youtube channel before but and I've had a history or I have a history of mild depression and anxiety and I was formerly told that that's why I have stroke had last summer in about August of last summer I believe so all those 2018 and and I wasn't really happy when I was told that and I started looking into CBT and stuff but I wanted this to give you an update on what I found has been super super helpful for my mother decide to my mud depression thank you so much to ami Maxine and also like other youtubers who have been really educating us about CBD oil this is the one I use and I got it from Holland and Barrett and not too short the Canlis very soon or not but this is a 5% CBD oil and I was using this I believe for just under two months and for me the source of my stressor is my full-time job I'm a HR advisor specialist like a senior HR advisor for massive corporation corporate environment just really stressful but and I started using CBD oil because I saw Amy Maxine and other nutri you know just speaking about the benefits of CBD oil I bought mine from Holland embarrass I think it was like 1699 I'm not to talk cause it was a it was quite a long time ago and the thing is I didn't use it for two months because my mother in Scythia my my depression went away so I'm kind of but like if it's good what's the point of me continuing to use it so actually I haven't used it since about like March of this year March of 2019 because I really feel like it's helped so much that I don't even need to use it anymore so then when I first started using the CBD oil I didn't really notice any physical sensations or changes in my body I think my head felt to be honest overall I didn't feel different I think that it tastes absolutely horrific what awful taste but you do get used to it and but in terms of how my head thought I think like the first day I used it I think my head felt a bit like mellow ever so slightly ever so slightly minute it was barely noticeable and then what I found over time is that even though my stress I didn't change so my work was the less stressful as it ever was nothing at work changed but I just found that my I wasn't feeling as anxious as I used to feel before I started taking the CBD oil so Biff previously like last year I used to get like heart palpitations I used to my head used to flick it was being squashed when I was really stressed out I used to feel like it was being squashed now made my breathing book increase that quick and rapidly that is felt like probably like the beginning signs of a panic attack I never had a panic attack before but I assume that that is how one feels when an attack is about to commence so yeah I kind of that's how I used to feel this essentially but when I started using the CBD oil those symptoms went away you know girl I was equally as stressed I didn't feel like the rapid heart breathing or I couldn't breathe and I didn't flip my head my head did look like it was being squashed you know I thought it's quite hard to explain but essentially since using the CBD all those symptoms those physical sensations have gone the way and I have not experienced them I'm actually I don't even feel as as stressed I haven't even thought stressed or anxious and it has been about I think four months now and I took it to work every single day so I used to take it in the morning and I kept it in my work bag so I took it to work every single day took about I think it was three three two to three drops in the morning before work so it had a chance to enter my system before I reached the work place and then I think on like rare occasions I used to take it at lunch as well so you know perhaps two times a day but that was only on really stressful days but honestly I use it for about two months and towards the end of those two months I feel like I didn't even need to use it anymore because I just wasn't reacting the same way to distressful situations in the way that I used to interact to them before and my body just felt relaxed it didn't feel anxious and like it was about to have a panic attack so I really truly truly am an advocate of CBD oil and and I do have some information about what CBD oil is because obviously I think this is still quite a newish being all those lots of people are talking about it I'm going to read from my phone I'm not gonna pretend like I know all of this for my heart because I don't but I truly am an advocate of anything like holistic medicine natural alternatives to you know prescription drugs and you know all of those kind of things so essentially what the research that I have collected is that CVE or is a concoction of Panepinto kind of big deal over stand perhaps announcing that film and and a natural carrier or such as hemp or coconut oil I think my one has yo- hemp to the character carrier although my one is hemp seed oil and it's a CBD or has been officially listed as a medicine by the British medicines and Healthcare Products regulatory agency since 2017 and it's legal as long as it's derived from EU approved hemp and as long as it contains no more than 0.2 percent THC and THC is the psycho active part of marijuana and its really good for stress and anxiety because it has anti-inflammatory properties and it can also improve things like your sleep and your immune system and your physical strength it helps your stress and it can also reduce epileptic seizures so sleepily oh I think is wonderful if you've got modern society mild depression or even like severe mental health conditions I think it's worth a try before you you know precede them to use in the prescriptions that perhaps your GP may give you but yeah I just wanted to give you an update on my mental health journey and also what I've been using what'd you find anything helpful hopefully my camera has not died great and my mum's back think of her in the bar in the background but yes thanks for watching this video and please subscribe if you haven't subscribed already

time it is there's the low and the high we're gonna see how that presses later anyway let's uh yeah let's see how she does all right uh when i said let's see how she does um break the woman up to 170 and i have um 18 grams of 74 to 159 micron dry sift not melt or bubble flash just dry cleaned very very efficiently clean and let's see how she presses those you're wondering um and thank send yourself that's a different press it is um i have a lot when i you know when i'm dialing things in or dialing in um specific psi's time uh press time press times um temperatures etc um i love my rosin press new york 20-ton tank right there beast plates are huge just love it but for tonight again as i mentioned a lot of work to do and a lot of presses and i have everything else out there this is really the only uh one of a few hash presses tonight um i know a lot of people aren't big fans of flower rosin but um it's a very you know as far as the the economics of it it's an undeniable product you know um it's a it's a completely solventless full melt product that that we can shell for very very cheap and it's never bad and that's like as dark as it gets and that's not bad at all always a nice butter consistency um i try to keep it fresh fresh but literally i don't know with flour rosin i can collect it immediately and jar it and get it into the freezer immediately and it's still buttered by the next day all right it's time to give this thing some pressure and by some pressure i mean little to none and now yep there we go we just deployed this place back down to zero psi so around a thousand and it's falling pretty quickly we're warming up and i'm evening out the bag here um again i have no idea how this press is going to go so i don't know if i said that or not yet but if i had been if i didn't say that or not yet now we have no expectations here um no guarantees of gold or anything all right up to about 25 hundo and what do you guys see in there nothing either huh falling pretty fast hit the three and it's falling relatively fast again um we have to be making some rosin i have a feeling i'm going to be heartbroken over the yield but i don't know then again maybe you just needed a minute you guys see both of us we got just in case you're wondering and back down hey turned out to be a pretty decent dry sip hash press after all um and for that anybody that might care this specific strain is cbd kush it's uh it's still very high in thc it's just it's uh well it's much higher you know most of your strains that have any thc in them have you know one percent maybe one and a half or no cbd this has i want to say like six 11 or maybe yeah 11 that's right that's right it's 11 cbd 16 to use so three to two and go ahead and uh run this guy across the top clean that out there we're at max psi there uh if anybody cares i'm i'm not trying to go any higher than six or sixty five hundred um i bumped right up to 6500 there and it fell pretty quickly there's obviously still some more hash to this place let's look at where it looks like we're going to get a reasonably looks like we're going to get a relatively decent yield got about 15 seconds left here there's more than definitely going to be a second press in this but i have had it on the plates for long enough that that can be our second press oof oh yeah all right how'd it come out how to come out um i know we're probably looking at the camera right there going like bro very dark rosin um you know as i mentioned dry shift and let's try something from some cbd kush buds that um let's see we're not only uh dry but they've been curing for a while so there's gonna be some you know the alpha and beta chlorophyll properties some mature maturization of the trichrome head is going to of course amber eyes that milky white or uh even just cloudy i'll tell you what the good reward again i feel like well i mean obviously that's [ __ ] i feel like this guy's got a second press in him but you know i don't know i'll never find out um i keep all my pucks and i keep them separate yeah i keep my rosin chips separate so that i can make solventless coconut oil with them and then i also go ahead and turn it up a little notch there and make that solventless coconut oil that you can use to make edibles you can dose your own you know what i mean let's see if i can get you guys in here really does look a lot darker than it than it actually is if you go you know um it looks it's yeah it's crazy looks darker on the camera that does the eye but it's not it's not a dark it's not too dark sorry of a chocolate color but it is gorgeous and as far as stability goes well let me just show you i can already tell just how it's going to act by holding the parchment for a minute yes my favorite ash rosins come up with this sorry i don't know i mean my favorite presses come up like this um whether they be you know flower or ash or whatever obviously as a smoker i i personally prefer hash rosin but it's uh it can be significantly more expensive and it can also be not available depending on where you are you know what your deal is if you're one of the people that you know follows me or um or has been following me for a little while or maybe uh or you you know you live in the pnw you're in the oregon market the wreck market uh california market washington market etc you guys just i'm not talking to you guys um and but even still you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about as far as the pricing of the hash rosin it's just brutal look at that i want you to see that collection let's go ahead and grab go back and grab our other one there we go right there right right there oh don't break on me oh it broke on me hey we got them all there you go ladies and gentlemen there is our cbd kush dry sift hash rosin not flower rosin damn okay oh we were gonna do yield weren't we i mean why not right okay let's see i'll try not to take too much longer i'm sure you guys are probably already bored if anybody's even uh you know i imagine 90 of you already have checked out and or maybe you just fast-forwarded to here i don't know either way my apologies for moving too slow for you damn that's stable that's the thing man with ah you can get the uh you can get hash rosin to maintain its fresh breast consistency much longer and also of course i'm working in a cold room right now so it's not really going to start to butter like this if you guys can see that or not but we are at 5.4 out of 18 which um 5.4 out of 18 that's almost 33 that's a solid 30 percent yield solid 30 yield on some triceps that i did not take a bunch of time and try and card and get it all clean and perfect or anything i just mucked it all around beat the hell out of it and uh i bet we can get this to 5.4 and above [ __ ] five point four nine five point five five and a half grams five and a half grams eleven sixteen and a half grams that'd be thirty three percent yeah we're definitely into this into a solid thirty um what's beautiful about this is that number one sloppy sloppily collected dry sift this the reason this gave me a third yield and some very reasonable quality hash rosin for a cured product not live not fresh frozen not fresh cured um this gave me the 33 yield because or 30 sorry about 30 yield because of the micron specifics this guy which is 25 to 73 the low microns and the high 160 to 249 i'm sure this guy will probably only yield about i don't know if this yield if the other one yielded 30 this will probably only yield 15 or 20. but there's a good bit in here so you know if we have uh 40 grams of sift in there or 30 grams of sip in there and i get uh 20 off of it well then we got another six grams of beautiful hash ruffles and of course then we can put it all together and it's and it's just full spectrum now let's see here i'll show you one more we'll get it prepared for you a little bit whew yeah it's just yucky i don't know i know some of you going like yo that is dark it's gross ew it's cured resin it's not fresh frozen and again it's frozen it's not gonna have that kind of clarity to it you know um it could have a beautiful color to it but it shouldn't unless it's very very fresh pressed and it's very live and has that beautiful color generally is not a lot of clarity this stuff is already starting to butter as you can see but you know i'm not uh i'm not writing any letters home about it or anything but again this is cured product and i keep forgetting to get this far i keep distracted getting distracted sorry aside from this being cured for the product not being fresh frozen not you know etc the um shoot almost almost as dominant as thc as cannabidiol um look at some videos of uh hemp rosin pressing even the live stuff is nowhere near the color that we get out of our fresh frozen hash rosin with regular canvas so having said that i'm sure the fact that it's a high cbd strain had something to do with it and again um well not live is not live but that's five and a half grams of incredibly high cbd uh three to two so generally my hash rosin comes in between uh 75 and 85 percent cannabinoids let's say usually right around 80 to 85 percent cannabinoids so if we're three to two you know um five goes into eighty what so what are we like uh right around fifty percent thc thirty percent cbd that's gonna that'll smack and it's incredibly medicinal hope you guys enjoyed the video hope i didn't bore you try to keep this baby under 20 minutes and of course this is just a little personal press for me here on the lab and uh hoping to be um submitting for inspection very soon so that i can start to produce here okay guys", "EwOuDDdTq-4": "hey hey marissa from the east coast inside my very own massage studio in new jersey so yes i'm a licensed massage therapist as well as a personal trainer my desire and my true passion is to help others reach their desired fitness goals as well as helping them stay out of pain or get them out of pain and prevent pain from occurring so in new jersey we are transitioning with the warmer seasons with spring and summer and with warmer weather increases heat and humidity also increases inflammation unfortunately so as a massage therapist how do i treat inflammation and how do i help clients fight off inflammation i suggest massage ice and cbd pure cbd that is thoughtcloud.net has pure cbd i use cbd every single day it is part of my morning and nightly rituals however come the warmer seasons here in jersey i'll throw in a third dose with their warmer weather i'm getting very excited to take it outdoors much more running and exercising outside but i gotta be careful because in my past i've had surgery both on my lower legs so i have pretty intense battle wounds we'll call them so i have to fight off with my scar tissue that builds up with scar tissue i do self-massage i ice but i do rely on my cbd every single day cbd helps reduce inflammation and steers me away from chronic inflammation now we don't want to we don't want to fear inflammation overall inflammation is the natural way that the body responds so when i go on my longer run those those scars they get swole they get swelled up a little bit and it's painful unfortunately but i never go down the chronic inflammation because i'm doing things to prevent that now chronic inflammation you don't want to even get there because chronic inflammation building up in the body then can cause disease which we don't want so watch out with those warmer

really wanted to get more educated about CBD and I wanted to at least use it for six months before I came on camera I talked to you guys about it now I am no expert but in today's video I do want to clarify some very confusing things about CBD when you're first considering taking CBD it gets very overwhelming its CBD oil just hemp oil are there even any studies to prove the benefits of CBD how is it that CBD can be this wonderful thing that addresses so many different issues is it possible it helps with insomnia anxiety and inflammation and even cancer and all these things like is it possible for one little oil to do so much things so in this video we're gonna talk about it all so without further ado let's get started so the main reason that I was very intrigued about CBD oil is because CBD is a very interesting compound from a medical perspective the reason is because we have cannabinoid receptors all over our bodies so we have some in our brain in our heart in our digestive tract so if we have these receptors for CBD all over our body does that mean it really can help with so many things that social media and the internet says now I decided to try CBD for a couple of reasons number one I've heard awesome things about it being anti-inflammatory and the more I looked into it it is true it is packed with antioxidants so I personally dealt with inflammation in the way that I had skin issues so I might insert the picture if I can find it right now on the screen of patches I had on my arms that were so strange and I had no idea where they are coming from is why I decided to take CBD oil to help with patches I didn't use it on the actual rash but I ingested it and it did help these patches disappear so that is the one reason I started taking at first I was intrigued at the anti-inflammatory properties found in CBD the second reason I decided to take it is because I was dealing with a leaky gut that means I was dealing with a bunch of allergies in digestion stomach pains and so on and people have said that it really helped them with this issue so I also decided to take CBD oil for that and it helped the third reason I've decided to take CBD is to help my sleep and daily stress personally I tried to CBD products one was a CBD oil and another was a CBD faith pen what I noticed is that the CBD vape pen didn't help me with my sleep issues as much as the oil did now the oil had a small dose very small dose of THC not enough to get you high just FYI who can I get high with CBD oil unless you get one with extremely high THC but a ratio of anywhere above h to one CBD to THC will not get you high unless you're like very super sensitive I found that the CBD with a little bit of THC made me fall asleep much easier while the vape pen made me more awake that they pen was pure CBD that's how I think that is highly individual if you're dealing with sleeping problems you might have to try different types of CBD oils different concentrations and different amounts to see what it will help you with now in terms of stress the more research I did about CBD I noticed that it could help with the serotonin production and as you may know people deal with anxiety and depression have lower serotonin I noticed that it definitely does help me relax however I do not have severe anxiety or severe depression to see how it would help if I really had a pronounced problem with this it does help me with managing my daily stress although there aren't a lot of studies on CBD oil they're having animal studies on CBD oil and anxiety and it's showed to reduce the anxiety of the animal however there are no human studies I believe they started human studies in 2018 so hopefully we'll get some results soon but I want you guys to know that overall CBD is not that highly researched yes it is being us at matically however the research is really limited I don't find this at all and that doesn't discredit it from working because a lot of the supplements natural supplements don't do not have studies backing them up it is just difficult to get funding for something like this so after taking CBD for six months I can honestly say that it is going to stay in my health routine now I stopped taking it every day I wanted to take it every day to see the benefits but now I take it when I have problems with sleeping around my menstrual period when I'm dealing with in digestion or when I'm just really really stressed so that's when I take CBD oil now I want to talk a little bit about the type of CBD oil I use now this is where it gets very confusing is CBD oil hemp oil because if you go on Amazon you can find a bunch of hemp oil CBD oil but is that good quality oil so at first when I started my journey with CBD I started taking it via hemp oil and it did have high concentrations of CBD but I wasn't feeling much effects at all and I was almost going to throw in the towel however I started researching more and what I learned is that it doesn't matter where the CBD comes from whether it's hemp or the marijuana plant it is still CBD however the CBD coming from marijuana is more tightly regulated and less industrial than the CBD oil coming from the head of whatever brand you choose or whatever company you choose for CBD oil I would highly highly recommend that you ask if they do third-party testing you also want to check with the company or buying from if they check each individual bottle or actual CBD because if they say there's I don't know 400 milligrams of CBD in the bottle is there really 400 milligrams of CBD in there so in my opinion don't try to give the cheapest CBD oil really really make sure you know the company make sure they know where they source their CBD oil from and they're responsible for the entire process from the beginning till end now let me tell you what I use so the first thing I use is this Papa and Berkeley relief tincture so this one has 450 milligrams cannabinoids so CBD like those solvent that it's in is MCT oil and it does have a little bit of TC you guys CBD oil will not get you high even if it has a little bit of THC now if you're one of those people that when you smoke the weed you that completely paranoid that you're sitting in that corner your profile your life that's me and when I was going to dig CBD I was like mmm no because I had this fear of that little bit of THC in there but I can tell you honestly that this ratio one THC to thirty CBD will not get you high basically this is the one that I take when I am going to bed and I have a hard time sleeping it has the measurement so his point twenty five point fifty point 75 I would start with the lowest lowest dose and just see how it works for you and this one is from a dispensary that's what made me most comfortable buying it I think this was very pricey I believe it was like eighty dollars but it has lasted me for a very very very long time and the benefits are awesome and I am actually sure that I'm getting a great quality product now before this video I had this awesome fake fan of pure CBD but my dog literally bit through it and it doesn't work anymore but basically was just a little big pen I do think that the healthiest is this oil you can put it in smoothies and just lucky something might not be the most natural thing but sometimes I just enjoyed it because it was great flavor and this really is unappetizing but how I use this is I put it under my tongue I wait 60 seconds and then I swallow it so this is the tincture that I use that's all I have free today that is my experience with CBD oil thank you so much for watching and if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to subscribe on your way out and I'm very grateful for your support", "tEZ6k5phQhc": "what is going on everybody everyone's doing good bring out the tank top you know I like to primarily stay covered up but I'm like art it is just way too hot out here I need to yeah I'm dying so tank top but I'll be back full code when I hit the gym today but um let's get right to it what's going on with the CBD oil CBD muscle rubs you guys rocking rocking with it or whether I know for me I'm sure you guys have seen over the last like couple years it's just been like this whole influx of try and CBD and the benefits of things like that and I mean I knew about it early on like I knew about it years years ago you know CBD oils and they put it like a tea forms and things like that and I was a little skeptical at first because at the time there really at least least for me I wasn't able to really define a lot of like information on it as far as like okay show me some science like I hear you you know I know if we smoke or something like that smoke some weed or something yeah everybody will feel relaxed but on as far as like the CBD I didn't know I really didn't know about it but you know as years went by you know the signs started really come out and it was really saying like hey this can really help specifically for me I was like okay is there to help with like soreness inflammation just can it get me back in the gym sooner so I started to try it I got my hands on it it was just like some CBD oil where I was like putting it in water it's like alright I'm gonna give it a shot I'm gonna see what's going on and I'm kind of feeling little better I gave at the time I gave it like a month I'm like I'm gonna use it strictly for a month I forgot the dosages and how much I was taking all that it doesn't matter you know but I definitely was taking him and after me I was just like okay in comparison to when I was not using it I actually do feel a difference surprising you know I do feel different I mean I didn't continue to take it you know cuz whatever I had I just used it for until it basically ran out I just like a hurry to school you know wasn't something that was on my list to buy though it's like alright if I come across a pool I'll pick it up but if not I'm not gonna really worry about it so time went by blah blah blah but then I got my hands on some but anyway it's CBD muscle rub the showers it's like is it just gonna be like menthol and it's just gonna burn whatever spot I put it on so of course some would think it works cuz that's what I think about a lot of these muscle rubs I mean some do work I'm not gonna hate on all of them some definitely work and I know plenty you guys out there try them and some of you feel some of you don't listen at this point I've tried so many different the tiger balm bio freeze everything under the Sun because got a couple of injuries throughout the years and I'm just waking up sore a lot of days I'm not recovering so I'm like all right you know muscle rub pretty much every day I'm putting something on I'm smelling like bengay out here but I got my hands on the CBD muscle rope and even though I used CBD I still was very skeptical with the muscle work I was like this this isn't gonna this isn't it now we're just trying to make money now we're just trying to capitalize on the whole craze this is Fugazi whatever but I'll give it a shot I'll give it a shot and that's nothing with CBD oils right so I definitely believe it works CBD definitely works but it all depends a great getting fit because as with anything if it's a phrase people are gonna try to make money off of it so it's gonna be a ton of other companies just coming out that they're not releasing the product and they're just trying to slap it on the label you know put yeah you could put CBD on the label and put a little bit of CBD in it but that doesn't mean it's gonna work just like when you go to the store and you want to buy something organic it's not really the whole thing isn't organic it just has to be a above certain percentage be able to put the label to put it on the label that it is organic right same thing with CBD it just has to be above a certain percentage of CBD natural product for it to be considered a CBD relief or CBD you know joint soup or whatever the case may be so that's a little thing that's hot that's how do you like to get us you know that's why you know unfortunately now it's a different ballgame right like you can if you want you can eat healthy on a budget when they try to you order like your supermarket and it puts OH all organic and they're trying to hustle us you got to go to your Whole Foods Market you know or get a locally sourced that is the the the upside about me living out here in the south is where I can get a lot of things locally sourced I can straight up like I know where it's actually you know grown from you know I know where it's coming from I get damn there drive there if I wanted to you know and that's that's what we really gain fresh stuff if you can you know listen I get it I mean things is costly you don't have access to it but just try to do the best that we can could we know at the end of the day we can train as much as we want it's almost that's not what this video is about that's so I got the CBD muscle robe I was like all right love two weeks I'll give it two weeks and I'll see what happens I guess that was skeptical I was a shy and just be alone like I'll just give it an honest opinion so I use it on my lower back like on my elbow but particularly on my lower back I haven't used any other big muscle rubs or anything like that in a while so all right let's give it a shot give it to me cuz you balance to admit I don't know I do feel the difference and what was different about this one which really kind of sold me was like when you put other one muscle rubs on it just starts to burn and essentially because it's like so hot you forget that that area is really hurting you're just morning thinking about that is just burning there wasn't a burn to it that was the interesting part about it there was not any burning feeling like you felt I mean a small tingle but like not nothing like when you put on like tiger balm on for example and it's like okay my back's on fire right depend on how much you put on I didn't fit and I put a good amount of like I really like layered on this cream or this South what everyone would call it and there wasn't a burning sensation and I was just like and when I didn't feel the burn I was like oh this is just trash there right but thirty minutes you know into it it feels warm but it's not to the point where I'm like it was just a warm sensation like almost like I had it really felt like I had a heat paddle and that was just comfortable okay okay cool and like I said once the first week went by you know when I would wake up and just expect to feel a certain you know feeling you know cuz I was putting it on before training and I was putting on at night that's usually my little regimen and I'm kind of good right now and then over time I was it's like I'm feeling really good and honestly I don't feel any pain I gotta admit like I feel good you know so I'm gonna keep rocking with it for the you know another two weeks well base until this whole thing whatever yeah you guys just take my word for it let me see if I can ease these openings you can see the color of it but um I'm gonna keep rocking with it see so it's like [Music] so I'm gonna keep rocking with you guys like this was kind of crazy to me I'm gonna keep it up I'm gonna see what happens yeah a believer you believe her now and I mean look they're not sponsoring me so I'm not gonna drop one company and this and that and just figure it out just fine just find it there's some barbers ones out there but there are definitely some good ones out there so I'm a believer I'm gonna keep it up we're gonna see what happened they said it went from okay so we're back it's you know massage isn't working none of that I've been using this and yes I'm doing the trick so now I'm curious to see like okay if I do let's say a muscle rub in conjunction with ingesting it how would that you know play out so I'm I'm on it I'm on it guys like I have to admit I'm really a firm believer in the CBD movement and I think there's just more science resistance it's going to start coming out and more products are gonna come out and it's just gonna get better and better so you know this is someone from this is coming from someone who was 100% skeptical hippo eyes like I did not believe it but I'm a fan this stuff works well let me just correct myself I believed ingesting it works worked and I'm a firm believer like when I was ingesting it I definitely agree okay this stuff works but the topical stuff I did not believe it and now using it forever for two weeks and gonna continue to use it I'm curious to see what are like how much more of a benefit I can get from it because yeah so I believe believer so I want to just talk to you guys about that share that with you and I said I'm out of here guys I'll see you in a bit more videos on the way", "61Mll-fnSyk": "hi if you're serious about cbd we have the

joints bruises sore\nmuscles anti-inflammatory cramps and more I like to use cutting boards as flat surfaces I am always working on the stove I have the\nindividual I'm container that the salve is going into I have some olive\noil I like to use coconut oil as well but I\njust didn't have any on hand And this is Saint John's Wort infused oil. Than we have ginger root essential oil clove bud oil essential oil sorry and some golden jojoba oil and then I also have beeswax that I buy this online off Ebay from a bee farm and then I have  my sauce pan now I because we have hard water in Arizona when I do this it kind of messes up the pan and as you can see so\nthis is become My, umm, double boiler pan that's all I use it for so I this is how I makeshift a double boiler see just\nput the water in here turn on the stove and then you can heat up the oils in the measuring cup and it won't burn them. What I have already done is I've put water in the sauce pan I am just warming that up and I'm gonna let it get warmer than I'm gonna use it so I'm\ngonna put it on high for now and I'm going to come back when it boiling and turn down the heat to medium and then I'm gonna start warming up my\noils and melting my beeswax. As you can see the water boiling I'm going to go ahead and turn that down Now while that's cooling-off gonna go ahead and take my infused oil. Shake it up real good because it had some plant  particles down here and I'm going to go ahead and use all of this.   I pour in my St John's Wort infused oil   and now I don't put the essential oils in until after after the beeswax is melted because I don't want to evaporate the any of the essential oils I don't think I need and olive oil but if you needed extra oil you can go ahead and add that and I like to cut up the beeswax so that it melts quicker and I don't\nhave to use as much I don't have to keep it on the heat as long   I have my beeswax. I'm going to go over to my water that is calm down in such a wild boil And now,  I prefer using wooden\nchopsticks to do this and we're just gonna go ahead\nand warm this up and then again this is on medium heat you do not want to have it on a high heat you don't want to be impatient  and use high heat because you'll cook out all the herbs and then all you have left is\nnothing but a cooked oil and wax   Just let that go for a while you are going to have to do this until the beeswax is fully melted my beeswax is getting melted and mixed up in there. It's about half way done. half way melted Ok, the beeswax is almost completely melted. I've got a few pieces still in here. okay now I know that I'm completely melted but I also know that they are small enough pieces that they just gonna\ngo ahead and melt before I get these in 'cause I still have a few things to do. I need to add jojoba oil you don't need much I like to add it 'cause it's really good for\nthe skin so any salves, I just add that to it now I need to add my clove essential oil Lastly you need ginger root essential oil now I have perfected this recipe down to\nthese three main herbs that you have to have you cannot make this without all three Ginger is what helps the salve penetrate through the skin and\ndown deep into the muscles and joints. The clove helps numb any pain and the Saint John's wort oil also helps with relieving pain and just soothes muscles and joints. Alright! and the bees wax is completely melted in there Now these are 4 containers I got this I got all these in a pack of I believe 10 for a dollar at the Dollar Tree they are wonderful containers for\nsalves. They also come in rectangle shape Now you want to pour it in   Now I'm going to go ahead and put this immediately in the sink with running hot water That helps it I to easily clean out measuring cup. Another good thing is to take the boiling water and put it in there;  pour it in there . Now that we have the salves in the containers We're gonna go ahead and put them in  the refrigerator. Now this is why I have the cutting board because it's a lot easier to transport\nthem especially when they're in their liquid state to the refrigerator you can just leave them out but I prefer to do them in the refrigerator and cool them off quicker and get them sealed up and ready to go. And we'll be back when they are cooled off! I just brought them out of the fridge they are done and ready to go put a lid on and put a label on for each joints bruises sore muscles anti-inflammatory cramps and more", "pRQQqKUyIro": "[Music] hello my name is Jennifer Dixon with the green valley nation and today I want to give you a really quick review on the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD this is a highly concentrated product that claims to be great for sports recovery folks suffering from anxiety issues and insomnia and sleep related issues Charlotte's Web grows and processes all of their hemp in Colorado they use organic non-gmo and vegan friendly products to make a full spectrum CBD using co2 extraction methods the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD comes in chocolate mint flavor it has 60 milligrams of CBD per each suggested serving size of one milliliter there are two current sizes which are 30 milliliter and 100 milliliter which gives you at least in this bottle eighteen hundred milligrams and then in the 100 milliliter bottle it gives you 6,000 milligrams of CBD because this is a full-spectrum product there is a little bit of THC in it but it's less than 0.3 percent and so it won't get you high let's talk about the packaging on the outside of both the box and the bottle is a picture of the Rocky Mountains a kind of tribute to where they are located and on the outside of the box is a QR code it's on the bottom right hand side that you can scan and get the analysis and the information about the particular product you'll find that each bottle inside of the box is individually wrapped with cellophane so that you know that it's new and that it has the ingredients and it has the suggested serving size of one milliliter because this is a full spectrum oil you'll notice that it is a little bit darker and greener in color than an ISIL it might be that also means that the flavor is going to be a little stronger now Charlotte's Web does use a chocolate mint flavor in this product but that doesn't necessarily mean it covers up all of the flavors let's try it you're gonna put it underneath your tongue and you want to hold it for at least 30 to 60 seconds the first thing that you're gonna notice after taking this product is that even though it is supposed to be chocolate mint flavored it doesn't taste super chocolaty just a little bit minty you're gonna still taste the plant it's a it's a full spectrum product so it definitely has that plant flavor to it however within 15 minutes you're gonna notice that you're calmer that you can focus a little better and that if you have any residual pain because it's so concentrated this stuff knocks it out pretty well now for me I'm very sensitive and I react very very quickly and strongly to CBD so I don't need very much I use like a few drops maybe a quarter of a dropper full and that will last me all day for you if you are a little less sensitive to it or you are dealing with a higher amount of anxiety or pain you might have to use the full suggested serving size of one milliliter and it may not last you all day you might have to take this every four to six hours it really just depends on how your body reacts and responds to it and then how quickly it metabolizes the CBD you can also find that when you take this before bed it'll help you to relax and go to sleep I find that when I take it before sleeping it puts me to bed like that and then I can sleep the whole night which is glorious let's talk value here this is considered a premium product so it is definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum if this is not something that you're generally as concerned about then it's a perfect product for you however if you live on a pretty tight budget this could be a difficult addition to your daily routine if flavor is also a big thing for you this might not be the best option because it definitely does still have a strong earthy plant flavor there is a hint of but if you're very sensitive to taste in flavors then I would definitely not recommend this product for you overall I really do like the the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD oil it does what it says it's supposed to do help you to relax it definitely helps me to sleep and it definitely does help to manage my aches and pains I can't recommend it if you are looking for something that is on a budget because this is a little bit more on the higher end of the spectrum but it is a great product high quality every single time I take it it's the exact same and if you're not as sensitive to flavors it's going to get the job done pretty quickly because it's so concentrated so you might not need as much thank you so much for taking the time to watch this review once again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and if you

to you about how to start using CBD and CBD oil CBD is a hot topic of conversation today the problem is a lot of people don't know what type to buy how to use it in the dosage I'm going to be answering all of those questions in today's video the first thing you need to know about CBD is that it really supports the balance of what's called your parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system a lot of us live in this fight-or-flight stay of constant stress which can affect our hormones our sleep our gut health what CBD does is allows us to get more in a parasympathetic State and so when you're buying CBD the things you want to look for is you want to buy CBD number one that is certified organic now I can't stress that enough when you're buying CBD look for the USDA certified organic seal on it if it's not on there if it doesn't say organic you don't want to buy it just like you want to buy coffee organic just like you want to buy your kale Organic you also want to make sure that CBD is organic or else the most the time it's been sprayed with chemicals herbicides and pesticides so make sure it's organic number two make sure your CBD or CBD oil is full-spectrum now full-spectrum means it's gonna have all of the other nutrients that CBD needs to work most effectively in the body let me give you an example of this did you know that if you consume calcium by itself it does little for your bone health your bones need more than calcium your bones need calcium vitamin D magnesium boron phosphorus your collagen your bones need all of these different things what a lot of people today especially companies that are more synthetic based and what they create they're creating these isolated synthetic forms of CBD which don't really work with your body similar thing tumeric is great because it contains curcuma noise and tumor owns and all these different types of nutrients when you're buying CBD make sure it always is a full spectrum which means it's going to have CBD but it's also going to have a very small amount of things like THC CBC CBG and terpenes which are what are found essential oils now in terms of dosage I tend to do between 20 and 50 milligrams a day and that's really what I what I notice I'll do maybe 20 milligrams twice a day or 30 to 40 milligrams in the evening that's how much I personally take if you're new to it though and just getting started sometimes you might want to just start with about five milligrams maybe just a half a dropper of a 10 milligram dose and see how your body feels with that and then you can move up over time and you can take it in many different forms everything from the oil form CBD capsules or tablets and also a seaweedy powder all of those are great forms of CBD and I think by using CBD you're going to know some great benefits in your health", "2MkPByzFKpM": "Hemp Genix CBD Oil and CBD Skin Care Products https://hempgenix.com", "fXqFWTGU-_s": "This video is all about full spectrum CBD oil benefits What is full spectrum CBD oil and why is it better than regular CBD oil? Check it out. Hey guys My name is Johnny Ross. I am a student at the University of Kentucky right now And I just did some research on CBD so that you don't have to if anything in this video is helpful for you I would really appreciate it if you would stop by my subscription button over to onder and Smack it maybe leave a comment leave a like if you don't like it. Let me know why share the video Don't forget to stay to the end because there is CBD there so full spectrum CBD oil is a type of CBD oil So if you're not really sure what CBD oil is in general, you can check out the video in the card above Basically CBD is one of 104 cannabinoids which are chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant These cannabinoids are particularly Medicinally useful for things like pain recovery mental clarity Inflammatory relief depression and anxiety relief and a ton of other cool stuff CBD is really helpful for humans full-spectrum CBD oil is CBD oil that has been extracted from the cannabis plant which includes all of the chemical compounds that the plant produces this includes terpenes flavonoids cannabinoids fatty acids and even THC when you extract all of the compounds from cannabis in Context of each other. They're more beneficial for you therapeutically Did you say that was th seed that now I did say there's THC in there Some people want THC free oils and that's totally understandable but a lot of times the THC content in a Seabee full-spectrum CBD oil is actually Point 3 percent or less so it's a trace amount of THC at best and it's not going to get you high You're not gonna feel any of the effects of that but it is going to help with the context of all the medicinal benefits that all the cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids have for within that CBD or full-spectrum CBD oil is different from broad-spectrum CBD oil and CBG isolate exactly as it sounds is 99.9% CDD it usually comes in a powder looks a little bit like cocaine, but it's not cocaine It's CBD. It has wonderful healing effects for you but you do put it on your gums or under your tongue broad spectrum CBD oil is a CBD oil that has been doctored to contain many of the cannabinoids terpenes or flavonoids But they are usually select by whoever's mixing them or producing them and very generally speaking Broad-spectrum CBD oils and never have THC not even a little bit So you might ask why should I care? because full-spectrum CBD oil is actually clinically proven to be more beneficial for you than CBD isolate or even broad-spectrum a study that I'm going to put in the link in the description compared CBD isolate effectiveness to Full-spectrum effectiveness, they found that CBD was producing anti-inflammatory and anti What when they increase the dose there was a drop-off in the effectiveness they then remedied this by adding CBD to a full plant extract full-spectrum CBD and the dosage and effectiveness both rised together so like I was saying CBD in the context of all of the chemicals that the plant cannabis Produces is more effective than CBD itself, and I just wanted to show you guys this it's not Super relevant, but it is relevant. There's a website that has a terpene slider so you can go see what effects you want And then it will tell you what terpenes and flavonoids that you should get in your oils That's pretty freakin. Cool cannabis has over 400 known chemical compounds that it produces the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabidiol and THC terpenes and flavonoids also have medicinal benefits, but they're not unique to cannabis A lot of essential oils are actually made from terpenes and flavonoids These chemical compounds are generally responsible for the way that a plant or oil smells or tastes Flavonoids are more responsible for the things but pigmentation as well So what colors are in your plant because full-spectrum CBD oil comes from a certain plant. It is actually very important to know what strain your CBD oil is coming from so You know what specific medicinal or therapeutic properties that you're getting in that oil because it's relevant to the genetics of the strain of cannabis That it came from that's what I got for you guys today except for one more thing Which is a link in the description to get some broad-spectrum CBD oil from a veteran-owned American company that sells CBD called pure American hemp oil Try them out first link in the description below and generally thank you guys so much for listening once again I appreciate your time.

CBD oil would be better for you I've tried maybe six different brands other than hemp bombs and I gotta say hemp bombs is definitely the best or you know maybe tied with one other you know really good brand up tribe but I'm not gonna get no other brands I just want to talk about that have bombs and specifically I want to talk about these two oils the $2,000 gram and the 4000 milligram now they're both really expensive you know the four thousand milligrams I'm not sure the retail I got a discount on it it's probably about $220 per 1 ounce and the two thousand is probably 120 hundred forty an ounce I got him discounted at a gas station cuz the guy just gave up on trying to get rid of him because nobody wanted to buy them they were there for months so I bought both of them and I bought others to about 600 milligrams thousand milligram 2000 milligram 4000 milligram now I tried the 600 first then I tried the thousand then I tried the 4000 then I tried the 2000 so the only way I can describe it the feeling is you know when I pinch it I shoot it through the back of my throat to run down my esophagus I feel a greater effect when I do that rather than put it under my tongue so when I do that immediately I'll feel a nomina fact on especially a stronger effect with the 4000 milligram I've only seen people do reviews on the thousand and you know this is 2,000 I've tried the thousand and it really didn't do much for me but I got to say that the 4000 really helps me with my pain my pain specifically being my right shoulder shoulder blade my ribs under here they get swollen you know I'll get um stressed out about things anxiety it'll take away a headache you know stomachache it does a lot it really does but for me it mainly takes away likes or tight muscles arthritis pain in my chest that I feel sometimes on my right shoulder just from past things that have happened but it takes about ten minutes for me to really feel the effect whether it was the 2000 / the 4000 and even the thousand I felt it a little bit I'll admit it but just not that much especially compared to the two and the four and comparing the two to the 4000 I didn't feel that significant of a difference but I did feel a difference nonetheless the 4000 was more numbing effect on the back of my throat when when I shot it in the back of my throat and the 2,000 does similar but not quite the strength so you know just from the experience of it I could tell the 4000 was stronger you know like it claims to be you can feel that it is and it definitely has a slight stronger effect on pain you know once it cycles through your blood for a few minutes so I would definitely recommend this stuff to anybody that's in severe pain the 4000 it's worth it it's you know you're not gonna you know not feel anything when you take this you're gonna feel some relief no matter what's wrong with you I believe and it helps with many you know mental weaknesses like a DVD HD anxiety all that I'm sure you guys know about it but you really feel the effects when you take the 4000 especially if you take it on an empty stomach and really feel it you don't feel it as much if you eat something really unhealthy you know fill your stomach up gorge yourself and then you know take a shot of this because you have swelling in your body from you the lack of nutrition and unhealthy food you just said which I'm guilty of that too I've done this Rob eating unhealthy and then try to make myself feel better take some of this and yeah it does work but not like if you take it on an empty stomach I gotta say like if you have pain on a full moon they're just weird seasons if you have metal rods in your body um this stuff is excellent if you have the money grab it uh it is really good stuff this 4,000 milligram and the mm is really good too I'd recommend that to anybody as well even if you have extreme pain you don't have as much money to get this mm but as far as people with extreme pain I wouldn't recommend anything below the mm for sure the thousand just it didn't do much for me and I'm not an extreme pain I'm just in moderate pain sometimes the people in extreme pain definitely need you know the 4000 and I haven't seen any reviews on the two or the four so I just want to let you guys know that it's both good if you decide to buy these um you don't have to question it so thank you for watching I hope this helps you guys bye", "ZL_j5dyk1Q8": "and to share with you the value of incorporating topicals into your medicine cabinet we feel that cannabis topicals and saves are generally underutilized they can be really effective for pain inflammation and skin conditions and the great thing is they're not psychoactive now personally I've used topicals a lot for sunspots and small skin cancers and I've had excellent outcomes there is plenty of documentation of people who've used them effectively for arthritis for joint pain and others use them for skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis sometimes you're going to find that topicals are blended with other herbs oils or products that can really help amplify their effect for a specific purpose here are some things to know about topical use a game psychoactivity is not an issue as the cannabinoids don't enter the bloodstream now they're not magical creams that aren't always work wonders upon initial use consistency is the key so I recommend using them multiple times a day and see if they work for you now it's also best to apply topicals at times of the day when you're not moving around a lot or sweating before bed is a great time and throughout the day when perhaps you're at your desk or just not running around let's look at a few simple topical products now there's really no surprises here what you would expect from any cream or therapeutic topical it's really not a huge difference with cannabis okay now with topicals it's hard to tell exactly how much of specific ingredient is in the topical itself obviously a cannabis topical will contain some cannabis or a lot of cannabis the labels should tell you if there's any other herbs or additives within the topical itself a lot of the time they'll use an oil as a base obviously some producers do choose to combine cannabis with other herbs or plants within a topical er south now we know that a lot of plants are good for medical use and depending on the specific intent of a product they could choose to combine it with an array of different plants whether it's for nerve pain inflammation or an array of other specific uses so just pay attention to the labels and start to educate yourself about both what cannabis is good for for you as well as potentially other herbs is also now let's get acquainted with this topical here notice first of all that they put it in a dark container this helps protect it from the Sun and one thing that I like to do it being acquainted with any product really but especially a Savoie topical is to first just simply smell it our smell is a really powerful sense that we have and it can help inform us about what our body likes about what it about what it doesn't like for example and cannabis actually I can smell it it has a distinct smell okay so you can sometimes even tell how concentrated this topical is with cannabis or smell other products within it now when applying can start liberally but the great thing about topicals is that really there's no psychoactivity you can't overdose you can't really overdo it but I like to start still with topicals start low and kind of go slow up in terms of the application just to gauge how effective they are so I have a chronic injury in my wrist from some impact from a martial art so I'm just gonna rub it on I like to rub it on my joints particularly but you can use it for any array of uses sometimes it can be very effective verts in conditions like psoriasis and eczema and dry skin that's really great inflammation like in my case or pain pain in joints or other areas some people use it like my colleague Chris for cancer for skin cancer and it can actually help with that topical application as well so I'm just rubbing it in smoothly if it's really thick you can combine it with another oil that's fine as well any other lipid-based product you can just combine it with whether you like the smell of it or anything so feel free to experiment and combine it with some other products you may use therapeutically and topically okay do as much research as you can we recommend this with any product that you take but it's really harder to go wrong with topicals and they are very safe so enjoy it enjoy your senses and just see how it affective is for your symptoms and condition", "J2ZjWo1hnXs": "CBD for dogs before and after CBD short for cannabidiol is extremely popular right now because of its benefits for human health but can it also work for dogs let's take a look at the surprising science behind CBD for dogs first let's look at

[Music]", "423fJzDs7co": "hi there welcome to my recovery journal my name is Mark and today I want to talk about a product that I've used the last eight months that has had a significant impact on my health so real quick to talk about my health I have been dealing with pretty bad chronic illness since the age of 18 I'm now 27 the last third of my life has been heavily affected by my health I'm not able to be fully independent I'm not able to hold down a job right now and haven't been for years but I am working to get back to that point and this product has been a part of my regimen that is getting me closer and closer hopefully so the product that I'm talking about today is Charlotte's Web full extract hemp oil now this product that I use in particular is pretty strong it is their original formula it is 50 milligrams of CBD which is cannabidiol per milliliter I take it as two different servings I take it in the morning half a milliliter and I take it before bed half a milliliter so overall I'm getting 50 milligrams around the per day of CBD I'm also getting a total of I believe 86 that's it yes 86 milligrams of extract in total so 50 milligrams of that 86 is CBD the other milligrams are other cannabinoids that are extracted in the extraction process hence why it is called a full extract because it includes the other cannabinoids that are naturally present in the plant so CW hemp which is the company that produces this oil has a really great backstory and I highly highly recommend to anyone who's interested to check out their website and read about the history of their company it's a part of the reason why love this product not only does it help me it helps a lot of other people and it's a story of its creation is pretty awesome story in my opinion so I will include a link to their website in the description you can check it out if you want to so I want to talk a bit about the medical benefits some of these benefits have been studied extensively most of them are preliminary studies because of the cannabis laws in America there's not able to do it they're not able to do a lot of research and studies into the health benefits and full effects of these different cannabinoids but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence as well as preliminary studies like I said on mice and other types of studies so we have some information about CVS benefits so the first main benefit is it has a great anti-inflammatory effect there have been studies that have shown to reduce inflammation throughout the body depending on dosages obviously all of these all of these supposed treatments or uses for treatment are dependent on dosage and so it all berries so on top of inflammation you have its ability to relax the body and to reduce insomnia and people CBD has been found to be a strong anti-anxiety meaning it is very helpful in reducing anxiety and depression it also is excellent for pain relief all different forms of pain whether it be muscle pains neuropathic pains or joint pains CBD is found to help reduce pain and that may be related to its anti-inflammatory effects obviously again there needs to be more studies done to really fully understand how CBD works but well it's a good start and the final and probably most important is its anti-seizure effects this is go to the backstory of the product it was produced for a young girl who had dravet syndrome and I don't want to over ask me but I believe it was tens maybe hundreds of seizures every day and so her family worked with the founders of this company of CW hemp to develop a tincture that she could take hopefully to reduce her seizures and my understanding is that the Charlotte's Web oil not only reduced but eliminated her seizures so that's pretty incredible in my opinion secondly I would say is that it really helped alleviate my gut discomfort I had a lot of bloating and general pain I had a lot of difficulty eating normal quantities of food I was definitely not getting enough calories per day and again while this didn't completely eliminate the problem it got me so much closer to being able to stomach three meals a day and being able to handle a day without having severe intestinal pains there are other products and other forms of treatment that I've done other supplements other regimens that have really really diminished my gut issues but this is definitely a big piece the third main thing that this oil magically helped with was my pain I had all types of pain in every part of my body pretty constantly this oil along with cannabis using cannabis has had a serious impact on pain reduction I have taken many different forms of painkillers in the past and no no if them were worth the risks because they weren't effective enough to take on the risks but this stuff has been unbelievable at pain reduction and a part of that is because of its anti-inflammatory effects I have an auto inflammatory disease and so inflammation my body is very prone to becoming highly inflamed and so having this bottle here really helps in emergency situations when I feel like I'm having an inflammatory attack I can increase this dose at my dosages of this oil and it really helps reduce the attacks pain wise and duration wise and forth and probably most important in my opinion for me is what it did for my mental health I've had anxiety for pretty much my entire life my earliest memories with anxiety go back to probably first grade so it's probably 6 or 7 years old and as I got older it came in went in waves this severity and my anxiety caused me to have to provide depression and it was really terrible and when I got sick at 18 years old my mental health spiraled out of control I was having regular panic attacks and anxiety attacks I was having constant constant bombardment of terrible thoughts and its worst I was having suicidal ideations I was having constant anxious thoughts 24 hours a day and it was mental torture I felt trapped in my head I felt like I couldn't control what was happening and it felt like misery really genuinely and within a couple weeks of taking this product there was a significant reduction in my what I would consider uncontrollable anxiety so the anxiety that was just my mind going in it I couldn't control it and the calming sensation that I got from taking this product from taking Charlotte's Web was was I don't know how to compare it because I've never luckily my parents never put me on drugs pharmaceuticals to handle a problem but this has been a game changer for my mental well-being since starting this product I have been in a clearer stronger and more confident headspace then I've been probably my entire life and that's while dealing with my health so it's it's I just love this product for my anxiety most of all so if you're interested in checking out the company CW hemp like I said the link will be in the description below if you are at all interested in checking out the products they have maybe trying them out on top of the oils they have CBD gummies they have topicals they have capsules they also now sell dog treats or dogs if you're interested so that's something you might be interested in checking out I'm also going to have a referral link in the description along with the website to the company so yeah so thank you for checking out this video I hope it was informative and helpful for you and I hope you have a great day thanks for watching", "T0dObVCg0wQ": "trying to figure out how much CBD oil to take can be frustrating most resources tell you to start out low and gradually work up but if you're not noticing any results it can be tempting to double or even triple a dose in a single day doing this can be counterproductive so make sure you establish a clear dosage plan if you anticipate taking CBD over the long-term it's important to remember that CBD is not a miracle cure don't expect to take a few drops of tincture and voila all your symptoms are gone the effects of CBD oil are not instant and many people make the mistake of using CBD once or twice and then writing it off completely if it doesn't work in terms of where to start with dosing we recommend just starting out with a low potency oil a dose or single serving is pretty universal at one milliliter of oil which is exactly 20 drops so rather than trying a single drop or two of a high potency formula start out with a low potency 200 to 300 milligram bottle take a single one milliliter serving and see how you feel in order to know exactly how many milligrams of CBD you're taking you need to know two things the total CBD content of the bottle and the size of the bottle in milligrams for example let's use a standard 30 milliliter bottle that contains 300 milligrams of CBD total if you take a 1 milliliter dose this would equate to 10 milligrams of CBD the key in deciphering dosage is to stick with how much you're taking for at least a week in other words don't immediately up your dosage if you don't notice any effects at first and give the CBD time to work with the receptors in your body if you still don't notice any effects after about a week then you can start upping the dose however be mindful of the fact that your CBD oils ineffectiveness could just be that you're using a low quality product the manufacturing of CBD oil is still largely unregulated so the amount listed on your bottles labeled could in fact be far from the amount that's actually contained inside also when administering servings remember to put the drops under your tongue and hold for at least 30 seconds before swallowing this will give the CBD ample time to be absorbed into the bloodstream before entering the digestive tract and lastly increased dosages gradually and be patient it could take time for your body to respond to the act of CBD compound so don't get frustrated if a week 2 weeks or even more goes by without noticing much effect also if you have access to a doctor or healthcare professional who's willing to talk to you about CBD be sure to speak with them do you have any input or first-hand experience dosing CBD be sure to share your thoughts with the community by

vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's

find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right

distance is what they're aimed to do right so now the him oil basically is aimed for nutritional values right so with that said it helped boots for instance um the circulation in our immune system right it also has g la gamma linolenic acid so what gla does guys is part of the omega-6 family that plays a part a very part the growth of our hair our nails giving us healthy skin right so that's what that do now it also have omega-9 which helps balance our cholesterol and you know what high cholesterol does right okay so now even more so the hemp oil also is one of the carriers that helps the absorption of the cbd oil in our digestive system in a past video i spoke how hemp oil olive oil and coconut oil are one of the main carriers that help with the exhaustion of the cbdr in our digestive system which makes it easier and you know it works all right so now both hemp oil and cbd oil is legal but now however cbd oil podesta's properties that's aiming and assisting say with treatments for ailments say um depression anxiety chronic disease uh mental disorders for those that have cancer that help them um with the appetite the nausea now the cbdl have receptors right cb1 receptors cv2 receptor and their role as little soldiers right they stay they they around you guys they they're in the brain because we have the endocannabinoid system in our bodies anyway right so these receptors they working and they're targeting they're targeting like liquid soldiers you get you get the grip so that is what they're aim to do and also it has promising in helping people um that want to kick substance um use disorder want to stop smoking um they're saying it's becoming promising with parkinson's disease tourette's system cbd oil even though it's in his early stages in the baby stages but there's constant constant research by scientists and saying listen this is what we're finding although we're experimenting in rats and not enough with humans but this is our discovery so basically this is the difference between cbd oil and the hemp now let's be clear there's no such thing as pearl cbd oil so if you happen to come across a bottle and it says pure cbd oil nine out of ten guys it have him oil or just snake oil it's just leave it on his shelf leave it on his shelf but going back if the bottle says pure cbd oil you better believe 9 out of 10 it has thc in it now zero point zero three percent so you save a three tenth is legal by law which means you're not going to get high like the marijuana right marijuana has cbd too but it has more thc which gets you that high feeling and a lot of us we don't we don't want that hype feeling at all so now there's three different um type of brands i'm not gonna say brands but three different type of variety of cbd you have isolate you have broad spectrum and you have you also have full spectrum so know that so there's there is a difference there now with the isolate usually it only contains the cbd um and no other cannabinoid but it doesn't mean it doesn't have any thc it might have very very very little thc or no tac okay so now you have the full spectrum the four spectrum does have um thc and the cannabinoid right but it has more cbd in it and very very very very little thc the broad spectrum guys well i'm gonna tell you um the response spectrum allegedly does not have thc but like i said you have to do your research um you have to make sure that you're able to get um the disclosure on line of what it what it actually contains and you should be able to get that online a lot of times it's on the back of the bottle and you can't read it right so you have to be careful so basically that is the the difference between him oil and cbd oil and i can't stress enough stay away from buying um dcbdr from these side stores gas stations even if you buy um from um drug stores or any reputable companies i'm seeing all over the place i don't want to say any names um do your research and make sure at least you can get anywhere from 30 to 60 day your money back guarantee if it's not working for you and the reason why is 30 to 60 day because everybody system is different and everybody pain is different so it might take 30 days for it to get in your system and you feel some type of relief or it might take 60 you know and also depends on the strength i can't stress that enough either i'm i'm seeing 3 000 milligrams 2500 uh milligrams guys and even though they're saying that it may be safe to take it um you can't od on these milligrams but on my last video um when i spoke with um some organic suppliers they're saying that a lot of times it's not safe so anywhere from 300 to 1500 they saying is basically safe anything over guys they really don't wreck a uh record minute it might cause you dizziness um diarrhea um mood swings stomach aids so people of different companies i'm sorry different um brand name companies they produce all this so you can buy okay you can buy and that's not good so with that said guys don't forget to subscribe click that button leave me a comment i want to know what you're thinking what you're saying if you have any questions i would definitely get back to you and

I'm going to show you how to make one of our most popular recipes for pain relief and it's pretty simple it's a little bit more labor-intensive than some of the other recipes so I'm going to be doing a couple of different takes so that you guys don't have to wait on things to cool and thanks to melt and things like that so first you want to start with your butters so have shea butter already measured in my bowl one cup of shea butter and shea butter has a thick consistency but it's not completely hard so it's sort of an in between between coconut oil which we will use and cocoa butter so I have one cup of cocoa butter and I've actually doubled this recipe you can do the original recipe was a half a cup of everything so I'm doing one whole cup on this recipe because I'm actually making this for some people so I wanted to get more bang for my buck and bang for my time so one cup of coconut butter and see it's really hard so you'll pour it together oops it's stuck on that shade that was a good cup and then you want to do one cup of coconut oil and again you can have this and just do half a cup coconut oil you can get organic I do not have organic here but you can use organic also Shea and cocoa butter you can get it free font refund or unrefined I use refined because it has less of a smell and I want the essential oils to smell I want to smell that more than they cook than the butters so I do I do use the refund but of course you can use whichever you prefer so I've got a cup of each and then I'm going to take a cup of sweet almond oil it's really really nice I love this oil and I've got more in the cabinet if this will not do me let's see how much this is about a third of a cup so I'll have to get a little bit more out of the cabinet and add it to this and so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to put this in the microwave and heat it liquefies and hopefully you can see it's just running off the spoon it is definitely all liquid it's extremely hot that's why I have pot holders down here going to give you a little tip you can add some vitamin E to the mixture and it acts as a preservative so that's a great little idea and you can get bottom an e in capsules and I'm just punching a hole in them and then squirting the vitamin e in it's also really great for your skin so of course it would be beneficial in this lotion you can also get vitamin E that is you can drop it in with a dropper which would be a lot easier so then just stir that up and now what I'm going to do with this mixture is I will put it in the refrigerator and let it harden and cool not too hard it doesn't need to be too hard so that it will not blend and whip with a mixer so when I come back I will show you how so I've already started the whipping and the blending and it makes it into a really nice smooth lotion which is really fabulous so I want to make sure you put your apron on this we get SuperDuper messy and make sure that you're not using a blender that is special to you because it could very well blow up the blender especially if you've let it harden too long so it's gonna blend it going every later could be all over my carpet and again this is one of the most time-consuming recipes that I do wish this motion is so effective at pain relief and my cope want some it's not hot food buddy now what's up almost like whipped cream it looks good enough to eat but definitely I would not eat it up everything's falling off my take off just such a great little lotion and really you can use this base for anything if you just wanted to use it as like a moisturizer not so much the the oils in it for the pain but oils that are good for your skin frankincense is actually good for your skin lang Lang is good for your skin patchouli is really great for your skin moisturize your body with it the OL song okay so now that you're a greasy mess and we're going to add the essential oils and I'm gonna do about 30 drops of each because I have four cups of solid so I want to do 30 drops of lemon grass okay 30 drops of peppermint 30 drops of lavender 30 drops of frankincense and you can add some block if you would like peppermint is for inflammation lemongrass is great for joints lavender is a very healing oil it's um soothing the muscles well that one drifts easy and frankincense is also healing it's an immunity booster it's like liquid gold I love this stuff and block is our paint blend it's got helichrysum Internet which is fabulous for pain so um you can add 10 or 15 drops of it as well which is what I will do it's got wintergreen and so once you get the essential oils I like to mix premix the essential oils in a separate container and just slosh it around a little bit and then pour it in my pain butter mix and then I will blend it again so then you will want to take it and you will put it in containers best if you get containers that are not at that are not clear and these are double walled plastics really fabulous you want to make sure that you label your containers and these have your name your address your contact information as well as what is in the jar the size so this is a four ounce what you do with it you rub it into the area of pain and then your ingredients listed from largest to smallest and you have to list out each essential oil as well so I will say I cheated just a bit and I didn't show you one thing I like my grandmother when I cook I did add just a tad of local beeswax to this and beeswax I read that it really helps with absorption so I added just a little bit of that as well and also just to make it a little bit harder and a little bit thicker so there you go that's how you do pain better simple there's quite a few steps and it's a little bit messy but it's very easy to do considering the relief that you get from from this recipe so go try enjoy share with your friends", "_-R-Oe1NpYY": "what is hemp flour in this video i'm going to tell you exactly what that is and i'm going to tell you that even though this looks exactly like marijuana it's legal on a federal level and while we're at it i'm going to tell you about cannabinoids which determine the intensity and it determines the physical sensations you're going to feel in your body and i'm going to tell you about terpenes which determine the smell and stinkiness of the flower so when you go shopping for flour online you're going to be able to find the best stinkiest flower that just really smacks so without rambling too much i'm gonna get right into it my name's chris with cbd extract.co i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and what i can tell you from my experience is that the words hemp marijuana and cannabis all mean the same thing technically but thanks to our good old buddy donald trump he now made federal legal definitions for these terms for example marijuana is defined as any cannabis product that has more than 0.3 percent delta 9 thc now we're not talking about thca we're not talking about delta 8 thc and we're not talking about any other form of thc we're only talking about delta nine so if it's above that threshold it's marijuana so and that's really weird because on a federal level that's a controlled substance it's a schedule one controlled substance so it's up there with meth heroin crack cocaine whatever those drugs are i don't know specifically because i don't do those drugs but what i do know is that it's in the same category which is totally bogus and messed up but what's crazy is that hemp is defined as less than 0.3 delta 9 thc so what that means is that all the other cannabinoids like cbg cbn thca delta athc these are all compounds that have free reign to be bought sold and shipped over state borders on a federal level it's completely legal and usps will actually ship this no problem they will not confiscate your product as long as it has a lab test in the package now what this means for you is you can literally go on google right now you can go on google right now and type in hempflower or delta8thc or cbg and you can literally buy products that look like marijuana but are completely legal to be bought and shipped to your house that is literally crazy that's insane so and as a matter of fact if you want to get your hands on some indoor flour you can get an eighth totally for free at cbdxrack.co we actually give a free eighth of our greenhouse or indoor grown flower completely for free all you got to do is hit the link below so definitely check that out um it you got nothing to lose it's totally free we covered the pot all you got to do is cover the postage but anyways to figure out if the product is legal or not so it's actually safe to be shipped because keep in mind marijuana is illegal to be shipped over state borders you don't want to send marijuana over the border or buy it accidentally online and then you get caught and get in trouble so what you need to do is look at the lab test and so i'm going to pop this up on the screen right now but if you look at the lab test you'll see the triangle 9 thc as long as that percentage right there is less than 0.3 you're in the clear and it's considered hemp um if it's over obviously it's marijuana that's considered hot hot hemp as they call it and completely illegal unless you live in a recreational state so um and keep in mind like i said total thc doesn't matter on a federal level um the thca doesn't matter delta a thc cbg cbn none of that matters only the delta nine so keep that in mind i know i'm like a broken record at this point with the delta nine stuff but that's literally just how it works um so if you want to find the best quality this is the we need to look at because we're already looking at the lab test i might as well teach you how to get the best quality hemp flower there's a lot of people there's a lot of crappy dirty ditch wheat out there but basically if you look at the lab test you'll see the total cannabinoid percentage cannabinoid cannabinoid i don't know everyone says it different but basically the higher that percentage is the more you're going to feel so for example if you have a high cbd flower it's going to be relaxing if you have a high cbg flower it's going to be more stimulating because cbg is considered a non-psychoactive stimulant some people react to it differently they don't know too much about it but obviously each cannabinoid has a different effect cbn it's actually slightly psychoactive and it um makes you sleepy all right and then obviously if you have a high thca product when you smoke that thca it turns into delta 9 thc so obviously it gets you high same thing with delta 8 thc okay so basically you can buy these products online okay so if you want to get the products that really smack because a lot of people say oh hemp flour kind of sucks like it doesn't really make me feel like anything you need to get a higher percentage flower okay it's really that simple it works just like the medical industry with marijuana the higher the percentage the more you're going to feel and like i said you have different ratios of the cannabinoids the the percentages of them the next thing you want to look at in terms of the smell is going to be the terpenes now the terpenes are essentially the oils found in the bud that give it that pungent smell so if you're smelling pine you're smelling skunk you're smelling weird marijuana smells or whatever you know it just smells like weed in general that's a result of the terpenes and these terpenes actually indicate whether or not it's indica or sativa so for example uh limonene is considered a sativa uh terpene and mercine is considered a indica so if you look at the lab test you can see which terpenes are dominant that actually determines what effects are going to feel because these terpenes actually indicate um how you're gonna feel right they bind to your receptors in the same way that cannabinoids do so it's really crazy and one more thing to look out for when you're shopping for hemp flour online is don't just go off the pictures because you're gonna see these big dank beautiful buds you're gonna see like all these reviews and stuff but you might get it in the mail if you're going at it blindly and you'll be like man these buds are like dull smelling they don't really do anything they kind of smoke it i got a throat itch and a headache you don't want that so always look at the lab test right because the lab test is like your safeguard to make sure you're getting quality product you don't want to be wasting your money you don't want to smoke dirty ditchweed and also you want to see on the lab test if there's panel testing for pesticides because who knows maybe they're selling pesticide hemp flour you need to protect yourself so always look at the lab test and that's pretty much it so hemp flour yeah it actually can get you high if you buy a certain type of product just have in general you can get high if you buy a certain type of product but really guys it's just so simple if you want to feel good look at the lab test check the cannabinoids and the terpenes and you're going to get good product so that's pretty much it i hope you enjoyed this video and like i said if you want access to indoor and greenhouse grown flower hit the link below we're doing a free eighth promo uh there's nothing for you to lose all you gotta do is hit the link if you're from the us you qualify if you're from the uk or another country uh we do not do shipping

remember I don't think I've reviewed this but this is gonna be a tincture review today guys okay I want to ease myself back in using cvd since I haven't used it for a while almost three weeks to be exact you know so and this is and this is a great opportunity to to be able to sit back and reflect on how it can affect you and calm you down being that I haven't taken I've had a lot of stress a lot lately so that's why I really made this video is because I want to bring you guys something that's of course CBD based upon so guys check this out mendel perps from five leaf ulness guys that actually has a demand it has some of the some of the genetics from the actual the the real old Mendel perps rain so guys go check out five leaf wellness Mendo perps okay use the code jb FLW 19 alright that's JB FLW 19 guys Mendo perps go pick it up cuz I got some coming in the mail you know when I saw the Mendel perps I was super psyched it's an indica dominant strain also guys I also want to let you guys know like I know a lot of people are obsessed with Delta 8 if you're looking for a very very very good tincture okay because there's a couple people that just release some tinctures that want like way too much money for them I mean like hundred and some dollars for them and stuff like that I mean 3qi has an incredible good tincture I suggest you get the tincture with the cbn in it to combat the the race enos of the delta eight because it will even that out and give you a very relaxed sedative type of effects okay alright so moving forward dies anyways um this is going to be Lazarus Naturals this is a CBD tincture 750 milligrams of CBD okay so let me see what's the size on this bad boy here I don't remember servings per container 15 ok 15 milligrams of CBD per serving okay serving size is

bring this close to you okay there it is Lazarus Naturals gay guys and this is CBD tank sure from Lazarus Naturals I like this because this is flavorless so you can put this in your coffee you can put this but you know I'm also gonna note this to you guys too especially people that are newer to CBD in general most of the stuff is to be put under the tongue okay so if you buy a tincture and you do not put it under your tongue don't wonder why you're not getting that many crazy effects okay it's just a fact just saying um but uh so anyways guys let me get some lighting on here for a minute because it's like very strange okay hold on there damn look how handsome I look with that lighting nah alright guys so anyway so that dude seriously it's great to be back guys real men dopes is coming in the mail sour Gouda looks absolutely phenomenal I'm not sure if I'm very interested in that strain though let me know if you guys order what you guys think I'm sure it's fire but I'm I like I just I love indica strains and the Mendo perps is by far it looks amazing guys like and this purple rain that I got is like it's so I don't know ooh it's a little bit on the drier side but let me just tell you something this is some of the most purple guys this purple rain though like what play this let me actually see if I can try to focus and with all the light because it like really look at this look at that purple seriously look at this holy mother of Lord boy what yo ha for real this shit's fire though right um alright so let me take the tincture now I haven't you see me like I said for three weeks so I will really actually be able to tell you if this team shirt works okay also I mailed away the ounce to the winner also bruh hey 93 your stuff is coming in the mail brother keep an eye out please all right big country I got you to pay him so I was able to take care of all those birds with one stone right so anyways so let me just take this thing so first before I move on all right so you want to keep it under a tongue for 60 seconds okay discount for 60 seconds how much is gonna sit here in silence guys all right I'm gonna date cuz that's what I do one second one second all right don't know when you're like tasting it it's got like that nasty oily taste too but I don't mind it to be honest it don't bother me that one so I just used some CVT guys we all know man anyways guys so I just want to talk to you a little bit about one of my favorite strains is a lifter okay very common strain this is a lifter plant okay so if you guys have any questions about this stuff this is one that will be ready to go to the other place by other location and put into the flowering chambers well firstly obviously I got a replant it okay now if you take a look here guys you'll notice that there's two nodes coming out of there now one two okay that is because I pluck the center one that is called topping guys and what this is gonna do is see now there's two there - look see one two one two okay it was originally one now there's two growing so topping is a great way to increase your bud sites and at the same time produce an even canopy okay so what I'm also gonna do then cuz I'm gonna tie it down and I'm gonna train it okay I'm gonna train it cuz it's gonna help it grow at an even nice right okay so this is a lifter straight guys very very nice looking very good so is a little dry now so I got to give it a nice a nice nice coating of some water yes so she's looking very nice guys alright she's looking very nice okay also guys I'm gonna be offering a service to you guys of providing grown plants possibly okay possibly German okay so maybe I could actually start my own business with germinated plants okay because that way I can send him to the people they can plant them and then they'll be good to go they've of course will probably be all feminized so you don't have to worry about any complications the only thing you have to do is make sure the growing condition are at an optimum level because if not you can turn them into hermaphrodites and what that means is they'll grow male pollen sacks on top of the feminized female parts of it to try to reproduce because if it senses stress it's gonna tell so okay we need to reproduce something's not right we gotta save ourself okay so that's how you know from an afroditi plant and a lot of times you can get hurt herm\u00e8s with feminized seeds well yeah this is actually a this is actually a rogue origin lifter so I'm excited to see what she has to offer I'm saying she because I hope it's a girl I'm not seeing any signs of I mean obviously not yet it's too soon but sooner than later I'll be able to truly identify what it is anyways guys so the Lazarus Naturals is uh it's I like it because it's flavorless tree nuts coconut so it's got tree nuts in it in coconut okay it's fractioned coconut oil and CBD excellent okay so this is the suggested use okay it's telling me you take one milliliter as needed or as directed by her health care may take up to two hours for full effect serving may vary greatly by individual okay so like I said that that all leads back to the thing I was trying to explain to you guys about sativa and indica okay you could take an indica and freak out it doesn't matter if it's indica sativa let's be real people it depends all on your body chemistry okay so let's just put that myth away alright alright so another thing I want to talk about here is I still have this this box indoor string doesn't mean I don't smell bad at all I have like a weird tea smell to it sort of Wow I mean it looks great though and guys I mean that's that's the this light is too bright I'm not gonna lie all right that and this right here is the Box train look at that yeah there's there's the lighting look at that that is the box indoor strain from hemp pop I'll be doing a review on that in a few days here hopefully excited for that that's been sitting here for a while I mean I've had all this stuff I had to put I had to put it all and stop it but you guys are like oh Sam's done he's going what's happening falling off the cliff not mailing out to giveaways like dude life on life terms or hey like life happens let's be real this scene Hayes that is by far one of my favorite sativas that I've ever had and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna see her in [ __ ] you if it truly truly truly is okay here's uh here's the CNAs actually let me just adjust this because it'll look at this okay on it it's the lighting look at that there it is look at that that is you're seeing a haze okay that is an absolute doll of a city bus train guys this stuff is phenomenal and this is I preach tea in a haze guys all right Oh guys so I had the I had the opportunity to just try one of these so far I would suggest getting these guys this is the indica granddaddy purp 50 milligrams of CBD all right per pod okay 8% this is a it's a carefully blended with accomplished terpene profile specific to the indica strain normally found in nature this famous cross between purple oracle and big bud provides a balance rush of sweet grape and mixed berry with each straw Wow so and these ingredients are very clean it's a bio-based propylene glycol organic terpenes hemp can't avoid extract vegetable glycerin and us Pete kosher vegetable glycerin one one CBD pod contains point six milliliters with 8% CBD by weight approximately equal to 50 milligrams draw three times activate guys this is from hip hop and this [ __ ] is fire dude I also found a company selling an indica shot you drink it and it has 12 milligrams of THC in it so for all you guys you guys want to know that you guys just let me know when she that direction and I got that lavender rose I I've heard nothing but great things about this strain that's got like a like a floral like a floral it's got like a floral smell to it this is a lavender rose a very very pretty as well guys look at it it is a very pretty strain okay so see the thing about THC and CBD it's it's like a double-edged sword because some people will tell you it's not good to take for a long time because it'll eventually cause psychosis long-term use there is another theory here that's very interesting I want you guys to be open-minded please okay so this actually binds to receptors in your brain that are responsible for fear okay so if you ever get anxious after you smoke CVD that has too much THC in it or anything like that you will have a panic attack and it is completely normal okay because that goes in those receptors which increases your your thoughts of having like scared or like like those feelings you know what I mean which is completely normal I mean social factor life design all right Purple Rain I love that I'm gonna put that one back in this collection I have a vicious collection by the way guys this look at a half ounce of tropical breeze so you know if you like tropical breeze and you're jealous that I got it yes it is fire yeah this is by far one of the best strings I've had today tropical breeze for days oh such a beautifully balanced hybrid like you know I need this just if I get a seat I'm gonna grow a forest to that [ __ ] trust and believe that this legendary from Black Tie was pretty good man so top 10 this guy wanted me to make a top 10 I don't know if I can do that well I'm gonna tell you right now for me number one's gonna be tropical breeze to this day I just wanted I have the same feelings for and I love it number two is gonna be the frosted Kush from secret nature CVT it's a glorious beautiful sexy string it is absolutely great number three could possibly be the GU berry because just because it smells great I love sniffing it I mean like a lot I also want to let you guys know that the grandmas gravy for me would be possibly number four all that is is a special sauce er B strain but it is very good and that is that is the fact I still got to review that but I do have it and I do like that strain out of all the art a new strains that one smells the best I know Todd really likes the creme de la creme and I'm not gonna lie that's a very good strain too they look great they look amazing you know what I mean it's unfortunate some of them got the more MP MP smell to it like you know what I mean nothing loud or anything like that or certain super super potent aromas but the grandma's gravy smells the best out of all three of them and I believe that it's it's a good string I really want to try the purple tsunami that's coming out that's Steve a dominant strain but they say it's one of the best strains for anxiety I also want to know give us a shout out to five-week wellness because they actually put down in their description of the Mendo purp strain that it has some of the genetics from the real men a person a lot of people were upset that 5-leaf is now putting out their genetics terpene profiles and all that stuff I just need you guys understand that is that is all directed from the grower the grower does not wish to disclose these things because those are his secrets his pride and Joy's okay a lot of you guys that doubt find lethal illness which is only about two or three people that I know think that they're not releasing that stuff because they're putting chemicals into it or it's an ad that is not the case guys it's just a matter of privacy and the owner the owner is very upfront honest with you if you give a call talk to him he'll explain you everything but I did note to him that that is one of the downfalls of the company in a thicket they could start putting more genetics and terpene profiles they could be number one you know what I mean because they're always consistently dropping new strains guys I mean let's just be real always and a lot of strains are from Europe that's the crazy thing some of the genetics are from Europe so I was really happy they brought back to CNAs the purple rain is good too though it's potent so anyways I'm driving at this point in time but thanks for tuning in guys oh no man let's just let me get let's it's your boy Sam for Sam you see VD TV guys and I am out of he",

thank you we've got to wrap it up thank you very much marcel you", "xXhpVaONFxk": "hey guys it's ellie here from way of leaf folks are using cbd at an impressively increasing rate and popularity doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon in this brief video rundown we tell you what cbd is where it comes from and how you can use it to achieve a number of practical health benefits the word cbd is actually short for cannabidiol which is a naturally occurring phytochemical compound found in most strains of cannabis and hemp before we go any further this is actually a good time to go ahead and explain what the difference is between hemp and cannabis or marijuana hemp and marijuana are actually the same species of plant cannabis sativa l while marijuana strains typically have a thc content between 10 and 20 percent hemp by definition contains just 0.3 or less thc of course is the psychoactive chemical in cannabis and is the compound responsible for the high that cannabis produces cbd on the other hand can be found in high amounts in both hemp and marijuana and unlike thc cbd has no mind-altering properties meaning it does not produce any kind of a high so to answer the question of what is cbd it's simply a compound specifically a compound called a cannabinoid that's produced naturally in cannabis let me take a quick second to remind you to subscribe to the way of leaf channel and turn on notifications if you haven't already every subscriber counts and is crucial to our growth and we appreciate every single one of you it goes a long way to help us achieve our goal of getting the best possible cannabis content out there and to the most amount of individuals also don't forget to check out our website wayofleaf.com anyway getting back to the topic as far as how cbd works within the body this has to do with various interactions within the endocannabinoid system or ecs the ecs in humans is a complex network of neurotransmitters and receptors that helps regulate and maintain a variety of physiological processes when we consume cbd the compound interacts with the ecs receptors to help return cells and their various tissue and organ systems back to a state of balance and homeostasis the most interesting part is that ecs receptors exist in nearly every single cell and tissue type in the human body this explains why for one person cbd might help with something like nerve pain in the feet while for someone else it might help with migraines or help muscles to recover after an intense workout there have been hundreds of studies carried out on the medical potential of cbd as of right now we know that cbd possesses anxiety reducing pain relieving and even neuroprotective activity cbd is also the active ingredient in the prescription drug epidialex which is used to treat rare forms of pediatric epilepsy in terms of safety and practicality of use it appears that cbd is less dangerous and has fewer side effects than the majority of prescription medications on the market in fact the world health organization describes cbd as generally well tolerated with a good safety profile the organization also mentions that cbd presents no public health related problems what else can we discuss to help answer the question of what is cbd oil as far as legality cbd is widely available in most u.s states due to unique legislation in the u.s farm bill while the farm bill doesn't mention anything specifically about the legalization of cbd it does mention the legalization of hemp which cbd is found abundantly in that being said the hemp derived cbd market is still not tightly regulated in order to find a good high quality cbd product that will actually work we recommend doing plenty of research reading plenty of reviews and making sure you only buy a product that comes with a third-party lab report among other things third-party lab reports ensure that the milligram amount of cbd that says the bottle has is actually the amount that's in the bottle for a rundown on some of the best and most effective hemp derived cbd products currently available be sure to check out our cbd section over on our way of leaf website we review hundreds of cbd products in an effort to point out what's good and what's bad about some of the biggest cbd names out there on the market we hope this video has helped to answer the question of what

Paul's alzo and I'm dr. Brad weenie okay so today's topic we're gonna cover what is the best topical ointment or cream to use on my arthritis or my sore muscles or bones a lot of people are looking for the answer to this so stay tuned okay first of all what why do we like using topical treatments for like arthritis of the knee or the hand or sprains and strains because it smell good they smell awesome it's not the answer they can smell good but the main reason like topicals is because they're safe yes totally agree I love using topicals if they can reduce the number of pills any of my patients have to take especially my older patients love topical I have some elderly patients that take so many pills I'm like do you have room for lunch yeah like you're on so many different medications you have time to eat lunch cause you got that set up there you got yeah the whole tray opened day one day two day three and day one's got like 50 pills in it it's confusing I can I'm on one medication I'm gonna say that I supposed to take every day I can't remember to take it so if I start twitching or fall asleep our talks without and take my medication okay all right so we like them because they're safe anti-inflammatories and your topical presenta if you took an anti-inflammatory pill yep like an aspirin type of pill there's some risks with that yeah I worry about my stomach I might worry about bleeding I might worry about blood pressure kidney function how it affects my diabetes so many factors yeah I mean these complications are rare and those medications are very effective in a supervised setting however it's always saver do not take it yeah because they carry some risk okay so we like topicals because they're safe okay we like topicals because they're effective yes they deliver the treatment right to the source of the pain right you've got a sore thumb you're putting it on your thumb sore knee you're putting it on your knee right instead of taking it having it go through your entire blood stream to get to that part you're putting it right on that part and science is more organized now too so they do studies to show that using a top of a head some medicine in it versus a topical that's just a placebo the one with medicine actually works and they've tried lots of different kinds of things so we have evidence that topicals are effective yeah okay I like that they're versatile you could put a whole bunch of different things in the top of them multimodal that's the buzzword right there now our pain gurus and our specialists say that we have to use a multi-modal approach to pain which means don't just use one thing I use a bunch of different types of things and you can get topicals that are multi modal and when you say multiple you mean like anti-inflammatory muscle relaxant nerve agent local anesthetic there's a whole bunch of different choices right right okay so that's why we like topical so what is going on is it easy to use your heard use they're very hard to use because you have to put a DAB on your finger and put it on the spot I'm just kidding they're easy to use easy it's very easy to use okay and you know guys like us we don't look at the instruction manual you know I mean first you I'm putting together a table or a desk I don't look at the instruction no and I usually put together wrong yeah except for when I'm doing surgery of course I look at the instruction manual oh yeah okay so that's why we like tacos now what is the best topical to use I think the answer is that it really depends right on a whole bunch of things what's in it yep we're gonna give you the tools here to understand what to look for inside the topical that might work okay yep so first of all I think it's important for it to have an anti inflammatory component to it something in there that's an anti inflammatory I would agree I like that I like some type of anesthetic in mine yeah something that's gonna sort of numb calm the nerves down yep and just give some kind of anesthetic and then you can get in to have something in there that might act on the muscle yum that's gonna relax the muscle in the air cuz you get some muscle spasm around these sort of musculoskeletal pains and then I'd say the last thing is that a lot of pain pathology relates to functions of the nervous system maybe kind of a specific effect on the nerves yeah so if you can find a top well has a few different components in it that can attack the pain pathways from those different angles that's gonna be your best one and ultimately because they're so safe and easy to use yeah you can try a few different ones and see which one works for you yes okay some work better on with some people some work better on other people and it is a little bit of trial and error for sure yeah I did the other thing that seems to be coming along the pipe is DVD and things like cannabis type products in a topical is potentially gonna be the future of some of these types ooh yeah that is that is something coming down the pipe there hasn't been a ton of evidence yet on that because they're just gaining approval over time a year or two however there are some studies showing that there are some studies showing they're gonna look at that question yeah down the road I'm gonna go get a topical we're big fans of using topical treatments for musculoskeletal problems we've sort of given you the idea what what our take is and what a good one would be do it with the supervision of your darker though to ask you know ask suggestions mention your what you're thinking about and then you can kind of decide together sure you often you need your doctor because some of these are over-the-counter but the over-the-counter ones usually aren't multimodal and usually aren't very strong that's right I'm gonna put the prescription strength ones usually get the drug levels the topical drug levels up to a point where they can actually have a good effect yeah so hey if you like this video

to try a lot of new CBD products but I haven't posted anything because I haven't really tried anything interesting until now when I finally found a CBD vape pen that I really love from joy organics which has been one of my favorite CBD companies for a while now I'll admit I have a lot less experience with vaping CBD than I do with other types of CBD products I've tried almost everything but for the last few years I've primarily stuck to CBD oils and pills for my daily CBD regimen now I have found CBD vapes that I liked before like the pens and cartridges from CB distillery that I've reviewed previously I just never really loved the vaping experience itself but a few weeks ago joy organics sent me one of their full-spectrum and also THC free CBD vape pens to try and I finally understand just how wonderful vape CBD can be when it's at its best so now that I've nearly finished the vape cartridges they sent me and I've had a while to test it out in a wide variety of situations I wanted to share my experiences with everyone because it's the first CBD vape pen that has actually helped me to manage my Munir symptoms and tinnitus in a meaningful way so before I go any further I want to just quickly explain what CBD is and also why and how I use it for tinnitus and Meniere's disease in case this is the first time that any of you are hearing of this so CBD is one of a hundred and thirteen different cannabinoids or active compounds found in the marijuana cannabis hemp plant and on its own it's non psychoactive which means you will not get high from consuming CBD products yet it's believed to be a lot of to be responsible for many of the medicinal effects of cannabis in marijuana and when I take CBD it doesn't directly reduce my tinnitus a quiet my tinnitus or reduce my other mini\u00e8re symptoms but it relieves my anxiety and lowers my stress levels more than any other supplement I've ever tried and because Meniere's disease and tinnitus is so severely worsened by stress and anxiety CBD ends up making a huge difference in my quality of life it also helps me to better cope in the middle of difficult moments by immediately calming me down but let's get back to the review so first things first let's talk about the packaging and design so I was impressed with the joy organics vape pen from the moment I opened the box so you can see the box it comes like this it's a small white box the packaging and design are are beautiful in a minimalist kind of way so it comes the package includes a white battery a prefilled cartridge with a white mouthpiece and a USB charger for the battery now assembling the pen couldn't be easier you simply remove the battery and the cartridge screw together and inhale there's no buttons or moving parts of any kind and it turns on when you inhale and it turns off when you stop and I think the sleek sort of minimalist design really adds to the charm of using this thing now the vaping experience in my opinion is what really sets this pen apart it's incredibly smooth almost every other CBD pen that I've tried has sort of like an unpleasant harshness to the vapor that makes me cough and sort of irritates my lungs a little bit but not the case with this pen coughing and lung irritation I should say are not a deal-breaker for me but it's just so much nicer when it feels smooth going in now the flavor is also excellent they joy organics cause the flavour light citrus breeze and I think that's a good description every hit has a sort of subtle citrus like couldn't pinpoint what citrus fruit exactly but citrus undertones that add to the experience without overpowering it it's it's a very subtle flavor but it's nice and I find it's that it really makes this pen and a delight to use and and and to hit there's no like harshness to it in any way the strength of the effect is the other way in which this vape pen really shines like all the other products that joy organics offers it's made with full spectrum hemp extract that is also THC free thanks to this some final step in the manufacturing process that removes a hundred percent of the th from the end product and I have nothing against the trace amounts of THC in in many full spectrum hemp products but I know that this is important to a lot of you so I wanted to mention it and the end results thanks to the fact that it's full spectrum is that it's a much more effective CBD product than other vapes that are made with CBD isolate which is what I've tried in the past which is purified CBD powder now vape CBD doesn't last as long as other means of ingestion but it's the fastest onset by far within a minute or two of of hitting this I feel a subtle calm and kind of warmth wash over me and my muscles relieving a lot of my anxiety and stress and it doesn't impair me at all either if anything the reduced anxiety in the moment helps me to focus because I'm not as stressed out or my minds not racing with other things and while it only lasts for about an hour or so when you vape CBD it's usually more than enough to help me deal with whatever difficulty I'm facing in any given moment so as you can probably tell I am obsessed with this vape pen and I can't recommend it enough truly especially if you have experience with other CBD products and you found them helpful for you since receiving it this pen has become a powerful part of my Meniere's and tinnitus coping toolkit and I find myself keeping it on me pretty much at all times like just to have it just in case I also plan to purchase additional cartridges once this one is finished the only real drawback here is the price it's definitely a premium product and they charged the current price right now is $99 for a package that includes a four hundred and fifty milligrams art regeni uh but it is a premium experience and it's and it's it's worked for me way better than any other vape pen I've tried so for me it's worth the price so I hope you guys give this a shot and if you try it be sure to let us know what you think in the comments or if you have any other vape pens that you've tried CBD vape pens we'd love to hear about those too thanks everyone have a great day", "GRriQ4OysuE": "that cannabis lovers beyond the Vespa smoking the best buds and today my buddy is Daisy and for this special weed Wednesday we're talking which i think is an important subject yep so I decided to bring my favorite top school on the show and Daisy brought her Oh taco as well yeah what she made yeah yeah so for people who don't know topicals articles are cannabis infused creams lotions balms gels you know that bath salts that softens are you put it on your where you have the most pain so are this inflammation directly on that and headaches as well totally I have heard that topicals have helped with eczema yeah psoriasis and with anecdotal evidence from so many people thousands of people who can prove that this is actually a treatment that works for them and what's really cool though topicals is that you get that therapeutic cannabis relief without that cerebral hive non-intoxicating and so is generally teach seeing them yeah you know you don't get that like you'll get stone from getting its down exactly just let direct area that you put that topic along how it works is that the cannabinoids and turbines right on the surface your skin penetrates and it does bind to see bt receptors but it doesn't go into your bloodstream which i think is like what a lot of people are looking for in the middle of the day at work you know if you have a desk job yeah if you have adjust your neck kinko then in front of computer like this on it yeah just around all the time so like that it's yeah it's really lovely daisy has had lots of experience talk tool she actually has some fibromyalgia and it really does but we were talking about this earlier from and you're saying like the nine points that you get hit with and even like under the knee just left yeah so issue yeah so far grow I would say like probably eighty percent of my life is spent in some form of pain some days is really bad whatever yeah but chuckles that cannabis in general like really help with all of that right that's a great way to get some relief and I like about what topicals - thanks about I said 30 to 45 minutes to kick in Chris depending on what's in your topical as well so many different variations you can get so many different benefit like even these two are like me different like different ways of infusing the cannabis into them right so there's so many different ways that you know like maybe an olive oil is gonna get down deeper and also I know that like terpenes and stuff that are in those will actually help them penetrate deeper yeah yeah area filena you can find carry off I'll intervene and black pepper and cinnamon and terpenes really mesh well with the can her cannabinoids - entourage effect you really get that synergistic effect today I wanted to show off the one that I use I actually got this from the headquarters here in Victoria BC the ingredients in this is coconut oil peppermint spearmint leaf cloves which clothes are found in human dr. bean and that's an anti-inflammatory turkey yeah as well as the black pepper eukaryote filing that one's anti-inflammatory as well as an anti analgesic red seaweed in this wintergreen oil honey bees wax now I really like this one is every the peppermint and spearmint in it that cooling effect so if I want like a gnarly hike worked out really hard that day it's like that's exactly what you need a cold one see what other people talk opposed to is they're like you know they can be used for any purpose like we said they can be used like a casual height like the bengay or something yeah they can be used for like really serious like you know like series migraine pain yeah headaches okay you can actually just rub him directly where you're feeling pain that's where it's gonna penetrate and really I mean like I said I always have mine on me so it's like a co-worker's a thing complains but a headaches and I'm like no try some of this I do not have a deal yeah but but ya know people love it like people are always just amazed yeah people have that idea that you have to smoke or eat we to get that benefit of the pain relievers that yeah you have to kind of get that psychoactive high yeah thing is people you don't and I think that's like what a lot of people are looking for so if I personally like the psychoactive cerebral I yea recommended if you're not looking for that high but yeah tell me a bit about the one that you have here yeah all right this is from big temples actually sorry BC as well the super grade I used to work there on infection made this batch a little bit ago and yeah there's all kinds of stuff in this instead of the more typical way of infusing it we used cannabis leaf oil so it's like olive oil infused with cannabis which is cool that's got some vitamin E it's as mucolytics the eucalyptus also kind of has that cooling effect then you're gonna get peppermint and stuff like that it does have a little bit of peppermint wintergreen as well some lavender some cinnamon which as you said that and inflammatory Antion is what it's all about boom it is I think it uh when I found this out I just my mind was blown it's pretty actually I was little little terpene in it and that was like the calming more like you Florrick effect to it really strong instantly I smell cinnamon yeah the cinnamon is over that's what I smell yeah [Music] yeah and so like there is my bulletin to you but it's actually actually people at this that gives like cool that's cool I love that we brought two different ones kind of show people that there's something out there for everybody

you didn't watch my last video it was on a vape pen so if you didn't see the vape pen a review on CBD FX I would highly recommend going over there and looking at that but for this I am doing a CBD oil now this CBD oil is called kidney B the company Canady is very reputable I believe I believe they have about four point four to 4.8 stars out of five on several platforms you can go research them yourself but I would highly recommend listening to what I have to say about it I have been taking this for three days only three days but I have been taking CBD for over three years so this is full-spectrum CBD oil what that means is it has THC in it it has less than 0.3 percent THC in it the reason why is because it is the legal dose that you can take in America in all 50 states except for Oregon carrot California Colorado Washington they're all recreationally legal for anything but in other states the point the below 0.3% is 100% legal and safe so the reason why I brought up TC is because I like products with THC in them the compounds of THC and CBD works so well for me together if I just sorry if I just use a CBD isolate I am going to not feel right I'm gonna not feel good at all because it's something that doesn't do anything for me like it does do stuff for me but it makes me feel off it makes me feel weird so this has enough THC in it for me to feel good I just feel good with it and I do feel THC and especially in small amounts I'm very sensitive to THC so if you're sensitive to THC I wouldn't recommend this if you still if you still want to try to each see in your system and you still want to try having it in your CBD oils or your CBD vape pens I would do some more research on the products that can Navy has or if you want to CBD FX or go to pure relief com now I want to talk about what I have in my system right now so right now I have this in my system about 20 to 24 milligrams I have something else in my system which is a CBD joint it's a pre-roll from peer relief and it had point zero three percent to each C in it and I had about 20 milligrams of that this morning this I take throughout the day this I supplement or the smoking I supplement to this this I take every day all day and I think I want to start taking the one dose in the morning and one at night because I feel like it's gonna make me feel a lot better especially with something with THC in it because it can make you a tad drowsy because I have about because I have about forty to forty four milligrams in my system I'm feeling a little bit drowsy but I think it's because of the THC in this that I'm having a little bit of a haze if you will but it's nothing it's nothing bad I don't I don't feel high well I feel slightly buzzed but that's just because my body is what my body is that doesn't have to be your body also I wanted to mention if you are 18 plus continue watching this video if you are not 18 plus if you are below 18 I would not get any of this because you're not allowed that it's still illegal for people under 18 to purchase so I would be careful with that you can't purchase it and I don't condone anyone below 18 to be using this and also I don't condone anyone to be I'm not saying anybody should use this it's actually not for everyone but I do I do strongly recommend looking it up for yourself and researching it because this can be a life changer this can be a very big game changer any CBD product so this product specifically is $69 it is the 750 milligrams but 'el it is 30 milliliters in lemon-lime full-spectrum CBD oil I got it for $69 now you can look up a coupon code for this I used a coupon code it saved me roughly 25% I believe so that'll be super handy if you're you know tight on cash as the pandemic is making you but yeah I would highly recommend looking at this and trying it my consensus on this as it makes me feel hazed it makes me feel groggy if I take too much or if I take it with something else I took this with another CBD product so they're kind of making me feel more groggy than normal but this would make me feel hast not groggy not tired hazed and what I mean by that is a relaxed pace and it's because of the THC like I said but it makes me feel extremely calm extremely clear-headed extremely clear minded and I don't feel like and I feel like I'm in control of my emotions more so and I feel like I'm in control of my daily tasks and things that I can get done during the day another thing about this is it's rated I think I already said that this one is rated at 4.7 out of 5 stars so I also have really good sleeps at night from this I have 8 to 9 hours of sleep per night and I was starting to before I took this I was starting to not get any sleep at night I would take this and I would weirdly or not take this sorry I would take this and not weirdly stay up I would weirdly fall asleep right off the bat as soon as I just like thought about bed and I put my head to the pillow I would just get sleep people with insomnia I should really try this and people with insomnia 25 milligrams is probably not gonna put you to sleep I think 50 milligrams is gonna put you to sleep so literally two servings of this also you have to shake well before you use it and it has directions for that but so yeah insomnia anxiety depression because I had probably problems sleeping I'm not saying or diagnosing this to insomnia patients I'm saying that I had trouble sleeping so this helped me now this is something that I never really talked about but I have digestive issues everyone really has digestive issues at some point in their life but I haven't tried digestive issues that kind of make and manifest my anxiety and depression on a daily level and especially when I eat something that is not good for me so I take CBD to also supplement that it doesn't cover it up like a lot of people say it does like cover up symptom or it covers up symptoms but like in a good way and it's also a natural pain reliever it's not temporary the pain relief is supposed to be there or that the pain is it there anymore when you take this and you're not supposed to just take this to supplement to make yourself feel better you can take this while being healthy because it restores your gut bacteria backed back to its natural flora I'm sorry I'm slurring my words anyway so that's what I take this is what I take for digestive issues because I have IBS borderline Crohn's disease so I take this and this makes me feel ten times better so it doesn't recommend nobody recommends you driving on this I can drive I can drive on this very well I'm actually way more focused than any other time but nobody recommends that you drive on it and that's because of the THC content but also because for some people it makes you drowsy and that's with the CBD and the THC so you can also walk take full walks and exercise very good very well with this I walk every day and this just amplifies it amplifying meaning making it a lot better to walk and a lot better to run or jog or exercise it makes you feel a lot better it doesn't make you dizzy it doesn't give you any weird side effects when you exercise now that that's just for me it doesn't give me any weird I'm saying you because I would think that it doesn't really happen to anyone else but I can't say that as a fact because I only know my body now I also want to tell you that you don't get high off of this that's the one thing that you want to take away you don't get high off of it so you're not gonna get a legal high off of this I get a legal buzz because I'm very sensitive to any form of THC any it doesn't matter how much is in the oil I still get a little bit affected that's not to say that you will but this is still not a high product so anyway if you are not feeling too well if you're not feeling the best right now if you're not if you're feeling more anxious and depressed as opposed to normal as opposed to have how you normally feel I would greatly suggest looking this up don't go off of my word go look it up for yourself online and do some research before you try to try this but I tried it it works for me it makes me feel very good I don't know if I come across high in this video but I'm buzzed to say the least it's just a buzz it's not like it's not like I'm higher placed so it feels it I feel it most oh my god I can't talk I feel it most in my head like right here and it feels good to me it makes me feel comforted and calm and just down-to-earth and relaxed for anyone else if you don't like that head feeling I would recommend getting something again without THC but anyways try to take care of yourself during the pandemic try to take care of yourself during a protest also black lives do matter just so you know they really do and hopefully you will take away that with the message of CBD oil being your relief from any anxiety that you're feeling from any emotions that you can't control from anything that is going on in the real world right now a lot of people have it way worse and they matter so I just wanted to end on a good note I really hope that you guys try this out and you can put in the comments if you did like I said I'll have a link to the website and to this specific tincture in the description below and I hope that you all have a beautiful day night evening wherever you are in the world bye", "4aOrjIGW_tA": "it's going on everyone in today's video we're gonna talk about CBD and how it's applicable towards various ailments illnesses and how you can use it and apply it throughout the day in the evening time kind of to your leisure so stay with me and let's talk about in previous videos I have shown various types of CBD ranging from oils to topical creams and I explained the benefits of using each one I like to talk cream because you can treat certain areas of your body especially good for muscles joint aches and things like that but in this video what I want to do is discuss another form of CBD because this substance is becoming so popular especially now live in Canada so cannabis has actually become legal in Canada the THC form and the CBD form now the THC is basically the psychoactive whereas the CBD is the medicinal side of cannabis or marijuana whatever you want to call it I actually picked up one recently and it's called X sprays and this one's really straightforward and actually kind of convenient because all you really have to do is open it up unseal each individual bottle and just feel quick little spray and you're good to go this actually is a very very quick way to dose yourself it's very clear on the dosing as well because it indicated on the packaging but what's cool about x-rays is that there's actually different types for different applications so if you're looking to basically just get CBD straight up you can do so with the one that I'm holding here there's also ones for just before bed your sleep there's also ones for recovery if your finished training if you're finished exercising and you just want to get a quick hit of CBD to improve your recovery rate there's also one for libido and other different options as well this is a really neat idea and I like how portable they are because you just bring them anywhere you want and I also like the ease of application just basically pop it open spray it into your mouth as per the dosage and you're good to go nice and simple it's a lot like the oil showcase in a previous video and it's not so much like the topical cream which is basically just to treat certain areas like spot treat certain areas of your body the main application for me of CBD and these x-rays has been first of all in the daytime to boost energy levels much akin to green tea or green tea extract and even somewhat similar to caffeine although I metabolize caffeine quite quickly so I don't really notice the full boost of energy or the jitteriness or the anxiousness that some people experience it's kind of passing through me a lot easier so I use the CBD because I do notice a little bit of an increase in the energy similarly to the green tea I also have been using it before bed and the reason is because I been heavily focusing on my REM sleep cycles I've made some videos about the importance of getting deep sleep because you do a lot of your memory building your a lot of your cognitive function and your brain repair I mean your muscle tissue repair happens when you're sleeping at night so I want to keep myself in a state of grossly a deep sleep and in order to do that it's actually recommended that you dose up on CBD and you may even want to go a little bit extra heavy on that dose so what's actually difference between CBD and THC THC is going to get you to sleep a lot quicker but it will wake you from your REM sleep cycles so it's this is the practice I've been using I have a little bit of THC before bed which gets me to sleep quickly and that's typically within a smokeable form and then I'll have CBD and I'll do a heavy dose of CBD either with oils or with these ex sprays and that allows me to stay in a deep sleep state much longer through the night which helps with my recovery and cognitive function and all that cool stuff so if you are interested in proving your your sleeping CVD is definitely an avenue you may want to consider in conjunction with all the other options that are available to you such that what's outlined here with the ex brain and I like how they've separated all of them so you know which one to use at which time of the day or the evening and it's a lot more clear than just a generalized CBD oil or just one one-off spray that you use for everything this one's a little bit different it's broken up and you can apply it differently that's a really neat about this product if you're interested in checking out x-rays I encourage you to do so link in description below along the coupon code down there if you want to try the note and I hope you enjoyed this video hope was informative to you hope you found it helpful resourceful if you did give a thumbs up got your favorites share with a friend and thank you for

uh it might on your bio it just sounds so funny doesn't it because you know you get asked to write bios for stuff and obviously you have to sort of like hype yourself up and it you know it's a bit cringy but you know i suppose that you know it was all stuff that i couldn't attend to i found i found that online and uh now where your book is told so we'll talk about your book okay so as i'm looking at myself i told you i haven't had a haircut and i've seen these curls that i'm not used to so i guess just a few greys coming through yeah enough minds yeah that's so funny so good to have you on and so um uh let's talk well let's your book and i'll go into that but it's called the cbd book the essential guide to cbd oil um collins congratulations uh it's a publisher on that one and so we'll put links and uh we'll get them to your book and uh go from there but your personal story you know i i everyone has a personal story um not everyone but many have a personal story of getting into this industry can you start with that and get to where we are today sure yeah i mean um it started really i was living in spain at the moment i'm based in the uk but i was living in spain um and it really was well actually i guess the first seed was sown actually with an ex-boyfriend who was growing cannabis his friend had cancer and he decided to grow some some cannabis um and i remember watching videos with him um you know there was a kind of classic rick simpson video and and like the first time i heard of cbd and cannabinoids and i couldn't pronounce it and didn't you really you know i was like okay interesting next and then um yeah maybe sort of two years later um uh a very good friend of mine who who is from who is from belgium her mum had pancreatic cancer um and yeah i just sort of you know witnessed how you know she'd had the treatment it was it was terminal um and she really cope very badly with with um with morphine basically you know it just um i mean it's like taking taking a sledgehammer to pain essentially so but in this case actually it wasn't controlling the pain but she'd lost you know all lucidity she was suffering terribly um and she just wanted you know it all to be over really um and her her children who you know adults and my friends mum was you know kind of well she was about to be i think she made it to 80 before she died um but her children you know thought okay how can we think outside of the box and and that had heard something about you know about cannabis and its medicinal effects and their their gp was kind of forward thinking and found a loophole that they could prescribe cannabis oil and you know i was witnessing this from another country so i was hearing this all kind of second hand but uh but i never sort of forget when you know unfortunately um my friend's mum died but i remember you know vividly the the conversation in my kitchen in seville when when anna was telling me about um you know what cannabis allowed for her mum which was basically to die with dignity so you know she completely recovered her lucidity she wasn't in pain she had a bit of appetite you know she was a little bit stoned so she you know could have a giggle with her family and it just meant that those final two months were weren't hellish suffering you know it was it was um you know a good death actually and for me you know i yes cannabis is also about living but but for me being able to die well is is a kind of fundamental human right and i felt i felt enraged i felt absolutely enraged that that so many people were being denied this this right really um because of of cannabis prohibition so as a kind of backdrop to that at the time i was writing i was living in seville i was writing i had a blog about you know the city where i lived and i was writing about kind of other stuff i'd just written something about ayahuasca which was published on cnn and so i kind of was my head was already in the kind of plant medicine world um and yeah so i kind of you know i remember that i was in my kitchen and i promised and i was going to do something about it this injustice um and yeah so it was like you know two weeks later there was a hemp fair in seville where i was living so i got myself a press pass just sort of you know went along again you know completely naive cannabis naive you know totally um but with a view to just doing some research and maybe write an article um there were two cbd companies so this is back in 2016 so it's kind of before you know cbd went crazy you know worldwide um and there were two cbd companies um and i just kind of chatted to both of them one of them which was um a company called endoca which you know i'm very grateful to them because if it weren't for them i wouldn't be sitting here talking to you today um yeah i kind of was chatting to the founders mum was there and we were chatting and um and it turned out they're looking for a full-time writer and like you know sort of two weeks later pick me huh yeah well and you know and i had a you know week later a few days later i had a you know interview with their head of marketing and then i was hired basically so it kind of you know it this tremendous it felt like the stars had aligned you know and also you know before that i couldn't really work out i've always been quite random in my in my profession so you know i worked in tv i was a complimentary therapist i've also been an english teacher that you know various seemingly unrelated things that i've done but in suddenly it all kind of came together um you know my sort of background i had to you know study anatomy and physiology to be a complementary therapist so i had an understanding of the body um and you know kind of an interest in holistic health my kind of journalism background from tv and writing you know see what came into play so i just kind of immersed myself i had free reign to kind of write what i wanted um this was before the times when you know the kind of different regulatory agencies crack down on what you could and what you couldn't write about so i just you know i was living in spain where they're you know in madrid at the complex university they have some of the best scientists who've made the most as you know yourself and the most you know groundbreaking discoveries particularly with with cancer and the anti-tumor is that where um christina's such as yes yeah christina sanchez and and manuel guthmann and you know the whole kind of team there so i would just you know kind of interview them and um i don't know i just just just felt i'd found my my my calling really um and yeah so that that's kind of how it all started i particularly became fascinated by the endocannabinoid system because it was like this you know i think it's something for you know the medical professions who are not within the cannabis space and and you know the general public at large it can seem they can be you know for a bit incredulous really that hang on a sec how can the cannabis plant which by the way for 70 years they've been told is this kind of demonic uh plant that's gonna you know lead you to psychosis and and all sorts of terrible things how can it have these you know kind of therapeutic benefits for everything from epilepsy cancer pain um nausea you name it and and then as soon as i you know started to kind of understand the endocannabinoid system it was like people need to know about this you know okay it's about cannabis but it's also you know the endocannabinoid system is not only the bridge you know and and how cannabinoids act in our body but we should be you know over and above cannabis we should be paying attention to our endocannabinoid system doctors need to know about it you know even if they're not prescribing cannabis at least you know if you've got fibromyalgia patients or patients with those kind of clusters of symptoms they're missing a massive trick right so so yes uh that that's neat it's amazing when you get down to it because that's that's it's funny crin i was i worked for a magazine for years as well and crin picked me up at the airport one day and we were driving by one of our uh convention centers and they've had cannabis convection this i 2009. i said pull over and she looks amazing let's go in there you know let's just see what it's a friday night we walked in there and i walked around and i said it says medical on here but there's nothing medical about it and we met a couple people started talking the same thing and didn't think anything of it we got home and i was traveling a lot she said you know let's see if we can do something and so we started looking at how can we get in the cannabis industry and and corrine i called her mary poppins she didn't drink and didn't smoke and i i kid you not that was in our wedding vows my mary poppins and uh we started building something in the industry it was just a a a site a coupon site and then her father became known and we said hold my gosh stop the press you know and the same thing we saw the benefits of cannabis not knowing the true benefit we saw was we knew appetite stimulation munchies and for a cancer patient we came across study that showed 40 percent of cancer patients pass them malnutrition before cancer same thing with aids patients wasting syndrome and that's how our story began and so like you said the planet's aligned the stars aligned and uh here we are today ten plus years later and uh and helped a lot of patients um and like you said if we didn't live in a legal state it wouldn't have ever been an option it wouldn't have been an option uh you mentioned your friend anna's uh mom in in belgium you know i lived in belgium and two of my friends uh moms uh passed the pancreatic and um my friend gaston his his mom they used cannabis in the same thing she passed with dignity they traveled she was in no pain and he just saw this i mean i have children he said i saw this plant this capsule we were taking my mom was eating she was happy let's go travel they went all over italy they went all the way down to dubai i mean they traveled and she passed and she was never in any pain and then two years later crin gets sick and i'm thinking what's going on with us you know and uh so for anybody going through pancreatic cancer on any of our listeners i've learned a lot i'm certain mary hannah has as well and so i share all the time with all cancer patients but pancreatic please reach out to me because uh i've done a lot of studying when karen was ill with crim and then afterwards i i've met a lot of doctors and scientists not only in the cannabis sector but in the integrative oncology world that that are finding having successful pancreatic and so i i mean that uh if anybody's going through this please reach out which a lot of you do on a regular basis so that was my uh sorry i had to throw that out there when i hear pancreatic i just stop and you know i know what it's like i know what it's like on both sides as a health advocate helping families you know avoid the tangled web bridging the gap um um and i know what it's like being a caregiver i know it's like being a spouse a widow now you know and so i think that's why i relate to a lot of families and patients and doctors saying help help so with the laws changing in europe and globally and you and i know you're a global journalist um what's going on with the c you know let's go with the cbd laws it kind of breaks the ice there's still a stigma there's still a stigma here in california you know california's been legal since 1996 uh for medical use um like you said it's you know was a medicine here 83 years ago and they stopped that um and it's carried on overseas and it's funny before we got on the call you said the united states is leading the way and i always talked about israel many countries in europe china south america it's a perception right i think maybe because in the uk there's always you know i don't know the special relationship with the united states in general and and sort of you know there for example there was a kind of entertainment slash documentary series um in the uk a couple of years ago and they took a bunch of aging celebrities um to around the us on a kind of like cannabis road trip but you know kind of suggesting that um suggesting that you know that it was the most advanced and it and i guess it's a kind of we we don't necessarily understand the complexities and and you know i think each country has its own um idiosyncrasies and and failings and you know and nowhere's perfect that's the thing right now in the uk i mean in in the world you know we can kind of um some bits are working in some countries um some bits are working better than others and and so i guess you know we're we as you i think you said before it's kind of like the blind leading the blind but you know hopefully we will there'll be some kind of harmonization at some point in yeah you know you know all the different like you were talking about all the different ailments i always talked about it's not like duct tape with a million and one uses but when you really get down to it you know when you really get down to it uh scientist manuel guzman and uh christina dr christina's doctor she's a doctor right or scientist yeah she's a doctor yeah um you know their studies and it's funny i i i recommend them as leaders from the us but you know the irony is that this is the crazy thing so you know i'm kind of between the uk and still my my heart is a little bit in spain so you know and it's tragic really in spain because they've got these you know incredible scientists not just you know within the area of cancer but neurodegenerative diseases and whole you know and cannabinoid science they are in many respects leading the way and yet patients in spain do not have legal access to medical cannabis they don't you know and actually that's not unjust the amount of times i've read that oh in spain you know their medical cannabis is legalized no it isn't no it isn't you know um when chris and i were there back in 2014 15 i believe we met some underground there are some underground cannabis clubs yeah and that they're underground but they're also i mean again they're sort of the the grazer i mean i was a member of one um and they have these sort of ways of of being being kind of semi-legal um you know you you you know you're a member you don't you know they don't get raided by the police or anything like that although in barcelona i think there were a few problems because there was a kind of industry building up around it and it wasn't supposed to be that wasn't it wasn't its intention but you know and also in spain you can you can grow you know you can grow your own as long as it's not it's not like you can't see it from the road or something like that so um but you know as i say no nowhere's perfect that that's the thing and it's um but i i really feel i feel for um you know i've got sort of you know friends and and colleagues in spain who are battling and battling but there's no political will there's no political and you know what's what's infuriating is that you know spain is exporting you know it's exporting medical canada it's been grown in spain and exported elsewhere but you know spanish people can't you know can't get access themselves so so let's talk about exporting a perfect lead into your article um uh your what is your your fda your food drug administration called the european well there's efsa which is the european food standards authority um i'm obviously i'm in the uk we're about to leave europe in about you know sort of i don't know what are we now well about 20 days time and so we have a kind of um a uk version of that the food standards agency um so so that there's been a lot of upsets in the last couple of years because um cbd or actually cannabinoids in general have been added to something called uh the novel foods catalogue so um basically a novel food is in in europe is is is something that wasn't commonly consumed prior to 1997. so um so kind of cbd seemed to be kind of going under the radar radar that then the you know these regulatory bodies weren't weren't getting involved and then suddenly um in january i think it was 2019 they sort of very quietly added cannabinoids to this novel food catalogue basically which then means once it's been added to that um you have to in order to kind of market it or sell um product selling cbd they have to go they have to like do and make an application a novel foods application with toxicology reports and proving its safety basically because if it's novel the idea is we don't know if it's safe you're sorry sorry mary your nephew a novel is like our cannabis brownies or cannabis water uh cbd water is that where you're what you're saying the thing is basically it's it seems if at the time um it says cbd is classed as a food it's not a narcotic that's another kind there's another kind of chapter to this this story at the time it was not a narcotic so therefore it was classes of food but there was nothing in between it's either narcotic or food nothing in between but it went food narcotic and back to food now right food narcotic and now back to food exactly and so like over here cannabis and i had a lawyer on the show a few weeks ago and i asked him about cbd and he says well my dad always taught me that it was the term it's clear as mud meaning there's still a gray area um like over here cannabis is still for you know that's why the scientists like you were mentioning we don't have the that um it's not really public with our scientists well global scientists like like the rest of the world has because it's still federally legal schedule one narcotic um still classified with heroin lsd highly addictive uh no medical benefits ecstasies on there and cannabis is on there and that just kind of just blows my mind with no medical benefits but they have it as a patent as a neuro protector with medical benefits and so is there with the with the narcotic uh scheduling that you have over there um where where does that stand is it is it still like that like we have schedule one is the number one most dangerous is your uh yeah so i mean i can talk from a kind of uk perspective so we have the we have the scheduling because you had the kind of obviously had the single convention of narcotic drugs which was the kind of 1961 u.n convention so um i think then each country each kind of member state created their own version of it basically so in the united states you have one um i can what it's called another one that was in 1970 you have a kind of convention that came from which which from which the classification of cannabis and schedule one came from everybody committee and then of course uh president nixon are you talking that were they kind of it's it's uh and that was around the 70s right yeah so we have we have an equivalent in in the uk so for until two years ago in in the uk um cannabis was was schedule one like it was in like it is in the united states um in november 2018 or actually before that it was six months before that that changed cannabis was was re reclassified um as is often the case you know with with with these things um it became untenable because you know we had two cases very public cases of of young children with um with epilepsy that you know was intractable and so it didn't respond to you know anti-seizure medication um and these children both had left the uk they became medical cannabis refugees one one was in in holland another one was in canada um and but they wanted to come home and if they if they came home their medication and they um would be confiscated basically so it kind of forced our um our politicians into acknowledging because basically you know as soon as these children stop taking their medication their seizures would come back and actually those politicians were going to be responsible in some way if one of these children you know passed away or something terrible happened and that doesn't look terribly good so thankfully um they um you know actually got some balls um excuse my my language but because this you know there's been on the table before with um where theresa may then went on to become our prime minister but she she had you know that there was something called the barnes report which was a cross-party report on cannabis with doctors and patients and scientists but she still was sticking to that schedule one there's there is no evidence um you know only sort of liable for abuse and and et cetera et cetera so thankfully this the the home secretary in 2018 you know actually acknowledge actually you know this is unindisputable these children their seizures are reduced so we're going to have to change the scheduling which kind of brought about the the gradual process which culminated in 2018 of um of the legalization of medical cannabis so then at that point you know we were as long you know with other countries like canada we were no longer following that kind of un scheduling which actually is just being changed you know last week but it's been taken out of of schedule four so um yes so yeah you know that last week it was uh you know it was um the the kind of the um um committee for narcotic drugs had uh decided to thankfully you know acknowledge that actually there is evidence of yeah of um or therapeutic benefits you know that that's that's what really brought i guess the walls down because i think they were so anti cannabis at the thc level which in my opinion is needed to fight cancer and i think in and even in epileptic children minutes amount you can give cbd yes it'll work add a little thc we found has really dropped this yeah i mean this was the case with these two children i mean um just cbd wasn't enough um and so when they actually left the uk for this period of time they had a little bit of thc and and you know that was enough to to pretty much reduce their seizures to zero and so but that that little bit of thc at the time was illegal completely illegal in in the uk so that's what forced the change and that's what unfortunately that's what happened uh yesterday unfortunately the the children pediatric epilepsy is what really brought uh cbd to the market over here and so you had a lot of cbd only states and that's what again brought the stigma down and started working and it was unfortunate i worked with families that had two children one had a seizure disorder one had cancer they lived in a cbd only state where cancer was not a qualified condition and so unfortunately their cancer child was an illegal patient using illegal narcotic while this the seizure patient was a legal part you know getting legal medic i mean it was just it's it's it's backwards and um i know it is was it is it in the uk or was is that all over europe where they just re-passed it to to mirror our 0.3 because your legal limit for thc for a while was 0.2 correct it was and that that's kind of was the legal definition of hemp basically um so that's now being changed to 0.3 i think there is um a move because in switzerland for example it you can have one percent um thc um so there is a a move i know the um european industrial hemp association are you know putting together i think they're doing kind of toxicology reports and different kind of you know studies to show what our safe levels of thc so you know what i think what the sort of the main thing with increasing it to 0.3 percent meant that now you have for farmers there are and for producers cbd producers you've got more options of strains basically or varieties of cultivars i think that's a proper word isn't that of of hemp so it just it just gives more more options really um for actually getting kind of cbd rich um products um so yeah so that's from the uk or is that being uh uh you know what i mean in in the uk uh there is this absurd situation um that um farmers if they're hemp farmers it's okay to grow hemp i think probably you have to have a license i spent you can use the stalks you can use the seeds but you cannot use the the flowering tops so um so this you know in the uk there's this uh huge cbd market and god so many cbd companies you know that's one of the reasons why i wrote the book it's like they're all like saying oh yes the best quality top best we're here cbd in the world you know but actually what's interesting is because they can't you know they can't get it from from from um uk growing hemp they import it from european um hemp farmers or suppliers and producers or sometimes north american as well and basically uh that you know it's kind of it's it's white labeling really um and so you know all these different all these different uh uk cbd companies are essentially selling you know about five different types of products and just sticking their labels on them so um but it's kind of you know i really hope for hemp farmers that that that will change it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever you know i get a lot of uh over the years i've worked with a lot of uh um uh uk residents patients as well and you know when they hear stories which are happening over here with success you know this is you know the internet journalists like yourself sharing stories you know you want to try it and i i think it's it's it's tough when a patient even here in the county in the united states a lot of them become cannabis refugees i shared you know it's not the easiest thing to leave your family your homes your church your community your doctors go and see if this works it's not a one-size-fits-all it doesn't work for everybody so before you uproot your family i always tell them take a two-week vacation if you're able to try it see if it works then then go back but i share an into many of the is brit a common word can i call them brits you could call us brits that's fine yeah but a lot of the brits that i speak to on a regular basis it blows their minds when i say you know there is a pharmaceutical company in your country called gw pharmaceutical they said yeah i've never heard of it does gw this has been over the last few years maybe they're they're making more ways but are they not a household name over there no no um because the the you know the the approved pharmaceutical cannabinoid based drugs well there's two obviously there's sativex which is which i think has a different name in the united states but it's there it's it's still the same so you have okay i thought it was like nabanols or something yeah so anyway so that's a you know kind of one-to-one ratio thc and cbd but it's it's only prescribed in uh spasticity uh and pain in multiple sclerosis and for a while because it was really expensive and remember in the uk we have uh the national health service which you know yay yay um that's that's the same you know publicly funded uh free um health care um but you know it's it's uh an order for our national health service to approve a drug it has to be both um effective for what it's treating but also cost-effective and at the time or for many years um sativex was approved as a you know pharmaceutical drug but it was too expensive to be prescribed by our nhs um that changed recently so you know as i saw talking about before you know since 2018 that you know there has been you know medical cannabis is is now legal and this is something important for you know your your listeners and viewers in the united in the united kingdom to to to know that um so so yes after effects there are ms patients are now being prescribed side effects um epidialx which is the kind of purified cbd for in the uk it's just for dravet syndrome and lennox gestalt which are these you know very kind of catastrophic um and rare types of pediatric epilepsy but what what's happened basically because it's you know it's very very uh um narrow uh and very sm you know few cases or few um conditions where um these where cannabis can be prescribed through the nhs um there's been a whole kind of like two-tier so we've got um private medical cannabis clinics that have opened up and there's maybe i think there's about four or five now that have opened and um and initially because of various kind of supply chain difficulties and it was you know there was a lot of um kind of i guess fear with regulators about what this was going to lead to you know medical cannabis being available initially for patients a prescription and maybe this is normal in the us i don't know but you know patients are paying like kind of two thousand pounds so that's like three thousand um how many that would be would that be one thousand five hundred dollars u.s yeah yeah so about yeah um a month for the medication and then maybe like kind of uh 150 for a consultation um so that was that was when things kind of first first started and the prices have come down and i think there will be a point because actually in the united kingdom it's estimated there are about 1.4 million people who are using cannas medicinally the majority of which are getting it from the black markets um so um you know for many you know obviously if your medication from your doctor was working you'd rather do that right you don't want to have to kind of go and find a dealer or whatever it's not your kind of first choice but um for a lot of patients you know initially when there was this legalization it was very prohibitively expensive with it being 2.75 milligrams of thc 2.75 milligrams cbd people just said over here people the the consumer over in america um seeing all the studies of gw pharmaceutical side effects they said so everyone started making one-to-one ratios over here and so yeah and having success not only with ms patients but with other and then epidiolex came out and i and my my thought and you tell me as you as a journalist my thought is okay they missed the boat over here they replicated the 2.75 milligrams of each and so the us government said okay with gw pharmaceutical this is just my mindset is okay let's try something else we'll bring your epidiolex over here we'll reschedule it now it's available for prescription insurance not all but some insurance will cover it and you can pick it up at our local pharmacy um if you want and so now that i think that's where they're making all their money because i know for a while gw was not making any money and they're doing a good amazing thing um and i have friends that their daughter is um autistic and and i introduced them to cannabis about four years ago with success but different uh cultivars you know i can you and i can have the same bottle we buy it and then two months later we buy the same exact bottle and it's a different thing because of you know hopefully one day it'll get that point where it's the same every single time like you would with a pharmaceutical tylenol or something um and they're they're um neurologists they they get eegs and they said i'm not seeing this i don't feel a success and they say well there's a product called uh epidiolex how about prescribing and the doctor here knew at ucla knew nothing about it so they've been on it for a good year and a half now with success okay that's interesting are you are you seeing that is where i was going with that um yeah i mean is it available over there it episodes is available but just for um lenitz gestalt and gervais um to be honest for um it's interesting that that this um patient that you're talking about has had success with just cbd because to be honest i've heard from other mums really because often these are you know kind of more severe mums of children with more kind of severe types of um autism who may be non-verbal or you know have those kind of self-injurious behavior and i you know i've heard more on more than one occasion actually the kind of high cbd strains have actually kind of made it worse or kind of made them more hyperactive or and actually they kind of needed that bit of bit of thc um in the uk i think there you know there are patients with these particular conditions who have been prescribed through our nhs epidialx um otherwise you know we've got these private clinics who are prescribing unlicensed drugs so these are more than kind of you know your bedra cam products or you know the kind of uh that haven't been through the clinical trials etc but they are standardized gnp at um you know they're standardized uh products but um they're not products that are sort of nhs doctors would feel um confident prescribing because for them there's not the evidence everything has to be evidence-based um what's interesting in the uk you know we're talking about this before you know at least they can actually prescribe it you know as i say this idea that we have everything great and rosy in the united states it's you know i don't think in the uk people realize that actually you can you know doctors can't prescribe they can make recommendations and then you have to kind of send your patient off to a dispensary right or you know somewhere and they speak to a bud tender what have you so you know it's it's not perfect in the uk because here is only um consultants essentially that can prescribe um so what you've got are these private clinics where you've you've got uh uh pain consultants who you know who top of their field and and you know they're maybe actually uh i don't know sort of heads of the pain society or what have you or and also you have psychiatrists and pediatric neurologists that kind of thing but they're new to cannabis they're new they've never done it before so they're having to get trained um and learn about the endocannabinoid system and then so they're kind of starting from zero so it's not i think what what is kind of i suppose limited here at the moment is there's very much a focus on thc and cbd so um i think that's kind of all doctors can get their heads around um and there's no anything minor cannabinoids or terpenes because actually you know these kind of standardized products they don't really say what else is in them i mean i'm not saying there's like you know you know chemical i don't know mold or anything like that but they don't say what are the minor cannabinoids what are the terpenes so it's sort of i don't know it still feels quite um quite crude in a way but it's better than nothing for sure and the prices are coming down so there will be a point approaching if not already where for certain patients who you know who um perhaps don't you need that need the kind of massive amounts of massive of milligrams um every day that they're spending possibly less a month than they would be if they're going to the black market and they're under the care of you know of of a consultant which i think that's hugely important in otherwise what are you doing you're just i mean i know you know with cannabis you're you know up titrating you're listening to your body etc but you kind of need to know is this going is there going to be some interaction with my prescribed medication you know that that kind of stuff is really really important someone who's looking after your care and that's something that i share all the time it's not one size fits all you should look at age weight current health condition stage of ailment or whatever you're battling and drug to drug interactions because we've had you know uh patients that have never tried cannabis they're taking you know neuropathy patients for diabetes or cancer and they're taking their oxycodone you know four or five a day like you and i would take a breath in and they try two milligrams of cannabis and they are stoned out of their mind climbing the wall and they said you know what i'll never do cannabis again i said no you're mixing them just like you wouldn't you know you have alcohol with that and so uh give it a try but education like this i think educating um and that's what we pride on at least united pace group we've always come in education first um we've done you know chris and i were big into conferences and we'd had all of our conferences were credited for medical professionals cme continuing verification and so we would have um 85 of our attendees were medical professionals not only here in the us but around the world that knew nothing about cannabis and wanted to learn yes so and they would get they would get credits for that and so i just think what you're doing as a journalist and others out there of uh and i always use analogy of throwing a pebble in the pond and seeing the ripple effect of education going out and and sharing stories and seeing patients share stories to like mums as you're saying because my friend you know with her daughter she is her that's her number one advocate and she educated the ucla doctor okay if you don't want us to go down to our local dispensary and get this thing how about prescribing what are you talking about you know nothing about epidialex if you want to prescribe it and so last week actually about 10 days ago they had the you know they do about three eegs a year and they did see some drop in the seizures with that and so the doctor was pleasantly surprised and i'm certain that doctor will go um do some more research on that and you were saying you were going to say something sorry mary no i was going to say i mean it i think it's the cannabis movement worldwide is is patient-led yeah um and that is you know fantastic so exactly i think you know the the a mother's love you know in so many instances we've seen you know obviously a father also loves their child but it seems to be it seems to be mothers who just push this movement along but you know the kind of flip side of the coin is that certainly i don't know in the uk patient experts um tend to kind of uh yeah not always get a very sort of warm reception from doctors because doctors don't like their patient to know more than they do and and you know and that's i've i really feel for patients in in that situation i mean it's you know sometimes with um i always think about these these children with with epilepsy and their neurologists within the nhs soon as they hear that they're going to a private clinic and you know they're under the care of a specialist they they no longer want to have them as patients you know it's it's it's they don't want to there's this kind of resistance why if you if you're a doctor why haven't you have why don't you have this curiosity when you see patients getting better aren't you like how on a set that's like the fourth patient who um i was you know oncologist for example you know there's so many patients you know again in the uk it's it's not um a condition that can be prescribed cannabis legally and so you know like anywhere around the world there are thousands of patients who you know through facebook groups etc you've got a community and they're you know medicating etc but you know when you're an oncologist and you've seen a series of patients who say oh by the way i'm taking cannabis and those patients you know their their outcome far exceeds the norm wouldn't you kind of ask yourself come on a second i need to investigate this and i think some do i mean there was an amazing case i love this story of them this gentleman this is in the uk um i think he had lung cancer and he was you know he's in his 80s he decided not to have any chemo or radiotherapy or anything like that because he just you know wanted to sort of enjoy what he had left and he just sort of got some cbd you know randomly chose some and wasn't taking very high doses actually um and then when he went back to have an appointment with his doctor his oncologist um x amount of months later and he had some tests what have you they're like the tumor had practically disappeared and they're like what have you been doing and it's you know have you changed anything and he's like well i just started taking it but that that oncologist did actually write a paper about it you know so um so i think i think one you just have to hope and i you know i encourage patients i know it's you know scary because you know you oncologists and consultants are these kind of authority figures and there's always this fear that they're gonna you know they're gonna sort of threaten not to you know give you the treatment if you say reveal that you're that you are using cannabis but but you know please do say please do say um because you know little by little that kind of penny starts to drop and i think you know there's a point where you know it's it's uh it's a tipping point basically tipping points for sure and that's something that i share with patients all over the world is even if you live in a legal state or legal country uh or legal state or legal country it's not illegal to ask the question ask the question this is your health and if there's another option hey doctor have you heard of this have you know share share these cases and we've had doctors here that work for major cancer institutions that have called us and said you know i made a promise to my patient that i do some research can you help me and and i applaud those doctors because they're you know not too many of those are out there but it's you know the the the topic of cannabis is starting to uh diminish meaning the stigma even um other natural like you were talking about ayahuasca you know and and phyllis island that is another topic that's been around for thousands of years that people have kind of pushed away um but it's coming coming back now you know colorado recently passed a law uh oregon uh here in the states has passed a law and so um but education is is is what i pr what i love and you're talking about mums i can tell you there's some great dads out there and and and moms uh but my friend mike hyde his son cash was the first and youngest legal medical cannabis patient in the whole united states he was the pioneer and no one wanted to cover the story he beat cancer twice and he was four years old and uh cassie ended up passing because the laws changed in montana but he would share two families moms and dads listen if a sign said it said it's federally legal to go swimming in that water but your son's in there drowning he said you better believe i'm jumping in that water and so it meant a lot because uh i did i've done a lot with that family he's one of my best friends and but cashy passed and uh because of laws you know the laws were there in montana in their state and then they said up we made a mistake we opened the doors too early now you know and now it doesn't matter if you have hiccups you know our national tv station will oh boy cures hiccups with cannabis you know they'll talk about it but then it was too it wasn't ready they weren't ready and so um i don't want him to be forgotten i don't want uh anna's mother to be forgotten what was her name um jose was it jose just saying just saying of course uh my wife corrine to be forgotten i mean you know and so uh i mean if any of these stories help um this is why we continue doing this let's talk about your book and what you're doing yeah great i mean actually the the the case studies and the stories and the book are sort of my favorite part of the book honestly because it is about you know i mean there's you know i write about science there's a you know i kind of unpacked the science behind cbd in the end of cannabinoid system um i talk a lot about the research um you know the kind of potted history of uh of uh you know kind of cbd and hemp etc but it's it's the patient stories that that um that just bring the book to life really um yeah so you know without having to kind of cast the net too far i i spoke to different people and a mum of uh little boy with with autism who you know just eight days into into taking cbd had his kind of first conversation with his mum which was to tell her that his head didn't hurt anymore and he wasn't scared anymore you know it's like insane um and actually a very you know very dear friend of mine actually who um she's this amazing uh woman who works on a refugee camp in athens um was this kind of amazing force of nature so positive um but you know as you can imagine if you're working you know every day in a refugee camp um you start to get sort of um ptsd anxiety et cetera et cetera so she was she was um having having panic attacks and and yeah and kind of waking up in the middle of the night seeing the faces of of refugees that she couldn't help and all that kind of stuff and and she because she knew me cbd was was on her radar and she and she started taking it and and you know alongside you know she's a yoga practitioner and um because i think it has to be part of particularly an adult it has to be part of other stuff but it just it really you know it she's she she's no longer having panic attacks and you know she's kind of over a ptsd um but yeah just loads of stories like that and that and that's actually i was um sort of doing the research for the book and and interviewing people and you know i kind of record the the interviews and you know when you write an article or you know in this case a book you kind of you cut and paste the best bits you know like oh yeah i use that nice quote and then you kind of you know stitch it together in your own words and stuff but when i was listening back to to you know their their stories and their own words i was like damn these people need to have their own platform you know it's like it's not the same me just retelling their story um so i yeah beginning of of kind of covered lockdown i decided i was gonna you know launch my own uh podcast called yeah and i wanna i wanna say that so for those of you who've not uh and it wasn't in your bio and i apologize because i like sharing um others podcasts and okay out there and so i really so if you haven't had a chance there's some uh mary you do a great job first off but you have some incredible guests and i know a lot of them so i may have to reach out to a couple of you and say hey guys you know come on let me go but um but talk about that it's on it's on mary biles.com yeah or you know if wherever you listen to your podcast then you'll find cannabis voices yeah i mean it's you know it's a mixture of as i say patients and parents of of patients scientists i really you know i i'm a bit ashamed to say i barely scraped through my my kind of high school science exams but now i kind of find myself being a science writer essentially so but i'm fascinated by you know the the how it all works and and um and so you know when you're when i'm writing articles you kind of you know i now i don't i don't understand everything in a scientific paper but i can kind of pull out the salient points but i love to hear the stories behind it you know and so i really it's one of my favorite things to you know to speak to the scientist so you know the likes of christina i mentioned before manuel and greg gerdman who is brilliant on the end of cannabinoid system um ethan russo um yeah and and i just i just you know i love i'm i love hearing people's stories and and um and so that that's kind of that's what it's about really i mean sometimes i kind of tie them in if i'm doing something for project cbd um i you know again if i'm writing an article i just think it's really important you know if it's about i don't know alzheimer's or something that you not only do you go direct to the source and speak to to the scientists maybe it wouldn't quite be so possible with alzheimer's to speak to a patient but so you know i often you know if i'm writing a project um project cbd article i'll maybe use the interview in a podcast or something like that but good but no i really love it but also sort of getting back to the book it's um i think one of them from a practical point of view and i think this is the same for wherever you are in the world really be in europe or united states if you're someone who's like oh i'd really like to try cbd and then you kind of like you know type in google or whichever is your you know search engine of of your choice um and it's just you know it's like thousands and thousands of companies and products come up and and you know i used to sort of work a little bit in digital marketing so i know all the tricks that they play the kind of you know the search engine optimization the keywords and that kind of stuff so i know a lot of it is just you know yeah it's not great products but they just happen to be who has the most marketing dollars yeah exactly so so i kind of the book really uh if nothing else it's if someone like has in their little little hands and and and spend some time reading through the different steps of just kind of explaining you know the different types of products you know difference between whole plant broad spectrum the entourage effect all these different things and then you just follow the steps and hopefully by the end of it you'll get to a point of being able to buy a reliable product that you know is going to have the best chance of actually helping you in some way so so so it's kind of for me it's um it's a road map and it's been really gratifying because i've seen you know people have like i used it and now i've got my product and now you know and that that's that's kind of what what it's all about really well is it on audiobook as well uh i don't think so it's on it's it's in hardback at the moment um and it's also e-book so um if you're in the united states i know people have bought it in the u.s but it just takes a long time to get there because i i don't think they've sorted out the rights um for it to be kind of sold through amazon the us version but you can you can buy and it just will get shipped from from the united kingdom but i think you know if you're in europe it gets there again so much and harper's collins not not a shabby publishing company no thank you thank you yeah um question before we go too and i meant to ask you earlier um four americans going into the uk or the uh are coming that are they uh able to bring their medicine over there i get that i get that quite a bit and and uh you know i don't want to put anybody in jeopardy and and if you don't know the answer you know i don't know the answer actually i mean they'd have to they'd have to i mean that's the thing i mean maybe because in the you know in the united states it's it's whether they're kind of recommendation would be enough you know if you're coming through customs i would have to say you're looking for that i you know i've had patients i said boy you're talking about i think you said balls earlier because i've had a patient say i said you've got bigger balls than i do because they said i've gone through i've shown my recommendation and i've shown my product and i've gone through here at least okay but i said but what's going to stop that i make it through the the tsa which is the security here and i hand you my packet and you go off to the uk you know and so that's that's the part that i don't know a lot but anyway i'll do some research and i'll put in the in the links here um any closing words i don't know yes education education education and and for me you know what i i don't know i feel compelled to do the work that i'm doing and it's it's you know this is a kind of fundamental human right you know we have a human right to wellness when it when it's possible and and you know this plant is one tool that that can be used um and also for me it's it's also about defending the plant itself because i do fear for a time in the future where you know it's just going to be kind of i don't know synthetic isolated compounds and all the rest of it and and and we still won't be able to have access to this plant that we've been given you know so um so i you know i just i you know i think we just have to keep fighting and and uh and yeah informing ourselves and and trying to get the message out of the echo chamber because that's the thing it's like you know there's more information getting out but it's still you know sort of within the cannabis community although that is changing in the uk that is changing well you mentioned tools and i'm a big fan of tools uh it's it's you know uh what you put in your body sleep is important getting exercise being surrounded by good people love and then good products and so uh you can find that in the cbd book the essential guide to stevie deal mary biles i so appreciate your time and i know and there you are and i'll put a link i'll put a link to that as well um um on this podcast in our podcast go video of course without the glitches i'll see if i can edit those out but uh audio and we're like you located i think about 18 different channels then we do a transcript for the people oh that's good you want to read as well you can read my words as well it's really yeah and it was funny when you when you please use british spelling british media earlier when you said balls and i was thinking to

an explanation but here it is enjoy what up guys James here and today we're talking about vaping let's go so I got into vaping just because I wanted to try it out and it's a really cool hobby this is a smoke X proof it's a great little mod it looks really cool I've got a rebuildable deck atomizer inside the the prince tank this is a TF v12 prince tank check it out I'll do review I'll do all kinds of videos on that but today's video is on CBD so I started trying out CBD oils like contacted hemp pumps and they sent the ton of samples for me to try and to show you and I can tell you right now they are very good they don't have any weird earthy taste these are 75 milligrams but they go up to like four thousand milligrams which is just crazy and it's really cool because they also have gummies and just the plain additives in case you want to you know add to your own eliquid you can do that and they have a few other liked inter drops as well so hep hep bombs it's not just a liquids they have a ton of products definitely check them out in the link below after about two weeks of trying them all are you ready my favourite hemp bombs CBD he liquid flavor is crisp honeydew melon this stuff is very good I'm actually I've been vaping it the most and I'm gonna tell you right now they have a cookie flavor and then the melon is like right here for me like they're both pretty much right back to back and it yeah they vape very well sweet almost has a bubblegum flavor to it and the honeydew actually sticks out very very well and I'm gonna say this like I can vape this all day long I don't have any irritation and it's only 75 milligrams which is kind of low but if it was a higher dose you know because I'm just getting started that might put me to sleep really quick so 75 milligrams this tiny tiny tiny there's no THC there's no weird additives to it it's very good stuff high quality but I will say this the wild berry jam I wasn't a fan of okay kind of tasted kind of weird the watermelon was amazing the Kush what is it called exotic exotic watermelon cush that was incredible the Arctic spearmint blast that's kind of a good flavor but you know once you put it in your cotton it's always gonna taste like that so you really have to dedicate you know one tank to this but it's very very good my second favorite flavor is fresh farm strawberry milk I don't know how they pull it off but they do the milk is like super creamy and that's just a very very good blend so there's there's a ton of options there's you know they have the cookie flavor which I also love and so you know they have dessert flavors fruit flavors and even spearmint so if you have like even a just an interest at all I think hep balms is a great place to start again tin sure's gummies they have a liquid additives so my one of my favorite flavors is cheery cheery hose and so I don't have the additive but I could just put a few drops in here and that would make it you know a great all day solution so definitely check out hemp bombs there's a great coupon code below where you can use my coupon code and if you guys have any questions let me know it kind of just makes me kind of tired a little bit it's kind of a relaxing it's great when I'm watching TV if you had a higher dose that might actually be more beneficial depending on what you you know kind of like what are you what you're doing it for some athletes they do it for muscle relaxation some people do it for sleep and you know instead of doing sleeping medication they can just vape it or do drops I think vaping might be better for sleep because it affects you quicker where's the drops I've heard kind of take longer to absorb into your cells but it's all good it's all really good I mean I think CBD is kind of it's really popular right now for a very very good reason as you can see it vapes are very very well and again Chris probably do mountain is my favorite so definitely check the link below where you can get more information and again if you guys have any questions let me know and also let me know have you tried vaping before because it's very very different than what I thought it would be it's actually pretty fun so thank you guys for watching and have a great day", "eW7Ilupd6H0": "I sent Lazarus Naturals to a lab to see if it's real now Lazarus isn't the biggest CBD company but if you go online into any CBD a community like go and reddit you would think that this is the most popular brand why well I bought this bottle of 750 milligrams of CBD for only $32 that's extremely cheap but is it too good to be true let's see the lab results they claim 750 milligrams of CBD and we found 794 milligrams of CBD or 5.8 percent no it's an accuracy it's excellent look at all those other cannabinoids 905 milligrams of total cannabinoids Wow we'll break that down THC 30 milligrams of CBC and 37 milligrams of CBG you guys know I'm a fan of Bluebird botanicals this blows them out the water with the CBG it's more than anything I've tested that's so much CBC - right I was really surprised by this one the CBC and CBG those are the cannabinoids and Charlotte's Web they might be the secret sauce to that very popular brand and I think it might have something to do with all the positive research and positive reviews for that strain and the various conditions possibly people like it the official lab test is here it's just one test and I don't claim the law test this way but it's completely independent and I promise you that I have nothing to do with this company or currently any CBD company the price for sense flat per milligram of CBD if you look at all my tests 15 cents is about average 4 cents is the cheapest out of all of them I tested not only that it goes down to 3 point 5 cents per milligram of total cannabinoids not only that you buy the larger bottles of CBD that they offer and the price per milligram of CBD drops to 3 Sen do you know what this mean not only that I sound like a damn commercial right now but you guys can see my industry report I've got the reports for everything I review they offer veterans disabled and low-income individuals up to 60% off who qualifies of course I don't I don't think they give every single person that discount Wow a little hard never but I really do appreciate they do this for people in need and they've got to be losing money doing this but the the regular price is insane - it's just it's it's cheap ingredients just hemp hemp seed oil and coconut oil beautiful I would be a little disappointed if they added sugar whatever other weird ingredients CBD companies tend to put in their oils this is the milliliter breakdown for dose I would caution this is this is potent you don't want a full dose of this your first go around look at the THC two milligrams of THC that's a lot research shows that high effects can start at two milligrams and sensitive individuals is you high and obviously it's enough to risk a failed drug test some people start off at five milligrams of CBD this is a 50 milligram dose just be aware of what you get into Wow welcome to the 700 club kid Lazarus is a company out of Seattle they've been around since 2014 and remember CBD just became legal at the end of 2018 so they're kind of like vets in this industry let me get the bat out of the way I did find one negative investigation by NBC that found Lazarus natural product had a high levels of lead however just looking at the product in this news piece I was like does that look like Lazarus Naturals label not really it looked like the label was printed on a home computer and deteriorating it didn't look like what I bought they bought it off of Groupon never do that Lazarus came out later and said that the product they tested was counterfeit which is actually a big one group on now I report everything that I find to be transparent but I think NBC's report was just negligent why would you buy something on Groupon and then publish those results but it should caution you that there are lots of fake CBD products out there and you need to buy from legitimate retailers I also don't like that they sell on Amazon because you need to be sneaky and say that you're just hemp oil basically to hide the fact that your product has CBD but the biggest companies are now doing this so what are you gonna do the good nbc6 investigators tested Lazarus and found that they were one of the only companies they tested to have accurate amounts of CBD Wow now you have my tests my independent tests and theirs to confirm its accurate which is good it's good to have multiple sources that's it that's the review this is the cheapest it has the most CBD cbc CBG they're good to vets and low-income people hit that subscribe button and i'll see you

advised that the information in this podcast is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as medical advice before making a health decision please consult a practicing medical professional thank you for your attention and enjoy today's episode what is up cooties and terms of the internet my name is Tony and you're listening to hemp nerd the podcast that helps you know your cannabis and cannabinoids so you can get reliable therapeutic results now in today's particular episode we're actually going to do it something a bit different from the previous episodes in regards to the topic and we're going to be answering the question can you take CBD oil with SSRI antidepressants so we're going to look at this question because I believe there is an underlining concern with people who actually do pose this question and I personally believe that underlining concern is that whether it is actually safe or not to take CBD oil with SSRI antidepressants so that's what we're going to be looking at today now as you know in order for us to do that the the ritual or the tradition around here with the hemp nerd podcast is to firstly understand I guess the problem but in today's particular episode we're going to be understanding what an SSRI antidepressant actually is so what is an SSRI antidepressant well an SSRI antidepressant or just called an SSRI and SSRI is a pharmaceutical drug to prescribe to patients with depression and/or anxiety the way SSRIs work is that they increase the serotonin levels in your brain by blocking them from being reabsorbed into your nerve cells the letter's SSRI stand for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor so serotonin is a chemical messenger or a neurotransmitter that carries signals between your nerve cells or neurons the most common antidepressants available in the market or SSRI antidepressants available in the market are celexa lexapro Prozac Paxil or taxi I think I'm saying that correctly Zoloft and vibart and they all have I'm saying that one correctly is all V bird vibrate not sure how I'm saying that correctly or not however they have you know active ingredients in there that you know that actually make the SSRI do the job that it's supposed to be doing one common line is settle in another one is paroxetine flu or XE time and I can't pronounce the other two site this site elope Ram an exciter lope Ram I think that's how you say them and villas Odone Aviles Oh done I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correct either but basically that's on my blog so if you actually want to read what these are you can find them on Hefner Co under the same title today's podcast now why is serotonin selected to be made more available in your brain using obviously SSRI antidepressants well firstly you have seven major chemical messengers or seven major neurotransmitters that do the majority of the work they are dopamine norepinephrine serotonin histamine gamma amino butyric acid or GABA glutamate acetate I : oh yeah and that's the last one acid acetic : is the last one they all have unique and important functions however serotonin is selected because it helps regulate your mood social behavior appetite and digestion sleep memory and your sexual function so the idea behind SSRIs is that it is more if sorry the idea is that if there is more serotonin made available in your brain then it may improve the transmission of messages between nerve cells regarding treatment for depression and anxiety the idea that the messages that regulate mood and social behavior will have a higher likelihood of transmission that is why SSR that is why serotonin in an SSRI and depressant is actually targeted to be made more available because they believe if obviously if there's more serotonin then there is a higher likelihood of of the serotonin being transmitted in especially in regards to managing your mood or regulating your mood that's the better word there now what's the problem with SSRI antidepressants or SSRIs now on paper you'd think an SSRI antidepressant would deliver the goods regarding the treatment of depression and anxiety however scientists aren't sure whether adding SSRIs to your bloodstream actually increases the amount of serotonin a new brain plus multiples patients state that SSRI and presents are not sure fixed for depression and/or anxiety and there is no actual way of measuring the amount of serotonin in your brain and a bigger problem that exists with SSRIs in my personal opinion is that they come with a host of unwanted side effects now the list of unwanted side effects include nausea and vomiting headaches drowsiness and dizziness nervousness agitation and restlessness insomnia dry mouth diarrhea weight loss or weight gain and sexual dysfunction in forms of erectile orgasm and arousal dysfunction now it's well known and documented in the medical community that people under the age of 25 tend to experience suicidal thoughts when taking SSRIs so that's on top of everything else they're going to experience it's commonly advised that anyone on SSRIs must be watched closely for unusual behavior and worsening depression it's also known that stopping SSRI medication will result in withdrawal symptoms such as nausea dizziness lethargy flu-like symptoms and a general feeling of an easiness look side notes every time I see flu-like symptoms I mean that at the time of recording this it's 20/20 okay and of course one of the big highlights of 20/20 has been covered 19 or the the corona virus on the moment and you know the symptoms there is everyone knows flu-like symptoms so every time I see flu-like symptoms I'm thinking covered 19 but then again I'm also thinking and this is the same thing that happened in the last episode is this with polymyalgia one of the one of the symptoms was flu-like symptoms and I posed the question again what if you know what if here's another scenario what if here's someone who was on SSRIs and you started to you basically stopped taking SSRIs because obviously you're in isolation and you started experiencing withdrawal symptoms and one of those withdrawal symptoms were flu-like symptoms and then you obviously go try and actually get in front of a doctor or maybe that that's enough to convince you if you're unaware here's this - two scenarios one is you're unaware that flu likes could be one of them withdrawal symptoms that you experience and then you convince yourself that you've got covered 19 and you should be tested on the other side of the spectrum the the other scenario is maybe try and go see your pharmacist or you go try and see a doctor and say look I've been withdrawing from SSRIs hopefully they're you know they're they equipped with the knowledge to know that you know one of the withdrawal symptoms of SSRIs is flu-like symptoms but if they're not then they could presume that you might have covered 19 so you actually should go through a test it's just a thought okay I'm not sure if this is what's actually going on I'm not saying this is actually what's going on but it's just a thought you know when I saw and even when I was doing my research and I saw that flu-like symptoms was one of the withdraws anyway let's stick with the topic now this combination of problems you know the withdrawal symptoms the anyone under 25 having suicidal thoughts because of SSRIs and the fact that there's a host of unwanted side effects when you do take them and also the fact that scientists are unaware that oh no they're unsure not unaware they're unsure that actually adding SSRIs to your blood stream increases the amount of serotonin in your brain so the combination of all these problems right is making people turn to cannabis as a possible solution all right a possible solution one overwhelming question people want an answer to is whether you can actually take CBD oil with SSRI antidepressants and on a side note the reason they're asking this question I mean they want to know if it's safe but the real reason they're asking this question is because they actually want people there's an overwhelming amount of people that I've seen in in so many forms Facebook groups read it on Quora and and little little forums unlike little forums here and there will be people are basically trying to get off antidepressants they're trying to get off their SSRIs and they're looking to CBD oil as the possible solution to help them do that in the smoothest way possible so that's why this question is really being posed so is it safe to take CBD oil with SSRIs the main concern again in people's mind is where the CBD oil will cause any negative interactions when taken with SSRI the medical community is split as to whether it is safe or not to do so on one side you've got anti cannabis doctors posing the argument that because SSRIs and cannabis both have psychoactive effects taking them together may cause some unwanted reactions like induced panic attacks I'm sorry induced panic attacks for example and this is for someone let's say with anxiety so you don't the the the argument that anti cannabis doctors are presenting is that you know if you get if you induce a panic attack you don't know if that's actually coming from the SSRI or the cannabis you know if what's actually inducing that panic attack or inducing that anxiety on the other side you've got Pro cannabis doctors that's stating that both CBD and THC are safe to take with SSRI antidepressants the key to success being strategic and careful application based on what these doctors are saying the pro cannabis doctors which I'm more leaning towards and by now I'm sure you can tell on pro cannabis however mostly looking to see what are the most practical useful ways to actually incorporate this in a way that it can provide you know because the whole goal here is to provide reliable therapeutic results with cannabis and so I'm looking into ways we can actually do that by researching what the doctors the pro cannabis doctors are finding so the strategy with pro cannabis doctors point to is something called micro dosing so micro dosing is a practice of taking the minimum minimal amount of a given substance in this case cannabis to achieve your desired results or effects with respect to CBD oil people consume very small amounts throughout the day to achieve results such as reduced anxiety and depression and pain relief effects okay so that's what micro dosing is enabling people to do and due to the doses being as low as 2 to 3 milligrams per serve which is very low micro dosing enables people to experience the benefits of cannabinoids present in full-spectrum CBD products without getting all feeling high so if you don't know a full-spectrum CDP CBD product is a product that also contains THC so there with micro dosing so what I'm saying there with micro dosing with doses can be as low as 2 to 3 milligrams per serve you can take see full spectrum CD products which do have THC within them and not feel or get high in any way shape or form now depending on your biochemical makeup this is something interesting I found depending on your bio bio chemical makeup the average optimum micro dosing range is between 3 to 10 milligrams of full-spectrum CBD so it depends on it depends on you it depends on your biochemical makeup it depends on your body it depends on what's running within your body at the time as well what you're doing with your body your lifestyle choices and everything that contributes to who you are at the moment but what that range is that micro dosing range where people are finding they can get results without getting high so to speak is our and that's if there is THC present within your cannabis space product because they are some that aren't that do not have THC at all and those are called either broad spectrum products or broad spectrum CBD products or CBD isolate products but however if you are looking at a full spectrum product yeah it's around the 3 to 10 milligram range some people less some people more I'm however when you're starting out which I'm going to get to it's good to start with in the 2 to 3 milligram range and then increase from there over time to see where your you know your happy place is now micro dosing is the strategy however you still need to be careful with your approach okay so what Pro cannabis doctors generally recommend is to start low and move slow alright I'll say that again they recommend to start low so that's the 2 to 3 milligram range and then stop and then move slow start low and move slow the moving slow part means increasing your dose slightly every couple of days while paying very close attention to your effects for example if you start to feel lethargic or dizzy after a dose increase then you should reduce your dose slightly and stay at the reduced dosage for a few days before attempting an increase again so you start you start low you increase every couple of days or so and then when you notice that you're getting undesired effects or undesired results then you reduce it slightly see what your effects are if that's a good place a happy place stay there don't reduce any further for example and see what affects what results you're getting and then increase like depending obviously on what condition you're dealing with but in this particular episode were obviously talking about you know depression and anxiety because we're looking at SSRI antidepressants because that's what they use for no micro dosing Academy space product is highly highly recommended by Pro cannabis doctors like everywhere I go that's what they that's what they recommend is there's not one who has not said no to this this is because there is scientific and anecdotal evidence that shows that heavy cannabis use can lead to worsening symptoms of depression and anxiety so for example in a 2014 clinical study researchers set out to investigate the effects of Herot heavy marijuana use in substance abusers versus a control group the researchers found that the brains of marijuana abusers became less sensitive to dopamine over time less sensitivity to dopamine makes you detached and apathetic which are two symptoms of depression dopamine is a chemical messenger or a neurotransmitter that sends signals between your nerves cells relating to reward pleasure focus and pain in another example at 2007 2007 rodent model study set out to investigate the effects of cannabis at low and high doses in rats the study found that THC boosted serotonin levels at low doses however at high doses THC had the opposite effect now can you take or sorry can taking CBD oil with SSRIs increase the risk of something called serotonin syndrome so can it increase your risk of getting serotonin syndrome pro cannabis doctors note that both THC and CBD can obstruct the metabolism of SSRI antidepressants obstructing the metabolism of SSRI drugs can lead to an extremely high level of SSRI serum present in your body the result of this is a condition called serotonin syndrome this is where there is too much serotonin made available in your system having too much serotonin in your system causes on wanton bodily effects such as agitation and confusion dilated pupils headaches nausea and vomiting diarrhea rapid heart rate muscle twitching and tremors heavy sweating and changes in blood pressure now according to dr. Richard Kim so this is one really interesting quote I found by a medical professional Pro cannabis medical professional it's states that the cytochrome p450 or p450 accounts for 70 to 80 percent of the enzymes involved in drug clearance making it the most important system for drug metabolism so cytochrome p450 is at the moments perceived as the most important system for drag drug metabolism in your body both THC and CBD are competitive inhibitors of three different enzymes in the cytochrome p450 system so of which I involved in the metabolism of SSRIs so two out of the three where is that two out of the three enzymes that metabolize SSRIs compete with THC and CBD as well all right to be metabolized so if you're taking THC and CBD this is my understanding so far if you take teaching and CVD with SSRIs I mean at the same time which I wouldn't do I would start with one then move to the other after some time then you're inhibiting your system from actually be giving it a chance to actually break down SSRIs this means that CB and THC are competing for the same receptors as is the SSRI which is basically what I said but he said it more eloquently so when an SSRI is taking concurrently with CBD and OTC the SSRI serum concentration could possibly rise since CBD is competing for the same receptors for metabolism which may lead to serotonin syndrome I hope that makes sense so fortunately dr. Kim also mentions that if you're concerned about getting serotonin syndrome it would take an extremely high amount of C and or THC to actually produce serotonin syndrome yet preventing serotonin syndrome is in the slightest of care as possible is another reason why micro dosing is highly recommended so the way I look at this is micro dosing is the strategy and then being careful is obviously the approach another layer of you know caroled add to this if you listen to obvious if you're listening and hear in the situation where considering whether you should take CBD oil with antidepressants is I would start with the seek whatever CBD oil you decided to go without start with that our micro dose that and before taking my if I was taking SSRIs before taking my SSRI antidepressants so maybe I'll give a window of about an hour to to you know I think that's I think an hour is good enough give it about an hour see allow the my enzymes to metabolize the CBD and and all the THC and then once that happens if I feel the need to take SSRIs because I haven't been prescribed with them so I'm not sure if if I have to take it as I as I feel I have to take it as a course but but I'm presuming I have to take it as I feel because if I don't feel the need why would I take it if my by you know my brain my hippocampus is helping me manage my mood but enough serotonin sending messages of mood regulation very well why would I need know why would I need to take SSRIs in that case but let's say the need is there then I'll give it about an hour maximum about two hours to then take the SSRIs so they can also metabolize but if I'm finding that I'm getting results with CBD whether that's a full spectrum my broad spectrum CBD solution or product then I would not this is my personal opinion of course I'm not a doctor more telling you what to do but in my personal opinion I wouldn't even touch the SSRIs if I was getting results with CBD products and of course I'll be consulting with my doctor and letting them know that this is exactly what I'm doing which is a perfect segue to my final thoughts here so based on my research so far alright in this topic I personally believe it is say you take CBD oil with SSRI antidepressants not at the same time though space it out I would space it out and I would mic reduce my CBD because I don't know this is presuming you don't know watch a tolerance levels on your biochemical makeup but still I still feel that it's safe regardless but the smart ways to space space off the takes and mic reduce the CBD I would and this is me trading with caution because too much of anything including something as good as CBD to but we all know it's too much of anything could and may or will have adverse effects or adverse side effects it goes without saying that you should seek and work with a pro cannabis doctor like I'm gonna stress this I guess until the day I die although until I can't stress it anymore which would be the day that I die but I would work with the pro cannabis doctor if we don't have one already or go looking for one because you know mixing medications is not a child's play you know it's something to take seriously because you're actually messing with the biochemical makeup of your body even when you're just taking regular medication you're changing the the kept the biochemical makeup in your body even when you take regular medication even when you're drinking water you're having citrus foods things are happening in there that we don't understand and it's best to work with the doctor who actually understands what's going on so finally a pro cannabis doctor secondly I would actually seek out products so this on the product side of thing I would actually seek out products that have been regulated and tested so you can be confident that you are taking a clean and safe product remember to start low and slow if you're incorporating cannabis into your SSRI medication regimen monitor and documentary results with your doctor so you can make the appropriate adjustments where necessary leaving zero room for guesswork and the simplest way to do this is to journal journal the type of the type of the form of cannabis you're using or CBD oil your dosage amounts each day and how often you consume them each day each day or during the course of the day and share your results with your doctor and keep in mind as well that CBD oil is no a one-size-fits-all solution I know it is the rave at the moment amongst a few other things but it's one of the big topics at the moment that everyone is trying to get into hopefully or for the right reasons but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution what may work for your friend or a colleague or a family member may not work for you which is perfectly fine it's okay cuz everyone's to some level everyone's different though or so all the same you just need to figure out what it's actually going to work for you so you kind of need to investigate yourself it's all speak so I hope this podcast was helpful I hope it was insightful and on a practical level and look if this anything that I missed anything that I should have mentioned anything that I should have brought up please let me know by going to the blog Hampton or Co and check under the comment section of these things that the blog talked with the exact same typos can you take CBD oil with SSRI antidepressants and let me know if there's anything I missed I'll be more than happy to look at the thing that I miss and make any necessary updates to so we're all on the same page however look if you want any of the references any of the links or any of the information this what I'm trying to say any of the information that I referenced in today's podcast or bead reference links are available available on hemp nurko again that is hemp nerd comb the blog post title is can you take CBD oil with SSRI antidepressants and right at the bottom there you're gonna find all the reference links to all the pieces of information than I had to read and research to come up with today's piece of content so that is pretty much it for today thank you for tuning in to the hemp nerd podcast I truly appreciate it take care stay safe and I'll catch you on the next episode of the hemp nerd podcast peace you [Music]", "5DoDLJ9Jhmg": "in this video I'm going to tell you\neverything you need to know about CBD oil CBD oil can help with a very wide range\nof things it's famous for treating anxiety stress depression epilepsy pain\nand a lot of other things I have tried a lot of supplements to treat my own\nanxiety but found nothing as effective as CBD oil CBD can be taken in different\nways the most common ones are vaping eating and sublingual which means under\nyour tongue each way of usage has its own pros and cons so find out which one\nyou like the most yourself me myself I prefer to use its sibling well since\nit's one of the most purest quickest easiest cheapest and effective ways\nthere are two different types of CBD these are called isolated and\nfull-spectrum the CBD plant contains around 100 cannabinoids isolated means\nit contains only one of them pure CBD with no other components full spectrum\nmeans it contains all of the cannabinoids my advice is to go for a\nfull spectrum full spectrum provides a lot more and way stronger health\nbenefits than just isolated because all the components work together like a\nfootball team creating something like a superpower called the entourage effect\nout of the many cannabinoids the two most famous ones are CBD and THC full\nspectrum also contains a very little bit of THC but you cannot get high from it\nthe amount of THC is less than 0.1% which is way too low to get you high and\nthere is way more CBD in it which works against the effect of getting high so\ndon't be afraid full spectrum will not make you high another very nice thing is\nthat you can't build tolerance to CBD oil\nfor things like THC you can build tolerance but not for CBD because it\ndoesn't bind to your receptors studies even suggest that CBD has the opposite\neffect a reversed tolerance this basically means that you need less from\nit over time instead of more so it works better when it's build up in your system\nalso you cannot overdose on CBD oil it is 100% safe and has no big side effects\nso there is no need to stop using it after a period of time you can keep\nusing it the right dosage is different for everyone and also depends on what\nyou're using it for so it's very hard to give a specific dosage for some things a\nlow dosage works better and for other things a higher dosage works better for\nexample for treating anxiety a low to medium dose will work better than a dose\nthat is too high but for epilepsy a higher dosage is required so it's the\nbest to find a common dosage for your condition and try out for yourself by\nstarting low and upping the dosage till the desired effect is reached for\nanxiety when using the tincture for sublingual use I suggest to start with\naround 7 drops of oil containing 5% CBD when you don't feel any difference you\ncan add a few drops till you found the desired amount for how long the effect\nlasts also differs from person to person and depends on the way of using but when\nusing it sublingual the average time the effect lasts is 4 to 6 hours when using\nsublingually make sure to keep the oil under your\ntongue for at least 2 minutes and after that swirl it around in your mouth\nbefore swallowing this is because you absorb very little when swallowing it\ndirectly it really has to be absorbed under your tongue so it goes directly\ninto the bloodstream there are a lot of good CBD brands but also a lot that are\nbad find out the best rate at CBD brands in\nyour country by looking at reviews these were the basics you need to know about\nCBD if you got any questions ask them in the comment section below don't forget\nto give this video a

[Music] hi guys and welcome back to medically assisted cbd with charlie pimarini um our goal this year has been to try and at least produce one podcast a month to continue to bring content and value to the community and as many of you know or you may not know i'm a practicing physician assistant um so i try and come at this from a medical standpoint in order to educate you on how it really works how it works in the body how it interacts with medications that you may be taking and i think it's important to realize that this is these supplements that you take not just cbd but anything that you get supplement wise from a vitamin store does have potential interactions with medication so it's always best to check with one of your medical professionals so today is sleep and cbd uh sleep we spend well almost a third of our life sleeping a lot of people don't sleep well i mean i think it's become very apparent over the last couple of years that sleep quality not just sleep length but quality is becoming so much more important and so much more relatable to different types of diseases and especially chronic disease hypertension diabetes uh you know stress a lot of reasons why we don't sleep um we have we live the typical american lifestyle right we we wake up we go to work and we work all day we use stimulants to keep us up and then when we come home we're eating junk food sitting down in front of the couch and watching tv and not exercising and so it's very tough for us to get into a good sleep routine so a lot of times i talk with my patients about sleep hygiene and that's something we'll go over a little bit later today in the lecture but so let's first define what sleep is and go a little bit about sleep i'm not a sleep board trained sleep physician but i can give you a little bit of a background and then we talk about how cbd can help with your sleep so what is sleep so the anatomy of sleep so when sleep starts it starts we have five parts of our brain that really uh help to control our sleep the first one is the hypothalamus it's this is considered our sleep center it's in the middle of your brain i'm going to receive signals about light exposure and controls behavior related to light and dark when it's light outside you're up and you're doing stuff when it's dark you want to go to bed that's controlled by the hypothalamus that's just a portion of your brain hypo meaning below and it's below your thalamus so the brain stem the brain stem releases neurotransmitters to promote rest to the hypothalamus and to relax muscles so the the brain stem is going to sense the nighttime and it's going to release neurotransmitters that go back to hypothalamus to tell your body that you know what it's time to go to sleep we need to relax the thalamus is kind of our central uh i've heard it described as like the central station uh everything all this uh neurons all of our stimuli come in there and then the thalamus kind of disseminates these signals so the best example is the shirt on your back uh you obviously don't realize you're wearing a shirt until now i just made you realize that but these sensations um from your skin go to your thalamus but your thalamus decides that you know what that's not really relevant to what we need to do right now uh you know we're not gonna alert the body that this is something that we're feeling immediately and so you don't feel it until your attention is brought to it now the thalamus does the same thing it um for sleep so when you're ready to sleep it relays external senses right so darkness sunset um a lot of things that are related to sleep hygiene having a cool room things that prime your body to get ready for sleep um and so it shuts off during in the beginning of sleep because you don't want it to be sensing all these things going on is your partner next to you wrestle you know rustling around is there a dark dog barking you know is an airplane flying overhead but in the beginning of sleep it shuts off but during rem sleep it's actually active and that's why we'll get into it that's why a lot of times during the dream state you're able to sense things and the dreams seem so real the next is the penal gland a lot of people know about this one it's kind of sometimes i've heard it referred to as a third eye directly in the back of between your eyes and your brain and this is the one that's really important releases melatonin melatonin's a hormone uh we're finding it's actually not just for sleep it actually has potent anti-inflammatory effects a lot of people take melatonin supplements to help them sleep and this is all part of the sleep pathway the melatonin is released and it tells your body accuse yourself that it's hey it's time to go to bed it's time to sleep i mean anyone's taking a melatonin supplement understands that when you take that you do feel sleepy and sometimes groggy in the morning the next is the amygdala the amygdala is a part of our brain that is responsible for emotions this is most active during rem sleep when we're having dreams you may have had a dream of a past loved one or a dream of something you did you know 10 15 years ago and you kind of feel those emotions attached with seeing a deceased loved one or you know seeing a friend that you haven't seen in many years this is because that part of your brain that is storing these memories actually becomes active during our rem sleep it's all part of memory what they call memory consolidation so taking thoughts and actions that you did throughout the day and consolidating this into memory inside the hippocampus and research has shown that a memory that has been associated with a emotion good or bad does get primed and has a little bit easier time of being stored and recalled and that kind of plays into uh ptsd too so what is the sleep mechanism so there's two mechanisms for sleep the number one thing a lot of people know is the circadian rhythm right it's our biological clock this takes external cues light time of day temperature and directs the function of sleep and wakefulness okay uh it tells our body that you know what it's becoming dark it's gonna let's lower our core temperature uh let's start to decrease our heart rate you know it's time to get rest and ready to relax and get to bed a lot of people's uh biological clock and circadian rhythm is gets thrown off you know when you have jet lag that's part of jet lag you go from one coast to another you change multiple time zones now your body is you know it may be night time where you're where you just flew to but in your clock where you you are from it's you know still afternoon so sometimes your body is not able to take these cues externally and then put it together internally because it's very confused about what's going on uh the next is the sleep wake homeostasis so this is this tracks our need for sleep this reminds us to sleep it regulates sleep intensity and so what happens is the intensity of our sleep increases with every hour we're awake and causes us to sleep more and deeper every hour that you're awake makes sense you know you try and pull down either from studying or your kids are waking up in the middle of the night you're missing out on sleep so your body tries to compensate by creating more and deeper sleeping mechanisms to get us that restful sleep um you know it's only been within recent that we've realized that sleep isn't just we don't need it just to you know consolidate memory if you don't there's only uh you know a couple published studies about how long you can go without sleep you can go a few days without sleep until you will have you'll become delirious they've done studies about residents in medical school that have pulled a 12 20 you know 24 hour shift and they've tested the reaction time in their memory they're basically impaired it's basically the same amount of impairment memory reflex wise and functionality as if you've had a few drinks so it's very dangerous and people know that you know if you've never if you've suffered from any sleep disturbances you understand how frustrating it can be so what are the stages of sleep how how does this work because we just don't fall asleep and stay asleep so our body goes through three stages of sleep and the two main types of sleep are rem and non-rem um everyone's familiar with rem and we'll get into that but what is the non-rem so stage one is the change over from wakefulness to sleep it takes several minutes and it takes um that's kind of the period of time when you know you're starting to fall asleep and you start to feel a little bit relaxed and you're starting to get into that deep zone of you know i'm starting to fall asleep but you really aren't asleep and you still can be awoken very easily your heart rate is decreased your breathing is decreased it takes several minutes our muscles relax and you have those occasional muscle twitches those muscle twitches are your parasympathetic taken over and your sympathetic system going um going on sleep and you're losing the connectivity between your brain and your muscles so you're not jerking as much when you're sleeping so the next stage is the stage two um this is where you start having some of those myoclonic jerks when you start jerking your sleep and you feel like you're kicking or you may feel like you're falling that's our body detaching itself from the muscles and getting our body primed and ready to go to sleep and that's stage two stage three is consider deep sleep um this is when you're difficult to arouse and this is where you spend a lot of time here in the beginning of your sleep and then as you go throughout the night you spend less and less time uh in stage three but stage three is the deep sleep and what people don't realize is when we sleep we're going through uh kind of a sub awakeness at stage one we go to stage two go to stage three go to rem and go up and down you're going from stage one to stage four and you peak and valley in between both all of these stages throughout the night so you're not just staying in one stage you're going through all these stages multiple times and that's what gets you the most restful sleep is when you're is when you're going through the you're cycling through these sleep stages and that's what the problem with uh sleep medications like ambien um they get you into a deep sleep but you're not into a restful sleep because you're not going through these sleep cycles as you need to be going through now the next one is rem sleep everyone's familiar with that's about an hour and a half after we fall asleep this is where we have our dreams this is rapid eye movement this is where heart rate and breathing are closer to the wakefulness pattern so you actually are kind of close to becoming awake in these ish in these in this rem sleep your amygdala is active right your memory system is active your emotions are active you're kind of sense you're able to send some stimulus and this is what's creating some of these vivid dreams that people have you're able sometimes to taste to smell um to feel from this dream you're like man i just had this dream about so-and-so and it felt so real that's because your brain is telling you that with these emotional centers and these uh tactile tactile centers that this this did feel real um and this is when the brain activity is closest to wakefulness uh heart rate and breathing are slightly increased and this is where we're dreaming and memory consolidation most likely requires both rem and non-rem so that's why a lot of people that take sleep medications sometimes have memory issues and they've linked long-term use of um ambient to alzheimer's and memory issues because you aren't your brain's not getting this restful sleep and during sleep not only we consolidate memories and we're resting but our bodies using this time for our brains using this time to clear basically the garbage that's produced throughout the day by different enzymatic reactions these are glial cells that are kind of the garbage disposals of the immune system they're there are specific immune systems re specifically for the central nervous system and they go around scavenging and cleaning everything up and this is the time that they're most active during sleep so how does the endocannoid system kind of relate to sleep and how does it activate your sleep so one of the biggest things is it activates the parasympathetic and deactivates the sympathetic right we've talked about parasympathetic as rest and digest sympathetic is your fight or flight you're getting ready to work out you're getting ready to run you're getting ready to run from a tiger so when we when we go to rest the endocabinet system is a big player in activating our parasympathetic and getting us into that restful state decreasing heart rate decreasing breathing decreasing our core temperature getting your body primed and ready to fall asleep and so it modulates also through uh wakefulness they did an experiment where they injected patients uh rats actually excuse me they injected rats with cb1 antagonists and agonists so what that means is they injected rats with molecules that specifically either bind and activate the cb1 receptor in your brain or bind and block any activity from the cb1 receptor and what they found was there was an increased wake time with people that had a with the mice that had a blocked cb1 receptor and then there was an increased ram and sleep time with the molecules that would actually bind and activate the cb1 receptor so showing that when the cb1r cb1 receptor is activated um it increases your sleeping and um gets you into rem sleep and so this is kind of reminiscent of why people take cbd or use marijuana at bedtime this helps our body kind of get into that rest and digest stage um and as we age um there is a decrease they are finding that there's a decrease in our own natural endocannabinoids right we will produce two molecules that are very reminiscent of thc and cbd there are 2ag and anatomide and 2ag is reminiscent of the cbd molecule and as we age we actually produce less of this molecule so our bodies so it's not just you know your grandparents just don't sleep they're not sleeping well as we age um and so which requires sometimes a little bit more sleeping throughout the day to catch to catch up on your sleep that's why a lot of times a lot of napping and with age you have less rem sleep so how does cbd and sleep work so cbd increases parasympathetic activation it increases our endogenous or our natural endocannabinoids it allows them to work longer allows them to stay at the synapses longer and binds the cb1r receptor longer and not only so it's not only working specifically on the receptors but it's also working in our nervous system to get us into restful state and a lot of people that have sleep issues do suffer from anxiety so that's all part of the sympathetic and neural and parasympathetic activation so cbd is decreasing sympathetic sympathetic activation and increasing parasympathetic activation so published trials there are a few they're about small to medium size observational studies that showed the use of cannabis for sleep um does show some positive effects on sleep and this was a cochrane review um if you're not familiar with what a cochrane review is a uh it's the review of all reviews basically they take multiple reviews throughout a specific subset of research and they put it through high levels of analytics and it becomes a cochrane review and they review reviews they review studies they review reviews and this spits out very accurate data to tell us well is there some correlation between whatever we're studying and they do show that it does show some positive effects for sleep but it does call for more larger more clinical studies and i think some of those will start to be coming us down the pipeline soon as cbd and marijuana become more and more deregulated at the federal level and just the mechanism of how cbd works it does help with ptsd and can help with sleep uh rem sleep behavior a lot of people that have ptsd they're replaying these memories in their brain their brain is going back to these issues now just the mechanism of how cbd works it decreases activity of neurons right that's how it's decreasing seizure activity that's how it's decreasing anxiety so cbd can help decrease your replaying of memories decrease that emotional attachment to this memory of whatever had happened to you and kind of help you get out of that ptsd cycle and get you into restful sleep but uh the papers do call for you know more uh clinical trials larger clinical trials but it it does show promise um and it and there is a you know a mechanism for it to show that it's working so it's just to take some time like everything in the cbd cannabis industry but uh we're we're well on our way there uh before i forget to mention there is a cannabinoid that a lot of that's gaining a lot of tension it's called cbn uh and cbn is not actually naturally made by the cannabis plant it's actually a degradation of thc when thc or thca is sitting around in the plant it degrades it oxidizes to cbn and cbn's been found to be almost five times more sedating than thc um and so a lot of supplements and a lot more researchers coming out about cbn but a lot of sleep supplements are starting to kind of include cbn in their supplements for sleep time um so the last thing i like to talk about is sleep hygiene a lot of my patients come in and they're really just stressed right sleep is sometimes a difficult thing it's not just it's an active process you don't close your eyes and you go to sleep it's not just the absence of wakefulness it's actually deep activating other parts of your of your nervous system so what i tell patients through sleep hygiene is the bedroom is for the two s's as sleep and sex you shouldn't have a tv in there there should be no ipads no iphones i'm guilty of it i think most americans are guilty of it that you have your phone in your bed when you're trying to go to sleep but that blue light decreases the melatonin response keeps your body active your brain senses that as it's time to be awake because it's a bright blue light so i tell patients sometimes to change the light bulbs at your nightstand to an orange hue of a light bulb that can help with representing more of a sunset and getting your body yet again primed for sleep um soothing background noise a lot of patients use a fan or a sound app uh dark room that goes without being explained and no blue light or light 45 minutes prior to bed that's a big point um and i think it's becoming more popular with the blue blocker blue light blockers that a lot of people are wearing um and getting your body getting your room into a cool temperature anyone that's pulled any extended periods of time you know from a work shift or through studying you realize that around two to three in the morning you just start to get really cold that's your body dropping its core temperature and that's part of the sleep cycle so you can assist in this by keeping the room nice and cool um another thing is meditation meditation anywhere from five to ten minutes before bedtime can really help activate the vagus nerve which helps activate parasympathetic activity and decrease sympathetic activity yet again priming our body um and the vagus nerve is the biggest nerve in our body so if we can get this nerve to be activated with sleeping with meditation that really helps with your sleep and there's a lot of studies that have been done around the four seven eight breathing breathing in for four seconds holding in for seven and breathing out for eight uh doing a few rounds if that can really help bring you into a relaxation mode so sometimes people ask me about supplements for sleep um always check with your you know your medical providers to know if there's any interactions with any of your supplements but gaba or 5-htp gaba is an inhibitory um molecule in your brain a neurotransmitter so it decreases uh neurotransmission so a lot of sleep sleep uh supplements have this 5-htp is a precursor to serotonin production so that's sometimes that's part of the melatonin pathway so melatonin's a good supplement b6 b9 b12 uh b6 is uh pyroxene that's part that's a cofactor um in production of melatonin from going from tryptophan to melatonin um that's why when you eat the turkey dinner you may realize you feel a little sleepy it's because tryptophan is in high levels in turkey and it gets converted to melatonin but it needs b6 to help with that uh the b activated b9 and b12 is part of the sam e pathway which is methylation and that helps with activating um different neural enzymes in our body to help us sleep magnesium zinc are part of coenzymes that are also help with sleep melatonin production and a big thing that's becoming you know a little bit more popular lavender essential oils or teas um chamomile these things just again prime our body uh to decrease activation but lavender essential oils like terpenes that are found in cannabis or hemp are gaining a lot of popularity there's a lot of these terpenes are aromatic this is what you smell when you when you use cannabis or hemp but it's also able to cross a blood-brain barrier and actually binds to receptors in your brain and induces can can induce sleep can induce you know you feeling stimulated like pinene and pine saw sometimes you feel you know you feel stimulated with these type of terpenes but there's other ones that help with decreasing your alertness and getting you into a good sleep cycle so to recap how does cbd help with sleep it not only does it bind certain receptors in our brain activating our sleep but it also decreases our sympathetic activation and getting us into a relaxing sleep mode so before you take any supplements i always caution patients to check with your medical providers and see if these have potential interactions with anything that you are currently taking but if you are able to take cbd i definitely do recommend you know checking lab results lab reports and getting a good quality product and with that that is all for today and thank you for joining us to learn about cbd and sleep", "F-Pch3F5nbM": "welcome back to the EVR life YouTube channel so you've just purchased or you're thinking about

having a great day this is the next video in my herbalism basics series and this video is how to make an ointment now in order to engage with the healing and health giving properties of herbs we need to prepare them into a format we can physically use in an effective way and one of the ways we can do that is by making an ointment and these can also be referred to as balms ourselves now haribol augments are used primarily to form a protective barrier over the skin rather than to be absorbed into the skin a lip balm is a good example of this point iment helped to keep heat and moisture in so they are particularly useful for applying to the skin surrounding areas of aches and pains arthritis and rheumatism sufferers will especially benefit from this heat retaining action on the other hand if you want a remedy that needs to be absorbed into the skin then you may be better off with a horrible cream now I've actually made a video on how to make a horrible cream and you can see it by clicking the link here or at the end of the video now horrible pointment are made using infused oils beeswax or other kinds of solid fats are melted into the oil and then poured into jars and left to cool the result is a solid or slightly soft pointment depending on the ingredients used now a fairly popular average ratio and general guide is one cup of oil to one ounce of beeswax the ingredients will be different each time depending on what pointment you're making and what recipe you're following oh now it's really really important that you never make a preparation from a herb that you don't have sufficient background information on or understand its potential strength also some infused oils are safe to be used on wounds or broken skins but others must not be used in that way so it's important that you know these things about your hubs before you start working with them oh okay so here's how to make a simple point Minh now this will involve heating an infused oil in order to melt additional ingredients into it so you do have to be very careful about overheating the oil so for this method you need to use indirect heat and you can do that by using a double boiler which is a glass or ceramic bowl sat on top of a pan of boiling water you can also buy an actual double boiler system which is like two glass sauce pans that sit on top of each other now the secret of the double boiler is to only allow the steam to heat the glass bowl above not the boiling water itself so here's how we do it take an already horribly infused oil and add it to the bowl on your double boiler now add a block or pieces of beeswax and use the universal ratio of one ounce of beeswax to one cup of oil allow the bee's wax to melt gently into the oil and stir them together well once the beeswax is melted switch off the heat now this is the time to add any essential oils that you may wish to put into the mix stir well and allow the melted ointment to cool slightly and then pour it into clean right jars before it has the opportunity to set if it does start to set too soon just reapply gentle heat again real iqua fight now do be aware of leaving this point Minh in hot places such as on say a car dashboard because it will become liquid again if it gets reheated now as far as shelf life goes pointment can keep anything from three months up to a year all depending on the ingredients and the oils used so that's it for this how to make a horrible augment video make sure you look out for my other perhaps specific how to make herbal preparation videos where I will show you other methods of preparing herbs into remedies thanks for watching see you in the next video you", "J6i4RcU1V5A": "How to use CBD hemp oil drops. You open the CBD 15% bottle by screwing the pipette top clockwise and squeeze the bulb with your thumb and index finger. This gives you proper control for delivery. Place the drops under the tongue, hold for 60 seconds, then swallow. It is recommended to use as any other food supplement 3 times daily before any meal.", "27FZ8LbDpkQ": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel today we're gonna be talking CBD again specifically we have been talking about CBD dosage how much should you be taking [Music] so one of the questions I've had coming up with my comment section quite a lot and a lot of people have been messaging me asking this as well and that's been Andy how much do take Andy how much should I take how much CBD should I be take one of the most important things that we need to realize is that everybody it's different everybody has a different metabolic rate and the amount of CBD that you should be taking to get the results you want will be different to someone else most CBD products that you buy will have a dosage written on the bottle my suggestion is to absolutely ignore Matt and follow some simple steps to work out the effective dose for you and for you personally this is referred to quite often as the sweet spot on websites and it's a mistake that I certainly made in the beginning just relying on the on the information on the bottle and not taking into account my personal circumstances it's really important to say that the method that you're taking your CBD is going to make a big big difference to how much absorbs into your body so 120 milligrams product might not be the same as the next 20 milligram product my advice is to find a product that works for you to find a method that works for you and stick with it then you're not message messing with dosage and you're not confusing your body by absorbing a different amount by using different ways one for one example is taking CBD fire oil under the tongue is going to absorb much quicker into your body than taking it in a capsule for example so if you've been using it under the tongue don't expect to be able to use the same dose if you take it from a capsule as the amount that broth absorbs into your bloodstream is going to be different so as I said the biggest mistake I made when I first start taking CBD or was just to go straight in and take the amount on the bottle I've quite been open about the fact that I've been using CBD pure hemp oil 600 it's been a great product for me and I went straight in and just started doing the exact suggestion on the bottle and it says on here suggested use and it says to take 1 mil and which is which for this pot was approximately half a dropper under the tongue hold for 60 seconds before swallowing now 1 mil of oil in this border in this bottle will give me 10 milligrams of CBD and this goes on say to take it twice daily or as needed so that's what I did so I was getting 20 milligrams of CBT per day I was quite lucky in the sense that actually I got really good results from taking 20 milligrams of CBD per day however I've realized that not everyone is that lucky to go straight in and find the the right dose for them so what I would recommend you do when you first get your bottle when you first start taking CBD or if you've been taking CBD and not guessed necessarily getting the results you need I would say follow these steps and you should find that the results work for you so the first thing to do is to make sure you've worked out the amount of CBD per mil from your bottle I said each product is different the number that the bottle gives you so in this case 600 milligrams that means that there's a total of 600 milligrams in this bottle so that makes no adjustment for the bottle size or the amount of CBD mil so while some bottles may seem higher dose or a lower dose actually it's more about the concentrate than amount about the amount you're getting so it's very easy to work out the amount of CBD that you're getting per mil work out the amount of CBD in total so in this case 600 milligrams and work out how many mills are in the bottle and divide that by the amount of mils in the bottle and that will tell you how many mills you get how many milligrams you're getting of CBD per mil of oil most CBDs will come with a dropper so you will be able to and measure quite successfully the the dose that you're getting and I think in most cases the droppers are about the same size and the majority of droppers I've seen a two mil tapas so as I said in this case it's a 60 ml bottle 600 milligrams of oil so you're getting 10 milligrams of CBD per mil of oil once you've worked out the amount of milligrams of CBD per mil of oil you can then start working out the effective dose for you now remember everyone's different so what someone else is taking but is not relevant to you whatsoever don't ask other people what they're taking and don't mimic that because it is absolutely irrelevant to you your sweet spot and your effective dose is absolutely unique to you so the way to find that sweet spot is to start low if you start taking a total of five milligrams per day try that for a few days and then increasing the amount of oil over the next few days again and keep doing that until you find the most effective dose so my recommended cycle would be to start from two point five milligrams in the morning to point five milligrams at night try that for three days three days if you're still not getting the results you want up that take take five milligrams in the morning five milligrams at night just keep doing that and eventually you'll start getting the results that you want without taking too much oil the other benefit to the fact that the or you're taking less is the fact that URL then should last you longer if you only need five milligrams of CBD per day then you're then you'll use much less oil and this bottle here will last you longer than as if unit if you need thirty milligrams a day dosage is much easier to calculate with oils and capsules and measurable quantities of CBT it gets much harder than when we start looking at a vape pen in all honesty I could not tell you how much CBD I'm getting each time I vape to work that out would be pretty complicated CBD vapor vape juice has a number on the bottle so my case is 400 milligrams and that's in a 10 ml bottle yeh again that is the total amount of CBD in the bottle to get a consistent dose every single time you vape means your you would have to be taking exactly the same amount in each time you would also need to know exactly how many times you take the CBD before you finish the whole bottle in order to break it down so what I've been doing because I find I found vaping to be very relaxed eval ative to my CBD routine is my effective dose works at around 30 milligrams of CBD per day so I've been taking 10 milligrams of oil in the morning I've been taking around 15 milligrams of oil at night and then I've been vaping occasionally throughout the day now I'm definitely not getting a consistent dose however it's close enough because I'm not vaping constantly that it's working out well for me if you're someone that allof apes and vapors all day then that's gonna be a big difference for you and it's going to be much more difficult for you to work out exactly how much you're getting and to keep that consistent so just be careful that you're not taking too much by using multiple ingestion methods if you're a regular vapor if it's something you're doing occasionally I think it's much more easy to manage because you can simply vape less if you're finding you're going over the required dose or if you'll getting some side effects you don't want the biggest piece of advice I can give when working at your dosage is to not quit too early I've spoke to quite a lot of people that said oh I've been trying to CBD for the past few days and it's not working for me absolutely not you're not going to get full effect in the first two or three days you might be get lucky and you might get some results I found a lot of people that are dealing with pain management again really really quick results I got some really quick results on day one for my depression and it really uplifted me but I think I got quite lucky with the dosage most people are going to have to use it for a few days to build up the the receptors and to learn to increase the effects of the CBD oh there is some chance of some side-effects in the first few days I've heard lots of reports of people getting diarrhea and I believe that might be because of the anti-inflammatory nature of it but it does pass after a few days of trying and using that the the nasty toilet trip should end but actually you should feel pretty positive for that afterwards as it's cleared your system out a little bit and and should make you a bit more comfortable I've heard some great results from people with IBS and even Crohn's disease that have used CBD and and it's really helped them because of it's amazing anti-inflammatory properties so to conclude the most important thing here is that you find the effective dose for you as we've all got different metabolic rates that is gonna vary from person to person so don't waste your time trying to mimic what other people do to get the same results spend the time workout your sweet spot work out your own effective dose and work out how much and you needs to get the results that you need different people and different conditions are always going to need a different dose and always going to take time to find that dose and see what's most effective but I promise you stick with it and it's worth the wait it's it's been absolutely amazing for me my use of CBD is totally changed my life and it's totally started to turn my life around and and it's and its really changing my life for the better in many way anyways and and again I just want to stress I'm not a doctor I'm not giving you medical advice here please please please do all of this under the advice of your doctor don't use it to come off any medication without taking the appropriate advice and steps none of this is intended as medical advice all I can tell you is what I've done and what I found effective for me and that's a really important part to play I can't stress any more how important it is to talk to your doctor and really listen as far as your own conditions are concerned and your own body is concerned but then also listen to your own body your body will tell you if you're taking too much if you're the inside effects you don't like if you're getting sleepy if you'll get in issues of and I've just got I've heard people get in issues of nausea because they don't like the oil so the capsules have worked better for them and an even vice-versa in some occasions so listen to your body do some research read up on the benefits and the side effects of CBD and make a judgment call for yourself alongside any medical advice you've got from your doctor that's really really important it may be working for me but it's not a miracle cure anyone that tells you that CBD is a miracle cure that can cure actually any ailment they're lying they're just trying to sell your products on most occasions it will take still to take hard work I think CBD is a great symptom medicine but it won't kill all your problems so use this as an opportunity to work on the cause well you've got some respite from the symptoms as well thanks guys speech you soon [Music]", "NpnbBbdK6V0": "today's subject was with regard to cannabis and the legal status of cannabis in islam now cannabis also known as hemp marijuana bunge known as charus in the indian subcontinent so many names for this plant because of its notorious role where people for many years have been smoking cannabis but why the subject arose was simply because the during the recent times some students of knowledge they deemed cannabis as being halal because they thought that the fatwa changes with time so they thought that the fatwa relating to cannabis has changed because of new scientific research and that the fatwa of the scholars of the past was outdated now what i wanted to discuss today was an overview with regard to the actual fatwa relating to cannabis also known as marijuana what is the classical fatwa firstly cannabis was unknown in the time of assalafusalihon in the time of the pies predecessors people were unfamiliar of cannabis but later on cannabis was introduced into the muslim world we know for instance the even the word assassin is from the word hashish because a group of assassins that resided in syria in the time of sultan salahuddin they were heavy cannabis smokers marijuana smokers and they were referred to as hashishin meaning from the arabic name of hashish as hashish was introduced into the muslim world so they they became known as hashishin and then when the crusaders entered syria they took the name assassin from the word hashashim and hashashim were people who smoked cannabis and the ulama became familiar with regard to cannabis now cannabis grows in heavy loads in india in the indian subcontinent in fact even during some hindu rituals they have a type of a milk drink in which they place hemp and cannabis so the the people taking part in that ritual they drink the lassi and they intoxicate themselves with cannabis in fact the indian type of cannabis which is known as al is a type of cannabis which refers to as a very potent type of cannabis which people smoked so the indian subcontinent was well known for cannabis smoking from hundreds of years ago that even the british during colonial periods many of the british researchers and they they associated mental health disorders with heavy smoking and use of cannabis this is something known historically in fact the records you will find some of the records and the cataloging of people who worked in lahore in the mental health they associated cannabis smoking with mental health but when cannabis was introduced into the muslim world the ulama could we say that the ulama were medieval scholars who were unaware of the effects of cannabis as we are aware today the facts with regard to the progress made in research on cannabis is that firstly cannabis uh has the leaf cannabis the marijuana leaf has over 360 various chemicals and each one of those chemicals must be studied the chemical that has the intoxicating effect is the chemical known as uh thc tetrahydrocannabinol this is the the particular type of chemical that makes people intoxicated so thc oil is the oil or the chemical extracted from the cannabis sleeve which gives people the feeling of intoxication but there are over 360 chemicals contained within the cannabis leaf so what is the legal islamic classical stunts and then how how do we review the classical stunts with the current research on cannabis so from all the books of the four schools from the books of al madahi firstly there are many uh fatawa that you find in the four schools you find verdicts uh in the hanafi school in the hashi of ibn's in the in the shaffer school in the hambali school in the maliki school they have various fatwas on cannabis but today for today's discussion i chose the fatwa as relayed and eloquently mentioned by alimon now he has a famous book as the word this book is on the major sins and the major sins of uh that a person can carry out and be sinful he has in kitab are those this is the chapter and those things which relate to eating so alim by the way for the people who are asking questions there will be a questions and answer session at the end cbd oil will also be tackled i will mention what the actual ruling is with regard to cbd oil and the the thc oil but what i want to do is draw you through the classical fatwa take you through the classical fatwa because one major problem that we have in today's day and age is that people criticize the classical fatawa without actually studying the classical fatah first we need to study the classical tower before critiquing them understanding the classical fatal will help us in understanding the application of the legal status of cannabis today so a fatwa on cannabis and what he states which means the hundred and eightieth major sin the major sin interestingly it states which means eating intoxicants that are clean meaning their illegal status is that they are considered tahir like cannabis so he starts with cannabis but he mentions other things as well like which is opium so he states the word muskera means an intoxicant an intoxicant is what is being debated here as to what is the meaning of intoxicant this is an important thing to understand at this point that intoxicant is what people confuse with only alcohol being an actual intoxicant so he states so the likes of ali was one of those scholars who stated that the the cannabi that cannabis is an intoxicant so he states the difference between the intoxication of alcohol and the intoxication of cannabis he states what they mean by intoxication is that it covers the intellect not with the type of joyous behavior that happens with alcohol meaning when someone drinks alcohol they become joyous but the type of intoxication meant here is only covering the intellect so he states that this joyousness that occurs is that which occurs with the drink meaning drink which intoxicates has a specific has a specific effect while cannabis on the other hand it covers meaning it clouds the intellect now he states further down remember i am only choosing the best parts of the entire fatwa that once it's established that all of these meaning he or he doesn't only mention cannabis he mentions opium and other things also he states if they are muscular intoxicants is that which numbs you down basically drugs the type of drugs that people take that inebriate them they are referred to as much states if it's established that these are that use of this is a career a major like alcohol now further down he will make make a mention of the distinction between alcohol and cannabis there is a distinction uh the distinction is that with regard to the purity of cannabis cannabis is not deemed by the majority of the scholars as an impurity it's haram to consume but it's not imp impure in the sense that if it goes on your clothes or if you touch it your clothes or your body would become impure so further down he states what is the proof for this meaning what is this based upon what uh the what is the legal ruling of cannabis remember cannabis being haram is agreed upon by the four schools so the four sunni schools agree on this they differ on a few details relating to cannabis which i will mention but what he states what is the proof for this he states al-aslufi vadika that the origin and source of prohibiting all of that is nothing what imam ahmadine writes on every intoxicant and two words are used one is musker one is intoxicant and mu fatter is that which slows you down anything which slows you down now and the mistake some people are making with regard to musker they think that musket is only the effects of alcohol meaning alcohol has specific effects so they say if those effects are not found in anything else like cannabis for instance then that cannot be deemed as haram so any intoxicant must be the same as alcohol is this correct the answer is no intoxication is scar is a universal term which has multiple aspects if one of these is found then it would be considered haram so alcohol slows you down alcohol makes your speech slurred drinking alcohol in heavy amounts can make you not being able to distinguish between two things like if someone comes across a donkey and a horse and they are drunk they will not know the distinction between a donkey and horse these are different effects of alcohol if any one of these effects is found in a substance that substance is considered a muscar so it's not essential that all the these components of intoxication are found in a substance even if one is found it's sufficient to make it haram to deem it a musker so for instance say the sharif al-jurjani rahim allah in his book on definitions when he defines iskar which is which is intoxication he says that which causes numbness or that which slows you down or that which makes the speech slurred or that which confuses you to the point that you cannot make the distinction between two things if any one of these things is found in a substance then that substance is deemed as an intoxicant if any one of these things so the exception of medicinal use which i will mention further later the that the reason for considering cannabis haram is the hadith so he then he defines everything which slows you down it slows down the appendages person is unable to move that all of these uh mentioned things too they give intoxication what to do they uh they are considered as that which numb you down and to fatiru they are those things which slow you down so even if one of these aspects is found then it is considered haram so this effect is found in cannabis that anyone who takes cannabis they will slow down or they will have paranoia and there are various other effects of cannabis which i will mention later now after mentioning this he quotes a great maliki scholar from egypt and he was the fa he was the author of a book called al-farooq now the subject of al-farooq in jurisprudence is when a scholar a jurist they tell you the distinction between uh one thing and another when they tell you the distinction between two things this science is known as wrote an entire book where he has a discussion on cannabis he has a discussion on cannabis he differed with some of the scholars and certain details but what did they say regarding the the prohibition of cannabis he states he relates from hakka al-qarafiyu so abu al-abbas ahmad the humbly jurist both of them and even allah was harsh against ibn tamiya so for him to to cite him for this shows that this position was agreed upon even among scholars who differed amongst themselves and other things that they said there is ijma they said there is ijmah on the the horma the prohibition of cannabis they related a consensus and he said meaning states whoever says it is before imams didn't discuss cannabis because cannabis was not found in their time that it appeared in the end of the sixth century that when the kingdom of the tatar they ascended then cannabis appeared in the muslim world so the end of the sixth century beginning of the seventh century that cannabis appeared now according to ibn whoever says it's halal commits disbelief we would say that the there is agreement of the four schools when there is agreement of the four schools on a legal ruling to oppose that is fisk is transgression unless of course someone is a much tahid imam to go against the ijuma is impermissible so after this further down in the fatwa after quoting the the scholars of the schools like for instance he states now the point of contention that some people have that point of contention is they say that when we observe alcohol alcohol is hammer so hammer is prohibited in the in the quran and this is a very important point that i want to alert everyone with regard to this there is a drink called nabeed nabeed is when you have a fruit like dates or anything else and you ferment the the fruit and it reaches a point where it it has the nature of intoxicating this is known as nabib and nabi by agreement is haram it's prohibited but some people they cite al-imam abu hanifa rahman allahu ta'ala saying that if nabiv is taken in small proportions in small amounts then nabeed is permissible so based on this they say therefore other drinks which are other than wine they should be permitted in small amounts so someone is saying a coffee intoxicates you this is incorrect coffee does not have the definition of intoxication that i mentioned the the four uh points i mentioned with regard to the definition of cough of intoxication where that it slows you down or it numbs you or it slurs your speech or you are unable to make the distinction to between two things like a donkey and a horse these these uh traits are not found in coffee so to say coffee is like uh cannabis is incorrect and some people have attempted to say that coffee was declared haram by a group of scholars and then was but the correct answer is that it was declared haram by a minority of people and then this fatwa was countered by the majority of the ulama the majority of the ulama and then later the the overwhelming number of scholars have said coffee is permitted unlike cannabis cannabis has an agreement a consensus of the scholars of the four schools that cannabis when taken for for intoxication is prohibited and as i will mention uh the legal rulings relating to thc and cbd further down but what i wanted to draw your attention to was with regard to beer now someone mentioned to me that in oxford you have people teaching islamic studies in oxford and they confuse the students by telling them things like al-imam that and what they mention is the legal ruling uh that relates to nabeed nabiv as i mentioned is fermented juice so you take the juice of any uh substance like a consumable substance and you ferment it and it turns into an alcoholic drink what is the legal status of nabiv the three imams they all say haram in the hanafi school muhammad shaiban he says haram and the fatwa is given according to the statement of muhammad shaibani and al-imam abu yusuf he states haram now some people quote this the statement of imam hanifah to validate a deviant interpretation they say permitted nabeed in small amounts as long as it does not intoxicate therefore they say in drinks that are intoxicants other than wine can be taken in small amounts the answer is that firstly the fatwa is not given according to that statement in the school as is elaborated upon in other works but the statement of ali should be taken in its true context what is that true context i mentioned elsewhere that alimony was mentioning this in terms of medicinal use with regard to nabeed and people said that i have said this with that reference but there are references for this uh for quick citation purposes i'll draw your attention to what uh is written in the the amazing work of a sheikh nurudeen he that with regard to intoxicants that are made from other than grapes he says that the amount that will intoxicate is haram and a person is punished by the government by the caliphate the muslim who drinks so he states but when a small amount is taken now listen to this point when a small amount is taken it's conditional so for someone to say a small amount is permitted it's conditional with multiple one of the uh conditions is that the person takes this for health reasons to strengthen themselves and not to emulate the transgressors so a person doesn't take it as a drink for uh socializing and going to the pub and these type of things that and other conditions which are not carried out to have the drinkers of this time meaning they do not fulfill these conditions so the condition of imam abu hanifa with a small amount is that with the small amount it's haram also because the conditions are very difficult to fulfill so this is important to clarify with regard to the misinterpretation people give with regard to annabeth so going back to hashish being haram the sin of smoking cannabis for intoxication is the same as alcohol that these the sin a person accumulates by drinking alcohol they will have the same sin by smoking cannabis by taking cannabis by consuming cannabis and inhaling cannabis so at this point there is a a part of the discussion that ibn hajjar maki rahim allah he draws our attention to a group of people who said there is a distinction between alcohol and cannabis they say there is a distinction between alcohol and cannabis that alcohol has certain effects that are not found in cannabis therefore cannabis should be halal he answers this by saying there is meaning not every effect of alcohol is found in cannabis and not every effect of cannabis is found in alcohol but both of the effects that are found in either one fall under the umbrella category of intoxication so kullu muscarin means that every intoxicant is haram the word intoxicant is broad and it's inclusive of every intoxicant even if the intoxicant only has specific effects so he states it becomes clear by that that there is no dispute between the ones who said that cannabis is an intoxicant there was a group of scholars who said cannabis is haram but it's haram because uh it causes tahdir which is to inebriate or to numb people down and they said it causes facade corruption and then there was a group of people who said it's musker it's an intoxicant but even allah says there's no difference between the two there is no difference between the two fatwas so if you check qarafi's al-farooq he has an entire discussion on this but ibn rahimallahu ta'ala states there is no distinction between the two why he states well while so when they say it's corruption they mean a specific type of corruption and when they say when they say that uh cannabis is haram due to a specific corruption that falls under the general meaning of uh intoxication also so when the scholars say cannabis is haram due to corruption it's a specific reason but it falls under the umbrella category of intoxication so he states in so what happened is uh some people said that intoxication is whatever makes the intellect cloudy they said sleep and fainting also makes you go cloudy so therefore uh this uh shouldn't be haram but he explains that a way and he says that uh fainting and you know madness are similar to intoxication fainting and um madness so cannabis has this effect also on the minds of people so further down he states regarding those who say that cannabis should be made halal what is further by the way i will mention the medicinal uses of cannabis after i just elaborate upon the fatwa he states uh regarding those who say that for uh leisure purposes someone can smoke or inhale or consume cannabis what is the legal status of such people now this similar to what even he says anyone who claims that cannabis is not haram and anyone who claims that it does not have an intoxicating effect then such a person should be punished severely that which prevents people from saying such things meaning in the caliphate if that someone states cannabis is halal or it or it doesn't intoxicate the government has the right to punish such a person belka whoever claims that hashisha cannabis is halal is a commit so according to ibn taymiyyah and people of the hambali school whoever claimed cannabis is halal then he commits kuffar but according to the majority they say such a person should be punished further down he has the discussion on what is the legal ruling so we know cannabis for for taking cannabis falls under iskar musker it falls under that definition so what is the legal status of cannabis in terms of cannabis the punishment for cannabis and also the legal status of the purity of cannabis so is cannabis so alcohol we know is najis but cannabis is it naji so tired we know it's haram to smoke haram to consume for leisure and for intoxication what is the legal status as uh in terms of its purity is uh hashish considered pure he states here uh he quotes al-habib that some of them said if it's an intoxication then if it intoxicates then it's nudges some of them said this and ibn tamiya said uh he said and al that he had the corporal punishment is essential for someone who smokes hashisha so there was this statement of some of the jurists they said hashisha is nudist impure and any and also the punishment for taking and consuming hashisha for cannabis is the same as alcohol the punishment the legal punishment the sin is the same by agreement but is the punishment the same mechanics that because it's a solid substance cannabis and it's not a liquid the scholars different there are three statements regarding its purity now in the hambali school alone there are three statements and the other schools have numerous statements but in the hanafi school we would say cannabis if it falls on your clothes it is not najis if you touch it it is not najis in the hanafi school but to smoke cannabis and remember uh the exception uh i will mention with regard to medicinal use i will mention uh further down uh with regard to medicinal use so i have some of your uh questions being noted down and you can continue uh mentioning uh writing your questions uh i will have the admin write down some of those questions for me so they disputed with regard to its purity and impurity and in the hanafi school it's considered pure uh likewise with regard to the had they had punishment uh they disputed the head punishment is the head punishment the corporal punishment uh for uh hashisha cannabis the same as alcohol or not now toward the end of the fatwa for me this was the most interesting part the most interesting part for me was with regard to the harms of cannabis some of the uh scholars have said waffy have said by consuming cannabis there are 120 harms 120 harms of cannabis worldly and spiritual harms worldly and spiritual cannabis gives you vile thoughts now these harms of cannabis that he lists are interestingly in accordance with modern research of some scientists also and researchers people who have written on the harms of cannabis if he mentions uh some of those things for instance it causes forgetfulness maturity likewise he mentions that it gives headaches corruption of thought sudden death it can cause certain death in some people it can cause deficiencies in the intellect meaning you would only have to observe anyone who smoked cannabis habitually or took even cannabis for a small amount of time that they will have deficiencies in their intellect likewise he mentions that the secrets a person has in their hearts they come out with those things after smoking cannabis the it does away with modesty so any modesty a person has cannabis does away with the modesty meaning any a person has likewise kathra tulmira it makes people argumentative cannabis can make people argumentative manners mannerisms uh keeping a marua is keeping uh mannerisms in society it does away with that likewise for aura a person who smokes this in abundance they will uncover their aura meaning their private areas or their private uh secrets likewise the person who smokes it is sitting with iblis they abandon the prayer they fall into muharram prohibited things so they shake meaning it can cause convulsions and shaking in people likewise he mentions it can cause liver problems and blood problems in the blood it can also yellow the teeth and ruin the teeth of a person so he mentioned so many various illnesses that cannabis causes in fact he lists 120 uh harms of cannabis and why cannabis is haram and this is in agreement with the four schools so before going on to questions and answers i want to mention something with regard to cannabis uh itself that just to recap cannabis is as haram as alcohol and new neurology and the study of neurology has not changed the fatwa in any way or form in fact so little is known about cannabis the the main funding for cannabis research is given by israel the occupying state of israel has the most research in cannabis and they also have a very high proportion of cannabis smokers in the middle east much of the cannabis in israel there is cannabis export and import from israel to lebanon and so many areas but they invest in cannabis research cannabis as i mentioned has 360 various chemicals not all those chemicals have been researched correctly but the chemical that causes the intoxicating effect is tetrahydrocannabinol thc now this thc is administered to ill patients for pains to ease their pain so cancer patients they will take thc to ease and facilitate the pain that they are feeling during cancer is this permitted this is permissible for cancer patients it's permitted for someone who has a prescription from a doctor they can take thc oil but a point i wanted to mention the cannabis that people would smoke in the 1960s during the hippie movement in america the thc contained in the cannabis leaf that was smoked by those people was only 2.5 or even less 2.5 percent of the leaf was thc so the the intoxication was less what's happened now is that with new methods of growing the leaf the the chemical of thc can be increased in fact some of the smokers what they do is that they place the cannabis on the roll and they they also place the thc oil so they may have even 25 percent increase of th meaning at 25 percent so with one smoke 25 of it would be thc oil so 25 percent of it would be thc oil and this increases the intoxication what are the health harms of taking such thc there is research that it contributes to schizophrenia and psychosis it contributes to paranoia this is not only known through research it's known through experience of people who have smoked it if you talk to people who have smoked cannabis they will tell you with regard to the paranoia they felt or the schizophrenia likewise bipolar it causes bipolar and psychosis in the smokers if someone genetically is predisposed to mental health problems cannabis is a trigger and it can actually trigger mental health problems anyone who was a habit and there is also a myth among some people that pure cannabis is different to the cannabis which is laced this is false the discussion is regarding pure cannabis so you can imagine the harms of laced cannabis so there is a laced cannabis which people have they place various chemicals on that particular type of cannabis that is by agreement harmful but the pure cannabis some people are advocating that pure cannabis is good and has benefits meaning the benefits override the harm but this is incorrect the harms override the the benefits the small amount of benefits found in the cannabis leaf could be permitted in the medicinal arena but anything else as a recreational drug cannabis is harmful and anyone who has smoked cannabis in the past you will see that when they attempt to memorize things many of them are unable to memorize some people will say carl sagan smoked cannabis or other famous individuals they smoked cannabis again by mentioning a minority of people it does not validate cannabis as a whole and it does not mean everyone who smokes cannabis will have schizophrenia it does not mean everyone who smoked a cannabis will have bipolar or psychosis the the research shows that the psychosis and schizophrenia is found higher in proportion and percentage amongst those people who have smoked cannabis in the past ins in fact it increases six times more if you check research on this you will find that there is more chance of someone who has smoked cannabis uh that the the effect of that cannabis could be schizophrenia or bipolar if you check their family backgrounds they will not have genetical predisposition to mental health problems and some of them they smoke cannabis in excess and sometimes without excess some people they may smoke the cannabis and it triggers a mental health problem so many cases have come to me where young men have been smoking and they have been they have had mental health problems this is such a common problem in our community that young men are smoking young men are smoking cannabis to such a degree that when they go off cannabis they have a service their mind plays tricks on them and the family will think that they have jinn and black magic and then they bring them to the masjid to say that they have gin and black magic when in reality they have had a habit of cannabis smoking and the effects of that have caused mental health problems and this is something being ignored in our community that there is a there is a percentage of young people who are smoking cannabis and some of them take also a new trend where they use canisters small canisters for balloon for these canisters you can order from amazon and what they do is they these canisters are made for uh spray cream creams for cakes and whatnot what these youngsters do is that they use the canisters and they they the gas in the canisters they place in balloons and then they nitro oxide and then what they do is that they inhale the nitro oxide and they have a buzz which they say is similar to cocaine and it lasts one minute now this will have mental health problems uh cause mental health problems in the long run it will affect their memories and in some cases it causes psychosis and violent behavior there was a case in the crown court in birmingham where a young man killed another man while under uh the high of the balloon so this came out in a case in the crown court so likewise with cannabis so what happens is when you go when you walk on these roads you walk on stratford road you walk on the side roads in spark brook spark hill to alam rock i walked to alam rock for numerous years four miles there and four miles back for numerous years five days a week and i would observe in small heat in alam rock in all these areas that there were canisters on the floor and i would wonder why are these metal canisters on the floor so i did some research and i found that these young people are using the gas uh nitro oxide in balloons and inhaling that gas which is haram and they should be told this is haram like alcohol and likewise cannabis is haram like alcohol so thc oil is permitted when a doctor gives the prescription for a cancer patient to relieve them of pain or any other ill person if they have a prescription from a doctor cbd the cbd oil on the other hand is permitted generally why because with the cbd they remove the thc so the tetrahydro cannabinol is removed and cbd brings out the other beneficial aspects of the cannabis leaf therefore the cbd oil is permitted but the thc generally is haram only permitted in medicinal cases when a prescription is given by a doctor there are a few other questions i use active gel which is filled with hemp it is like vicks and gel mixed together for pains around body mainly mainly is it allowed the answer is yes this is permitted so active gel which has hemp and you use that to rub on yourself is permitted this is halal likewise someone asks thc is haram it intoxicates but can the cbd be used medicinally the answer is yes that would be halal someone asks does it cure or stabilize cancer from a scientific perspective as far as i know thc suits the pain for cancer patients it does not cure cancer do not follow these urban myths regarding benefits of cannabis there is a strong pro-cannabis lobby that campaigns you've had numerous you've had george soros and hugh hefner and notorious individuals funding the lobby pro-cannabis america so do not trust the propaganda that they peddle uh on social media and other outlets can edible weed be eaten for a certain symptoms again for medicinal purposes you would have to have the prescription of a doctor because it's not considered nudges in the three schools it's not considered najis consuming the carniv cannabis in its medicinal form would be permitted for medicinal uses i wanted to mention something with regard to dmt so uh with regard to cannabis and the hemp and marijuana a few more things before i move on to dmt that there is a culture now in muslim communities where young men are hiring renting flats and various buildings in order to grow marijuana they grow marijuana and then pedal the marijuana in a society they are not only having the sin of peddling marijuana but also of those who smoke the marijuana and then all the crimes that happen as a result of that marijuana smoking it's like there is a ladder that people are climbing they start with cigarettes and hukka and then they move on to from cigarettes and hookah to cannabis as some people say uh with regard to pan is pan haram the answer is pan is not like cannabis ban does not the definition of intoxication i made very clear it slows down the body it makes someone languid it slows them down or if it makes people unable to make a distinction between things or if it slurs the speech or if it makes someone collapse and faint these are the definitions of musker and cannabis does fall under this definition but then what happens is they move on to cannabis and then from cannabis if you check research you'll find that people who have had mental health problems in the past uh mental health problems that were triggered by cannabis when they stopped smoking cannabis they some their sanity was restored but when they go back to cannabis insanity is triggered meaning the effects of the cannabis is such that the bipolar or the psychosis or schizophrenia is triggered again by them smoking the cannabis some of them have uh also they go cold turkey in ramadan so if they fast during the month of ramadan they do not have tobacco they do not have alcohol they do not have cannabis when they go through cold turkey they will have violent outbursts sometimes during the iftar when they open the fast they will have some violent outbursts because they cannot handle the hunger and the the lack of tobacco the lack of nicotine in the blood the lack of the thc the or the lack of alcohol in the blood so they will have violent outbursts so the it seems that the rung on the ladder is that they start with cigarettes then they move on to cannabis then some of them have the nitro oxide from the the small canisters and they sit on the the sides of the roads in cars and they fill the balloons and they they inhale the balloon now in the 80s and the 90s people glue sniffing was common they would buy glue powerful glue place the glue in bags and then inhale the glue gas sniffing was also common where they would sniff gas for highs all of these are haram as they ruin the intellect and cannabis is on par with them then from cannabis they move may move on to more heavier drugs like crack cocaine brown other types of drugs and unfortunately when they when they go to that stage we see that many people muslims and non-muslims within the uk are homeless they become homeless their lives are destroyed and then so many muslims take advantage of these homeless people today after fajr prayer on my way home i met a local man dressed in clothes to warm himself and he was a muslim but not a born muslim someone who adopted islam someone who took on islam and he mentioned to me that when he accepted islam his family ostracized him beat him up violently he was from leeds and they left him for dead he was found by muslims in 2018 and they placed him in some home in a room and there are some government schemes where the government gives money to the the landlords for keeping these tenants but but also they give money for the tenant but what happened is that the landlords muslim organizations he mentioned the organization to me muslim organizations that claim to house the homeless they took his money they did not give him money and he would still beg on the streets and the landlord would drive past him the landlord would drive past him while he is begging on the roads eventually after seven months he did not receive a single penny from the scheme that he sued the organization and now he was currently in another house a tenant in another house and the landlord receives government money for maintaining these people as tenants but yet the landlord was still charging extra rent and because the man is unable to pay extra rent he was also his house he was get he was given a card to keep the electric and gas going so he needed to charge the card so he was begging for money to top up the card and this man he had a kidney removed he had illnesses various illnesses and this was a man who may have had a drug problem even though he claimed he was not he did not have a drug problem so when these people they become heavy drug users and become homeless we as a muslim community have failed in with rega in a few regards number one is the amount of drug dealers in our community muslims born as muslims who deal drugs to to to the community muslims are non-muslims they deal out to everyone they are from our community secondly when those drug users are on the streets some of our muslim landlords are extorting them taking benefit from them when the government gives certain handouts to landlords taking the government schemes but yet at the same time charging those tenants also charging them that they have to then go back onto the roads to beg so we have failed in in that regard that the situation is so bad that some people sometime ask me is it permissible for us to report local drug dealers the answer is yes it is halal for you to report local drug dealers who are muslim who claim to be muslim you are still allowed to report them to the police in fact you should report them to the police many years ago when i said do not pray the funeral prayer of drug dealers do not pray their funeral prayers some people went against me and they said you must have mercy on everyone even drug dealers yes you have mercy in giving them thou inviting them to allah but the fatwa is harsh with regard to those who die without repenting the fatwa is harsh on those drug dealers who destroyed the lives of so many people and and have arrogance and refuse to repent to allah that you do not pray their funeral prayers and then someone said in order to counter this they said you many years ago attended the funeral prayer of a drug dealer meaning what happens is i make a statement so people attempt to find contradictions because of their own association i said in response to the person who brought this objection i said in reality the people do not know the backdrop when this particular drug dealer died the local community invited me to speak after his funeral in order to condemn drug dealing in order to condemn violence not in order to praise the man who had died and to praise his actions that is the context of my attendance of the funeral when i spoke against the actions of drug dealing and against gang violence this was over a decade ago so some of them they spoke against me saying uh he's being harsh to drug dealers but then after many years they caught up and agreed they said yes he is correct for saying this so this drug problem uh unfortunately uh is common in our not only in our community in many communities but as muslims as muslims drug dealers someone states deserve mercy yes they deserve mercy to make them do tawba repentance and their cases with allah but the legal status is that when when they when they destroy the lives of so many people the fatwa regarding them is harsh that when they destroy the lives of those people who are homeless on the roads who are addicted to the drugs and continue continuously beg money in order to buy drugs which are harmful so moving on to dmt dmt uh many years ago i read a work on dmt now the work itself let's go into the claim of dmt firstly dmt they say dmt is produced in the mind when a person goes to sleep and some of them refer to it as the spirit molecule they say it's a spirit molecule because when you dream that dream like state takes you to the world of the soul and this is caused by the mind producing the dmt now the pineal gland it is said that the pineal gland is what secretes the dmt in small amounts the pineal gland is is contained within the middle of the brain interestingly enough even and others have said that when the child the fetus is in the womb the spirit enters the womb from the top of this of the head interestingly enough and uh he states regarding he states uh regarding death that when death occurs the last point from which the soul is taken is from the top of the head so the pineal gland the author claimed this is one of the early works on dmt you'll find this work online meaning it's available to purchase i forgot the name but dmt the spirit molecule now the research is criticized by many people but he claims that at the time of death the amount of dmt stored in the mind increases at the time of death so this dmt uh they refer to as a spirit molecule and that a person when they dream uh they the the the spirit enters this the unseen and therefore this is caused by dmt so what this scientist did is he injected uh dmt into some of the uh people who were were taking part in this experiment and they had experiences where they met beings they said the beings looked like aliens so he has this whole research paper i read the entire paper many years ago and therefore people say that they are entering the world of the unseen the unseen realm and when they enter the unseen realm this is this is caused by dmt so what would be the legal status of dmt uh likewise the pineal gland the role of the pineal gland was mentioned by some medieval philosophers like descartes descartes mentioned the pineal gland and the role of the pineal gland research on this is still scanty meaning if you check proper research on the pineal gland you will find that research on the pineal gland is actually still scanty people still do not know the entire role of the pineal gland so what is the legal status of dmt what what is the legal ruling of dmt firstly there is no proof scientific proof that when a person takes the dmt that they are actually and by the way there are also south american methods of taking a drink form there are particular names for this drink if you do your research you will find the names of those particular drinks that they have high content of dmt so when they drink they hallucinate and see so many different things what is the legal status of those drinks as well as the dmt which is given the answer is in islam this would be impermissible because it would fall under halluci hallucinative drugs drugs which give you hallucination there is no scientific or religious proof to say that when people consume dmt they are entering the world of the rape if someone wants spirituality spirituality is not attained through taking intoxications like dmt or cannabis spirituality is attained through spirituality is attained through tahajjud pre-dawn prayer spirituality is attained through maintaining the sharia of allah and increasing the so the answer regarding dmt is that there is no proof to say that it is a spirit molecule in fact the scientists reject this reset if you do if you do your own reading you will find that they question this research uh that is written in dmt the spirit molecule and the role of the pineal gland is still unknown so these are some of the uh things that i wanted to cover with regard to cannabis before finishing i'll recommend a book which is written about marijuana and mental illness and violence this book tell your children this is a good book to read tell your children the book is by alex berenson a journalist from america he has a lot of opposition from the anti the pro-cannabis the pro-cannabis lobby in america so they oppose him but the book is a good book to read and then tell your children the truth about marijuana mental illness and violence and there is much more to be said with regard to mental illness and violence uh he mentions many statistics for instance that you will find interesting in this book statistics as to how research developed with regard to cannabis ask allah to benefit us from what has been said stay away from cannabis as a recreational drug stay away from thc as a recreational drug only use thc or cbd if you're a thc sorry if your doctor has recommended cbd is permitted but thc is haram unless your doctor has recommended it for you small amounts of this will make someone's head spin the small amounts of thc inshallah we ask to safeguard our minds to keep our intellects intact do not listen to those who say cannabis is halal they have only ruined their own minds and brains and they will ruin your minds and brains also cannabis is haram as a recreational drug do not take it as a recreational drug and take your kids away from it if you know people who are dealing in cannabis report them to the police it is totally haram uh dealing in any of these illegal narcotics is is haram prohibited it destroys society it fragments society it breaks down society it causes crime it increases crime it causes prostitution and pimping and so many other vices that are occurring in our communities we ask allah to enable us to act upon what has been said was",

"hello everyone and welcome back to the channel I'm really glad to have you here in today's video we are going to talk about the power of hemp seed oil in terms of hair growth my experience with it and what I think about it in terms of the properties in and its effectiveness in boosting hair growth fighting hair loss and hair fall and stimulating new hair growth as well and just nourishing the hair in general so I purchased this brand this Australian brand while I was in Australia but any brand works best as long as it's organic as long as it's cold-pressed you need a gold cold-pressed there's also a food grade hemp seed oil that also works great it doesn't need to be the one specifically made for skincare so this hemp seed oil is absolutely stunning when it comes to boosting hair growth fighting hair loss and just nourishing the scalp and the hair follicles at its best so you could use it as is you just need to warm it up and then use it as a hair mask you can also add it to your shampoo just add a teaspoon or so if you don't have time or don't have the capacity to do a full on hair mask so is you could also use additional essential oils that also work with the hemp seed oil to stimulate the hair growth to help nourish the hair for example if you don't have sensitive scalp and sensitive hair you can use rosemary essential oil absolutely stunning it just works perfectly for stimulating the hair growth it works perfectly for nourishing the hair and for speeding speeding up the hair growth as well I've tried it but one problem with the rosemary essential oil is that you will feel a slight tingling and a slight not not burning but more like a slight tingling sensation in the scope and you do need to dilute it with a carrier oil so in this case if you are going to be using hemp seed oil it's a perfect carrier oil for any essential oils that you want to use on your hair and before that you also need to do a test patch to make sure that you do not have any allergies so you might want to add a little bit of hemp seed oil to your scope if you do sense that you or you feel that you might have some sort of allergies for hemp seed oil you might want to test it first out just choose a small part of your scalp and then put a layer on a thin layer of the hemp seed oil massage it through and then wait 24 hours if there's no reaction if there's no change in the external look of the skin or the scope or there's no tingling sensation or burning sensation then you're good to go but in most cases have seed oil is a very nourishing seed oil that rarely I develops a allergic reaction I've tried it and it works perfectly great so I advise you to give it a try other oils they could also use is castor oil you could also use olive oil you could also use almond oil sweet almond oil is also great as well but one of the best oils that works also for skin care and hair care is argan oil cold-pressed skin care argan oil absolutely stunning it also works great another one is black seed oil but help seed oil is great if you have access to it do use it let me know how it goes and make sure to warm it beforehand because warming it really helps to open up these skin follicles these hair care follicles to make the best use so I hope you enjoyed this video do let me know if you have tried it before or what is your best go-to oil for hair care have a great day and take care bye bye", "_PvdG6xVJUc": "back pain is a problem that many people deal with every day and for some has become an everyday part of life as soon as you wake up you can feel the pain you've tried everything they over the counter medication the muscle relaxers and all the stretches most days it just seems like there will never be any relief a source of relief that you may have heard of but not explored yet CBD and CBD creams in the next few minutes I'm going to walk you through what CBD is and how it can offer relief of your back pain at the end of the video I will show you a product that has been used by many people to relieve their back pain and it's been proven to work first off what is CBD CBD oil comes from a plant called cannabis sativa the plant has over 100 chemical compounds called cannabinoids that have a range of effects including anti-inflammatory and pain relieving qualities the cannabis plant has two main varieties that are grown for specific purposes THC THC is the compound that's associated with the high feeling that you hear of people experiencing and then there are industrial uses this form of the plant contains very small amounts of THC usually like less than point zero three percent and can be used to make things like paper clothing some building material and this variation of the cannabis plant is called hemp and while CBD is present in both varieties many of the CBD products that are available to consumers are from the hemp plant CBD does not come with the high effects of marijuana so what are some of the ways that CBD can treat back pain well research indicates that CBD may reduce back pain by reducing inflammation also helping with the anxiety that's often associated with long lasting you know back pain the stresses that comes with dealing with that every day and helping with sleep and relaxation so some of the CBD products that are available are things like oils CBD oil can be taken orally it can be vaporized or mixed in other things like beverages oil is what is used in other CBD products just like creams and sprays but it can also be used alone they're also like CBD filled CBD oil filled capsules which are also available and provide the ability to more accurately determine dosing there are things called tinctures and a tincture is made by soaking the cannabis flowers and alcohol for a long period of time this process will extract the CBD into a more concentrated form that then what's usually found in most other CBD oil products and tinctures can be used on their own or they can be mixed with food or beverages there's edibles CBD can be mixed into food and drinks they can also be made at home by mixing CBD oil or tinctures into food and drinks examples include baked goods gummies and chocolates then there are creams and gels CBD infused lotions are considered topical because they are applied to the skin CBD creams and gels are absorbed by the skin which makes them a good solution to back or neck pain and why they have been shown to reduce inflammatory and neuropathic pain why use topicals so CBD cream is highly effective when it comes to treating very specific areas of the body which allows you to focus on the specific part of your body that's experiencing pain for example if you use CBD oil to create to treat a specific sore muscle or pain in your back you will experience pain relief that is generally throughout the whole body but the actual pain in the muscle itself may not disappear completely so when you apply the CBD cream directly to the painful area the pain relieving effects of CBD are entirely focused on that specific area it can be compared to like taking ibuprofen and getting a massage so you take the ibuprofen and while it may offer you some relief to your entire body a massage is more like focusing on a specific area that's sore and dealing with it that way CBD comes in many different forms but topical application is ideal for treating back pain just because you can apply it directly to where the pain is compared to forms a CBD that need to pass through like your digestive system topical CBD effects can be experienced faster and it's controlled long-term release means that relief is lasting in some cases people have felt benefits of CBD topicals for days rather than hours can CBD make you high CBD cream will definitely not cause you to get high in fact the only way in which CBD products such as edibles or tinctures or oils or creams could cause you to get high is when they contain elevated amounts of THC the CBD creams have very little or no THC which means you don't have to worry about those high effects that you may have heard of so now that you know a little more about CBD and CBD creams I'm sure you're ready to try it out below is a product that I recommend and based on reviews it's been proven to give relief to many people that have tried it out review state that is taken effect in as little as 10 to 15 minutes and has provided relief that has allowed people to function throughout the day many people have reported that they have been able to decrease the amount of ibuprofen and muscle relaxers that they've taken which has allowed them to live a better life day to day so check the link below check the product out let me know what you think and let me know in the comments if it has

over the past few years but they are different products that offer distinct benefits both compounds are derived from different varieties of cannabis plants cbd oil is extracted from leaves flowers and stems of the cannabis sativa plant while hemp oil is made from the leaves flowers and stems of the hemp plant both oils are associated with cannabis but what's the real difference between them cbd is short for cannabidiol which happens to be an active ingredient in cannabis plants while some cbd oils do have low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol thc it is not enough to experience the euphoric feeling associated with other thc infused products on the market cbd is sold over the counter as a remedy for pain relief and neurological disorders some studies claim that it helps improve moods and can even lower blood pressure and improve blood circulation cbd oil interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system cannabidiol works with the body's own endocannabinoid system which is a complex cell signaling system experts don't completely understand how cbd interacts with this system but they seem to think that it helps to treat certain ailments as well as regulate sleep mood memory nausea and appetite hemp oil might contain low levels of cbd but not enough to have the same benefits as cbd oil however there are many brands of cbd hemp oil on the market it is worth noting that hemp oil and hemp seed oil are sometimes advertised as the same thing but they have differences hemp seed oil differs from hemp oil in that it is manufactured from the seeds of the hemp plant because of that process hemp seed oil does not contain much cbd or thc as a result hemp oil is used in beauty products for its moisturizing capabilities because it is loaded with healthy fats it is also used for cooking or taken as a supplement don't forget to subscribe our channel", "Gbgzultq114": "pd may boost signaling through these same serotonin receptors leading to similar reductions in anxiety existing pre-clinical evidence strongly supports cbd as a treatment for several anxiety related conditions including generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder studies have found cbd to be particularly effective in treating acute anxiety that comes from knowing something potentially frightening or uncomfortable is about to happen like taking an exam cbd has also been shown to decrease symptoms of social anxiety disorder which is when you fear situations like meeting a lot of new people or having to do public speaking it is even demonstrated the ability to help wipe out fear memories in those with ptsd now this is just what's been found in the lab however patients using cbd have confirmed what the studies have shown in their own experiences they've reported feeling less anxious having fewer of the racing thoughts associated with anxiety and having either eliminated their panic attacks or experiencing fewer attacks or attacks that were less severe now let's talk about what type of cbd oil is best for treating anxiety as you may know cbd oils can be made from the hemp plant or the marijuana plant the difference between the two is that cbd oil made from hemp is going to have less than 0.3 percent thc thc is the component of cannabis that leads to the high commonly associated with smoking marijuana thc is also the component that leads to the other attribute often associated with smoking marijuana the paranoia now obviously those taking a cannabis derived product for anxiety would be trying to avoid anything that could induce paranoia which is why it's so important to choose the right cbd oil for this as hemp derived cbd is going to have less than 0.3 percent thc it's advisable to use hemp derived instead of marijuana derived cbd and ideally you would want to find cbd oil that has zero thc finally let's cover what dose of cbd oil is effective in treating anxiety this is where it's helpful to seek out a practitioner who's versed in cbd treatments however should you wish to try it on your own you need to take into consideration three elements that affect dosing first cbd oils come in a wide variety of potencies so it's imperative to use one with clearly labeled doses on the bottle second people come in a wide range of sizes so what works for a tiny person may have no effect on someone larger lastly the length of time the cbd will be effective can vary based on both a person's weight and how well they absorb it taking all of these into consideration it's best to start with a low dose take notes of how much you took and how you felt and then increase as necessary until you've reached a dose that works for you research on cbd has found few to no negative side effects this means cbd oil may be a good option for people who don't tolerate the side effects of other anxiety medications and one last note well i may be a doctor i am not your doctor so please consult with your own personal physician before starting a cbd regimen especially if you are pregnant breastfeeding or are on other prescription medications in addition if you're currently taking prescription meds for your anxiety please do not discontinue use without physician supervision if this video has been helpful please like and subscribe for the most up-to-date cbd information you", "wgj2ySwmjMg": "hi I'm Katherine certified nutrition consultant with foods that heal you and I'm going to talk about CBD hemp oil and how it might be able to help you with your arthritis pain there are a couple different types of arthritis there's osteoarthritis which is the deterioration of the joints and then there is rheumatoid arthritis which is an autoimmune disease so CBD hemp oil can help reduce inflammation in the body to help reduce pain from arthritis and I'll go through a couple different suggestions or types of CBD oil that might help you address the arthritis that you're suffering from but a couple other things to note is that CBD oil there is more evidence now that it might actually help stop or slow the progression of autoimmune disease because autoimmune disease starts in the gut with the leaky gut so there's a lot more going on with autoimmune disease but the CBD oil is a great supplement and a great place to start you'll want to do other things like probiotics and there's just a lot of other things you want to do and you can always schedule consult with me if you'd like help with further addressing that but then osteoarthritis is the deterioration of the joints so that's going to have a different route and you'll want to address the pain of course again which is helping reduce the inflammation but CBD oil is also shown to promote bone growth now I'm not saying is gonna regenerate your joint or anything but anything that's gonna help promote strength and bone growth like collagen protein powder is really excellent or bone broth is even better but homemade bone broth that's really great for both autoimmune and for joints so alright so moving forward here the different types of CBD oil that I would recommend for arthritis you it depends first of all on the level of your pain but if you have rheumatoid arthritis oh I will I guess or osteoarthritis the full spectrum is probably going to be a great choice or best choice for both of those the full spectrum would be like the pure oil concentrates I've got the gold here the green or the blue would both be really great choices as well they're full spectrum the Tacey drops our full spectrum they might not be quite as concentrated or strong but they're still full spectrum and the reason I I'm in full spectrum is gonna have all the plant properties and compounds which promotes healing so if you buy if you're looking for something that's just gonna strictly reduce inflammation and you're not concerned about any other yield potential healing properties then you could always try the vapeshot it's fast-acting I really like this I personally use this for helping with daytime just to calm me down if I'm having a tough day or stress this is not full spectrum but it's extremely effective against inflammation so all of them are gonna be great for inflammation it really depends on what you're looking for again I like four different things like autoimmune disease I like the full spectrum and then another thing you can do is we have a topical muscle salve right here AB annoyed that's also on my website which I forgot to tell you the link to my website will be below this video and but anyway this salve and I've been using it for an old egg ankle injury as you can see it's a real it's in Nice check texture I really like this but you can just use that for localized pain for example I have people with arthritis in their hands or their knees it works really great it's working great for my ankle it can work really great for local pain or even skin conditions but that I would recommend in addition to the gold the pure oil concentrate or the vape or whatever you choose internally is the best way to address inflammation but like with my ankle I noticed that the internal wasn't quite cutting it for my ankle you know the problems I was having with some aching and stuff where is the salve it was a direct topical solution that has just kind like icing on the cake in my opinion I wouldn't personally use just the SAP I would start if you're on a budget I would start with one of the it oral solutions of the CBD hemp oil and then but if you can afford it I would absolutely recommend adding on the topical safe and there might be some situations if you only have for example some arthritis in your hands which a lot of people do actually then the topical solution might be enough for you it's really up to you it's experimental because everyone's different on what works best for them how much they need I'm just trying to educate you to help you make the best decision for yourself and then also I have articles if you can follow us in my community on Facebook and ask questions on there learn more on there you can subscribe to my youtube channel I really want to help educate people on the health benefit and how CBD hemp oil can really help reduce inflammation and help you live a more pain-free life so thank you for watching this video and I'll see you in the next one"}
