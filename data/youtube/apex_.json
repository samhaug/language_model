let's get into today's clips low just keep dodging just keep dodging oh my god what you're nuts i hit her a little bit [Applause] see firing arm down trust in the decoy become one with the decoy [Music] you got bamboo look at you you got bamboozled um [Music] yeah okay i saw you buy it i fell off the map so guys we all know of fuse's knuckle cluster but how does a cluster missile sound to you apex legends intel expert shrugtel may have found some code that hints towards a new ability he posts that while looking through the most recent bits of code he finds missile multiple target data according to shrugtel it doesn't really have a purpose to be in this patch and so it could be something that's used for an upcoming legend you may think that this could relate to bangalore's ultimate however the description for cluster missile states this fire a rocket that explodes multiple times this is definitely different from a bangalore missile barrage so could this be something that was meant to be given to fuse or could this be something that's coming up for a future legend and if so how exactly would you like to see it work personally we can see it working somewhat similar to a cruise missile in call of duty but i'm sure with apex being as creative and crazy as it is there are multiple ways in which this could happen let us know all your thoughts in the comments section down below and if you'd like to check out this full post you can find shrug towels twitter link in the description below foreign no want to see my singularity all remember guys always protect the gold

video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some revenant who i love playing but he is looked down upon so much at the moment whenever king's canyon is the ranked map on apex revenant becomes a menace and it's because king's canyon is quite bad for third parties and with revolt you can get a no risk full send third party because if it goes bad you just spawn back in the safety of your totem with 150 health also when octane's jump pad got buffed recently this combination got far more annoying because of the distance that you can cover for your entire team you can third party someone half the map what it feels like but it's a fun legend to play i love his design and voice lines they're amazing and also in the first game of today's video i'm trying to get used to a regular ps4 controller i usually play on a scuff but mine is just broken so my aim is shaky in some parts but it's still decent it's not too bad considering i'm trying to use a new controller but yeah thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'll go here i'm running this one comes up um i went below i think there's two down here with me so i might be dead uh don't worry man i've got a mozam and white armor oh i got a ball okay okay and this oh i'm taking the report so many teams a lot of teams down there okay they're all what's going on dog i'm coming up oh thank you huge one boiler more people down there uh i have a med kit hold my house on the ground okay nice that's nice yeah i got my kill which is good and there were two more people so if you need those let me know i don't need them um i have two cells i can take them i drop something lt's on 50 scan i forget that i crouch quicker something i always forget about rev yeah crouch is kind of nice you can creep up really nicely rising's cracked oh oh okay i think they'll still live get in here somewhere we're going to spain another team are you kidding or anything i have a 301 with no meg so annoying such a broken jab another one below at some point i'm gonna have to use an uh a a horizontal at some point cracked wait behind me i think this is yeah all right we're in the middle of two teams i'm like extended so that path and that octane i think got away right uh oh yeah this way oh my god how annoying wait look at them just go i'm never going to catch up to these guys either they're so fast that is gone bunch of speeding boys you know made kind of i think yeah just beneath me last few squads wish i had my old seat this is a nice place for silence well there's probably some there though anything yeah it's really it's really flexible i just can't wait to do that i completely get that way too much effort okay i gotta be on this side of the map right yeah they have to surely didn't react to all that shooting so oh yeah over here i have my oh my god i'm gonna put my where is he i don't know i hear him the rev oh back there i thought one of them went in here oh maybe maybe that's what that was he just quick scoped you well these guys they're in here on this building he thinks i'm cracked oh boxing nice just loving the box to do that i still want a game mode where you can pick the same legends i want to see one playing pathfinder i mean how that would just be it would just be the greatest ever or just everyone yes it doesn't have to be here for two weeks just like two days three days a game automatically picks it for everyone so it's like everyone's just playing and if it sucks you're getting lucky it's like everyone's playing watson it's like oh but then you imagine everyone's playing fuse the whole map's on fire i had the greatest idea for a video um you you come in like as the dummies you know you know no no hip no difference in hitboxes name it boxes everything and um you have a you have like your ability and every time you use a like you start off with maybe like a bubble and then every time you use the ability it changes oh my god this crack goes behind you oh there he is or maybe it wasn't crater i think he charged since not me that's mine usually again we're getting all scared for nothing i know he's getting annoyed that's what you have a thing you know the crab clip i had the other day um my mom reminded me where you were trying to like save me and the one where you went like 12 or 12 right uh oh yeah it's that one killed like 14 do you reckon if you get crave a hedge i mean the crab is already disintegrate just explode just do a thousand damage you just explode you can't be rest your banner can't be picked up just but you're new game it just automatically uninstalls the game for you it's like go try this all right 100 they hurt ready ready oh he's blind well done genius my controllers disconnected oh my god i can't play bro where's the what is find this all right i don't know if the path i don't know but i'm gonna drop them no they're gonna go into the storm for heat shut down i'm giving them my second chance i'm giving them a second chance they don't even want to res i've only got two crabby shots left he's putting the right shield up for him they're still so scared fight do something cool i've got two shots left i'm just going to shoot to them go for it go for it go for it come on come on come on oh man behind that oh you got that one down okay the other one yeah yeah yeah what do you got he's down here somewhere oh he used on the other side of this okay one shot left right here right on the edge of the door right on the right on my ping [Music] oh my god it's a massacre nice when i when my audio is going bad my controller disconnects so i have to put it back in like the wire is kind of loose and like my pc wants to use is an audio source it gets confused for a second champions uh so what what is your excuse referring to um there is no excuse okay absolutely popped off with the crater", "IOTwXWC3jdQ": "welcome back to apex legends everyone today we're gonna jump right into ranked platinum all by ourselves to see is the ranked experience by yourself truly that bad well let's go jump right into it eh maybe we can get to uh predator along the way all right i'm excited to meet some of the platinum lads all right all right all right where to go of course we're gonna go here this is gonna be a hot drop that's my little nook and granny household so it seems like other people are coming here hmm i wonder if there's going to be any diamonds or predators in this match they're going to be in every single team i reckon nothing in my little favorite house oh that ain't good at all i need my beautiful havoc oh have okay guess we're not going to sleep on that way i'm making a uh a turbocharger cooking up a turbocharger turbocharged havoc do not sleep on the havoc oh god are they really pushing in there wait no i gotta get my i gotta get my turbocharger wait wait wait wait wait wait so it seems like there might not be some coordination coming don't leave the game don't leave the game let's see if we can clean this up then all right my teammate now myself so doing the same thing that i just did to my teammate looks like there is three of them there i know my team member will be here soon run by run now oh god there's another squad as well oh my lord she gonna push me but she doesn't even realize there's a team right there i gotta get my teammate though

go on save the team save the team come on boy you cannot beat us my team is here to protect me well in spirit at least and then i'm gonna heal and i'm gonna kill all of you you have ammo for me maybe i can kill you third party lad what are you guys doing you do not run away come back here that's it everyone's dead whoa and i'm not even the kill leader that's kind of scary to be honest hopefully my team will stay around me this time down there go go go go i love third partying oh but i hate getting third partied don't you dare shoot at me trying to warn them of our position oh god wait there's another team here oh i want to tango with the mango eh another squad okay let's go up there yep good idea wow that's some good strategy look at that decision making deciding to go the opposite direction of where all the squads are you know when you want a third party you just get third uh the heck why are we all down there surely they'll shoot each other nope they are all going to converge onto us uh how do i save my teammate i'm not oh my god i thought i could he left the game doesn't he get minus ranked points i was gonna respawn him no i could kind of see what uh troubles people will go through if their teammates leave but uh oh well let's continue all right here we go you think you're gonna so cold heal oh you are whoa you know i kind of despise the fact that people leave the game even in ranked let them fight let them fight let them fight they're gonna have a nice little time you know they're so happy right now look at them wow look at all this fighting isn't it amazing boom steal the kill oh if you third party me i'm gonna come back with a vengeance hopefully oh that's a vengeance all right all right come on what are you doing in front of me teammate i got a plan look at this double zipline double zipline ready boy steady oh my god okay that's a bad idea bad idea why have i done this man i shouldn't have told us to go up there i was so confident but confidence is sometimes a slow and insidious killer i guess we're just gonna have to become what's known as a rat but you hide in the corner and wait for them to attack each other and then your third party now this is the game player what sit back crack some knuckles ah hear that all right let's go for that team down here down here right this is gonna be a hard one oh it's three of them never mind never mind looks like we're gonna go this way more the guy in the water here oh there is oh my lord oh my lord that's the guys that killed us before it's just goddamn hard this is goddamn hard but we got points though baby came third just in the nick of time all right all right all right let us see what our gamers can do let's do this gamers no leaving this time alright alright alright where do we want to go then you know what maybe just a hot drop everyone loves a hot drop let us see if our boys are worthy straight away just right off the bat you know there's probably what's that two other squads and then some over there waiting the third party all right looking good looking good purple armor just for me and an afk revenant just for me oh okay please please stop doing this apex don't tease me like this right now not when i there's an enemy right here revenant grab this armor and help me out come on revenant grab the armor grab the army boy objective hold until revenant gets back oh my goodness all right here we go all right hit her in the head but except she's never going to peak again never mind i hate the 30 30. another squad attacking eh gonna have to grab our teammates

every kill they want makes me happy you know what it's time for a finisher protect me i'm finishing you take a little punch crypter i hurt you guys a lot damn he is just better kid all right looks like i've got a good teammate and hopefully they never leave the game of apex legends i think it's time to craft oh no oh you're so close to dead can i catch him off guard i'll try to oh my boy just caught him off guard right now i think that calls for a finisher nope it doesn't okay and i was going to end you in a nice finisher but i got shot by your teammates right if they're revenant does that mean we're about to revan at all all right they're portaling in they really want to get their teammates and i appreciate i don't need that if i'm going to just dominate her oh they did that anyways

if you enjoyed that road to predator remember to hit that notification bell and i feel brad we'll see you guys later", "QP3WptGICyg": "hi i'm water in this video we're going to be going over how fuse will be getting a buff and then a nerf they want to give octane there's no denying that octane is one of the most picked legends so it does appear that they are trying to lower his power i'm gonna get into the octane nerf that they have planned but starting off from daniel klein he says rampart has the second lowest in our win rate data across all skill buckets and the only one below her is fuse rampart has the second lowest win rate and then fuse has the lowest win rate the argument of bad players play these legends and that's why their win rate is low doesn't work because this data is from all skill buckets when it comes to fuse seeing as he does have the lowest win rate he says we have some plans for him but nothing's 100 yet but yeah he didn't come in super strong like we wanted it's still very hard to predict how strong a character will be unless they have a meaningful mobility like octane horizon if you had the opportunity to buff fuse what ability would you hit as i would say his ultimate or even a rework as to how some of the abilities work but it is clear that fuse does need a little extra power we've got to be careful not to fall victim to mobility creep as well the more general mobility there is the less fun the game becomes for everybody because you can't just hit people this is why removing some of that power from horizon we are just reducing how quickly you can wiggle back and forth as you go up her gravity lift to make tracking her a little easier in octanes while they are flying they are pretty trackable saying this though daniel still believes they need to hit him a little bit more as he's become extremely dominant they think they know how to shave a little power off in a reasonably fun neutral way and they're thinking about increasing the health cost for his stim but letting you stim again much sooner there's currently a three to four second delay between stems which this will be a small buff if you just look at the speed at which you move but taken together with the increased health cost it will allow you to drop your health real low real fast there isn't the information on how much the new stim will hit you for how much damage you'll actually do but this is how they plan to nerf octane and if you didn't catch the nerf verizon i went over they're reducing the straight speed and the gravity lift to make her more trackable i personally like how they're not touching octane's jump pad as it is one of his abilities for the team what are your thoughts on these legend changes we just got told views does have one of the lowest win rates so they are looking into giving him a buff and then for a rise in an octane they are looking into giving them a nerf it does appear they do not want her rise in the number one legend spot as she has constantly been receiving nerf so i'm wondering if this will be the last one make sure you're staying hydrated until next time it's been water and i'm out [Music] peace", "GC5-GcrTsnc": "hey everyone what's up and welcome back to the channel man today we are back on apex and i i got some interesting stuff to talk to you guys about today um it's kind of got me excited as you guys don't know i've been playing apex for a very very long time um i played since the first day it came out and we're past two years now the next milestone is three years that's pretty crazy to say but i think the only other game i can compare apex to in terms of long-term success it's fortnite oh boy is he coming up okay let's handle the squad quick oh get up pop the medi quick he's resting his boy i'mma block him in got him there we go absolutely destroyed man i know some of you may not like fortnite i know a lot of you guys actually do like fortnite i'm sure there's a lot of people who play apex who like fortnite i don't care what anybody says i feel like they're somewhat in the same realm of you know animation and type of game i know there's fans out there but fortnite has expanded way beyond just battle royale and it's really taken their game to the next level because it appeals to so many audiences so many people enjoy the game if you don't want to sweat it out you can just literally basically go play the equivalent to minecraft in fortnite you got people over here let me go check it out but apex put out a statement and i'm gonna put it on screen so you guys can read it here but essentially they said that in 2021 they're going to expand the ways we can play apex beyond battle royale and i couldn't be any more excited about it man i would say that that's the one reason why i kind of get tired of apex i love the characters i love the legends the lore everything about it but sometimes i literally just don't want to drop in to a 60 man game and be the last one standing hmm don't kill me oh you would kill me gibster gypster noise horizon can you toss me a tactical to get me out of this ring of fire oh thankfully for the res that's amazing i'm gonna get out of here quick we're going we're going oh get me out of this mess yeah like i was saying we're gonna be able to play new ways of apex outside of battle royale now i've been kind of keeping my you know eyes on the data mining scene in apex through the people who go into the game files to take a look at all the new things coming to the game and uh it said that apex legends arenas is going to be making its way to the game sometime soon now i'm assuming that this is what apex legends was talking about in that statement and they're talking about new ways to play the game i gotta get out of here bro we gotta get out of here quick real quick inside inside catch the zip down nice that boy got absolutely destroyed give me all this heals quick we're in this game for the long haul okay we're going to survive his boy's coming just through here hold up let me get him let me get him what's up son here we go eat them alive baby breakfast lunch and dinner oh my god there's even more are you kidding me there's so many enemies this is wild the problem is i'm out of bullets here i'm in big trouble i'm gonna go down and get this uh fusey's banner and then take his ammo energy i can live with now it arena's game mode that i was talking about is going to consist of from what i've heard of 3v3 gameplay it's going to be completely different from what we've been seeing um oh god okay you know what i might i might actually need to get out of this this is a little too much for me i just don't have the ammo to do it i would stick around but i can't there's also been talks that uh loadouts could be making their way to apex as well with this 3v3 gameplay obviously you know you're not going to go into a little a little box cut arena looking to loot up all of your guns and stuff like that like that just wouldn't be practical so you might be able to choose your loadout before you go into the game like maybe you want an r99 in the mastiff or literally whatever you want or maybe there might be a buy system there's kind of a million ways they could go about it i don't really know what they plan on doing um and everything is kind of subject to change like this isn't even a confirmed game mode this is going strictly off of leaks and stuff like that but either way i'm sure they'll pull it off i think the closest thing we've gotten to that is winter express if you guys remember back in the christmas event you kind of spawned in with a pre-designated loadout that was disgusting that was a monstrous beam another one another one dead another one bites the dust and that is a full team mic let's go okay this has been a crazy game it's been super hairy you really still want the smoke buddy we cracked him up and everything oh god another one over there pop a quick cell we got to get a rotate left here now in terms of the maps like this is kind of a weird commentary to be honest like i'm i'm having to like fight a team say a little bit fight another team say another little bit this is freaking intense man and this is a way or something other than battle royale would honestly be refreshing like even from a content creator's perspective where i can just kind of relax a little bit more sit back and just you know battle it out without constantly having to worry about third parties and all that it would be more enjoyable but in terms of where we would be fighting um you know once again from the data miners i've heard that it's going to be designated pois chopped up into baby arenas i also got to go rest my teammates um yeah so like for example containment could be an area artillery could be an area a gauntlet could be a little map of its own and i don't know how they would cut it off i don't even know that they would be good arenas because when you think of like map design and call of duty they're three lane maps and they're all set up to be strategically played out for the players so that they have lanes to push you know there's a there's a lot that goes into map design other than just chopping up a baby portion i don't think i can stress enough how important the design of the map is going to be because um this is supposed to be competitive like i said there's going to be a ranked playlist for this game mode okay let's go get these guys quick hold up oh no no no no get inside quick can't get fried i'm trying to think of the best way to go about this got a battery got her she got her soul melted daughter team white beauty okay we we gotta clean up here this is this is the finale of the game man look at the make their way get out of here bro you boys stonks man your boy stonks oh we are beaming today we are literally beaming got him i think the other guy died perfect absolutely perfect let's get a heat shield down so yeah like from what i've talked about so far let me know what you guys think man does this sound like a good idea ultimately i just think that anything other than battle royale is going to be really healthy for the game it'll attract new audiences and there might even be a fan base that doesn't even play apex for its battle royale another big question i have about the mode and how it's going to operate is like the legends abilities i kind of wonder if it's gonna be an ability-less 3v3 tactical scenario or if it's going to provide a completely fresh experience because i don't think there's another game out there that provides ranked 3v3 gameplay with abilities this also isn't going to be like a search and destroy type of gameplay setting where if you die you don't come back there's going to be respawns available in this game mode so the only other thing i can really think of that might compare to this is rogue company you guys know i play rogue a lot of you guys have seen the game before and there's a game mode in that in that game called strikeout where basically there is respawns but after your team uses up like 30 extra lives there is no coming back and then it's up to the rest of your team to clutch up with the remaining amount of lives they have available so maybe that's how it could work i could definitely see that being like a really good competitive type of game mode i think it could work let's heal up there's only four teams here we gotta clutch up i want the dub bad there's too many scenarios where i'll peak in a situation like this where i'm low health even though i think they can't see me and then i'll get knocked and then i just get super mad because it literally blows the game they'll choke on the res and it just gets ugly so let's converge on this i i want to take these guys out they're getting 30 they're pinched in between us now creeper craver you say i'm coming oh no he picked it up he picked it up one guy right here oh look at them all get fried man no no horizon oh no okay i can't oh get me out of here please for the love of god for the love of god get me out of here oh thank god we have no no hold up hold up hold up hold up verizon tactical tactical give me tactical shoot okay i'm gonna crawl down i gotta get inside i gotta get inside or this is gonna be the game i'm in i'm in horizon come back downstairs downstairs downstairs oh no what a tragic ending to the game i was trying to push the talk to talk to her to tell me to give us a tactical so we could get the flip out of there man but she just ended up running away anyways we got 10 kills a little 3 000 damage i just want to share some of that news with you guys let me know what you think of it hopefully you all enjoy the game i'd really like to know down the comments especially if a different version of apex came out like a 3v3 competitive team deathmatch would you guys still play battle royale do you think you would like the 3v3 better or would you still stick to the battle royale scenario so yeah with that being said hopefully you enjoyed it once again make sure you guys leave a comment i'd like to hear you guys thoughts and opinions i'll catch you on the next one subscribe if you're new around here we're so close to 400 000 subscribers and uh yeah catch you guys the next one peace out", "vPXt_EVrcRk": "hey everyone i hope you're well today we're going to be taking a look at the new update what's changed in it and the final ring fury mode now this one gets kind of crazy in my opinion it looks a lot of fun so once we're dropping down we can kind of talk about the new update um yeah we'll land here sean i'm gonna go here so what they've done is is they've added a new thing here called the survival slot button under the controller settings so if you're on controller and you have an heirloom or yeah you have an lm and you want to run and inspect your weapon so for example you got the kunai and you want to twirl it then you can now turn off the survival slot button and it will give you access to the inspect what's running again so it's going to allow you to kind of inspect your weapons um a lot easier instead of having to go into this menu here definitely a good change um besides that they have what else have they done if you got the watson skin from the collection event they're actually refunding anyone that bought it so whether you bought it from crafting or legend tokens you'll get a refund and you'll keep the skin and the reason they've done that is because the textures were glitched and it showed that you'll get this cool sort of white watson skin but obviously it was just a glitch texture um and now it's a lot different um so yeah obviously it's kind of like falsely showing it there's an accident on their hand and they've kind of made up for it you know which is really cool and yeah but you still get to keep the skin even if you bought it so a win-win a win-win i'd say and of course this new game motorcycle squad oh god dude i'm not feeling that look at them coming out no they're not it's not what's quite is it what are they doing damage farming [Music] but they don't have any armor right [Music] we're gonna win this oh we're not gonna win this oh oh scary dude let's get back in here a second all right so now that that's done we've got the survival slot we've got the watson refund and the new ring fury game mode i don't think they've done anything else i'm not too sure obviously they fixed all the skins that had these problems in the first place so that's always good um yeah but besides that we just have this crazy updated mode and as you can see things are pretty crazy so i think there's a maximum of 20 sort of small ring flares at a time right but the crazy thing is once the play area gets smaller 20 ring flares in a tiny play area gonna be mad so hopefully we have some good action here hoping so i got my ride stuck dude going on foot now going on foot firstly i've enjoyed i've enjoyed this game mode um i didn't enjoy the one where it was like the basically the entirety of king's canyon or half the size of king's canyon when it was in the middle but every other um every other stage of this i have the only complaint is i do wish it was still a limited time mode instead of a takeover mode i think that takeover modes kind of you know sometimes i just want to play classic vanilla apex oh my god oh my goodness crap we go over here quick enough we can quickly pop a bat full speed rotate around this way don't want to get too involved and we've got to play smart when we're alone different approach i don't really know what i'm doing with this charge rifle but i'm missing my shots as well oh i see yeah kind of awkward not gonna lie actually you know what i'm gonna take that spitfire because i don't want this charge rifle dude come on come on come on come on below me i think oh dude freddie java come on this is where we gonna wait for the third parties to come and chill with each other you know just just have meet each other i've introduced these two teams to them to each other now so we should be good i seem like a pre-made squad the way they are rolling up on us not gonna lie did they win their fight i think they did oh i'm leaving i'm leaving yeah you gotta pick your fights carefully when you go solo because i i would die there there's eight squads left so hopefully we get to see round one i wanted to see the carnage that unfolds when there's like round three and a bunch of squads and all the rings on the map like 20 of these now isn't such a big deal because i mean that the player is already already so large okay there they are dude going to a ring flat enter a ring flat i just like the way you can like really escape quite easily when you have these ring flare things i need to pick up some more now i've got one left it's not so bad we're now fighting in there again there's people fighting there as well go for this fight we go for this fight that dude thank you please have armor dude oh my goodness no this store only has one kick on it please nobody find me dude i'm taking that okay you know i want that on there like that but this is my forte if you can pick around on these guys something now oh no we need to leave oh wait they're fighting each other dude there's no chance no it's not run run run run run i think we're dead now how do we make it out dude go phase runner yeah oh that's scary almost died all right come on we uh look look at how many ring flares there are man but there's still going to be more what's that oh they're coming run dude i can't fight them what that dude right here hammer you better run what that dude i don't care i'm going through there's no ring flares near here though what round is this oh wait it doesn't matter i can just do it right here dude you just pop it right here right do you think we can get the trident dude i'm scared okay round two we got two med kits we'll be fine we'll be fine are we gonna be able to get back into the ring a long way to go we only got one one uh thingy finger thingy so apparently you can kind of like i don't even want to try it dude somebody got one left and like wedge it into the trident like it doesn't fit on like a normal ability but you can wedge it on there i'm worried i'll drop it and then have it when i not have it when i need it you know like i'm gonna need it any second all right how about here come in put it it up there we go just crazy man now we just zoom into the ring all right we'll just go over the building no problem under there all right i've got my trailer a little bit stuck but we're alive that's the important thing okay i tried it out never mind there's another one up there see what's going on here dude if we can get a little peek on this fight coming to me i think if he won there ah the ring flares are coming you know what i think we go around i don't like this i'm going around dude i'm too scared i need one damage thank you we're running out of ammo there's four squads left dude i come ah why wouldn't it destroy what i gotta shoot it kidding me dude there's someone over there for creeper as well oh come on that's going to be tweaked right come on come on come on come on okay go go go this go some light ammo there the time i need a new heat shield what i'm marvin almost like what weapon is that that looks crazy dude all right all right all right all right okay right there oh no i think we're dead dude i think we're dead dude oh no dude come on quick quick quick quick oh we're dead no oh man ah well i think we did our best that's crazy dude that was crazy all right well gg thanks for watching everyone i hope you enjoyed this video let me know what you think and i'll see you all in the comments", "B79HCjHY0Aw": "hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i have what i believe is my highest kill game of the season so far it's quite difficult to get damage and kill credit when the people you play with are jenks and so far who are obviously incredibly good players and also main octanes they're always in the fight first it's tricky last season i got a 4k badge whilst playing with so far just because he was practicing mouse and keyboard so it allowed me to step up to the plate and put in a performance you know hope you enjoyed today's gameplay thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends best bangalore skin ever by the way really good we're going to be matching we're going to be matching two again oh yeah come on badgers let's go intimidating 7 19 13 in successive seasons that's progression right there in the progression i'm going straight to the middle part i'm going to land in this tree i'll come with you we'll land together i'll go straight down with you hopefully not just the windows track signing down the other side i'll meet you in there okay i'm down

launcher i dropped this i dropped a blue up top but you need to hear oh no maybe you don't i picked one up don't tell me not even looking crap wow he turned around and uh he went for it you gotta respect 120 here 120. i took the vault extended like magazine here level 2 ammo did you hear the fight down though as well i did hold on here hold on here let me do a thing here gonna put it on the wrench i missed it it still might work though oh beautiful it was here i see some crates some death boxes all the way to the other side thinking that they were in here and they're not oh they took a pad oh i'm not [Music] hit one he jumped on me he jumped on me i i hit him a little bit he's probably got 20 shields 20 shield totals he's on a bat right now purple oh no you're you're ticking you got the bat though i gotcha that was the last of us another squad you can switch this purple up top either one well thank you three zero rings close oh okay horizon just flying through the air that was kind of funny i was not expecting that no what was i ten seconds healing that's a fun stop six kills a thousand damage okay yeah all you dude you're cooking i'm gonna need to find some light ammo i have uh i've got i can drop you soon that second stack is just one bullet situation like that i uh wish i would have had a little bit yeah yeah i was trying to i was trying to fight up close that bloodhound with my repeater and it was like see there's so much i can do that's the problem i was having before i was no scoping i was zooming in it's difficult it's honestly kind of tough you're really limiting yourself whereas if i had a nine you just would have died yeah to the right i thought i heard to the right too yeah yep that was the whole 411 bullets is a beamer it is is that what i was going to say no you i thought you're going to say nice title the r3l1 is a beamer yeah like have you guys tried the arthur one we're in season 8 of apex legends are you familiar with the r301 it's been good since day one it is good though it is good i i wasn't lying [Music] launch my smoke from the smoke launcher crazy not to let him fly i guess extra damaging might accidentally get a kill too imagine ah one day i'm right behind you i heard your smoke and i thought i heard a footstep but then it was like your footstep in combination with the smoke not even looking not even looking oh he would look let's get in there that's like my favorite thing about octane when you hit a pad you just kind of like go yeah oh yeah it's the go bun i'm gonna hawk yeah yeah must go faster it's gonna be a big nade trust it's the biggest name i've ever done in my life to the right okay it was a zero it's a zero zero this is the biggest i've ever thought of this was huge no that was a little short it was almost the biggest need though huge thermite octane got purple oh i messed up oh i messed up who am i getting shot from give my shield i don't know why this guy is so trying to thirst me why thirst me do you not hear like three teams fighting each other nice i have a phoenix v if you need it do you need it yeah drops it dropped it dropped it if you slide into that pad i think i got it perfect where you'll slide perfectly into the other side 100 i'm dead i don't know why i challenged that he's not going to push he's not pushing you're looking this psycho will be pushed he's got 20 health replicators coming in for a landing thank you give me a second charging i mean he's heard that gun somewhere uh he has one single hp one one single hp in here yeah yeah [Music] eat through all of it i have a ton i can drop i'm dropping a lot of energy i just don't want vaults i don't find any there's 130 here 77 in this box and then another 60 on the ground ah thank you perfect right when i dropped my vault i found all the energy and the extending mags and everything that i needed oh my god this this place is just a mess the energy d-pod dude i love it here the old energy d-pad i am looted i have so much light i'm dropping some light i'm picking some back up get it together i need light i'm dropping some light i have too much light i'm picking it up yeah i'm picking it back up i'm running i'm going on a rope i was keeping you updated and what's going on the play by play yeah yeah all right not even looking we're just going in once again it's the play oh it was a really wimpy pass i should have waited that was a wimpy oh just he would have been a good one well we got another one right here this one we prepared earlier i was just sitting there marinating waiting for us to come back a second time hello we're inside the ring one last thing first you lose your cool then you lose your head where the people are there was a package down here somewhere wasn't there i saw a light and now i don't see a light so wherever it landed i don't know where i landed though it was somewhere in this direction i thought right oh right yeah right right hedge on this ramp yeah blue armor on one i'm gonna go die again oh jump massive shot give my shields a reach up get ready for a light show what have we got in here hopefully these guys have some throwballs because i do not need 412 you get what'd you get nothing a purple knock down shield and a purple shield oh god i know right literally scammed it getting worse and worse i mean there's only two squads left so it better be something good should not be in packages bro guns should not be if i have one and i can just change out the site if i wanted to i don't want a variable scope yeah i just it's i'm just baffled by it i don't know whose idea that was but that was not it that was not it would have been nice when the game came out because those videos were bangers those are good yeah it was just fun finding a golf gun i'm gonna put it all on the line this place freaks me out honestly rings next door when we came from all right fellas get it together we came from this way though right so i don't know if anyone would be this way unless they underestimate the rats yeah half of one i see anything to solo this package is open hmm they dropped a gun for it this is a fresh one mozam gold beak and they dropped here somebody dropped a nine i probably have a problem let's go let's go they're dropping an smg i don't know i don't know what to do oh right ahead they dropped off the charge awesome mirage

decide to not ping it so my teammates are not inclined to [ __ ] slow our rotate down before you go and jordan let me sound like i'm blind what if snipe needs a ball then i don't get then i don't give

right now what is going on boom no [ __ ] [ __ ] on", "4FvXcylXUCM": "[Music] what's up gamers hope you all having a great day today we have some pretty intriguing topics to talk about today ea crossing the line big time in my opinion but what do you expect it's ea we're gonna talk about that also one of our biggest and favorite youtube streamers getting hit with a seven day suspension not even able to play the algs tournament and as always got some really good and juicy news between the drama between the players and the respawn developers and as always we got a gold nugget at the end of the video so as many of you know i was waxing my leg hair if we hit 1 000 subscribers in five videos in a row well unfortunately we didn't hit on the last one but there was actually a glitch with youtube where everyone that posted on that day's video did really really bad so what i decided to do is i will still wax my leg hair if a we hit 1000 subscribers for the next three videos or if we hit 3000 subscribers off of this video then i'll go ahead and do it next week and considering about 30 to 40 000 people watching this aren't even subscribed it's literally so easy you get to watch me wax my leg hair and be in pain for free just by clicking subscribe alright so to kick it off we got some drama between some respawn developers and the players not just pros actual just your casual gamer so people like you that just play the game for fun and this is what he had to say i'ma chop it up a little bit so you understand i don't read the full thing basically what he's saying is that apex is so bad or in a bad state right now because of the rng we've always talked about this before you know we really need to start with like basically what locked and loaded was all he's pushing for here is for locked and loaded to be permanent respawn has already talked about doing that so i don't know why this guy is freaking out but a respawn developer actually tweeted this daniel klein saying come do game dev where internet randos explain your job to you the irony is dead and so as always with this tweet it divided people into two separate groups or honestly even a third group which i think i'm a part of number one you completely agree with the guy and hate respawn number two you agree with respawn and hate this guy or number three you think the guy is right but he's a little overboard with the way that he's talking to respawn here things like i don't know why you cater to bad players you need to make locked and loaded permanent or else it 100 will not be played in a decade basically giving good valid points which by the way i do agree with just delivering the message in a more bashful way so when daniel tweeted this making light of the situation you had people that would agree with daniel and people that would say this guy's out of his mind and you would also have people that came in the comments saying look this guy's not wrong he just decided to share his opinion in a bad way i'm pretty sure that he's right the 99 percent of the good players want the ltm to be permanent maybe remove the mozambique because the starting weapon though not having to loot the whole game was so much fun and even another youtuber chicken nugget which you guys probably heard me talk about before saying the delivery is pretty cringe which we all agree with this guy was a little overboard but i hard agree with what this guy's saying and then he says wow the devs are clueless and honestly i don't really like to bash the devs too much because i don't want to ever come after someone i know that they're trying to do their best honestly they don't show up to work and in hopes of destroying the game i believe they all have good intentions it just bothers me that they're making light of a situation acting like this guy's out of his mind when in reality if you think he's out of his mind you're probably not watching any twitch streamers or listening to any community out there because from most everywhere i've heard everyone really liked the locked and loaded and wanted it to be permanent before it went away that was all i saw in my timeline was make this ltm permanent so let me know down in the comments what you think of this situation like i said i think this guy is a little bit overboard but it is weird to see them make fun of a guy of what he's saying when honestly that is the way the community feels but they're treating him like he's some outlier and as if like the entire community wasn't tweeting about this for a straight week about making this mode permanent all right so let's talk about it the reason you clicked on this video i've not had my blood boil this much in probably over a year so basically long story short many of you know that we are getting a gold week at the end of the season meaning we've had a gold weekend before you probably remember we had gold rush duos we had like gold weapons only where it was only like legendary weapons it was super fun crater mast of every game it was so fun back then so during that week we're gonna be getting recolor skins and a lot of people have been questioning because they've heard rumors that these recolors actually won't be able to be bought with legend tokens and shrug tall has confirmed that this rumor looks to be true a guy named strife on twitter saying is it true that we won't be able to use legend tokens to get the octane and bloodhound recolors and shrugs all said yes they don't appear to be sold for tokens rather apex coins to which he replied that's a huge letdown and complete garbage garbage yeah that's what he said so if you're still not understanding basically ea pulling another money hungry move where instead of having a legendary skin and then you can just go ahead and buy that recolor with legend tokens now you're gonna have to re-buy the entire skin just for the recolor so for instance if you wanted to buy flashpoint and you already had the vengeance seeker all you had to do is just use your legend tokens but now you're not gonna be able to do stuff like that you're gonna have to buy the actual skin itself so instead of people saving money like they were hoping to do with legendary skins that they already had and they could just buy the recolors with legend tokens that they already had ea said absolutely not i want you to pull out that credit card and swipe it again so maybe i'm missing something let me know down in the comments but there's no other way to explain this other than you wanted more money usually when i develop an opinion on something i usually sit there and think well it might benefit that group but still not the majority of us but here i just don't see who it benefits this hurts everybody it only helps them and of course they're not going to come out on twitter even though this is definitely the motive they're not going to come out on twitter and say hey we're going to start charging apex coins for the recolors because we want more money i mean it's like apple trying to convince you that it's a good decision that they don't include a charger in the new iphones like what apex has so many good qualities about it but they're small things that they do that really irk you and honestly ruin such a good part of the experience now there's still nothing like it i love apex the gameplay is untouchable it's such a good game but they're small things that like i said they do that just make me so mad it's like having this amazing juicy burger and then just putting craft single cheese on top of it it's like having the best cut potatoes and making the best fries but you don't cook them in peanut oil like five guys does ah man i'm hungry before i bury myself too deep this is not 100 confirmed but it does look like that's what it's going to be so if it turns out to be that way then shame on you ea but i know you really don't care because you've always been about money yep well i'm not getting invited to the next event i know that much all right moving on one of the biggest names on twitch and also youtube one of the favorite players especially with movement being one of the best wraith mains i've ever seen i love watching this guy's clips actually got hit with a seven day suspension and cannot play in the algs now to be honest i need your comments down below someone pronounced this word for me is it fade or failed or i don't really know how to pronounce his name i guess we'll just call him fade but many people know him as soon as asu left the scene fate came on the scene and kind of took over asu's spot i mean a lot of people argue not the same but still this guy's cracked out of his mind and this was the notification that he got hello we want to notify you that we found your ea account to be in violation of our rules of conduct while reviewing your account we identified the following violation on origin inappropriate reference hate speech directed for saying the word that you see on screen now and i'm not going to say it just because i don't want it to be taken too seriously and then maybe youtube flips off and say you put this word in your video we're gonna demonetize it i don't really know how it works i'm just not even gonna take the chance and my only concern with this is like why not a chat ban why not banning someone from being able to use communications with the apex legends why ban their actual game experience and rocket league started this a couple months ago and it ticked me off so much they started banning people for just saying words to your teammates if they were being dumb if the guy wasn't rotating and you call them out on it they just oh that's hate speech in your band like come on dude not even a chat or communication ban just banning you from the game what why did we normalize that now there are some situations in some circumstances that i completely understand it's leading to the point where eventually you're just gonna get banned for calling your teammate stupid i mean come on like what is this and if it gets out of ban like really bad just permanently ban them on chat i don't know maybe i'm wrong maybe you guys disagree let me know down in the comments i'm always open for discussion i don't ever think that i'm dogmatically correct in every situation i'm open to see what you guys have to think about it maybe i'll change my mind alright guys welcome to the gold nuggets part of the video if you made it comment down below gold nugget i'm gonna be replying to some more gold nugget comments like i did in the last video we have two gold nuggets one is just a really cool picture i want you guys to see and number two is an opinion i want to get from you guys and girls because apparently i didn't know i actually have a three percent female viewership that's cool so the first one we're going to talk about pro player monsoon giving some really big controversial ideas on twitter saying removing the craver from comp apex might be a good idea alberli replied and said competitive apex algs other terms etc but not ranked for those if you don't understand what monsoon and other pros are asking for in case people aren't aware care package weapons were disabled during the preseason invitational and it was the best competitive experience so obviously most of us are in algs and we can't really relate to what they're saying but this does make you think okay competitive the highest ranking competitor that most of us probably get to is like ranked play maybe masters diamond maybe apex predator if you're up there i'm not sure but that makes you wonder what do you guys think about this for ranked i mean if it does create a much better competitive experience for rank i mean for uh algs why wouldn't it make a better experience for rank i don't know personally i love the cray bar one of my favorite weapons ever it definitely is a lot of fun to have but is it really a good weapon for battle royale is it a good weapon for any kind of competitive mode like rank with it being so high powered maybe it's only best that we keep it for arena modes coming out next season alright and the last gold nugget i want to show you guys this is a really cool picture i thought early olympus layout exploration here originally the map blockout was very random and chaotic looking this was a first attempt at organizing the chaos of a battle royale map in the sky good times also here some very early rough blue sky concepts look at some of these pictures that we had of olympus so this is like a little mini map the map looks completely different from what we have now but it does look pretty cool then we have some of these other pictures and the map just looks totally different from what we have now looks really really cool i also saw a picture last week that made the map look more like a city and i'm also wondering what do you guys think about maybe future apex maps maybe even with the arena maps if we had more like maps that were based around a city maybe like something that you would see in gta you know it actually looks like a town it looks like a real city maybe stuff like h1z1 where you have pleasant valley and there's like actual houses and restaurants and subdivisions and culture sacks and you know all of these street lights and everything that looks like a real map not just like an animated random poi based map i don't know let me know what you guys think down in the comments below also i just made an announcement on twitter and discord that when i come back for my vacation in april we actually will be starting a new stream schedule this is gonna be a huge step in the right direction for me hopefully we're gonna stop doing tuesday thursdays and saturday streams we're gonna

how we're gonna survive the longest you ask caustic glitch with the heat shield all right everyone make sure you tell your teammates what's happening maybe just say zilbrad or something and we're gonna go around grabbing all the crafting materials because we can craft the heat shield we're gonna go all meet each other at the end of the ring get as many crafting as possible who is this it's a bomb of course it is wait bomb your lifeline i thought you'd be caustic oh that one's like okay cool all right so why did that man kill someone you see we live in a society who knows why they did it we're going to look into that one day the psyche of why people kill each other in apex legends well such a beautiful community we're going to bring up once you've uh gotten enough crafting everyone meet at the salvage and we'll all have a little trip to the market we can buy some stuff before the ring closes and death comes in oh i see some people coming over and flying in two wow more members of the community lifelines and caustics such a beautiful world this is it's the perfect blend of toxicity and lovingness well wow whose shop is this get in the goddamn shop i forgot to get my heirloom again oh i forgot to get my heirloom oh well so what do we got for sale today that's worse than mine i would never buy that trade in heat shields so we'll keep waiting around here look here's some more people coming hey welcome to the half toxic and half loving community we're gonna be here all day i better start lying back or something but you're throwing grenades in the sky it's not gonna come back you know what if this is a society we're gonna make one sacrifice just one all right you grab that lifeline lifeline who is your stick can you can you point to which one's your caustic all right we gotta sacrifice everyone we have a sacrifice come on over bright caustic you're too colorful to be a caustic get over here get over here bright caustic otherwise i'll kill you myself you either die honorably get respawned or just whatever come on the sacrifice must be made don't you dare stand there get in the goddamn green lava good look at him take it this is a community oh keep dying he will die and then he'll get respawned born and you there we go beautiful what a beautiful society everyone kill the dragon jesus christ kill it oh my god beautiful cut it up we're gonna eat tonight we're shooting at the drop no don't shoot at that no stop shooting at that man he's born in you he's fine he's fine it's please don't kill him give him some help jesus christ this will be hard this says a lot about our current society we're in the end stage so we want that crafting because we're going to stay next to the crafting the crafting is water to us and there's actual water right here too that has been poisoned good everyone had to go around this goddamn cancer game mode everyone start crafting uh you know it heat shields why is that two of them in one thing oh no [Laughter] run everyone run to uh the caustic treatment place there's one more crafting there i'm going infinitely doing it right now oh no i screwed it up i screwed it up oh god all right it's time to craft oh my god the sound is going really weird make sure to throw your gas can outside the thing good everyone this is good oh it's glitching out all right so we've got some very experienced society makers here who know how to do this glitch very well oh god the ring's getting cut off oh god it's getting kind of close oh it's about to be the final round everyone we're about to hit the longest uh time in apex look at this guy a diligent worker keeping us alive you're a hero you're a hero there's a gas can right here no no don't put the gas cans here i'm killing this guy i'm killing this guy put down the things put down the things i'm killing the one guy who was a troublemaker you don't deserve to be in our society there we go okay uh oh god oh god okay oh god okay this is a huge problem right now oh no i screwed mine up keep it up keep it i'm gonna craft jesus christ no no so oh no no that was 22 minutes 14. pathetic team we got to keep this up we got to do better than this i want a society it's a society oh nice i got a lifeline teammate bardzill yes hello it is me barzill let's do it all right so we gotta get really efficient at this society gangers we're gonna grab all the crafting and start putting it all in the middle oh my god i've just realized if we find a building we put the core sticks on top so that way the lifelines underneath uh don't get gassed all right this is looking good i see someone practicing over there that's good that man is practicing everyone just him from far away he is the chosen one that man out there oh and he just died no someone died i don't know who we gotta be like that soon we have to be like that oh my dear god oh my dearest of gods oh my dearest of gods what is god happening god is dead only we remain if you don't have a heat shield scavenge scavenge going good guys this is how society works nowadays oh i screwed mine that's not good is it that's not good at all that's not good at all what the heck we still got oh we had someone going god here what was that 23 minutes and 52 seconds okay all right let us try our best we just keep crafting here everyone this is our society and we love it we love our society and but only bomb proof right now no one else throw down a thing only bomb proof everyone else craft craft like your god damn mean it it's just terrifying this is goddamn terrifying this is gonna be the hardest thing to do this has to be the hardest thing to do in this game like without a doubt without a doubt this is the hardest thing all right don't go up don't go on that thing you might trigger that guy's gas don't trigger another caustics gas whatever you do oh my god okay okay no mine's out oh god no wait there's this one here is there one here someone here there's a one here's the one here there's one here there's one here is there one here okay okay everyone stay in the thing everyone stay there no one's okay i'm with you other person i'm not gonna hit your gas thing i'm not gonna hit the gas i'm just gonna stay right here don't worry about me everything's going to be fine i want to put it over this side you put it that side no all right you continue it oh you're screwed up no bob's going hard he's doing it for society he's doing it all right just a few more hours bomb you got this you got this man no no they didn't have another person all right we have got the final end game strategy bomb right here is probably the best caustic known to man so i'll be his little baby lifeline but we'll be in houses camped with a car stick above a car stick below and just in case one car stick screws up it saves the other and in case they both screw up we've got the life lens this is it this is all the money baby keep putting it down this is looking good very very good all right i'm gonna start testing to see where the caustics will reside what does it look like um not too spacey not too spacey not too spacey at all no but it works actually wait no you can stand it probably it works right it looks like it cool oh my god that is even better bomb there's a beautiful idea we'll take this all right we'll take the bunker and we'll have our bottom boy caustic be down here people stop bringing it over right and start bringing the heat shields you guys are doing nothing come on i see you all teabagging we live in a society you slackers let's do this boys and no one else except for the two boys that i know stay here no one else just us here bring caustic which one is your lifeline that one i'm sorry you weren't just you weren't supposed to be here this is the society this is a goddamn society and you had a heat shield that whole time okay we didn't get too many heat shields in the end nice so everyone has their own little little houses we've got house boys over there house boys over there house boys over there oh god it's goddamn beautiful it is goddamn beautiful all right since since i i reckon don't you dare this is a society we're supposed to work together what the heck are you how did you get get out get out die get out of here how the heck did you get there how did you get all the way over there oh which team died that team died oh no where where did things go guys where did all the shields go there was three of them here oh my god why is there a coaster coming all the way over what what is this all right you stay there don't get too close actually we can't get too close to you otherwise you're dead you know that's that would be that would be unfortunate wouldn't it yeah it would be those guys are still live over there they had the most everyone put their heat shields over there and they didn't put it here jesus christ you get to that one kiss that one other caustics stay away and you guys don't stay close to each other's gas stay away from yourselves gas no stay away give us your goddamn thing you didn't have it all right both of you start working towards this one oh my god had it all set up and how did it turn into two chances two two extra chances let's open it up together whoa alright start moving the items outside the thing too and start moving these heat shields on top of this and no one take the heat shields from the spot everyone just only move the heat shields there this is the best work i've ever seen lads these zip lines mixed with jump pads enjoy how i hit you everyone out of the goddamn place everyone out okay oh don't go at the top that's it that's it you aren't up the top i give everyone one chance and they don't they've got the top you didn't go up the top if you go up the top you die uh don't you tuck off the top cost if you stay in there it's looking like a lot of how is there still this many people alive we live in a society all right we live in a goddamn society do we still have a horde of things where is it all going how is it all going what what shields all disappeared and and a default pathfinder came in and i assume maybe he picked it all up somehow loot despawns outside of zone look does despawn all the boxes where i killed everyone is gone it's all gone you'll give your heat shield when i need it okay we'll transfer from you to me when i need it don't drop it on the ground otherwise it despawns oh who activated it how'd that even activate stay away from it a bit bit further away from the corner guys the way the further away but for the way do not activate it whatsoever if that happens one more time he's screwed if another gas can gets activated i am killing you all that's just how society is did you screw it up you screwed it up didn't you wait how did that activate no one moved a muscle how'd that activate how did that activate i get don't put on the right then bomb maybe it activates if you go right just have it on the left don't jump up don't jump up don't jump up stay jumped that's it that's god damn it he needs to work oh here come here we've got the absolute final best strategy to live forever this has taken us the longest time ever but we're going to make it a reality all right so everyone drop now and go left it's the swamps it's the swamps go here we go let us get started caustics with me let's start organizing these course sticks so you'll be doing a shield at the bottom and uh is this luna this is your little area if everything goes to fail you get to you have to crouch kinda so this is your area kinda you like put it here because our bomb and i will be just under you okay so firstly let's get uh gaba okay let's get you to stand right here do not move from that spot okay oh thank you gamma thank you so it is getting closer to the thing uh keep the doors closed and no one go inside gamma you will be the first one to die if i need one here we go let's see how long we can last it is doing it at max max attack right now so we are in overdrive if we even go two minutes from now we've hit the new well record technically but we want to go for 30 minutes at least 30 minutes from this second so make sure you keep teabagging or looking around to make sure you don't get afk disconnected we're doing really really well all right yeah yeah yeah camera gamer gaming do yours give me anything all right gamma you have to die go run out there go run out just right onto the zone good luck hey next one next one line up all right all right oh no oh god um so it seems like in the end of all of this we cannot hit to 24 minutes because of some glitches where the shields just disappear and you can't do the infinite thing anymore so this time we've got another strategy oh boy okay everyone everyone uh towards the cliff uh before you uh go towards the cliff go inside the house and drop a heat shield everyone drop a heat shield inside the house we're having a nice time this is for the glory of the soul this is for the society for the good of society all right everyone ready in three two one jump off the cliff let's go go very nice very nice off the cliff you go you didn't go off the cliff you get off the cliff get off the goddamn cliff get up the goddamn cliff now everyone off the cliff nice good all right we can begin wait we need another team oh oh if there's anyone still alive please come now we chill you don't you don't put like anything down unless he screws up we're basing it on him it's all up to him now i'll see if i can oh yeah cost acostic start start switching them out switch out each every single one like put put them over here at the core stick and go like that okay you drop them over there they pick them up you drop them over there you pick them up if you see them rapidly disappearing keep one on you if you see them rapidly disappear and keep one on you keep traversing them good just in case just in case that actually does the despawn timer all right here it comes the final ring oh my you keep switching them i gotta get i got a heat shield at the ready in case that you keep switching the boy i've never been sorry i'm smiling so much keep switching those around in case you screw us up we've hit the 24 mark just keep this up and i think we've got it i think we have the fail safe we're officially hitting new record highs bomb proof single-handedly carrying it all nowhere is safe on the map except for here outside is just red it's a goddamn death war zone out there we have to live in here forever only three people to maximize this so it doesn't glitch out we had the best strategy before but because there was too many shields it screwed up but this is it it's saying get back in the ring but this is the ring oh man he didn't disconnect did he oh god just imagine if he disconnected caustic why are you not there i'm wait i'm reading the chat guys did something happen to him did something happen to him you could get back our vase get back he is disconnected he crashed he says he can't reconnect are you kidding me ready up no oh 32 minutes because his wi-fi cut out okay we've figured out the thing bomb has a carpal tunnel he's carrying the entire thing and now we just have to have other people not leave the game so we've we've got that and we can stack up heat shields this has to be it i say it every single time but this is the one this is the one oh and i'm the champion oh no that says something if i'm the champion then it's going to work and bomb will carry and no one will disconnect grapple do a grapple a magnificent grapple oh that was kind of pathetic but nice you grapple grow grapple out of there everyone get outside the building once you've done your last delivery everyone outside everyone outside seems like we've got a bit too many people trying to stay in here that would make it glitch there's supposed to be four of you who's the imposter can you guys point to the imposter is it that one oh it i thought it was the default life one not gonna lie all right this is everyone except i know there's some stragglers around here the amount of stragglers uh caustics throw your alt downstairs throw your old downstairs car sticks yep nice nice nice checking them out everyone back up everyone back up don't don't stay down there oh beautiful this is just what i want to see that's a that's a very good spot i like it all right you're gonna you're gonna just stand there for a little bit aren't you all right make sure make sure you guys keep switching oh yeah switch out the heat shield switch out the head seals no no no no no no switch keep switching keep switching juggling juggling juggling juggling i forgot about that oh my god i forgot about that juggle like a goddamn life depends on it and remember stay towards the corner of the thing wherever the new corner is bring bring the heat shields more to the corner otherwise you'll activate his gas do not activate his gas at any point god i wanna i don't know like if too many squads live in the end this won't work just grab just just grapple away be free be free go be free be free you may be free in this world it's okay grapple away come on i want to see you grapple i want to see you grapple god damn it now you're going to go in the water goodbye oh god i feel bad he better not have a heat shield on him and does he he did he had a heat shield the whole time interesting here's another heat shield guys another reef hiding in the corner go be free be free it's just obvious guys what are you go go away go away pathfinder oh luna it was luna one of the good caustics that time so uh when the final ring comes guys i'll get ready to throw and uh one other lifeline the other devil lifeline get ready to throw one okay let's see if bomb can beat his other record and the ring is about to close and everything will glitch out and especially the map the map will have the weirdest glitch of all and it just zooms all the way in as whoa whoa it's like i'm going so fast hell yeah oh my lifeline get ready you didn't see that lifeline but basically he screwed up he screwed up once he screwed up again that was a close one that was a very close one nice it's healing him slightly he's going back up this is why we have lifelines you keep it up oh my god oh my god you actually threw a gas can down actually threw a gas can down cute dumb boy necessarily this is a carpal tunnel speeder on any percentage right now we're hoping he gets carpal tunnel at 50 minutes or something i don't actually have the proper time limit since i'm basing it off me being recording but i've been recording for 29 minutes so i think it's now we're over 28 minutes so all you got to do is just keep it up this is it this is the absolute last chance we're not doing it ever again i believe we have beaten the previous record let's make it to an hour let's see how far we can go as our final test what does it look like so it's you have one guest can but if the two come out still able to and then you have two fail safes over there and then ask fail safing and then a health drone pretty damn impressive this is just what caustic does caustic is mad and wants to kill everyone because of all the stress he's been put through and where's watson watson is nowhere to be found it's caustic doing everything surviving in the ring [Laughter] each shield lasts about four to five seconds we'll say five three if bomb says you type during this don't type it's tight okay the last three seconds then three seconds keep it up keep it up everyone in the chat is just saying his hands are slowly dying i can't believe you typed don't you dare type again don't you dare type again oh you're thinking about it you were thinking about it just just keep going just keep going i feel like i'm dying just watching this like i'm feeling the pain despite not doing anything you activated caustic gas at the bottom you look at these pools i think we're about to hit 50. see when i pause my recording i forgot what number was that i know it was 30 but it might have been 30 something we should we should just not tell the number that way bomb just keeps going for hours oh you threw the gas at me are you gonna grab it are you good are you good are you good you're trying to pull a sneaky one people saying a bomb hollow spray pecor stick that is memorialized in this house in this house in king's canyon i mean it could be every type of this house because there's this house duplicated all over the map another suggestion maybe a new legend that can go 10 meters outside the zone ow oh oh oh are you good are you good he's just he's just flexing at this point he's actually he keeps teabagging i want to do crazy stuff like this all the time but i could get like a permanent custom server oh my lord but this has been the hardest video to record and not even for me just for him we have spent so many hours trying to figure out the glitch some and he spent so many hours perfecting this where he's only had two screw-ups i'm pretty sure we've had an hour that is some hour hype a little bit of a woo if you have anyone living in your uh house bomb you might need to tell them to to bring a bucket to bring a bucket bomb he just looks at me lifeline lifeline that needs to throw the thing you go to the toilet right now okay you prepare you go to the toilet right now okay you got a knot you're gonna know to go to the toilet you go take the toilet break i'll take after did you have a great little tinker it was it was nice very nice good good good you go tinker all right you go tinker light you gotta have a nice tinker all right we gotta we gotta keep uh okay we're gonna keep tinkering i know it's really disturbing saying tinkle but what am i supposed to say to make it disturbing as possible i say tinkle nowadays because of meat canyon that that youtuber that had the mcdonald's one it's like take a little tinkle oh it's like we have the most premium baths why don't you take a tinkle make bombs stop he will never it's only just begun it's war this is my last war we would have reached this conclusion that this is the most efficient way to do this if we had a custom server oh no all right all right we can calm down we can come down but i looked away i literally checked discord because someone messaged me the first time i do that we had a bit of a panic oh he throws down he's out i threw one down nice two just in case that's good so we only need one he he literally if he screws it up he he just gets it easy all right so what are we what are we at how many have got left uh lifeline if we get down to five left only i'll do it or only you will do it type of deal but we'll keep this up just because we're you know we want to see for extra extra fail safe in case one of them screws up about to be done what do you mean oh he's saying that he's dying are you dying bomb he is dying now oh no oh no uh keep keep doing it i'll start asking any cause sticks know how to do it really well you do are you the most confident in it oh my god i'm throwing one down alright still good we're still good perfect get ready to switch in three two one switch go go bomb switch switch switch i'll throw it down what no how much i want donut okay go take that break go take that break i should probably take a break soon but like right now it's just too much i've lost count of how long i've been here now i've actually lost count i know for a fact we're getting close to two hours got some he's got pizza he's got pizza at 2 40 in the morning if compute this screws up once and he might go on forever oh my god we're good are we good jesus christ we are running out we are down to like seven of these left i'm gonna go craft some more guys we're back devil lifeline you're the backup for now i'm going to toilet did i take damage one tick one tick twice oh no okay well you keep relaxing bomb oh my god we're almost out it's not it's not a double stack okay and it's gone i should have just taken the one tick damage we have no spare bomb would you uh like to get ready to do it basically ready okay so if you're going down the stairs uh compute this make sure you're going down the right side of the stairs and bomb make sure you're going up your right of the stairs so that way you don't hit each other keep going compute this this is your last one oh go go go everyone take the damage oh okay that is one charge though that is one charge you still have another one right yeah yeah all right bomb you've essentially got one more so if you screw this you got one extra i'm still holding one so i can give you that one too this is for all the money can we hit 3am we're getting close to 3am 12 more minutes to 3 a.m are the two people outside are you on the same team huh anyone want any any of you two want to sleep anyone want to get finished by me any of you two willingly want to get finished yeah just to all right actually let's play a game while this is happening all right walk walk walk shoot [Laughter] no you're finishing i'm not done come with me caustic now isn't this beautiful it's a little bit uh romantic you could say yeah don't you reckon yeah drop your guns you know take off your clothes drop it all drop it all drop it all drop it all yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is looking good this is looking looking real damn good oh it's okay it's okay shh we're having some fun down here together i'm getting you you're so wet it's time to put you to sleep it's okay it's okay it's okay hey other lifelines how's it going well we're having a great time aren't we it's just us lifelines left uh wasn't that just a great time wasn't it what's that you say where did your where did your husband go i slept with him and then killed him okay here's the new juggling one by the way all right he's got one more fail safe if only there was a duplication glitch we could go for like over 48 hours because then we have like an american team and an australian team this says a lot about our society in the end it's one man and three women in the end that's just society everyone this is the male's fantasy that a smiley face you're making let's go for a zone walk that's conf that's being confident though oh my god but then they could trigger your gas that's why we can't go for a zone walk that's the whole gist of it i go in front oh my god okay okay are you back yet other one avatar can't rejoin it's just us left i'm gonna i'm gonna kill her oh where did her body go where did her body go whatever i think we put two hours you could go for his own walk i've got a spare thing all right it was south this one good laughing go oh yeah nice little zone lock nice little there's a little zomlock what did we get at the end was that actually two hours oh if that's not two hours i'll be so upset one hour i mean i read that wrong two hours and four minutes and 29 seconds you should have died nine seconds early oh my god oh my god and we only died that early cause lifeline tripped over in the other lifeline dc and if only i didn't shoot those other caustics if only very unfortunate very unfortunate but i carried bomb i got 14 kills wow guys that was an impressive beat by bomb

team with heat shields can be pretty useful come the end zone for rotation holy [ __ ] take a deep breath coming in eyes and coming in horizon coming in recharging oh my god so guys some of you may remember way back in august of 2020 apex legends intel expert shrug tao posted this tweet looking at a possible gadget item and slot coming to apex legends well fast forward to now and we have the survival slot along with the heat shields and mobile respawn beacons so now we know exactly what they meant by gadgets however currently we only have two items to use and so it creates the question of what else could be coming would you like to see elements such as smoke grenades or emp grenades perhaps or could there possibly be items that like the heat shield can benefit an entire team or past that is there something completely new that could really change up the game that you can think of as well as this you can see some code titled wt anti-titan and wt titan core now while these directly linked to the titanfall series these are just in there from past development code and so the idea of seeing a titan in apex legends isn't something that's likely to happen at least anytime soon let us know all your thoughts in the comments section down below on if you think we'll be getting more gadgets and also be sure to check out shrug towel on twitter for loads of juicy apex intel you can find

jesus just overwhelmed just overjoyed the fact that we made it last stream i was keeping it calm i was trying to keep it cool but now i'm just ready to let the energy out rain it's great to have you here by the way don't forget guys to leave a like on the stream and let's get into the the match so what we're looking at right now as teams are picking their legends what you're seeing is the prior tournament but once it updates we'll look at what legends everyone's picking essentially what we need to capture is make sure to see who's going to 50 50 right off the rip i know flashpoint tends to land harvester i think we have two teams harvester that are going to be landing um i'm not sure if who's going to be landing sorting you turn up the volume for some reason seems a little lower looks like it's actually okay it looks like the farm boys are going to be landing potentially on the outskirts of no name take a look i just want to capture the 50 50. everyone technically should have their spot looks like six and metro's team are sitting pretty comfortably in lava city they split it panders is hitting the beacon the first beacon this is going to be a geyser ending which is looking pretty good for farm boys and impulsive dreams overall team we do see a split over and sorting factor which is definitely expected expected we have current esports already hugging the edge of this as well as vayne and omnis and scurry's team which you know i'm proud of them for getting uh signed by the way a very very talented roster i've seen them very very consistent especially when they've gone from team to team so happy to see that they're consistently being signed let's take a look fragments looking pretty hot we got rambo a pretty strong controller player definitely cracked up his mind um looks like we're seeing some action here let's switch over this is we know shroud do they know shroud guys honestly they actually really do they have played with them we'll see how they manage to move out of the situation they probably need to opt for the rotation out which is what they're doing their armor it just isn't looking great but my little phony is smelling the fear and it's not fear they just know they can read the situation they have the one up in this armor and if they play this right they could technically knock them out pretty early on and they have the caustic to make sure they don't get pushed back the connections with the volt are not happening but they are going to try to arc and find some positioning pony head is actually going to rotate grab a little bit more loot and try to get a nice flank on the other side let's take a look and see how they're going to handle this flank and see if the team manages to get out they got him stuck in this building especially with a caustic they are hard holding him phony head is trying to retreat out gets a lot of damage done to him this is a plus for we know shroud this team and getting them confident 26 damage then may not be enough they have the armor situation but are they going to be able to hold it the alternator may not be enough phony trying to take an off angle as well as fury but as may not be enough everyone's quite low and fury popping the q which is a sign that they need to get out and reposition once the wraith pops are queued that's usually a clear sign this is not going well as we have fury pushing on into the bubble nobody is down but this could go the opposite direction let's see how fury does the bubble fight there's a spitfire the ebay definitely gets them in somehow they manage to clutch it up and they get third partied was this worth it was it worth to push that there they have got to be angry i know we know shroud's team is definitely frustrated that did that need to happen did we need to see that happen that early on congratulations both teams are probably arguing definitely debating is like why did we fight this why do we fight this early because now we have two teams already out of the count and everyone's just rotating in we do have absolute mark monarchy am pushing into the rotation looking for geyser here we have sir lifting fat fruit ninja sleepy panda they've been playing together for quite some time they stream together i see them quite often and they are finally finding their footing together with their third so this is a positive situation to see but we do see sushi getting into a pretty gas station sushi getting into a fight here solid r31 shot 75 damage in we got to see how they're going to rotate find their angles find their positioning because they are not necessarily down for the count but they are definitely hurting and there's some solid damage if they get the rotation and flank this could be huge nice spray from sound getting a nice angle and then might be able to clean this up bite to clutch it up they're screaming that they're one there one i can feel it in the energy and there we go there's a knock and now we got a 3v2 situation along they play this patiently we're going to see some positive gameplay 2b 2v1 2v1 2v1 situation you know they're calling it out the other guy's flanking he got greedy he got greedy that's not a situation where you want to get greedy but luckily sound manages to clutch it out but unfortunately they're about to get third partied in just a moment by a whole different team it's about to become an absolute cluster cup sees team is rolling in with tech patch with the cossack getting a solid spray tech rolling in saying toujman i'm here for the fight and they decide to queue out flashpoint has to be aware that this is going to be an absolute mess they're hard chasing well they have the team hambinus team rotated right behind them they need to be very careful this is nonstop action already at the start n a is already looking like a frag fest blatant disrespect happening across the lobby and teams are finally finding their footing panders team is trying to hold the angle here they're 16 teams still remaining charge rifle shots happening at all angles getting the poke damage in my gosh there's so much going on i'm already choking cheers ladies and gentlemen let me take a breather okay we're back let's get right back into it so what we're seeing with the teams obviously now everyone's going to play patiently and we're going to see teams not really go all in on this at this point everyone just needs to find positioning but it looks like there is a knock that occurred from omni's team getting crummy wow there's the the old town to buy themselves some time they honestly team should be holding their buildings but the flash point is full on aggro in this building we're seeing nothing the disrespect in the lobby a lot of pushes this is playing out like a pub is this last ch is this last chance qualifiers or is this a pub what am i watching nice cleanup by flashpoint putting them some nice kills up above but they need to watch out they're going to take the port back reposition 15 squads are still remaining some nonstop action already happening in the lobby this is crazy what is happening in north america people are hungry we're gonna see some teams really change up their combo i'm surprised we don't even see an octane revenant here at least there is that level of respect that we're seeing at least with no octane revenant but we're seeing a lot of horizon come into play now all we got to do is hear the silence fall in the lobby for just a second while we see teams that are rotating one team is obviously out and the outskirts here but we need to hold this ankle because this is the fight that's going to be happening with hrn with simply hill and eures they know they want to push this but the question is can they get a crack and is it going to be worth it by the time teams rotate in as you can tell these teams are going to hard hold i don't suspect that they're going to be fighting anytime soon the teams like rx are rotating in they're probably wondering what is going on this lobby can't believe so many people are dead already as well as tpm which is taylor's and sushi's team just trying to find some angles and positioning nice flex with wall-bound sushi gotta keep that mobility alive and going so once we switch back to pov flashpoint managed to get their third nice and comfortable a little bit of a struggle bus to get him up there but nonetheless it did happen we're sitting okay and we are good to go the wheels are falling off there's a lot of people on it difficult you know so it's hard it's hard it's a hard life everyone is just kind of finding their own in their groove we really because the amount of teams that have died already we really should not see too many teams really duke it out at the moment it looks like panders team is trying to find their spot with mst here they're just poking around they have this whole snake and now we're seeing hill's team hrn already finding another fight now if they were to get them out this is a great choke point let's switch over povs team depression is already getting a nice flank and fight in here this is not a great spot to fight by the way there's nothing but open spots i can feel the pressure from the inside of this building if he stays if they able to get it off angle here there's the scan they got them trapped in a corner there's two cracks depression unfortunately kim chili is unfortunately getting knocked and now that's a 3v2 situation are we seeing this fight play out the way they want it to play out dudes night out is it their night out ec and duplex not letting this team breathe and there they go strictly running for dear life this is depression nobody wants to go out in 14th place at this point got to avoid depression all costs let's take a pov at hill because they are breaching this building and swish povs because hill's going right through the door they see the bubble up top he's making a play he's got the massive he's looking for the players and where did they go to schmidt where do they go that looks like they ran in and now they're stuck trying to find their positioning this isn't good they're going to get hard grief by every team there's no way that they get out of this comfortably they're going to get knocked let's ski let's see if they manage to clutch it out unfortunately now the poor lonely crypter crypto is all alone and there it is get the knock and we see panders team coming in with a nice cleanup snagging a kp point of their own now we do have a team amp coming from the north side this is axe team running in seeing how they can position and find their footing now we do have the choke we do have a team this team these two teams are hard griefing each other outside of the zone they still have a minute and 16 to get in now all they can do is really edge this and there are committed so at this point there is no backing out and backing down all they can do is chase they're asking themselves why are you running why why why i mean why are they running at this point maybe they should just stay and fight they really can't do much they know that sushi's team is not going to let up they're breaching the building taking various angles they're going to get them stuck he's rolling in with the eva eight my gosh let me tell you n a is hitting different today usually there's not this much to color commentate and usually i can chill and vibe for a second but i get any of that today i'm not getting any of that there's the zuck trying to get the positioning let's see how they're managing to breach down below and tmp has rotated out if they rotate out they're going to have to go right to zone and know that they're going to get sandwiched they have to clean this up they really don't have a choice but to clean this up the all other teams are kind of fighting well looks like they're backing out let's see how this team dudes night out is handling their situation their fight and their building let's see how rare excellence has watson not running watson running a horizon got a crater in play if you can get his crater shot my god can that be a make and break situation every second that passes is a moment that they are going to get caught out in rotation they need to clean this up i know they're hungry for it that's why he's got his crater out can you land this crater shot i want to switch povs and i want to miss much get the creeper shiny misses unfortunately snags right in the back didn't give him a haircut cut the back back hairs just a little bit there he's flying in the air but it may not be enough he's trying to duck and weave and dodge pops the cell repositions with a squad the crabber was not able to find an opening wow and this team like i mentioned is chasing him that's hard chasing him when they come in they're going to be nothing but a sandwich nothing but a sandwich these teams are not going to fight these teams are going to in just a hot moment they know they have to run into sushi susie's team this is going to be hard man they're going to have to pray that the other teams really do something because they're going to run right into the worst trap of manageable they can edge this they got to make sure the other teams don't pick on them or fight them because if they do they're going to be caught out and stuck let's see how sushi's team manages to play this out though because they're in the worst possible situation the best thing that could have happened is they mopped up the team out and they just outskirt and edge this that's not going to happen for them these teams out here are still rotating around fight finding their footing between the building why fyp they're taking a lot of damage by the time they make it in they run in are they going to be able to sandwich this team are they going to be able to do that do they have the ability to do it or are they going to be able to run right through these teams on the outskirts are going to be the ones that all fight we'll just have to see how they manage to fight it out we're going to see some good accuracy a good knock something to make a play sushi's team is waiting for the opportunity i'm not sure if they're aware of the team that is on their right holding the other choke if they full send this that's going to be a hard throw knowing that the other team is holding the angle holding the choke it looks like four swots team is finally rolling up they need to they need to sandwich somebody they need to make a crack they need to make a play because that building is going to be hard held and they don't have an option to rotate towards the south they really don't honestly they could play the bubble zone they could play the edge here but now this is playing like a scrim at this point feeling the pressure waiting for things to play out played like a scrim at the start where everyone's fighting each other and now people are actually taking it a little bit more seriously minute to make a decision they only have a minute simply's team got a knock solid play with team depression just running around for dear life at the bottom not much action that we're gonna miss here let's just take a look at this amp getting the fry this is what i was looking for let's see how they're going to manage to hard gate them there's the res there's the zuck solid damage re-knocks the horizon the gibby is just getting flung at all angles and they're sitting comfortably as long as a team their unaware is about to roll up right behind this is about to be huge cluster act just realize that the right behind them there's the damage going out non-stop damage getting pumped into him amp not looking so solid the other team from the choke rotating on the right why fyp is completely unaware that they're about to get rotated on non-stop shots of wingman is hitting by euban though solid play this is exactly what what fyp really needed this is a bit of luck struck of luck that came on their way or was it 100 calculated who really knows but nonetheless good comms in their part to find the positioning to figure out where they needed to go now they need to go back into the choke to find their angle because if they wait here too long it's not going to pose positive for them and you notice that all the teams this team is going to be hard rotating amp has lost one but now they're struggling through attrition he can get a bat off but he's going to die to zone it's zone three the horizon is going to be going out in just a few seconds once she gets shot by this other team trying to have as much mobility trying to find her angles i definitely feel and share her pain and they're separating just to try to maximize as much kp and placement points as possible we see forces or forces team fyp rotate in they have a team on the high ground in the back and now they're literally stuck in the middle they use the bubble to buy themselves some time but that time is only bot time until they make a decision to push something they finally decided to say hey let's push the team up top it's probably going to be our best play and best angle and there's the crypto but luckily not luckily unfortunately the crypto went out at the wrong time the wrong moment and there they go there's the costa cac gas wyben goes down and fyp is not looking so hot here tech's team is absolutely poppin dude's night out is trying to get some positioning here completely caught out flashpoint kopsky has the right angle has a hemlock trying to land his shots relying on his team for the cleanup and text team now is the kill leader in the lobby they have some solid positioning but they have an uphill battle to fight in front of him as you can tell on the map these teams stomps team has to rotate in while on the south side we have flashpoint really really struggling to get into this point they do have the kp they do have the points as long as they can hard edge that might be a positive that might be positive flash point now has the high ground all they need to do essentially wait for the moment it looks like his watson has actually been popping off with that craber what is his watson on what is he what juice is he drinking i know we missed a few craver shots earlier but it's been non-stop action at the choke flash point needs to rotate into the left are they going to hard gate flash point or are they going to find a way to get in there's still nine squads remaining this is not looking too good misses the crater shot the only first one that i was able to watch let's see if he manages to get this damage the rare excellence has to be aware of also flash point that is behind them i need to find some positioning flashpoint just biding their time waiting hills team on the hill no pun intended here just biting time until the zone closes because once this zone closes you can tell your recent hill are already getting tractor they keep getting cracked at this point when the zone clothes is gonna be done so for them and they won't be able to survive they can't take any more damage as they rotate and as you can tell they're getting shot consistently eures is in a really rough spot this team is just gonna have to full send it and yellow and prey and rat which is what hill is doing calling for his team just to crawl right up right behind them and say get in this spot hop in with me trust me this can work as they find their placement in the building this is looking pretty good this is getting pretty crazy flash point fighting out right in the open here this is going to be the cluster unfortunately there's going to be so much happening here right in the open we're not going to be able to capture all the bit of the damage but tech trying to fry trying to capture the angles goes down barely surviving is acoustic but at least can buy themselves some space is he gonna throw a canister to buy this one time unfortunately goes down and scurry is one of the last ones here is kill leader again with four kills with the grenade right on him and he's going to go out with almost barely surprises one hp my man by on bot time at the moment i literally felt chills right behind me because i heard the the team i felt like he was about to get shot in the back i'm really surprised he's still alive they'll switch over to his team as they're fighting eures absolutely doing some damage laying work throws down his bubble walks in with the wingman goes for the swamp has a gold armor now in his inventory not too bad not too bad hryan has found their footing and he's opting just to go out and and just die yuri's just giving him the one tap just put him out of his misery hrn walking away a bit with this not too bad not too shabby let's take a look at fat fruit ninja absolute monarchy's team starting to hard gate the opposite team at the opposite angle they decide to push in but is that the call is that the right play they're going for the kp there's still eight squads remaining and there's a gibby old that is out they have to mop this up quickly because if they don't the team is going to show up right behind them and hard gate them taylors on the north side just riding his way to victory and there's the reds they go in for the punch and there it is waiting for the last one the last kill nice mop up let's switch pov and look at the madness that's happening over here everyone is up on the building inside the building upside down it's like a dr seuss book in here there's the gas canister as they decide to breach we're seeing a lot of variety here my gosh things have been pretty crazy for the first game i i was not expecting things to be this wild and chaotic going to last chance qualifiers to try to capture that pov unfortunately didn't miss it chr now rotating in six squads remaining taylous is unfortunately going to die to zone as you can tell he's just going to try to buy some time before they fight they do see the the rat who's chilling up above he managed to get up here rare excellence finding the rat spots the best spots are manageable and now taylor should be going out there's taylor's going out in the zone and now we have all five teams chilling vibing the team on the upper left here is most likely going to be the ones to fight they have not bad positioning panders and metro's team and six have some decent positioning here as they find their footing not too bad not too shabby as long honestly this could be their game as long as they don't throw an overextend if they overextend which is what we're seeing right now that could be a hard throw they just need to make sure they don't push on their back here and they hard hold the building because that's gonna be bot time everyone's gonna have to fight outside the building i'm trying to make sure what's gonna happen here is to hear them on the outside metro and panders that they hold this building they're going to be looking pretty good they just got to guard the back part as all the other teams are going to be forced to fight right out in the open nice charge rifle shots from metro he's got he's watching his angles team is doing quite well simply does knock i sleep panda but we're gonna hard hold because this is a team we're gonna watch for now because they have the highest probability if they just play the building inside to let all the other teams fight if they let all the other teams fight and then come out up top this is this is a pretty solid positioning and win the only downside i could see is that they get naded absolutely crushed on the if everyone picks on them if everyone picks on and just starts nating them that's whenever things are going to spell bad for them but while they'll see how this plays out will they get naded will they manage to find their positioning and let the other teams duke it out let's find out let's find out how this plays out because they have the most amount of time had a hiccup there for a moment there's the scan about to happen all they need to do is wait i know the other teams are finding we're going to stick with how this team manages to clutch this out if they wait things are going to be looking good the zone is going to hurt up top just play patiently i can feel the tension i can feel that they're they're like just make sure they don't push just make sure they don't push well yeah of course as long as you hold the building you're pretty much good let them duke it out outside let them have it we'll switch back up top now this team is actually really holding on to their angles euresa's team does maintain the outside high ground but they'll need to push out in just a moment yuri's team is looking pretty hot hrn not too bad not too shabby they're looking just as good as the team inside nice eva 8 damage takes it a different port he's going to come right through and he dies to ring we're looking at a team inside a team up top and a team out team at different angles just got to be sure not to take that port not to take too much zone damage euresa's team is not looking too hot there's a caustic gas going out on all of them they're just trying to buy some time the team inside like i mentioned as long as they stay hrn decided to leave the building i'm not really sure where they decided to leave obviously because the zone came in chr is the champion the caustic gas unfortunately just hard-gated them they really had no choice but to run outside the building meant to call that unfortunately that's that's what we're looking at that's what we're looking at ladies and gentlemen pretty crazy to see how things shape up we'll switch over to the scoreboard in just a moment and we'll break down everything with that hrn had a nice spot lisa came out in third place not too bad not too bad at all and we go into game two see here two seconds ladies and gentlemen will we switch over to the scoreboard in just a moment all right let me put a thing in discord chat so everyone knows that we are here game one underway already ladies and gentlemen game one all right we're all set game two is about to get underway in just a moment we'll switch to the score and we'll break down what exactly we saw there oh man intense round all right once i connect to the lobby we'll look at the scores we'll break things down and take a look my gosh what an intense round honestly it was a lot a lot of non-stop a lot of hard griefing occurred just curious if we're gonna see that in the next round i'm gonna keep an eye on we know shroud's team see how they're gonna handle splitting fragment see how they're going to handle spreading splitting fragment so here in the lobby switch to the scoreboard as you can tell chr which is crooks team hambino taking first place there with a solid 25 points congratulations good start to the round good start to the day hrn taking third place but they definitely had more kp which puts them right ahead above metro's six and panders team in third place where excellence definitely was able to kind of rat things out they had a solid amount of kills there not too bad not too bad our top teams are looking at chr hrn mst rare excellence and altoria well it's scurry omni and vayne a classic squad looking at the top ten let's see how things start to change up as we look to see who is going to qualify for this round oh man ladies and gentlemen be sure to leave a like on the stream if you're enjoying what you're seeing we've been casting now for probably about nine to ten hours it's been insane i don't know how i have energy like i mentioned in my prior cast i'm gonna eat a lot of pasta tonight i'm gonna eat a lot of pasta i've been eating all day i've been it's kind of hard to eat when you're just kind of talking the whole time and i have a lot of energy still somehow and feeling pretty good feeling good ladies and gentlemen feeling good all right in just a hot moment we'll get into the next round don't forget to leave a like again if you're just tuning in what are you watching what what is this this is apex legends global series last chance qualifiers last chance you're seeing a whole lot of teams really fight for and we look at the scoreboard we saw some teams go out early we saw we know shroud go out with zero points and then we want lan unfortunately going out right below as well we saw gas station at least get three points because they mopped up at the start let's see if gas station sushi is going to hard grief them are they going to hard grief that team you know we've seen a lot of teams fight fragment but this is kind of consistent in terms of uh them getting into that danger spot so let me go switch back we're going into game two we're almost halfway there what a crazy day ladies and gentlemen what a crazy day let me tell you i can't believe how much energy i still have after so many hours of casting i mean i started this morning around three in the morning i'm gonna go eat after this and it's gonna be a lot of fun to be a lot of fun ladies and gentlemen what a what a day don't forget to grab yourself some water i'm glad my fiance brought me some tea we're seeing a lot more variety a lot more horizons than we did in europe i wonder if teams are going to opt for the octane revenant i don't think they will a lot of teams right now don't seem to be going right to zone they seem to be edging a lot more and fighting right off the rip as people start to get a little bit nervous we're seeing the opposite effect compared to apac north apac north they played very passive the same thing with europe and then they played super aggro towards the last few rounds it seems to be the opposite here i feel like with north america we're gonna see teams play aggro at the start then play passive towards the end we do see a lot more caustics than we did in europe so caustic is making a pretty big play and making some pretty big moments so not too bad not too bad again i appreciate all of you guys for watching for being a part so far because we have more underway five minutes until we launch the next round here be sure to grab yourself a snack get up and walk around get the blood flowing get the juices flowing you know what's interesting about seeing n a and uh versus europe is the amount of how passionate the players are from north america we definitely see a lot more banter a lot more conversation a lot a lot of uh back and forth happening between the teams yes you know if it's possible to get your own lobbies with their friends working like tournaments potentially i'm not quite sure you know ea definitely how holds the power to all of those let's give a shout out by the way when we're talking to people in chat everyone's here nicholas jonathan zovak virtuoso danny the diesel katrin appreciate you man alex uh toru amir dewey sparrow all of you guys for being here jonathan thank you guys so much it's been a long day i appreciate you guys for

she helps all right so we're gonna begin here let's see how long ago they say should begin here in about two minutes will dance be streaming the playoffs what to see we'll have to see if i get permission from e that would be absolutely amazing if we had that opportunity we'd love to do it or if i can do it we'll see we'll see where this leads us i have no idea this is where all this is gonna go i just know that i've been enjoying the ride it's been a whole lot of fun all right ladies gentlemen one more minute go grab yourself a snack grab yourself coffee get right back because we are about to go into game two all right don't worry i'll pause the music so you can hear the footsteps in just a moment most likely i will definitely stream apac north playoffs definitely that i would love to see if i have an opportunity for na or any other region all right this is a moment we can breathe for a moment yeah sure i've definitely been really heavily uh streaming apac north so we'll see if teams decide i'm gonna follow we know shroud pretty closely here just because they had the 50 50 at the start with gas station unfortunately they got 30 i'm not even sure if it was worth it might have been worth it for gas station definitely they were feeling the pinch from from them we know shroud's team overall definitely rough definitely rough vive thank you so much for being here buddy appreciate you welcome the channel welcome stream good luck have fun the round is starting let's get into it let's have some fun ladies and gentlemen round two don't forget i will time stamp this this will turn into a vod so if you miss it if you can't stay for the whole thing don't worry it'll turn into a vod so you can catch up and watch the remaining bit this is on a five minute delay this is live i am capturing all the action live rotating the camera commentating doing everything far in between so any bit of support would definitely means the absolute world because i mean listen it's been it's been a heck of a day it's been a heck of a day we still have quite a few more rounds all right don't forget to get up and stretch having to remind myself afterwards here to do so game two let's take a look at the compositions and memorize them to see what changes we're seeing a lot of wraith bloodhound and gibby oddly seeing less horizon we do see it with taylor's crew with tpm as well as amp definitely works we definitely know tech's team is running crypto what's sweet is the apac north's team definitely apec north runs way more crypto compared to north america for some reason north america does not opt to play as much crypto obviously we see gas station at flash point but apac north is running upwards between seven or eight cryptos in the lobby see nothing but drones flying around and just popping off non-stop but what we're seeing here is a bit of diversity did anyone change it there is no octane there is no revenant we still have tsm dolphin in europe actually running you see me octane let's take a look at we know shroud's team see if they're getting contested let's zoom in and take a look at who's flying in we do see flashpoint is pretty close by but they're definitely taking the higher ground my little phony here they go let's take a look at sync's pov i can just feel the frustration knowing that if they have another 50 50 and they lose this right off the rip that's not going to spell well for getting in the top five having a round like this we know shroud's team needs a banger they need a really big round unfortunately wicked does not have armor he does have a helmet at least and there's the armor with the gun situation they're not looking too bad they can definitely make a play if they want a hard grief right back but i'm not really sure sinks is point point man at the moment trying to get his angle not really sure he's gonna be able to find it and there's a cue to go right back to his squad in team opens the door for him what a great doorman i would have opened the door for sinks as well and it looks like they're just going to hard rotate we're not going to see the 5050 that we saw before so we'll have to keep a close eye make sure that no other 5050s are happening in the lobby as you can tell most teams are all playing pretty respectfully now the flashpoint is really really close as well obviously this is flashpoint rambo two we know shroud so just want you to get a memorization of where people are at i'm keeping an eye on them i get the feeling they might full send this but probably not maybe they're not feeling comfortable with their armor situation let's take a look where zone is going to pull so you know what's interesting is that this round is playing very differently than the round we saw before teams are finally having a level of respect for one another in the lobby rotating and playing zone as they should otherwise it feels like it's running like a tdm or a pub which is not the feeling you want no other teams at the moment are really fighting at least they know where zone is they're going to run right towards it and find their positioning in spots so compare the last round this is a nice moment to kind of explain what you're watching if you're just tuning in this is apex legends global series north america last chance qualifier event so what is the last chance qualifier event you may ask it is an event unfortunately does get knocked right out of the air looks like it happened when he's taking the jump tower last chance qualifier event is taking the top five teams and moving right over for the chance at half a million dollars in tournament earnings this is big for teams i don't think they're going to be able to get their bud fortunately you try it's gonna be a little rough gas station sushi needs to find their positioning now got pushed out they're not looking too hot here they have a hard rotation looks like sync's team is rotating right behind another team they got their trail they could to potentially isolate this fight potentially if the other team hard holds the angle they get a solid crack a solid knock although otherwise they're just going to be dancing around each other not going to see too much there yes there is a five-minute delay for those that are watching i am spectating with my own camera so there is a five-minute delay in the stream otherwise you know could definitely be prone to just cheating because they would know exactly where teams are rotating at what they are doing a level of respect has been found in the lobby there's only been one knock so far in the tournament or game two everyone is just finding their footing and their positioning and we're just waiting wait to see what happens this is this is a nice moment nice moment for me after commentating for 10 hours getting hungry thinking about food you may know shroud but do you know pasta i'm hungry for pasta love some spaghetti you know i'm making chat hungry i i such a long time i don't even know what time i ate let's take a look gas station sushi unfortunately they went they tried going for the banner it proved fruitless and now eight second it's all on his own take a look at we know shroud looks like they're getting into a fire fight they do have a nice positioning a nice angle they did get a knock from omni's team so now they're in a 3v2 situation he's just trying to get some additional armor some additional angles some additional items to start to feel comfortable he does spot the hostile switch over to his pov let's take a look at what he's looking at nice triple take shots unfortunately nothing really connects he's scanning just to make sure nobody's rotating right behind them n a seems to be favoring more of the bloodhound than crypto compared to apac north and europe bloodhound is definitely really strong in his own right but his interest is interesting to see how the meta has definitely been switching pander's team is going to be rotating through harvester in just a moment potentially going to see a fight don't worry we're not missing anything over here all the teams are just going to be hunkered down if any team disrespected each other here that would be hard throwing the round i'm not going to lie literally throwing you might as well just throw the tournament while you're at it if they were to push so we're not going to see a whole lot of action there we just need to see how these other teams decide to play this out with fyp trying to find some comfortable angles it's a scan trying to find its positioning we're seeing a 3030 in play uh wyben holding out in the angle they finally discovered a different team four swat definitely needs to top off before he gets that angle or else he's gonna be caught out of position there if they got a crack i definitely felt that i felt the need that they wanted to push let's take a look at am's am's team here this isn't half bad for them still 20 squads remaining a few teams missing here and there we got farm boys trying to farm some kp in the back but they realize that they're too late there's a minute 22 until zone closes farmer lucas trying to find some different positioning with his squad realistically the only thing they can do is to play south side playing north may not be the best bet it's going to be a tough choke point here especially with taylor's holding the tunnel tpm is holding this angle holding the choke little do they know that this is about to get really really sweaty let's take a look back at tmp or tpm excuse me flip-flopping on the names it's been a long day about to happen peaks they let taylor's go down i get what they were going for there but the jump up was a second too late too late and sushi's team gets white super hard with very minimal loss happening from why fyp they come in as a kill leader underdog team here really showing up nice push on their part i get what taylor's team was going for there but fyp just full sent it and i don't think they were ready for them to full send that quite yet i think they were waiting for them to take it a little slow away from some better positioning but it just didn't happen that way now a lot of teams are not going to fight they're going to wait for the next zone to really pop and for something to really occur here just a lot of poke damage happening not missing a whole lot obviously i'm taking a look at the map just to make sure we're not missing any fights let's take a look at absolute monarchy as they decide to take a different angle perhaps they'll fight over at the choke with this team i know eight second is right behind them he's probably not gonna shoot at them he's just gonna wait for them to go into a fight and probably sneak past i'd probably be my play if i was ratting probably wouldn't really go for the third party and just full sentence considering there's really not much kp you can earn it's probably better to get placement points more than anything so i don't think they're aware absolute monarchy because they're not running a bloodhound so i don't think they know that a team is rotated all the way around but they could do it they could do it honestly looks like wyman's team is opting for the long rotation meanwhile all the teams are just chilling rare excellent it's holding some nice gold armor almost got full of zodia here just take a look make sure we're not missing any action intel's team here tempest holding the choke this is not a bad choke to hold they just chill here they vibe everything's going to be looking quite good for them this is kind of the match that i need right now to be quite honest after the craziness that occurred last round you know sometimes you take a breather you need it with apex legends sometimes just stuff gets way too crazy and way too intense let's take a look at tempest pov oh see we got any picked up on a scan he did not wasn't able to pick up we know shroud's team but they do they are aware of the presence because they are they do know that they are there because they hear the shots and it looks like we know shiraz about to get some solid shots here they could etch this team out this is an isolated fight for now as long as turns does not take too much damage which he is he's about to get knocked that bubble came down just a little bit too late i get why he wanted to hold it for the potential push but now it seems to cost him there is sinks going in for a potential kidnap doesn't see anybody there gets a nice r301 shot for 116 damage stinks is full sending it he's taking point but the thing is that if he takes point too much will he get fried and the answer is no sinks knows exactly what's what he's doing here he they see the ult and all the old does it just means that they need to push harder listen sometimes you throw the gibby old it could be a way to push off a team or it could be a way just for the team to realize they need to push harder hambino does go down to arkstar and now this team's in a 3v2 situation not looking too good for their team it looks like they're trying to reset fearful of a third party that's about to happen if they will send it just a little bit too hard there's the kill the finish on hambino the other team decides to rotate out and farmers lucas team is looking at we know shroud and saying hey we might know shroud as well they may know shroud how many people in chat no shroud can we get a tally who all knows shroud i don't know shot unfortunately i mean i know who he is but i don't know him personally i mean i heard he's a good dude no i would love to know shroud but nonetheless now that we've had the conversation about shroud let's take a look at the action it's about to happen looks like absolute mark is about to get into a fight let's take a look at sir lifty going in breaching with the shotgun the gibby bubble is down unfortunately whips a little bit of the shot not a perfect centering it like he pro i was hoping for there's the swamp sleepy panda needs to win and clutch this out he does have the one up at the moment the bloodhound is getting a little bit greedy getting a little bit greedy with his kills he's off to the wingman the wingman whiffs this is not good if he just stuck with the shotgun it might have been better there goes the hard whiff you know what just happened that trade just occurred right there and metro is just trying to reset but it might be a little bit too late for them the zuck does go out and there is the port telling his team to hold on for dear life don't worry i can get you out but it might not be enough six is running out outside the zone and there it is he's about to go out last shot current esports hard griefing teams getting some extra kp they got to three points off that their team is celebrating about that amp just chilling just vibing collecting all the loot from that what they saw farmer lucas is looking to farm some kills off the off the teams here off the zone they're taking some zone damage this is zone z3 incoming this it doesn't feel nice solid plays not too bad let's take a look as well now at how shroud's team has trials team we know shroud is going to push in here they have an uphill battle they're probably the team that's caught out the most at the moment taking a look at them is it wyoming keeping it i mean most of these teams are not fighting uh might see a team over here by team depression i don't think they're aware of each other yeah i don't think they're really gonna fight i think the team happens to be here that's really going to fight compared to the other teams we know shroud has a minute and 14 seconds to get in if they keep waiting any longer this is they need to push in as simple as that and luckily the team is leaving so the decision to hold was the right call once they can try to shoot the center down there there it goes they managed to glitch it out not really glitch it out but just kind of snag that door open just a little bit and now let's see where the next fight is going to happen fyp might get caught at a rotation here depressedly not feeling too hot i wouldn't be feeling too hot after those nice g7 shots g7 scout like a g6 ladies and gentlemen what era of music is that from i'm not a boomer you are let's take a look at the pov here dude's night out it's sunday the dudes are out see if they can get their night out really they're probably gonna be holding there i don't foresee them going too full on in on this it doesn't make a whole lot of sense i don't see a lot of teams really fighting here it'd be kind of odd if a team did even current esports is down below the team right up above is not going to push them there's no reason to jump down they could get an angle and the end of the receivable making a comeback anvil receiver we can talk today let's see how chr manages to clutch us out gets the heel that zone is really going to tick hard this team is going to go out next i guarantee it there's no way they make this in this is free kp for them right up above that he goes down and now crook is just going to have to drop to there's a low ground and there is no team there luckily so he's got his moment but they're going to secure that kp and there you have it ladies and gentlemen my little phony is aware that they got a little lurker there and we know shroud holding the angle here this is the hardest point right here i'm not gonna switch and bring up the map anymore because this is where the fight is going to happen they don't have very much long they have to push right into zone they're going to take the port to buy themselves some time right underneath it's not bad honestly not bad but the thing is that he's about to throw his costa gold right at them or arcstar i thought he had his costa gold up my apologies i haven't seen two teams fight like this close proximity in a hot minute this is pretty crazy just waiting buying time see if there's any else teams fighting tt i don't think the other team is going to fight so let's go over it over to intel let's go with tempus team let's see how they managed to get their way in not looking too shabby for a lot of teams i don't think there's a team that's necessarily caught out too bad team depression could push this team on the far right but if they get griefed that's not looking too good either not looking too hot there's a horizon queue up they make a big play team depression's feeling the sadness here can they spin this around and there's a knock and that's cause for just a full-on push his gibraltar just full on left him he did get it i i i feel like they they should have pushed on that team there but i mean the rng really don't know what's gonna happen you know see where this all plays out excellent rare excellence luckily has height here not looking too bad let me take a sip of water all right flying in his watson gotta get the solid massive shot gets the shield to disappear and now we're reset looking pretty good not too bad rare excellence showing some excellent performance they definitely have a solid amount of kills total of six 11th place not too bad got a total of seven points let's keep it going whoo ladies and gentlemen this is absolute chaos that we're seeing my little phony team is getting hard gated here if they just hug zone this isn't half bad they are taking a split here and now phony could be going down two zone goes for the swap oh that was so close he almost took his own damage there that was really close chad honestly at least you managed to get the swap off just in time at least you can heal up here in just a moment let's take a look right back at height busset boys are they busting it nope they're in the building they're not busting it but the dudes night out are looking to get get out he whiffs his master shot my gosh that's not what you want to see that shot was so detrimental and i don't think his team is ready to back him up quite yet they're a little hard focused and now the gibby ult is there but they do have the bubble to buy themselves some time his watson's team rare excellence is caught out right now once this bubble goes down they're just free pickings they're already free pickings right now as everyone throws a nade at them but they do have two gold shields they might be able to heal it off essentially where excellence needs to make a push 50 seconds to make a play there's the nade it's waiting for him to push there's the angle and now they're free to rotate in rare excellence is the team that's caught at a position right now there's a swap let's see how sung happens to have the angle for him there's the zuck pulling everyone in he's only got a few shots with the eva eight he overextended just a hot minute there but at least he's able to reposition get a sell-off nice clean up actually worked out in their favor total six kills rare excellence is popping off are they gonna make the playoffs commentators curses they get third at the moment they need to reset can they get the res they need to they need to calm down if they were to hold just for a moment and reposition they might have been able to get their wraith but they know that the other team was just right behind them let's switch over to the pov and see what this madness from flashpoint is kopsky trying to find trying to find a location for his team this isn't bad though cubski is looking pretty sharp his shots are on point at the moment literally as i say it shots are on point and now they need to reset and there we go there's the opening damage we got a few teams fighting for it right out in the open flashpoint setting up and now they have the hard angle and their positioning dude's night out unfortunately is losing quite a bit here rare excellence does have two people up they do have kill points keon looking really sharp with seven kills if they manage to hold this get it third place second place it's looking pretty good unless this team decides to jump down on them if they jump down on them i kind of feel like that's a hard throw i don't think your irises team is going to do that they know better than just a jump and actually they're full sending it they actually catch them out this isn't looking good they're going to get grief from a distance potentially actually i was wrong i admit when i'm wrong i admit when i'm wrong big brain play hr i'm a smooth brain they have the most wrinkles in the lobby that was a really smart play on their part by catching him out i guess the team had the same thought process thinking i mean i mean his watson's team i had the same thought process like why would they jump on us why would they do it but i'm a smooth brain they got all the wrinkles in the world hrn pulling it out with the third place so far the thing is can they hold this all they got to do is keep ducking weaving ducking a weaving they're the muhammad ali right now got to be light on their feet sting like a butterfly something like a bee i don't even know anymore listen you know it's approaching 10 hours let's just switch around all of the horse before the carriage the carriage before the horse i don't even know anymore who knows who knows what's going on all i know is that hrn's movement is pretty cracked right now until they're all burning and now we're looking at a kfc console here just getting fried but at least they got gold armor at least they're able to kind of secure it out and there is the port just to buy them some some positioning the best play would be for them to split i'm watching them because i don't know how they're going to get out of this man this is this is rough they're going to have to take the edge dodge it as if they're playing a world of warcraft video game stay out of the fire start positioning if they play their cars right and they play this patient they could clutch out a first place game here let's take a look at the pov from the other team that's right above them flashpoint has point no pun intended on the high ground but are they flashy enough i don't know the guys if you guys have seen uh justice league but every time i hear flash point i think justice league kovski's team holding the high ground sitting in the gas sitting in the gas man and there it is flashpoint coming in with a solid cleanup here this is their game congratulations flashpoint taking the round flashpoint coming in pot they're taking they would like for them to be i don't even know the words anymore just

definitely switching things up things are very very different in terms of composition we'll see we'll see if teams are going to opt for the revenant octane let's see if they actually do revenant octane are they actually gonna do it we saw it happen in europe we saw it happen in apac north are we gonna actually see it happen in north america are they gonna get honestly you know what happens in north america i feel like they're going to i feel like they're going to meme on them the first team that does it the first team that decides to run octane revenant is going to get memes so hard and i feel like we're going to see it happen this next round what do you guys think what do you guys bet cheers razzle dazzle it's great to have you here by the way buddy thank you so much man we're about

playoffs start and uh i believe it not i don't know if it's next week or the following week because i don't know what day it is anymore but nonetheless it is coming soon the top five teams are gonna be moving on which is the top five teams that we're looking at over here we got chr hrn flashpoint rare excellence and six xz's that's who we're looking at right now about to get started next round once we hop into round on pause the music i want to follow we know shroud's team as well as gas station i want to see if they're going to 50 50 off the rip i want to see if they're going to do it i just feel like i can feel the twitter draft being sent right now the twitter draft is saying why are you contesting us in fragment east why are you being weird sometimes you gotta contest i don't know i don't have the answer for it i'm just i'm posing the question to chat i'm posing the question to the world i'm curious i'm generally curious oh we've gone through a lot of water today good luck have fun ladies and gentlemen here it is i feel like we're about to go on a roller coaster literally i feel like we're on a roller coaster should be starting say good luck have fun there it is 10 seconds 10 seconds ladies gentlemen we're just vibing next round caden was watching at 3 30 a.m went to bed woke up and you're still going we're still going man i we're still going this next round this is going to be let's take a look at the teams all right who wants to make bets all of chat who wants to make bets who's going to be the first team that runs octane revenant anybody got any any any takers do i have any takers in chat who do you believe is going to run octane revenant first who's gonna cave to the octane revenant meta um if i were to place a bet and there's no disrespect whatsoever who would i etch to run octane revenant take a look at the scoreboard i'm trying to take a guess probably the busted boys or gas station sushi partly because gas station sushi has been full sending it man so to only compliment them with the the full sending you might as well just go revved in octane you know but i feel like the busset boys are gonna be looking for some kp they're playing really smart with the positionings but listen there's nothing there's no shame in the octane revenant you know i'm just i'm just putting it out there it's just we see it so much ranked it's it's talked about everywhere on twitter it's just the only thing we have to talk about you know okay let's get into it ladies and gentlemen let's follow we know shroud's team let's take a look at wicked's pov let's pause the music so you can hear all the footsteps and all the beautiful noises of apex legends let's get right into it this might be a good place all right after this round we're halfway through ladies and gentlemen we know shroud are you guys gonna get contested again i'm not wishing it upon you guys i wish you guys the absolute best i wish everyone has a happy landing spot of no 5050s no fitty fitties this isn't 50 cents no fitty fitties don't do it i think they're going to 50 50. i think it's going to happen chat i'm hoping for no 50 50s but i think it's going to happen i mean my little phony i mean if they get good armor i mean they can essentially just go full send it you know i think they see them here solid damage nice using the canister by the way good cover there looking pretty solid you know got got the nice canister got the nice gas trap going blocks a little bit of the damage man this is this is looking a little so this is looking sweaty here you can feel the tension you can feel the heat there's a scan right back nobody wants to get dropped at 20th place right now nobody wants it just don't do it please i'm begging both of both these teams find a different rotation just don't fight it just rotate out go to no name oh i guess you can't go to no name if stomp says there by himself go to no name it's okay there you go i i it doesn't matter there's no shame at either of these teams backing out i just would rather see some of these teams go to end zone rather than fighting 50 50 right off the rip that's just my opinion just my thoughts i just i just don't see the value but stops needs to get the heck out of here before this team runs up on him the sinks might be aware and if he catches him out that's that's that's done so for him dunzo don finished no other teams are fighting at the moment oh actually absolute monarchy about to roll up on on a team here they are fully aware they hear them grabbing the crafting materials sleepy panda walking up with the g7 like a g6 oh it's got chills there i don't know about you guys chad i almost got chills just waiting for them to rotate in solid damage but i'm not sure is the other guy did he rotate yeah he already rotated sorry for missing some of the shots i just wasn't sure if he rotated already almost like he did this is the only fight that's really happening are they going to full engage this they do see the team we know shroud by the way hambina's team is flying right across so they have the oppo there's two teams about to break out and i wonder which one's actually going to full commit i don't really know which one is actually going to do it i think chr is going to back off looks like there are as well looks like everyone's not full committing on any fight we still have 60 people in the lobby remaining with only a minute and three seconds until the zone closes probably best to go to zone kind of chill kind of vibe out listen you know can we just netflix and and chill in the middle of the zone can we all just netflix and chill for a moment amp says no amp is rotating right behind them they're saying no we're not going to netflix and chill in fact i'm going to unsubscribe to netflix i'm going to go back to blockbuster grab myself a movie show up in my place um aggressively with love i don't even know where we're going with this but nonetheless amp is showing up here i'm just trying to highlight the fact that they're just they're full on aggro with them anybody remember blockbuster blockbuster was great until netflix showed up netflix showed up and ruined everything i know we're missing vayne's fight but we're also watching a fight happening right here in front of us amp is gonna go down and now they're just gonna full sent run away that's it it's done done it's over it's over man it's over see if we're missing any of the other fights we also have another fight happening my little phony is holding up at the angle here farm boys just chilling just farming with the vibes let's switch over to harvester because the busted boys are busting it six xz's need to be very careful because they get knocked out here this is our team in fifth place this is our team at fifth place they need to be smart they need to be careful looks like we did see a knock from turns but i'm not gonna switch to that pov i'm kind of curious how this is all going to play out this is getting really really rough we know shroud is about to roll up looks like farmer lucas and his team hands back down after they got that knock we're seeing non-stop fights definitely occurring we're trying to capture the action as soon as it occurs we're just gonna have to guess essentially what's going to happen a lot of teams are playing quite strange that you know they're trying to get into zone i understand i respect it but at the same time here it is busted boys are they going to be able to get into a fight here here it is murdog getting a fry needs to go right back through the port they are going through the zone and decoys does go down there's the bubble to buy himself some time murdog accidentally goes right back probably claiming he needs help but he goes right back to the zone this is not looking good man this is going to be an instant knock for them hill's team cleans it up nice uh clean up there and dudes night out is catching this other team out in rotation the volt is absolutely frying this team they need to full send this duplex there's the port screaming push push push push by the way robo thank you so much for becoming an aim trainer really appreciate your support on the channel really means a whole lot thank you guys so much for the support don't forget to leave a like on the stream and the channel every little bit help support and for others to find us on youtube dude tonight i was pushing making their way downtown going fast here's the bubble and there's the eva there's no dmca here on youtube ladies and gentlemen because i only only sung it for just a hot second there it is nice bolt damage duplex has to cut the corner i don't remember if he's on controller if he's on mouse and keyboard but nonetheless they reset i wasn't about to say he's about to do that nice taft strafe he's finishing up the mop here he's just trying to clean up before they go through trying to finish him is not enough does he take the port back does he claim the kill is it worth it is it not worth it we don't know we don't have all the answers let's take a look at we know stratix is about to get into a gunfight here they see them there's a lot of caustic traps here at this angle my god there's non-stop fighting occurring there's 16 teams left we're still in the first zone what is happening are we playing pubs is this pubs ladies and gentlemen where is the disrespect happening everyone's going right to zone there's no respect to the lobby everyone's just kind of pushing getting everyone out of their angles and their corners madness is in the lobby not my madness i mean he's already qualified i'm sorry you're not in the lobby but i mean congratulations for already qualifying you know all right as we hang tight silence has fallen upon the lobby sync's team is not going to rotate on that doesn't make a whole lot of sense they're definitely nervous about what they see the only team that has the potential to fight is six xvs but even then they're down a person so i'm not really sure if they're going to engage on this tempest team does have height they do have a potential angle they could clutch this out if they're aware of them that is and there's the scan counting the numbers they would be giving up height but at least they could get some kp and probably rotate back i don't think i i mean they could edge this i think i think they have every opportunity they could definitely edge this and the reason i'm bringing up the map i want you to see the location of where these teams are fighting and where things are going to take place because this is probably the only fight that's going to happen if a team fights over there i'm going to call that they're throwing but this team fighting isolate out here this this makes sense for now if they're edging but it looks like scurvy's team is gonna hard rotate his watson's team which is rare excellence doesn't have any kp but they definitely have some decent armor and they need to rotate in before it's a little bit too late otherwise they'll get caught out dudes night out just chilling in the donut just vibing as they vibe and they do my little phony just chilling on the opposite side of the donut rainbow just while bouncing just chilling it's a great moment just to let you know if you're just tuning in just say welcome the channel this is apex legends global series last chance qualifiers be sure to leave a like and help support the channel um i'm definitely doing this a fun brand i'm enjoying it a whole lot um i guess my definition of fun is is definitely a little wild considering been going about almost 10 11 hours now nonetheless i'm having a blast so a lot of teams are not fighting at the moment just because we're waiting for the zone to see where the position is let's take a look at things maybe he's going to get us a nice juicy craver shot i believe anybody get this get the shot do do it for do it for chat do it for chat get get the shot i believe in you ready three two oh 145 damage there's a crack sink is definitely screaming to his teammates i cracked one amy he did it for you guys you should you should you should leave a like support sync for for getting that shot he did it for you i know he did now as silence falls upon the lobby we wait for teams to rotate the zone has a minute and we'll see where teams decide to go because right now look everyone is just holding everyone oh i missed the shot i apologize holy and i think he's going to repeat that my man if syncs hit you with a crater shot the first time why would you repeat him the second time he just wasted so many resources let's take a look at his armor situation let's take a look at this i mean yeah he's using a phoenix now i mean you're you're wasting your wasting through resources there's no reason ever to peek that poor man again stinks is just begging for it cause he's loving his armor honestly he's almost to red at this point not too bad i remember hollywood video i'm definitely dating myself i remember not dating myself physically you get dating myself in terms of age anyways nonetheless we're all we're all good guys who are all vibing kopsky unfortunately does get knocked god knock from a distance tech is just trying to put his drone out just to make sure they don't do not push so he might put his ult out to stop them so he's got it in a nice position just give him a stop if he needs to all you need to do is pop his alt and then boom they're set for rotation he's going to opt to rotate on the north side which isn't looking too good because they're going to be running into a different team fat fruit ninja and his team are hard gating with the other spot flashpoint has the hardest rotation in the lobby at the moment we'll see how this all plays out it's really the only this is the only way that it's really going to play ladies and gentlemen the other teams aren't really going to push oh there we go sorry i apologize on tech's part good movement unfortunately this one was not enough he did got caught out of position see if peach is able to buy tech some time that he is not but he can go for the banner the zone is closing they're wasting time the zone two they could eat a little bit of this but not enough to really justify it peach is potentially going to go down here he needs cups to kind of cover for him but at the same time he doesn't want to give up his rat spot because if he does go down looks like they are okay they have found their footing but they do have an opportunity to be pushed out of position here all they can do is hard edge flash point had a massive kill game from before they need to keep it together to maintain their status because if they get knocked out early that's not good it's not good nice solid damage from on senpai and there's that shot breaking through the gibby shield in case you don't know gibby's shield was nerf and there is blew through damage now so if there's a sniper shot a creeper shot it bleeds right into his health pole which is what you just saw there as an example let's take a look absolute monarchy stuck in the choke here with ice sleepy panda they're giving up their height just a little bit to rotate there is a sandwich occurring here absolutely marnick is going to opt to come right back into this gunfight there is the krypto alt boom all the bubbles are gone everything is reset now all they need to do is get into zone and push them out as i would say push them out push them out nice solid damage coming in from i see panda and i know we just missing or senpai getting some solid damage from across the map let's switch that pov we got to keep an eye on these two fights simultaneously i know one is just as valuable as the other asumar nikki stuck in the center here it's making me nervous man i want to capture the action take your time please you guys are popping off make my life just a little bit easier can you guys hold off why am just either gets fried or they actually push this team out please we we know shroud to hold for just a minute because i would like to see the action happening over here at the same time because they need to find their positioning and they decide to queue back the gibby's going to full senate they fortunately fat fruit ninja does go down and i now ice or lift he's going to go down right after sleepy panda's running for his sheer life wyben has an off angle here this choke is becoming an absolute mess flashpoint is making a push in believing that they have an opportunity to make a push but little did they realize that they already cleaned up the team and they're ready for them now they have the uphill battle of pushing through a full squad also now a dude's night out is showing up showcasing that is not only a girls night out but a dude's night out all together and there's the q they rotate back it's just it's just a duck and weave pattern man teams are ducking and weaving flash points just waiting for the right moment to just get in they have two seconds before zone starts to close what a crazy round ladies and gentlemen and they're ducking weaving tmp coming right back into this fight not too bad up sushi trying to find the positioning nice solid triple take damage there are they going to finish them off hard focus is the wrong team now sushi is really hurt they essentially have to wait till sushi finishes off this whole phoenix maybe sponge spaghetti can clutch something out here sushi is now full health there is the zuck going out they managed to get a solid kill there not too bad as they're getting thirded getting shot from all angles they need to rotate in taylor's team is screaming for them to get out it's not enough because they're getting started right in the back this may not be enough for them to get out switch over to the bloodhound how he's going to manage this sync is still popping off with the crater just non-stop action happening left or right in the lobby as the zone decides to close got to try to capture as much action as humanly possible we need to switch over to chr see how they're doing because they are our master of the squad unfortunately does not get that damage but it does go down up sushi's getting shot from all angles and they have to get into zone let's take a look at poor dudes out aves is about to go out here i highly doubt he's going to survive this scenario pieces in the back here we have a 3v1 v1 happening in the building and there goes that out and flashpoint is probably going to be going out next while we have panders team on the south side all rotating this is free real estate right now flash point let's see how they're gonna handle the situation see if they go out at least in ninth place boom there's the massive shot wyben coming in and clutching let's see who we got left in the lobby ladies and gentlemen in terms of the top teams the c8 chr is our first place team so we're gonna watch them for the time being right now hrn i believe is still in flashpoint is out rare excellence is i believe still in they are so we'll keep a close eye ambino has the crater this time this is where we're going to see some crabby shots to see if they create an opening rare excellence looks like they have some solid damage let's switch over to their pov rare excellence making a play here god there's so much action happening it's just non-stop it's been non-stop overall and there is the cleanup that they're gonna get it's going to be a 3v2 situation as long as they don't take too much damage if they just kind of edged us out they knocked out up sushi this this these teams this should all be kosher here unless syncs decides to third this these are the teams we have to worry about hrn has the uphill battle they are in second place right now with 27 points they have a total of around 6 kp at the moment this isn't looking too good for them uphill battle let's see how they managed to clutch this out i mean they could port past they don't have they do have the bubble there's the scan hill is pushing in they get a nice swap and trade minimal damage they're gonna probably finish them to go for the swap he's probably screaming for hill to go for the swap but he's actually finishing his bat they have minimal time they need to rotate in he's blocking the door the wraith is coming out of the building eures is slow crawling in getting some solid r301 shots but it may not be enough there goes the bubble he gets pushed out hill is getting knocked he goes takes the zip back and there it is crh does have the high ground it's over anakin and they come in for some nice kp points at the end we're looking at a top four situation versus chr rare excellence we know shroud and there you have it ladies and gentlemen last few teams wyben might get caught in position as wicked gets some wicked shots popping off here trying to hold the angle he gives up the angle they need to be careful because he could get caught out all the teams nobody's actually in zone right now nobody wants to be the first one and the first one is probably going to be the one that's going to get hard focused so see how this plays out though i promise you the first team that decides to go into zone or the first team that that engages is going to be the first team that goes out in fourth place unless unless see this nasty little peak here 43 seconds getting pretty intense getting pretty sweaty notice how the lobby just went chills chills ladies and gentlemen some solid peaks everyone's just kind of ducking and weaving binding their time watch as the apex legends plays play in the natural environment it gets a solid crack decides to end on it what is the int effective i have to say honestly the end is pretty effective this is this is theirs this is theirs they need to not get greedy though if they fall right behind them they'll be the last one to get pushed in in this choke rare excellence needs to be careful as they push in luckily they do have the port they're not getting picked on by sink's team we know shroud anymore wicked getting some solid shot his watson getting caught in a position he has no gun in his hand at the moment he's just trying to find him out but it looks like rare excellent is going to be going on potentially in third place wicked is just trying to have an angle here and there it goes hayes watson gets knocked by turns so chr has a total of eight kills at the moment why wicket's team has a total i mean they're they're looking pretty good this is this is the this is the game that we know strata is looking for we're looking at the first place winner versus a team that's not looking so hot nice 59 damage by sinks he was trying to hold for the 69 damage trying to clutch it out because we all know what 69 is about it's just a number ladies and gentlemen relax all those good all as well a minute six seconds see if you manage if there's a crack i promise you they're gonna full send it if there's a full-on crack they do see that he's isolated on the right side so they may opt to take the teams on the left the two people he doesn't have a whole lot of charge rifle shots and he's got an alternator hand kind of surprised to see an alternator at this level nice 50 damage at least breaks down the shield he's running low on ammo though there's the bubble now we have the bubble versus bubble we have a venn diagram almost in the works sinks has taken an off angle he's going to try to take height guarantee it he's going to take height there it is my boy coming in with the height but unfortunately the flank was just not as effective would it have been better if he stayed would it have been better if he stayed i i don't know i get where he was going for there going for the height to take the angle but i think once the team saw him queue out they saw it as just a free push a free 3v2 i saw what he was going with there if the team was play played a little passive and waited just an additional five seconds i think he would have had it honestly thank you would have had it oh man pretty pretty crazy now let's switch back over here in just a moment i need to go to the washroom this is a great moment for us to get up go to the washroom i'm going to showcase the score on screen i just need a hot second ladies i just need a moment to go to the washroom i'm going to hop into game four we're over the halfway mark ladies and gentlemen over the halfway mark we're doing it which over the scoreboard halfway grab yourself a coffee grab yourself a snack grab yourself some water go to the washroom come back come vibe come chill we got three more rounds to go three more rounds to go and you see the scoreboard that is updated here i'm gonna leave this on screen click the link above let's come back and let's analyze this together we'll analyze this together once i'm connected into the lobby i want to break this down for you but i want to make sure at least i go to the washroom for a moment and we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen so take a look at the scoreboard we'll be right back [Music] [Music] all right ladies and gentlemen we're back looks like the lobby is filling up came back at the right moment don't you love it don't you love it when you come back right at the right moment hopefully got a chance to look at the scoreboard and see chr is now our first place honestly at this point going in with uh a few more rounds remaining we're really looking at the fact that these teams take a look here on the halfway mark not bad not bad that last round was really really solid very very solid overall not too bad ladies and gentlemen game four we have three more matches remaining chr has really kind of claimed their spot all they have to do is just stay consistent they're gonna be in the top five top five not a bad play not bad at all so when you stepped away if you stepped away at the same time as me what did you do did you grab yourself a snack hopefully you're doing well don't forget to leave a like on the stream in the channel i'm very very excited to have all of you guys here really means a whole lot again don't forget to leave a like on the stream every little bit helps support what we do here on the channel alright so just a hot second we will be getting right back into the fray and into the match and yeah we'll be good to go let's see here five five minutes so i believe we probably have about two or three minutes before this round starts and then we should be good to go again if you're just tuning in this is apex legends global series north america first time casting north america um i think now i have a total of maybe eight or nine casts under my belt i'm still relatively new to casting but i've been really finding my groove and starting to get really comfortable with it hopefully you guys are enjoyed joining me on the journey i just appreciate the fact that you guys are watching watching competitive apex very passionate about it i myself have competed done a lot of scrims understand the length of the game there's always something new to learn even as we're putting out guys tutorials weapon tier list it the meta shifts of how people maximize and capitalize things and there's only so much that you can predict now we'll have to see which team is going to change up their comp his teams have been very consistent with their comp and not switching they've been sticking with their gun and saying this is what we practice this is what works we'll see if they decide to switch or not so game four only a little bit more to go here right now looking at the scoreboard just as a reminder again chr 50 points hrn at 59 points or 56 30 let's start that over chr 50 points hrn 36 points rare excellence 35 points flash point 26 points then we have we know shroud at 22. so this is one two three four five these are our top five teams that we're looking at at the moment we know shroud had a pretty big game there this is exactly what they needed they just need to be consistent for the next three rounds here halfway point because honestly what they could do a lot of these teams i mean we could even see a team lower down you know mst win two rounds in a row and instantly go into you know finals you know or playoffs so we'll just see how this plays out and what's going to happen he's still making those pancakes rain good old caustic let's give a shout out to everyone in chat keanu isaac the diesel damash michael reeves milk and cookies oh my god that sounds so good right now hi my name is bob it's so great to have you here virtuoso arnesta the diesel one froggy all of you guys thank you so much really means the world this has been an experience this is i don't think this is anything i'm ever gonna forget by the way i appreciate you for joining me on this like i guarantee you years from now i'm going to look back and i'm going to remember when we stayed up and went through three a 12-hour cast i'm never going to forget it because it's insane to do to begin with but it's so much fun and it's memorable like i'm never going to forget it i'm always going to remember it's going to be something that we share together so if you're here today you shared that moment with me you know i i can't wait for all of us to be in advance again to see apex legends in person it's moments like this that really bring the apex community together and really means the world um and i look forward to if people attend the in-person event i'm hoping that by that maybe that point one day i'm still casting and maybe i get to say hi to you guys and shake your hands and you know it'll be great be really really great all right we're going into the next round here in just a moment two minutes until we launch and we should be good to go good call on the water let me drink a little bit more okay okay okay okay ten seconds ladies and gentlemen here we go game four of apex legends global series winter circuit last chance qualifiers right before the playoffs north america let's go baby let's make it happen they don't normally uh shoutcast last chance qualifiers but i stepped in i felt it was very important for people to see last chance qualifiers i think it's important i think it means a lot uh because these are the teams that it gives them their their time as well all right let's go in take a look at the comps see if anything shifts here let me go and pause the music should be good to go in just a hot second just trying to memorize all the comps that i see i know some of them are obviously not shown correctly they probably left the lobby maybe went to go do a quick pub nonetheless kind of curious how we're going to see some of these teams switch it up still see a lot of horizons crypto has not made a big enough splash switch back and forth okay we're still seeing everyone running the same same comps okay so everyone's staying very consistent we're at the halfway mark this is game four i don't think we'll see or feel the pressure until let's say game five or six and that's whenever we're going to see things really change change up essentially so the reason i'm following we know shroud's team is just because they've been getting 50 50 right off the rip here pretty much consistently and last time you know obviously they managed to find their footing but this has been quite uncomfortable for them but it looks like they're kind of giving it to them this time around i wonder if they had a little gentleman's agreement nice throw on the shield there for his bloodhound and just if you're new to apex legends the reason why he threw his bubble is when he's scanning who's extremely vulnerable so he doesn't want him to get shot it's a free bubble it's a freeway just for him to get a scan without getting shot so it looks like they're opting to rotate to no name right away and i don't see any other fights really breaking out there might be one potentially and skyhook if they happen to run into each other we'll see if that actually occurs or not pretty solid game so far no 50 50s off the rip here a lot of teams are all playing quite respectfully as you can tell from the lobby but they are aware of them let's see what fyp does in the scenario they have a devotion they have a p2020 they have some decent guns enough to make kind of a splash but we'll see if it's enough to make a big difference there's a scan did not pick them up so they have an opportunity to go surprise them knowing that they didn't pick them up on the scan there's a horizon queue out the open and they're just trying to assess the situation sushi's team looks like they're just going to rotate through the north side of skyhook here they're not going to engage they're going to take it quite slow and play it safe no other teams are fighting the zone is going to close it's mostly going to pull towards epicenter or survey we'll see where that actually pulls for the finale here uh sleepy panda looks like he's getting some shots let's see how they managed to clutch this out he's trying to get back on height to help his friend free agent or fa eight second taking height just to try to get get an angle here nice spray with the l-star this is exactly what they need as long as he plays patient waits for his teammate unfortunately it does get flanked i don't even hear audio on that nice ark star what an archer what a throw all he has to do is come clean this up gets his spray and unfortunately it's just not enough because the mastiff has a faster kill [Applause] dps overall compared to the spitfire this is why the spitfire is fantastic but of course when you're running against a mastiff it's just not going to be enough pressure but that arcstar is beautiful beautiful art star as he ran up unfortunately i didn't even hear the footsteps on the left i wonder if he heard the footsteps because he got completely caught off guard holding that angle it felt like he'd probably just slid jump around the angle to really catch him out so really big play on their team we'll see how teams decide to continue to push us out mst looking for an opportunity the zone they know where it's pulling i was actually wrong i was actually wrong on this is actually pulling towards no name it's actually going to be somewhere right around this open area here i've seen this end here several times and now they're gonna have to go through choke let's see if sync's team we know shroud wicked as well as turns is aware of them about to roll up and if they're just going to surprise him wait for it i'll wait for the audience to hear it there it is there's the surprise attack arcstar just to buy some some time there nice r 99 spray they need to clean this up quick before they get 30 which is occurring right now we know shroud's team is in trouble and wicked is just running for dear life metro's team is showing up in a big way here with panders taking the helm panters is full on chasing almost knocks them just not enough needs one more hit unfortunately his teammate was not able to clutch that out goes for an additional scan when they run out they're running into a whole different team now all they can do is hope that the other team runs into it throws the arc star and all he has to do to rotate and all he's trying to do is just buy time turns gets shots in the shot in the back and there it is now vayne omni and scurry are rotating out and just holding their angle holding their positioning realizing there's another team right behind them [Music] gotta flex just a single shot spitfire and there's the rotation out so at least they have the building they're secure there there really should not be much fighting occurring here just mostly poke damage they somehow get a magical knock which i highly doubt it's going to occur oh and maybe i spoke too soon commentators curse fury's really feeling the burn here swamp for the armor if it's possible there it is only unfortunately it's only only get able only able to get more white armor hills team is running up hill's team is doing quite well still in second place they need to be careful or not to get knocked out too early because they want to secure some positioning but it looks like they're just cutting right across and probably going to play the rocks so hill's team is just gonna chill here on the hill no pun intended and just keep rotating for a better angle they just pretty much left all this in the dust here meanwhile tempus team is getting shot right in the back looks like they managed to hold them out panders team does rotate right back and they do reset we do see a potential six x z's going in for a potential fight here i know they heard those footsteps because i heard them on my my screen and there they are sliding they need to be careful they're about to get pushed in the building let's see if oh whiz wiz's shots are strong enough on his flat line and there it is he's going for the crypto for them to push right up above and see if they got some damage the arc star does go out nate is just refreshing healing well wait for this encounter to play out silence falls upon the lobby ladies and gentlemen as we wait to see and there it is there's the scan i knew he was running away from something i was like there it is there's the moment of truth running for dear life trying to find a different building and reset they're getting pushed in this building let's see if swervy excuse me nades and i can't talk it's been a long day hey the words are escaping me ladies and gentlemen lost for words oh whiz getting fried trying to reset the mastiff is coming in clutch to switch the povs nays does go down they're held up in the bathroom as if this was a nightclub on a sunday night and it is a sunday night but it is not a nightclub not the night club that you want to be a part of and get shot in the back and team depression is no longer depressed i wouldn't be depressed after that fight not a pretty clean fight there's no knocks now they have a lot of healing looking pretty positive looking pretty good not too bad now we see all the teams are fighting within their general area hrn is getting picked on at the moment there's a scan to buy them just a little bit of time and there's the gibraltar alt they need to reposition and recoup and there is hills he may go out here at 16th place this isn't looking good ladies and gentlemen this is hill's team was in second place overall now they are down hell this isn't good is this new by the way this is live by the way this is live i apologize if i i definitely feel like i'm losing steam and trying to keep up with the momentum we're keeping it together we only have a few more rounds left let's get it baby yuri's team getting shot fried in the back we're keeping eyes on them because this is our number two team ladies and gentlemen this is their number two team they matter these are close to champions if they manage to close this out if not they're going to drop on the leaderboard rare excellence has the opportunity to surpass them which we're going to keep an eye on in just a moment in just a second they're ducking and weaving trying to find their positioning they got a wraith port they're getting chased they're getting chased this is not looking good for your reese's team simply and your wreaths are trying to just hold waiting and prank simply gets fried by a mastiff and there it is the r3 when misses almost every single shot lands only 24 damage throws his bubble and now this is it this is this is this is how it ends this is how it ends and chr is looking quite hot because they got a solid damage there and this is only better for chr because they are in 15th place and they have good positioning in the zone chr is just securing it man ombino's team is doing quite well for themselves now you saw them they dropped their arms and the reason they're dropping their armors is because they want to avoid the crypto damage from crypto olds that's why their armors are on the ground it's not because they don't like their armors you know maybe they want a breath of fresh air but nonetheless that's where we're at let's take a look at a different pov here team depression while they were holding the building before are now that look at that flex you don't see that quite often in a tournament boop him right in the head can't remember who he is [Music] okay mai i don't know if he remembers who he is at that moment he booped him so hard on the head he might be back in the lobby with amnesia i would be switching off the map i apologize i had it open was just switching povs murdock thoughts of boys are really struggling in this tournament they have a lot of talent a lot of skill but they're definitely struggling to find their footing murdock's team is definitely quite low on the leaderboards right now they need some kp they need some points but they can't seem to find the knocks and there it is busa boys makes a push in and like i said they're looking for the kp they just don't care they're full sending it there's the ark star and there's the thermite they're coming in everyone's quite low they can all die essentially from one solid massive shot so if they're not careful this is going to be it's all 51 damage but it's not going to be enough because murdog is about to get flanked in the back by a massive and there it is ladies and gentlemen they are out 15th place amp get amped they're pushing up amp getting amped in the situation just as much as i'm getting aimed but he's trying to reload it it is a cluster but at least they managed to clutch it up and have some good positioning and reset they're not going to get dirty actually they are getting third sushi's team is showing up going to deliver some sushi giving them the zuck and there it is ladies and gentlemen they got some solid cracks they're stuck up there he's got an eva eight he's rocking a purple bolt it is time to do some damage that caustic is doing way too much damage though the zuck is counter-intuitive it's they're not able to find their footing he could though bounce outside the building pop his cue or fly or jump outside but there is another team rolling up they may need to rotate out of this this isn't looking too hot this is not the clean fight that they were looking for these aren't the joys they're looking for where is anakin where's the high ground where's obi-wan kenobi when you need him amped wow they really held it together they're feeling pretty good they're feeling amped all right ladies gentlemen he gets knocked his charge rifled from an angle where was that angle where the heck did that come from i think he shot it from right above and this this this q i i don't know if this was good or bad fanatical is just probably screaming for dear life asking why he put it there but nonetheless at least it bought him some time cool ladies and gentlemen this is getting pretty intense there's still 12 squads remaining let's take a look at c chr is still in the running and we still have flash points still in the running we're still looking pretty good as well as is rare excellence yes we still have our top three teams for the most part still it outside of hills team which is hrn eures and simply this is looking pretty crazy let's take a look at chr they haven't really moved this is why i haven't been focusing on that's not doing anything wrong oh looks like they're actually making commentators curse is a perfect moment for us to take a look at exactly what's happening here switch over to the caustic to see if he's able to find an angle push right back into the gas i know he can see them he's telling them all to breathing in maybe they can't breathe properly there's the gas another one this team is this is it man he's throwing those pancakes as chat was saying but unfortunately gosh i don't know how hambino got knocked there if they don't clean this up relatively quickly this is gonna be it for them he tries to rotate back but it's just not enough now they're in h they're in hp throws the caustic barrel tries to res them are they going to be able to reset this chr is our first place team by the way at the moment with 50 points 50 points ladies and gentlemen and he gets knocked and they're about to go out in 12th place with a minimum kp they have they had two kill points he's going for the rez he's got a gold bag which can buy them some time he's kidding him in the back saying i got you brother you look like santa claus from coca-cola you good drink another coke there's a cosmic barrel just buying them some time he's going to pop the smoke just to disorient them but he is burning burning burning burning he's feeling the burn there's non-stop action happening we're switching the this this gibby's just gone he doesn't exist anymore while tpm is sitting in the building looking quite good and let's take a look at flashpoint and see how they're holding up flashpoint is on point they're sitting on the point you know where this is gonna end ladies gentlemen it's gonna end right here they're pinging it they we're we're all on the same page we're on the same page we're on the same page we all know where it's going to end we all know where it's going it's going to right here it's going to ride right here i know it i don't know i'm so excited about that we're all on the same page we should conduct a search right here if it doesn't end there would be super sad let's take a look at rare excellence they have been hard edging they don't have any kp at the moment but they're on the north side i wonder if they're aware of ack ackman's team let's see how this plays out i don't think they're gonna they may find honestly they may fight this is an isolated encounter otherwise i'll switch over to fat fruit ninja squad because they're also fighting here too okay let's switch over to fat fruit ninja squad because it looks like they're not going to hard engage over on the far right absolute monarchy guy has to make a play here if they stay here for too long it's not going to look good they need to rotate over to the left sir lefty taking some massive damage in the back he does pop his bubble but now he does not have the bubble for a rotation but at least they do have a good solid minute and there is the crypto it's about to go off they need to push they have to push and they're not going to push i guess it makes sense to go to zone maybe that makes sense that makes sense i i i'll take it i'll take it i mean the downside though is that with the team in the back they're gonna become a sandwich i don't know if anybody has ever worked a subway but you're looking at a sandwich these are sandwich artists and this is kind of why i thought they should take out the team in the back one when they had the crypto old because right now all they're going to do is be stuck here and the team has already recovered and now absolute monarchy is in an absolute dire situation i love crypto i really do i think he's an underrated legend especially when i see him play an apac north it puts a smile on my face so it's nice to see fat fruit ninja's team really rocking crypto all right looks like they're not going to fight all the teams are just kind of chilling and vibing as you can see flashpoint is kind of holding the center zone while his watson's team rare excellence waiting for an angle waiting for an angle and by the way this is live ladies and gentlemen is on a five-minute delay so hopefully you're enjoying this commentary enjoying the stream don't forget to leave a like support this is apex alleged global series last chance qualifiers north america let's go this way all right we'll just hang tight we'll just wait here i i just rare excellence has probably the harder rotation in a lot of teams do unfortunately this is this is going to get hard to commentate mostly because the teams are probably going to fight at the same exact moment so i really really feel like it's about to happen absolute monarchy might find some positioning here but wyoming is going to see them he's going to see them nice movement there nice wall bounce popped right over didn't didn't waste a second didn't waste a beat unfortunately he gets a little bit of damage but not enough to make any crack but he dig or cracked himself took two sprays from two different individuals they're in a this isn't a bad spot i've seen them hold i've seen people hold this individual spot before after monarchy on the other hand is an absolute shambles nice solid spray but is it going to be enough he needs to reset he needs to bat doesn't look like he has any bats in reserve he needs it though and there it is the kryptol takes away the bubble and now absolute monarchy is in absolute trouble they're just waiting for the right opportunity i don't think he has any bats and there he goes fat from ninja does go out and there we have it let's take a look at flashpoint wyben actually will take a look at their pov this is the bubble fight of the century they're rolling in we have the vault they have height and they go right back underneath and chill and vibe trying to get the loot from over the wall oh man that sucks that's not what you want to see i don't know how they had such an angle there they had such an angle i'm frustrated for him flashpoint does or rambo's team trying to switch over to them give me a second having a little bit of a hard time getting into their pov let's just go to flashpoint because they have a different pov on this team anyways they're just right on top of each other unfortunately it's getting hard a little bit to click i know i can hit a keybind but nonetheless here we are reviving we're present it's been a very long day but i'm enjoying myself hopefully you're enjoying yourself at home as well don't forget to leave a like comment subscribe means a whole lot and it looks like flashpoint my gosh they could be going out here this is our fourth place team but they do find their positioning and footing that's not half bad not half bad at least they got the gas they're all breathing it in breathing it in ladies and gentlemen amp is caught his only got 14 seconds 14 seconds 14 seconds with his watson's team also being revived with a gold bag okay these are the two teams i'm not gonna be able to literally catch both of them at the same time but i'll try to catch rare excellence team because they happen to be higher up on the scoreboard so that's my justification for following them at the moment i don't know i don't know how they're gonna i guess they're okay looks like they're okay here but they're getting shot in the back and they're about to become the sandwich this is getting pretty rough there's a thermite he's burning from it and one of his teammates says watson does go down this is not good this is where this is this is the end he just needs to buy time he's in top six where excellence can you clutch it out can you recover it looks like chaon does go down and sung is out in the open let's take a look at current esports looks like they're all okay rare excellence just holding a bond holding on by a thread of life you could find some spacing right underneath everything he's looking for an angle i don't know if he's going to find it though man oh my god oh my gosh what a spot what a spot i didn't even think that i didn't even know that existed i didn't know you could fit in there that's insane i'm i'm actually mind blown and there's actually a rez actually taking place as we speak at the moment look at that a respawn beacon in the middle of nowhere manages to clutch out a res that's crazy and you oh could only possibly do this with a caustic too man i wonder if he's gonna be able to get much loot or is he gonna shot at the sky unfortunately all with their shots and the bloodhound is back in it man amp is feeling amped dude's night out has a different angle here and as well as rare excellence just kind of chilling and vibing let's take a look at how current esports they they they have the heart of everyone's looking at him everyone's looking current esports they do have two goals which is helpful but nonetheless they're getting shot from the right they're getting shot from the left they're getting run off right now this isn't good current esports may not be so current they might be a little bit dated now dude's night out roads up and they say you guys are expired esports last few teams they're going to feel the pressure in a moment they're going to feel the pinch they have to climb a pipe amp actually has the highest chance or probability of winning this if they can secure the high ground but only oh that's not good either and they don't have a gibby there's gonna be non-stop blowing up here at least they have the wraith or the horizon to at least pop them up a queue this isn't looking too good the zone is burning amp just trying to hold on to the high ground for dear life but unfortunately it's just not enough and dues night out has secured their night out another team has secured the height on them let's take a switch over to their pov tmp is now taking zone damage while flashpoint is in the trailer on to the left they're looking quite good they're looking quite company piece does get a knock tmp is holding on with dear life trying to syringe trying to survive may not be enough the team inside let's switch over to the pov dude's night out has height but it looks like flashpoint is now regretting their positioning i guess i mean it's not bad dude's night out is is clutching out they're making some really solid plays this is really really solid and there it is and boom dudes line out sunday night dudes night out congratulations gleaming game four enjoy the tunes of apex legends global series we now only have two more rounds under our belt two more rounds ladies and gentlemen two more rounds hope you're all having a fantastic night a fantastic evening once the scores update here on the right we'll break those down and it looks like they have let's look at the scores go to game five let's look at the scoreboard dude's night out looks like they have claimed now second place very solid play on their part chr still claiming first place rare excellence in third hrn has dropped just a little bit unfortunately with flashpoint in fifth place these are the teams that we're looking for we know shroud has dropped a little bit their placement was not ideal that last round they need they need to claim these next few rounds they need to claim the next few rounds for it to really matter otherwise it ain't looking too good any look at too good ladies and gentlemen so chr 53 points first place dudes night out 43 points rare excellence 38 points hrn 36 flash point 35 they're sitting pretty comfortably chr looking pretty good don't forget to leave a like comment and subscribe means a whole lot as you guys are supporting we're about to go into game five let me switch to that pov now there it is let's get into the lobby ladies and gentlemen let's do this hope all you guys are having a great evening thank you so much for just taking the time to spend with me seriously and for those that have been watching all day i know it's been a journey i love days like this i've watched a lot of streamers when like you have a pretty big day casting or following something's so long like this it's good it's fun a lot of fun all right going into game five in game six this is a moment for teams to really reevaluate their situation are they going to revert back to the calling of revenant and octane or are they going to stick with what works i don't quite know we're gonna have to find out here in just a moment but nonetheless don't forget to leave a like it really means a whole lot these tournaments can get pretty crazy there's quite a few guys here in the channel but if you just left one like would mean the absolute world it really would insane let's see if we can get up to 300 likes see if we can do it what do you guys think let's see if we can all right sorry just make sure to check a few things but we are looking pretty good all right next round everyone's loading in game five ladies and gentlemen game five game five game five we'll see how teams change it up flashpoint has been very consistent they are so close though to not making this and i i do have faith that they can hill's team is doing quite well as long as they have a next two consistent games all the top five teams need at this point it's just a nice consistent game just a nice consistent game just to build up the energy let's get up real quick and stretch take a moment to stretch okay i'm back i hope you guys had a good stretch i had a good stretch myself i can't believe what time it is it's been an insane day and insane evening let's get into game five in just a minute i know it's five minutes so be sure to grab yourself a drink grab yourself a coffee come right back let's chill let's vibe let's uh let's go into asmr land let's look at the scores chr 53 points dues night out 43 points rare excellence at 38 points hrn at 36 points of flash point at 35 points a lot of teams that we've seen win so far take first place are really holding their own at the top it's looking pretty good [Music] all right guys a few more people just need to join the lobby and then we're going to be good to go this is my moment to kind of breathe and relax i'm at the home stretch i can't believe we i can't believe we've done this i can't believe we streamed for 12 hours today i took a little nap for two hours in between but i still can't believe that we maintained such a long stream it's been insane it's been a whole lot of fun i appreciate all you guys for being here i can just put myself in the place of the player and just imagine especially the teams that are a little further down below they have to get top five they essentially some of these teams need to win two games in a row to make this happen but i'm not quite sure if some of the teams really have it in them at the moment because you know after five or six games it can feel pretty intense you start to feel the wear down you know you start to feel that wear and tear and as we're approaching game five usually you're pretty hot around let's say game two or three and then you start to feel the wear on game four five and six and just kind of start to top off you get sometimes your second win though second win does occur two minutes until launch then we'll get started appreciate all of you guys for being patient as we're in between rounds i definitely agree to i definitely agree after this i'm gonna go get some uh bro i woke up and daz is still casting yes sir boss guy we're still here man we're still going we've gone through aipac north europe we've we're going through all of it we're going through north america we've traveled the world traveled the world quite literally you're like the optic hex of apex legends you want to know with something crazy we both have the same first name or both their names are hector isn't that wild it's not crazy love to meet him one day he's definitely a big figurehead in the scene all right ladies and gentlemen it's nighttime here when i started the sun was coming out and now the sun is down crazy how was the shoutcasting been for you since 4am it's pretty good i get my second wind i bounce back i get pretty pumped to get hyped sometimes i have some low points i'm surprised my voice it's been holding up which is good it's been good but as long as we're keeping it together and we're doing good i'm actually glad that they've been keeping the everyone's been getting here super early in the round so we can get started it's keeping the momentum going all right we should probably have about say 30 seconds 45 seconds remaining and then we'll get started and we'll go into round five does shiv do tournaments yes unfortunately didn't qualify but he was doing uh europe if he was he would have been in my last cast if he made it everyone's ready the fact that everyone is here and already ready to go kind of highlights how serious people are taking this what a day of apex legends ladies and gentlemen it's been a very long day we've seen a lot of action we've seen some of the greatest plays from gibraltar occur at one point in impact north we had five gibraltar bubbles up at the same time all in one straight line we saw people frying with the r301 we saw versatility we've seen diversity among legends we've seen crypto pop off we've seen horizon we've seen wraith we've seen we've seen practically every legend the only ones we haven't seen is watson and rampart you've even seen octane you've even seen octane and there it goes ladies and gentlemen the first round or fifth round of the day the most important meal of the day fifth round of the day let's take a look and see if teams decided to change up their compositions if they decide to change anything and we'll kind of go from there yeah rather has definitely a lot of power we're seeing her still quite a bit i think we're seeing her more in north america than we are seeing her in europe and apac north to be quite honest we're seeing way less cryptos but we're definitely seeing quite a few horizons make a splash especially with team amped making having such a solid game there too all right what's happening here in this screen just so you're aware oh shoot looks like we had an error there let's see if we can get right back in this one hold on server looks like it was shutting down hold on one second ladies gentlemen see what's going on here i think i think everyone's about to reconnect i think uh we had a server shut down server shut down ladies and gentlemen unfortunately are they gonna do the same server they're trying to figure out what happened give us a hot second taking a look at the chat wonder what happened there all right we're hanging tight we're just waiting for the server to get brought back up we'll see what number in terms of server we're going to use if we're going to use that same server or we're going to pick up a new one just give us a hot second here while we figure out what's going on see maybe we can use the other code right after let's take a look i think they're opting to use the next code okay we're back in we just got to get everyone back into the lobby because it looks like that server crashed out which isn't good thank you so much i appreciate all of you guys sorry it looks like we had a crash there this thing's happened but at least happened at the start rather than later in the round so everyone's reconnecting we should be pretty quick on this next turnaround here i'm just curious what code we're going to use after this considering the server crashed hopefully we don't have to wait eight minutes for everything to start up but we'll try to get back in it looks like the players are all in agreement everyone wants to get right back into the fray right back into the match so pretty exciting once we get everything all situated yeah it looks like we're gonna start as soon as they're all in which is fantastic which is good hector with a k actually hector with h-e-c-t-o-r i love it we'll get started as soon as everyone's in we just need everyone in hopefully this is a quick turnaround i mean everyone's almost in so if they start as soon as everyone's ready i mean this could this could be great okay we're just missing one more person cuppsky just needs to move over all right actually we need one more and then we should be good to go ladies and gentlemen need one more person come on taylor's up sushi get your guy in here so we can get going let's get it everyone's waiting everyone's excited there we go spaghetti once he moves over we'll be good to go why did the nerf every part of gibby accept the bubble i guess because this bubble makes a massive play for her for competitive has a massive playing competitive [Music] all right honestly i think they can start here in a second we get right back into this so we're waiting for at the moment i mean once we get the go ahead it looks like we'll be ready to go [Music] the players are antsy they're ready man they are ready they're ready to start i'm ready as well all right guys [Music] oh we're waiting on one observer huh all right [Music] once the observer gets in there it is perfect and we go nice fast reset shout out to uh algs pulling together here fast reset i love it very very nice at least we get a nice reset we're right back in didn't waste a whole lot of time it's probably the fastest that i've seen around just have a quick turnaround time it's positive all right so obviously we see the comps i don't think anything's gonna change i don't think we're gonna see octane revenant i just don't foresee it happening to be honest not at this rate unless somebody's trolling at the very end you know everyone's picking their legends i'm gonna pause the music and let's get ready hope you guys are all pumped don't forget to leave a like on the stream seriously after all these hours of streaming the only thing i would like to ask of you is if you left a like just thumbs up scroll down just a little bit hit the thumbs up button it turns blue it's a nice color and then that's it all right i'm gonna be honest with you guys chat i won't lie if i tell you that i'm a little bit tired just a little bit though all right guys this is it let's follow wino's trying to see if they get contested here at the rip i don't wish it upon them just i just it just seems like they're super unlucky i don't really get why why they're getting targeted so hard it's like if it's not one team it's another and there we go there we have it game five i'm excited guys this is great here we go so in terms of where they're landing it doesn't look like they're going to get 50 50 like they normally do looks like people are playing a lot more respectfully looks like they're splitting it just as they should they do have a beacon here so they need to hit it there's the bubble they got that down pat let me tell you they have that down exactly the way they need to do it team amp looks like they're just amping up is there any 50 50s just want to make sure let's take a look at fyp let's see if any team is going to contest them i don't think the ending team is going to contest them but we shall find out now we take a look at the rest of the lobby we don't see any teams really contesting at the moment actually what just happened i believe i just crashed out i think i actually crashed out unfortunately ladies and gentlemen i don't think i'm gonna be able to reconnect i don't think i'm gonna be able to capture game five hold on ladies and gentlemen we'll hang tight i don't think i'm gonna be able to reconnect my game just hard crashed out i don't know if the server crashed or the game crash i'm not quite sure which one occurred and i do apologize guys these things do happen i'm really really sorry if that's the case we'll just have to hang tight um and wait for the round to conclude hold on let's see here that's never happened to me before i'm not really sure what happened see if we can get back and i really apologize chat unfortunately that is out of my control and they're going to play this round out what we may be able to do is spectate another stream and see how they're doing so let's take a look and let's see if we can spectate oh am i able to get back in am i gonna be able to get back in let's see here it is loading come on fingers crossed and we're back inland oh yes oh i'm so happy i am so happy you have no idea i had to fall back but i'm so happy right now oh man i don't listen oh man can we get a like in chat for that hallelujah we're back in the server i'm so excited oh man i oh man i i'm i'm i'm overjoyed right now okay okay hopefully we haven't missed too much oh man oh i was sweating i was sweating their chat i was i was okay what stream can i go and go watch what can i do but we are back in ladies and gentlemen all right let's get right back into casting let's see what is the action what is occurring here there is a fight my little phony already having a fight here with fury fury's furious with his spitfire right he's gonna run low on ammo pretty quick but he does have a gold mag on that beast so oh thank god we're able to reconnect to the server i'm excited i'm pumped nice solid damage the wraith does go down unfortunately this is going to be tough oh wow the 30 30 was enough but unfortunately now he has to cue out and reposition but is it going to be enough he's going to go for the swap is he have time to get it he does unfortunately does get knocked and phony head does go out and 19th place oh crazy let me make sure that the stream is still looking good for you guys just because it did crash it did it's going to lag for a second because i did tab out but we are all okay now don't worry we're all set everything's good ladies and gentlemen we're at the 11th hour and here we go looks like am is getting into a fight already let's try to catch their pob before it is a little bit too late unfortunately i'm a little bit disoriented about what is going on in the lobby just trying to get my bearings can i find my anarchy oh my gosh i'm just having one of those moments let's just let's just switch over to rare excellence i i don't think they're gonna we're okay we're okay i'm just trying to get my footing trying to gather my bearings once again where excellence is doing pretty hot they're being consistent let's take a look at chr let's see how they're handling their situation they are around lava fissure or lava city at the moment they're not contested they're looking pretty good they're still high up in the for the boards right now they have 53 points they're looking pretty solid all right we know where the zone is ending this is going to pull towards this choke point right here i've seen it end several times this is going to pull south it's most likely where it's going to pull silence has fallen upon the lobby we're all just kind of chilling just kind of vibing just kind of finding our footing again aturia amnes scurry and vayne have a building they're sitting quite well in this building though there's the thermite coming in on them all they got you know all the teams need to do at this point everyone's gonna play patiently nobody switched up their comps we do have two three teams that we have gas station sushi my little phony and current esports that are out and it looks like they even left the lobby for some reason looks like they're probably just trying to warm up probably just trying to warm up brandon it's good to have you here thank you guys so much really appreciate all of you guys for being a part we're we're lying we're doing well everything is on our side today everything it looks like teams are taking up uh playing patient here peace has gold armor especially encaustic big boy caustic not looking half bad i wonder if they're going to hunker down here they do know where the zone is going to end they do have a crypto but if they play patiently and age out teams edge them out it's going to help them massively we should conduct a search right here let's look it here let's go this way right now every team is playing quite passively at the moment we're not seeing a whole lot occur in terms of rotations they are pinging where teams are impulsive dream and farm boys is holding a perfect kind of choke point they kind of have their their little i guess you call it triangle of success here as you're seeing they're holding out the angles so as we're holding out teams are playing very respectfully there's really not much to add at the moment as teams are just waiting for the zone and waiting for rotations nobody wants to be the team that gets caught out at the moment as you can tell now the only team that could fight is team depression they could fight the team over on the right if they if they like it is an isolated fight but they are taking some shots and they're taking way too much zone damage so it looks like they're gonna fly up it looks like we're looking pretty good here team this is really the only team that has has a play to be honest everyone's kind of dancing so let's take a look over at uh at dome this is probably where a fight is going to break out here a lot of teams are trying to avoid the fights i i find it really strange everyone wants placement everyone wants zone nobody wants to fight anymore you would think that they would run octane revenant or teams that don't have a lot of points will want the fight but it doesn't seem like that that's the case what we're seeing here today ladies and gentlemen we're seeing just a lot of poke damage the gibraltar needs to get an angle here and if he does get a successful triple take shot that's going to be full send it let's take a look at tech's team flash point and a really rough spot the gas just is not enough and they just got pushed out hard dudes night out has been rocking it they've been doing quite well with flashpoint going out this early on and going into games this is six this is not looking good at all flashpoint is in a lot of trouble once we update the leaderboards that's something that we're gonna have to break down together afterwards to take a look at what's happening let's take a look at chr because i know dude's night out listen they're in second place let's hold on them let's just hold on them let's see if they manage to clutch this out let's watch let's watch ladies and i'm gonna see if they manage to make it or not this is getting pretty tight for them they are second place we'll take a look at chr if they manage to survive which they do and all they're going to do is rotate they got 56 seconds to rotate into zone and they have to worry about every other team in the lobby trying to push them out as they rotate late we do have a fight occurring from team depression making a breach here we have messiah ttv pushing in some solid damage with the ebay but unfortunately have lost one and now they need to go for the res and messiah is making the cover for them the wraith does take the port n and now all they're doing is they're in a holding pattern they do come right back out unfortunately messiah is getting shot in the back you can tell he's taking the port out a little bit of a panic here and to reset strictly is getting a large phoenix kit off if he can push in i know this is a cluster there's multiple teams here i think there's probably two or three one of them did get mopped up from with my understanding let's take a look inside into mst cleaning up intel tempest and there we have it you got panders and metro really holding it down there is a gibby alt to buy them a little bit of time but the team right outside i don't think they're going to push them i think they're just going to hold outside actually messiah is coming right back into the building they're rotating right back in they want some of this action they're getting some damage in from a team underneath and they're going to breach if they can and there you go tc is out and 16th place messiah taking some solid shots there's a scan if they all push this angle this may not be the smartest play unless they can get a crack even then one of them should take an off angle here in just a moment which i guarantee one of them is going to do but if they keep letting them reset and there they go there's the off angle trying to figure out what their goal is here if they spin this too long here this isn't going to is this isn't going to go well and there they go they opt for the rotation they do have a team that's right on top of them they're about to rotate they're trying to buy team let's see how team depression handles this are they going to be able to clutch out some kills i don't think they will i actually don't think but omni's team is getting hard griefed in the center by his watson which is very excellence which is what we need to see from them considering they're in third place so this isn't this is looking pretty good for rare excellence they could be going off to playoffs here they're further securing their spot overall listen let's move here just want to catch with everyone chat just want to let you guys know luckily we reconnect and we're back ladies and gentlemen it's so great to be here excited to be here everyone's just chilling everyone's just waiting for the right moment it's interesting that we went from having absolute chaos in the lobby to having teams play extremely passive because right now every team has been playing extremely passive there's there's you can feel the need to get placement points teams want kp but they also want the placement points and they want teams to rotate on top of them for the points hrn obviously we're focusing on right now because flashpoint is down if hrn manages to clutch out some points here they could definitely boost up our focus are crh dudes night out rare excellent hrn missing a lot of poke damage a lot of poke damage in the lobby everything's kind of chill this works out for me this works out for me ladies and gentlemen this helps me relax a little bit and here we go team depression might make a move let's see if they manage to get their their q out rotating and making a play of messiah gotta be careful not to get cracked before he makes the push in gets a solid swamp only positive for team depression here unfortunately messiah does overextend on that push there gets knocked now we have a 3v2 situation the bubble is there to buy them some time but unfortunately team depression looks like they're going to be going out and there they go mst metro panders and six amazing place very very nice plays on their part clush it out now taking kill later not a whole lot of teams we might see a fight actually break out with the amp on the north side here waiting a little patiently to see what occurs everyone's kind of in a holding pattern waiting to see what happens and waiting for the zone and waiting to edge out teams at various angles nice damage by ack nice solid cleanup and there you have it so sweet as we see teams what we're looking at here is teams are clearly waiting for the zone to close to capture teams out of position trying to capture who's going to get the most damage here opting for the arc star there is a spitfire frying him and he tries to take a reposition here luckily is able to get the bat off and recover we're seeing a lot of teams really get stuck unfortunately this is a really hard zone to to fight in there's the bubble to buy themselves some time but now they have to worry about the team that's just going to full center at this point there it is there this team is going out right immediately tmp nice cleanup good arc stars the bubble just wasn't put down fast enough for them to recover team p absolutely getting fried in the back by spitfire taylors is recovering and we see a dragon ball z fight happening in the mix over here dragon ball z meaning of course the horizon is fighting up in the air we're seeing them just trying to buy time this is this is just absolute chaos and definitely messy let's take a look at the pov from sync's point of view because they're definitely healthy and they're definitely doing quite well all they need to do is just all they're gonna keep doing is mopping up and pushing unfortunately they only have one kill point at the moment but they're looking for some pickup kills there's the port back and they are they may not be in here if we look at the zone there even though the wall is there technically it's not in they need to rotate on the south side of this let's switch back over to chr and see how they're handling their situation they have only one kp still but this is our still our first place team at 53 points not too bad ladies and gentlemen chr coming up right behind gonna get some solid picks here the devotion with the turbocharger is ready to fry is 240 bullets quite literally he's ready to send everything flying as they roll up this could be their moment the one of the gibby bubbles has gone down unfortunately gets fried as he goes in but nice damage going out and they need to reset as fast as humanly possible here but it was nice solid kp but they need to be careful for the third part let's take a look how the wraith is kind of handle this angle they have two turbochargers look at that and nice comps here as he drops a armor for his buddy chr has been playing really well in this tournament just want to point out we've been following them they've been consistent they've had consistent performance in this tournament thus far i think they are a newly formed team comparatively to a lot of the other rosters we're seeing so it is pretty great to see them click so well together let's take a look make sure we're not missing any of the action we do have a few teams on the outskirts of the zone here we got amp specifically if amp is able to get an angle here and take some shots which they aren't doing at the moment for gibraltar getting fried there is a bubble to buy themselves some time but the bubble's only gonna do so much because amped is actually getting in on this action there's a gerbalter going down and now we have the last remaining of the squad who's gonna get the kp and it goes over to amp this is a pretty big game for amp they knocked out your reese's team euresa's team is now out of the running with hrn not bad placement points if you look at their overall points this is gonna at least keep them running this is some consistency that they're having but we'll have to see how this changes things up so now we're looking at a top five situation amp is looking quite well as well as c-h-r if c-h-r clutches this win there's no doubt that they're obviously going to be making the playoffs at this point if they manage to clutch this win i mean even before their points are still really solid with a solo 53 we'll see just how it all decides to shake up solid damage on the opening catches a team caught out in the rotation chr has some prime positioning here you got to make sure he doesn't take too much zone damage though it only takes one tick so that's not too too bad and there he goes we only have four squads remaining looks like omnes team vane is out chr really clutching it out here and then we have another team we only have three teams running let's take a look at this pov from amp amp has been doing quite well they are the kill leaders let's let's hold here let's hold on the kill leader and see how ack is going to handle the situation he's got 5 kills 1 300 damage i know chr is obviously our first place but it's always fun to see when a team is really building momentum how they're going to maintain it love to see if ant is able to kick this up a notch and continue popping off nobody wants to engage first on this encounter or else they're going to be the third party so essentially if they manage to get a crack or get a knock that should spell death for the other team i don't think anybody's really going to move though mst unfortunately just doesn't have an angle on the right and chr doesn't have an angle on the left the only team that really has an angle here is amp they can see both teams which means that they're most likely going to get picked on from both these scenes nice damage by ack some solid comms there swapping ammo where they can and now we wait for zone zone has a minute and 40 until it closes and this is where everything gets chaotic amp needs to be very careful in this situation not to get caught out and picked on because the only team that really is getting focused right now is amped luckily the gibraltar didn't go on them out in the open and act getting some solid r31 damage but he's taking way too much zone damage he needs to recover this let's see if he can bat in time if he's able to if he's got a bat they do have a knock he's playing this patiently he may not have the resources for a bat i think i just saw his teammate drop one and now he's just gonna try to recover and refresh just get pushed in the back and sixth is there switch over back to monet and there it is ladies and gentlemen our champion i believe was chr yeah and this is clutching them pushing him more to first place first place looking pretty comfortable for them not too bad we're gonna look at the scoreboard but chr really is running around with this this is really gonna be a game especially going into game six to see where individuals are going to place let's pop in the music and let's transition and we'll be right back in it alright last game of the night last game of the night i need to figure out which code we're going to switch over to but this is looking pretty positive let me switch over to this pov so you can see the scores chr 73 points with first place dude's night out with 48 rare excellence at 45 hrn at 44 amp at 35 with flashpoint flashpoint and amp are really fighting it out here if one of those teams goes out first they're pretty much handing it to the other they really are they're pretty much handing it to the other you're gonna see a little bit of lag um on the screen give me one second here okay we have a new code okay all right get into the final game code in just a moment last game of the night ladies and gentlemen last game of the night i just want to take a moment thank you guys so much for being a part it's been a very long day casting following everything that's been going on as you can tell i'm losing a little bit of steam but i'm still ready for the last round kind of just keep it keep it calm keep it cool kind of go into the last round nice and smooth you're even awake right now didn't you start yes i did i started at four in the morning or three in the morning or two somewhere on there i don't know how i'm awake i i don't know i don't know anymore but looks like everyone's connecting and we got the last round underway beyonce is coming over i'm gonna ask her for a favor can you cook some noodles it's like have some pasta um i don't know forget no i'm kind of breaking off a little bit i'll eat a bunch of it [Music] all right last game ladies and gentlemen thank you so much sweetheart shout out to my fiance supporting me bringing me to coming over saying hi all right last game of the night round number six you already saw the scoreboard over on the right i'm gonna switch scenes in just a moment so again chr 73 points dudes and i doubt 48 rare excellence 45 hr and 44 amp 35 and flash point 35 points all right last game of the night this is it this is what we've been waiting for this is honestly still mst can make a play here there's this is panders metro and simply they can still make a comeback all they need is get a few more points and boost up right above and flash point this could be so this could be really anybody's game this still could be anybody's game depending on who clutches out the last game really good all right so i am gonna have the spaghetti tonight a little a little bit off topic oh what are you guys having for dinner what time is it for you around the world i'm actually just generally curious if you don't mind just typing in chat everybody what time is it for you around the world i know when i started this morning some people it was they were saying is around 1 pm when it was around 4 am my time but i'm generally curious what time it is for you where you're located kind of gives me a ballpark and how your evenings are going what you're up to how things are going uh the next round until that until we have the discussion is about to start here in about five minutes and yes this is doom doom 92 this is the main algs if you're just tuning in this is apex legends global series north america [Music] so if this is your first time watching a tournament especially on youtube right now what you're seeing is everyone's queuing into the lobby getting comfortable getting set up and once they do we'll hop in we'll play right now i have pinned right up above the scores so you can tally to see who's in the top five the top five teams are the ones that are going to advance i'm gonna save my voice just a little bit for the last round and then we'll get started we'll get going [Music] [Music] what rank am i i'm actually currently masters currently masters master rank [Music] done a bit of scrims tournament could definitely put a lot more time in the game sometimes the day job gets in the way which is not a bad thing my day job i actually run uh sore gaming as a general manager that's my day job and then this at the moment is uh what we call this a passion side hobby i just love creating content i love doing it [Music] last game then dad's going to sleep for two days facts facts i'm trying just to reserve just a bit more energy for the last one here because i'm i'm beat but i'm as you can tell i'm happy i hope you guys are all happy at home as well all right so this is the last round meaning that individuals may try something new i wonder if we're going to see any teams decide to kind of troll a little bit by running perhaps loba rampart revenant octane something along those lines be very much interesting to see if we had such a massive shift i don't know if we're going to see it though because i know there's a lot on the line here so i don't think anybody's gonna do it but it could prove well for some kp if they decide to two minutes until launch and then ring started this is your moment two minutes once we get started we'll look are you in the comments of course i am or sam uh again there is a five minute delay that if i if i do not have the five minute delay then obviously individuals can see the stream and not cheat but i mean i guess it is cheating would be the word so to keep competitive integrity we have a five minute delay on the stream don't normally do that for my regular live streams before commentating and shop casting we have a five minute delay who's in lead so far fantastic question team that is in the lead so far is chr and second is dude's night out rare excellence hrn and amp we have quite a few teams competing for that fifth place spot so realistically what you're going to see is individuals play perhaps a little differently see chr doesn't really have much to worry about even if deuce night out happens to get a first place win with 15 kills they're still in first place overall still first place after this we can say we did it after this we could say we officially achieved our goal of casting three different regions in one day maybe i'll have you guys commentate the last round it's three in the morning almost nine a.m wow some of you guys got up super early to watch and i appreciate that having a sound patch right now that sounds good i wouldn't mind some ice cream what day is it what is today today is the 21st look at that just ate pizza nice i know there's a five minute delay so i'm just catching up enjoying everything that you guys are talking about and doing oh we got everyone from around the world that's wild tanner that's great well it kind of shows we're all united watching one last tournament excited to see how this all plays out here we go last round no crashes no fitty fitties all right and we're underway last round of the night we'll see the scores relatively quickly because they have been updating very very quickly so we'll catch the scores we'll break them down we'll talk through it all and we'll be all set so i'm gonna pull up as we infamously do what we're going to look at is the teams now keep an eye almost like guess who in a way and see if there's any changes i don't think there's going to be any changes but might be surprised we haven't seen a watt so we haven't seen a pathfinder all right everyone is choosing the legend so obviously we're not frozen on the screen but here we are who do i mean i actually mean watson or horizon but thank you so much dante appreciate you appreciate you buddy all right so as people are picking the legends let's take a look let's refresh nobody's running octane it didn't it did not happen in north america it happened in europe and it happened at apac north but it did not happen here no team decided to opt for it i respect it i'm very happy to kind of see it octane revenant can be such a weird comp keeping an eye as we know shroud just in case they happen to get into an early fight here don't want them to get into an early fight but it's definitely a possibility you can look at zone as per usual he's going to land here and then his gibby is going to drop him a bubble there you go solid uh solid teamwork the other 5050s are taking place at the moment looks like there's going to be a thermal station let's see and busted boys have the zone have this zone also doom92 thank you so much for the 10 donation i really appreciate that man thank you so much oh looks like we already see a fight already happening current esports he gets a knock but unfortunately looks like there's our first team out in the final round current esports is done omni's team does recover from the situation and they move them out of sorting that was a fast that was a pretty fast wipe i'm not gonna lie it came over as fast as possible but that was a pretty intense and fast wipe that we saw happen from their team it looks like current esports has already left the lobby they're definitely going back to the drawing board everyone again as we're wrapping things up everyone has to remember that every player in this lobby is talented everyone knows what they're doing there's just a level of synergy that everyone has to pay attention to get comfortable with and no teams should be disappointed for making it this far they should definitely be proud of their overall performance knowing that they made it to to finals and potentially the playoffs so they should be very proud of their overall performance so my what i'm getting at as we look over at most of the teams seeing how everyone is positioning the only team that might get into a fight is absolute monarchy prep for ninja has taken the most amount of damage and now they're just trying to find an angle here so they can get a crack he used to be careful not to overextend but unfortunately does and goes down this is not looking good for absolute monarchy because unfortunately this could put him out of the tournament let's take a look at crypto as he's just trying to recover really the only thing he could do is rap but i know that for a fact they're going to push him and he's burning tries to knock as many as humanly possible does a massive amount of damage but unfortunately it's not enough and there we go going out and 19th place see a little bit of anger and toxicity happening in the lobby all right switch to different pov let's take a look how teams are rotating but it looks like nobody's gonna run into there's a potential that we know shroud might run into this other team they do get a solid crack and they do know their armor situation so two teams out already we know shroud team has already popped their alt they're pretty confident on this push or the rotation in depends on what the other team does but it looks like a man's team amp is choosing to rotate instead so we got the narrative we're following them along let's take a look at chr because that is their current top dogs in the lobby i'm less worried about them so i'm not sure unless they're absolutely destroying and melting the lobby we'll come back to them but i think they're just going to kind of vibe and just take this take this away it is let's take a look at dude's night out dude's night out is in a thermal station with a lot of teams rotating in and let's take a look at rare excellence to see how they're handling their situation in skyhook excuse me not skyhook skyhook i apologize um i stream fully on youtube so if you're tuning in i do stream every sunday on youtube if i'm not casting but recently i've been doing a lot more casting and capturing all the action that is taking place taylous is already in a gunfight at the moment let's take a look at tmp as they push they do notice there's a lot of caustic gas but they no longer fear the gas and they're going to push right in unfortunately the cost of gas seems to not be halting them but they are taking way too much damage that the team has decided to just keep rotating away amp does have a nice angle here so if they decide to come out this is a nice head glitch spot by the way solid hedge glitch spot so as teams are holding out and chilling and vibing we're seeing that there's 17 squats still in the lobby all the teams are still rotating on the north side we may see i'll hold up on amp here nice solid damage gets a crack this could be the push but unfortunately does get cracked and now they have to opt for the rotation to get out there's no way they can push this anymore after that initial crack the triple take was a solid a map a solid amount of damage there solid amount of damage it was commendable all right let's take a look at a different pov here all the teams are rotating we're trying to see and it looks like taylor's team is hard chasing they know that they're split and the reason why they split is obviously to kind of buy themselves more time and we do see as well my little phony is taking center i don't know if ackman is aware that there's two teams that he's in between right now but it definitely lowers his chances of being successful there it is let's see if he gets the amount of damage he's looking for unfortunately is not able to clutch out the damage they're looking for but they are able to potentially hard chase they are in zone they're not looking half bad let's go over to thermal station because we're seeing some shots busted boys does have height and with having height they're just waiting for the right opportunity to rotate let's see if they're gonna push this that is it looks like my little phony did manage to get the kill on akman moving their squad out and now monet is just playing patiently waiting it's really all he can do amp has done really well and this is actually working in the favor of flashpoint if amp goes out early this definitely helps secure flashpoint's positioning so if they manage to if he manages to get caught out that's only a positive for flashpoint at this point no pun intended there so let's take a different pov here as teams are fighting mostly poke damage is occurring with dues night out taking some shots as you can tell from a distance i'm not sure if they're going to be able to make a play on this unfortunately we get some solid shots to see if we can nail some of these g7 shots but they're actually in a really good positive spot here they're actually in a positive spot not much to worry about sitting pretty comfortably let's take a look at the teams i know metro's team is just trying to recover here but they are in zone i highly doubt atoria omni and scoring vanes team is going to push out into the other team that is i mean they'll push out to find some positioning but i think they're going to push out to fight the whole other team altogether nice r31 damage i got them stuck in here need to be careful we're also going to get picked on from every other team they get the mop up and there you have it nice solid kp by altoria we'll have to see if they manage to get a solid kill to boost up to first place they got four kills so far at this point what they need is more points to get up on the leaderboard seeing a lot of poke damage still occurring a lot of rotations coming in we do see my little phony they did have some solid kills earlier three kills they are rotating a little bit late but they are running up right behind farm boys let's take a look at flashpoint and see how they're doing because now that amp is a little bit more of the equation is flashpoint able to find some comfortable positioning we'll take a look at chr and dudes night out in just a hot second as well but these are the teams that we're going to keep an eye on okay looks like they're not going to be making any headway here let's take a look at chr and see how they're rotating and how they're finding their way through so chr is having the hard rotation on the back end not much action going to be taking place here so let's switch over to monet just want to see where he's decided to rat so he's got the low ground here he might actually lift through quite a bit so the most action that we're going to see is going to be on the north side of the map with yubi as well as gas station sushi rotating right behind them so it looks like they found them out they do have gold armor they have a spitfire and eva and this could be pretty positive for them if they manage to get some cracks not cracks in themselves because unfortunately they are taking quite a bit of damage let's take a look at their pov how they're doing so they are resetting but it looks like because of their confidence and the amount of damage that they've been laying down it looks like they're going to make a play off of this there's some of the scans out all they gotta wait it's patiently for the scan just to dissipate so they can make a play nice solid damage there's a knock and they're gonna full send this let's see if there's any teams that have the potential third party this is an isolated fight they have to be they have to be nervous knowing that this is an isolated fight the enemy team that is knowing that this could be free kp which is why they've abandoned their third and let's see if fyp decides to chase and it looks like they're not going to they're not going to chase it makes sense don't want to get too greedy and it looks like rare excellence has a nice position in the choke here while most of the teams have to hard rotate on to them so we do see a potential fight happening with chr as well as the farm boys we'll see how this plays out if they're gonna just opt to rotate in or if they're gonna hard contest them here and chr is not looking too hot now they need to get out i don't know if he's going to be able to res him in time he decides to rotate out instead of going towards the portal right away he has he throws the gasp the gas right on top of his head quite literally right in top of his head at least they're able to recover the banner potentially here in a moment but they are taking a ton of zone damage the thing is chr does not have to worry too much here because they have achieved a lot of points they have 73 they're in first place even if dude's night out gets 30 points they're still well in the lead and there's not much to worry about but doesn't mean that they should play poorly of course they're playing it as if everything was still in the line which is good on them to play farm boys is waiting for them to rotate into zone trying to see if they get some solid damage here with the charge rifle and how that's going to play out a lot of teams are playing quite respectfully chr is just going to try to hold into zone as much as possible their resources are a bit low but i think chr could rotate in and create some more med kits because he does have 45 points but the longer they wait obviously the harder this is gonna be rare excellence is holding the choke still and there's two individual teams still in the building we got flash point let's see is which team am are we looking for to see if they're still in let's go this way let's take a look at amp give me one second here let's take a look at amp amp is still in their sweet spot but they could go out here whenever they do this could be handling it handing it over to flashpoint fyp looking for the angle trying to see if they're going to rotate over to the choke on the left or to the right stomps does get a solid knock let's take a look back at chr and see how they're about to rotating because they're literally about to run into a team here quite literally about to run into a team the other teams don't need to worry about too much they did manage to get the res and recoup their buddy let's see if it's enough to really keep it together though oh it's gonna get that kid off he does just in time luckily gets the med kit off and now he can rotate in there's the queue to buy themselves some hp and some time we see the farm boys stomps popping off with a charge rifle they do need to wash their backs i don't think they're aware of the team that's right behind them they could come in and sneak attack this terry it's good to have you here by the way if you're just tuning in this is apex legends global series north america and we are color commentating the tournament that's happening right before the playoffs the top five teams get to move on to the playoffs so chr is taking their time making sure they're topping off and rotating together level three they have a hard rotation in this it's going to be rough let's take a look at the team fight that's occurring farm boys happens to have the bottom part and it looks like right up above is a whole different team farm boys is now trapped inside this building but i wouldn't know if we call it trapped they're throwing an arc start back it's a massive amount of damage stops has been popping off he's going to be stacking his damage getting well above 1k here in just a moment there's the port back up and there's the cleanup all they got to do is recover they're safe up there they have gold back hopefully it doesn't get shot in the back oh is it gonna be enough is it gonna be enough unfortunately does get knocked he might have needed to stick that rez when he hesitated he could have had his buddy up but unfortunately now i mean i mean look at fyp they're looking pretty comfortable they got a lot of loot up there let's take a look at chr as they rotated in they took the low ground while the other teams were pushing into the main building themselves chr is just playing patient going for their placement points which is respectable let's take a look at flash points pov flashpoint is still within their building let's also take a look at dude's night out dude's night out is also playing patiently within the building it's aids it's deciding to rotate back they were on the south side of this map it looks like they're getting a lot of picks over here with the gibby holt nice amount of damage with the gibby ultimate solid shots with the g7 this could call for a potential potential kp but at the same time they don't want to overextend this because if they do it's going to spell disastrous because they're going to be giving up their their main turf which is what they don't want to do switch over to hrn's pov hrn has been doing quite well still they don't have they only have one true kp but nonetheless they are in center zone for the most part they just have to worry about the teams that are right behind them so switch over to the donut the donut is an absolute master my little phony coming in switch over to phony head is able to clutch this out unfortunately it's not he hits the damage on the shield which is not enough fyp is managing to get some massive kills so far in the final match of the day hrn sitting pretty comfortable let's take a look if we're missing any of the action here and yeah we're looking for every everything's looking pretty good we've got nine teams left dude's night out chr i don't know it's rare excellent still back in the rare excellent still in and i need to double check if amp is still in i don't think if they are they still only have one rat let's take a look hold on no it looks like amp is out which leads the door open for a flash point to make fifth place take look how flash points handling the rotation they have a hard rotation in they only have a little bit of time 32 seconds the zone is closing kopsky managed to find an opening here for his teammates they're gonna have to push this they don't really have much of a choice but a slow amount of damage and they get a knock tech gets a nice crypto bomb and they're gonna clean this up and they'll find some space to breathe no pun intended with the caustic of course because i mean you got to breathe it in right let's take a look how deep team depression is handling this just trying to swap armors for days let's see if he can manage to get his res off and there it is unfortunately rare excellence does come in mops them up and that's the end of that flash point is down at the moment but they are not out sixth place this is looking pretty good we look at the updated stats this is going to be really close on the leaderboards to see overall who wins so i'm going to do i'm going to switch back over again to rare excellence i'm curious if they see them they have to see them here in a moment if they were to look just further south they should see them right there it's going to be really close to see which five teams are going to advance ladies and gentlemen we know that chr at this point has solidified their spot dude's night out has definitely solidified their spot considering they're still in the top five here it's really going to come down to hrn and flashpoint depending when they get knocked out they need to hold their own here we're excellence finding the high ground this is really good for them this is going to secure their spot in the tournament let's switch over to flashpoint and see how they're managing to clutch this out i don't know why he hasn't rested him yet maybe he's afraid that he's going to get pushed he's waiting for the right moment he should probably opt for the res here in about 10 seconds if not the zone's gonna get them once again all right looks like they get a nice recovery flashpoint is now back in it let's take a look at chr how they're doing it looks like they're having a massive fight in the building here caustic battle looks like chr is about to rotate right into zone you see the teams that are trying to hide underneath the building get some solid r 99 damage all you need to do is wait patiently before pushing in and hug the zone if they hold the left i mean they're sitting pretty good and that could be a kidnap in the hat and the waking right here they move in they rotate and they have their nice little angle here and it looks like chr is about to go out he's going to take a little bit of zone damage let's see if he dies from it he's about to die and luckily takes his own right back and gets a swap and then goes right back but this extra ticket damage may be too much and actually put him out and he does die hrn is now in the top three let's look at the remaining squads that are in we got is excellent we have rare excellence hrn and deuce night out with that this is going to be interesting how far amp got up and the leaderboards to see which five are advancing we know hchr deuce night out rare excellence and hrn are moving up the question is how many points does flashpoint have and if they're going to make it overall to finals has the best positioning in the building here let's take a look on the outside rare excellence probably has maybe some of the harder positioning because they have oh no actually they have good positioning looking at the zone it's going to pull right in front of them let's keep an eye on rare excellence and see how they manage to clutch this out if they can hold the high ground against the other teams so just so you know where they're at they're in the buildings right down below as long as they play patiently they could definitely clutch us out let's go this way now of course the reason why you're hearing the silence is we're waiting for the zone to close and once it closes this is where the pressure begins might be something good this way here comes the closing got a minute 35. where accident needs to be very careful about taking any excessive damage if they do if they get cracked it's going to waste seconds trying to get a bat off to recover they have a nasty head glitch both teams do it's just a matter of who manages to land their headshots more there's a couple to bounce them off the building this is a positive for a rare excellence but also it could be a negative as a team in the back is now no longer pushing pressure on the team down below there they go they're gonna take right underneath the stairs good decision there's a next gibby bubble that or gibby ultimate that's coming out and they have to move there's the bubble to buy themselves a little bit of time rare excellence is actually playing this very well and very patiently and there's a number another gibby old and this time they're gonna have to utilize the horizon q just to buy themselves a little bit of time getting some solid cracks used to hang tight and just wait and here we go this is this is where we separate the men from the boys popping his cue trying to reset got a dragon ball z fight right in the air manages to get his battery off that's insane we see a huge number of bodies flying up in the air and wow hrn comes out on top what an insane ending it was so there's so many bodies there at the end it was pretty crazy all right once the score is updated here in a moment we'll talk about the teams that have made it in the top five all right ladies and gentlemen that is going to conclude today's broadcast i want to take a moment and thank all of you guys i know a little bit towards the end i definitely feel myself losing a bit of steam that i've been going since like four or three

interesting audio files the first one being titled phase runner amb ext snow grass this audio features some rain blowing wind sounds clouds and thundering sounds somewhat similar to the world's edge audio however could this mean that a storm is heading towards olympus olympus being a city in the sky we wouldn't say it's completely not possible with us only very recently getting olympus and the

click it no did i hit 102 wait what they lied to us that's actually going to be so good for ranked or for even a lgs yeah watson's going to be meta g'day guys the biggest apex update possibly ever has just dropped with the most balanced changes we've ever seen and the corsic town takeover the bangalore heirloom there's something you know watson got buffs or shield regens mastiff apparently got nerfed so you can't to tap people anymore was what everybody was saying except after watching this video you're gonna find out that was all a lie we explore the new area and work out how to unlock the gold guns as well this video's got a lot i hope you guys enjoy there will be a double upload today because there's so much to go through in this update hey james let me read this my patreon ring flares spawn one by a bloody one throughout each round they remain the duration of the current round then piss off at the start of the next one oh we could go no phil oh we totally should have done it jack hey we could have done no phil i wasn't paying attention oh look we didn't even need to know phil apex just blessed us first time trying no fill empty yeah come on bro we got a new area on the map what's going on oh wait are we doing oh yeah how could i not see that pile of stink from a mile away i just kissed the messy jenks and i liked it i didn't say we go to the edges somewhere james i'm going right here oh you can't land there james you cannot land here alone something new and now i probably die what's their situation jax i got punched to death and now i'm getting spam finished i just got blue armor in front of me nerfed massive by the way domestic by the way jenks i was still cracking this guy at medium range for like a fair bit as well oh i just got that off in time wait what they lied to us i'm only getting big numbers there's only 32 people in this lobby what is going on uh yeah there is there's supposed to be a max of six people who could know phil 25 teams should be 50 people though you know oh my god i got a wing man bro oh i'm jealous i got a triple take there's a guy in front of me i'm gonna murk him with it no i got a repeater it's not a triple take i doubled the other guy double the other guy nice [Music] okay i need a real gun he didn't have one i'm going out back wait found me i've got double sniper you're by yourself i hit it for 90. i'm a speedy octane guy oh purple up here there's a speedy octane guy running away from me right now he ran i'm gonna let him run i got zero bullets in a vault you have any energy am i come up here this is all unloaded man we can do some exploring i'm done i'm dropping this ball for a nine oh purple ball there's a volt here with ammo and more ammo up here oh do you want to keep it yeah i'm gonna do that i got a wingman as well okay so in the trailer the gas was like flowing it was like moving up there's gotta be a way to like turn those on or something it's kind of already flowing though no bro come here come here come here come look come look okay i'm getting ziplined on give me a second i'm just gonna prime oh nice job okay there's a thing here we can drain the toxin wait what all right why is this ring have to start coming in towards us this thing right here this command oh yeah you can click it oh oh i tried all the things are these trained as well oh these aren't oh a gold 30 30. wait it's got the 2-4 on it oh wait wait they didn't oh i'd open this one a mozambique i gotta try this dude i got a gold 30 30 with no sight on it oh my gold spitfire with an interchangeable sight oh that's sick dude i just took this i just took this gold mozambique took the digi off it oh no oh oh that's cool though all right i'm going to get the gold mozambique bro yes that's so sick you put it on your other gun i put it on my wingman yeah i wonder if they pick it up with the digi like if someone wants to die if you do you want to drop your side and me to pick it up and see if it like resets it actually that wouldn't make sense because then we could just spawn digits they wouldn't it wouldn't be like that otherwise we could literally spawn digi threads for all of us okay do you ever see right now i have to use a man uh kid i mean you can make it i don't ever carry syringes when i'm locked in look at how many rings are down do you reckon people are putting these down or like they just randomly spawn no they just randomly spawn how do we how do we use the equipment this one started it oh oh hold left on your d-pad yeah yeah that's what i was doing to put him down first guys oh i can't i can't wingman inspect anymore i can't do like jump pad wingman inspects bro i think they would have changed button right i heard shooting like north east actually no north directly north near i like how she's our new like talker in this mode gear packaging coming i'm disappointed i'm going to throw this down here so it like follows us actually no it doesn't expand that far though does it it only expands like a certain amount like on our mini map can you destroy them no you can't it'd be like good you're getting chased oh right in front of me just went in here no it's not like a gift bubble it only protects you from storm i think i got one nice grab he got two he dropped down on you that's the guy that was shooting over yeah i got you oh you're fine i got him nailed him should we collect heat shields oh cannot equip what i think if you would just have one you can't oh you need a lab two you're allowed to earn your laptop did i hear a team you heard something dude there's a team right there oh my god he's right up top on me jump down jump down i got him oh nice little stream of my guy what was that noise though was that a grapple i don't know what that was it sounded like a zombie right so you or am i tripping it was a weird sound yeah i heard it too it's a weird one that's why i was kind of like confused i'm like is it was that a guy is there a guy here it changed path on his grapple sound oh he added that good stuff okay why do i have a slot missing in my backpack that i can't pull is that a glitch okay let's fix itself dude you can pick it back up wait really oh no you can't no you can't no you can't no you can't seventy percent how's that so it doesn't hurt you no it just blocks the storm look it's like raining it's like it's right oh that's right i thought it was the storm over here someone just put that down or is that you oh oh i'm in the storm i'm stupid wait what that's a heat ring yeah oh man this is this whole heat ring thing yeah so that's it oh i get it now i was thinking you were putting the heat rings down but you're just putting the dome of protection yeah all right i'm stupid i also have zero health meds so i need to change that what just happened i why did it oh that's gotta be that's gotta be a bug what happened i just tried to pick up uh a heat shield thing and they said i had no room and i had to swap it out with oh my god i just got pre-fired bro you're gonna have to shoot for me for a second i'm going inside and i'm phoenixing hold the high ground they were waiting for us it was i'm so confused they're not even walking out be careful with her she might be sucks but then again she probably just heard me coming i was not prepared for her she's just like she's not there i'm gonna check around i'm lagging i'm like skipping yeah i'm gonna try 200 p i think they're just waiting for us around the corner it's a ramp up so she might be set up let's investigate if she pretty much my ring man has nine bullets by the way bro my wingman has nine what's that right side right side here it's like you're standing still and prefers me the devo a ring player just came in a marker by the way honestly think they ran around i might cut back through market and there's fighting that way all right let's go there dude these eggs these heat ring things are gonna be so sweet i'm gonna go around just because that heat ring is expanding and cutting off most of the market dude you could sit and storm for a like a long time yeah you could i wonder if many games are gonna be like that like think about it you could have three three teammates all of you have two heat rings each that's six heat rings and you just you just alternate them oh we might run into that right in front of me i'm gonna throw an aid and then i'm gonna shoot pretty much crack the one i think somewhat low on you cracked on you there's another team coming up behind it though 100 on the guy behind him 180 on this guy all right yep you're good i just got my kill stolen it's a heat ring battle i don't think so rising like look at this they had to drop heat like that heat shields just stay out there that's so cool it's just so sick i love how the spitfire's got the 2x now as well what was it before the one to two i don't even need to swap it out i could take it off if i wanted to but i ain't gonna okay where do we oh behind it's probably the ryzen's teammate okay they're both theirs too oh you are insane bro it's the other guy's crack just send this oh you're already in that i respect it yeah god i'm like send it see you halfway there just flying at him his name is you're a ding-dong shield cell thank you dude that octane card exploded yeah and that first guy you must have exploded i just shot at him and he fell over oh they're fighting there's a team high ground team left up should i like not even carry cells now that my character just heals its shield now you probably should still carry cells i want to see how long it takes to charge full red armor i'm going to let him break my armor janks just for science yeah this guy really needs to learn recoil control he didn't even heal i'm kind of confused all right you let that thing heal up it should take a long time though because it's old octane yeah oh it's the original octane that's why it's extra slow i want to see you with the gen as well is it like does it stop that's pretty good it definitely stacks it definitely stops we can just sit here and i can do this all day long that's actually going to be so good for ranked or for even algs yeah watson's going to be meta it's kind of ridiculous deals are so important in that mode this guy stopped being weird and just like intestines or die i'm going to kill him yeah get him out of here janks i was getting ready to be even bro dude i wanted to wingman inspect so bad i'm like i just can't you can't do the wingman inspect anymore rust and pepperoni yes this is fun though wait wait wasn't that like a half player lobby too yeah there was only 30 people or something 32 i think in that lobby we just played it anyways wait this is interesting kills assists knocks kills assists we're so even you guys listen to this watch this mighty zeus god of thunder from down i under have a lozenge that really i might be bleeding in the throat right now", "FveTyaELwvs": "hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some ranked with janks and lulu i've never played lulu before but we had a great time in ranked the games of crazy i was playing corsic the entire time which was uh necessary because the octane rev pushes were plentiful it's also worth noting that these games were recorded pre-updates all the recent changes hadn't happened yet you can find draxies and lulu's channels in the description thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm so scared all the time i can't hit you get it together they're losing the package i'll show you like the one signs from here you need is the one times two look i got it the embassies do the work from this far away yeah it is not i can't see anything they are like little ants do you plan tonight you pay though uh-huh honestly states tonight oh my god that's what i get that's what i get come on come on come on i was like i was literally like just standing still trying to inch closer to my screen i need to recharge myself that was actually so funny round one if the craig wrote at one times i'd use it little red dot they said you could take your you could take sights off all of the gold guns and heirloom guns apart from the crib they specifically at the end said not the crater like they even had to the graveyard oh bloodhound this way are they out there are they on my forehead as well oh you can open the door yeah yeah uh rev one bullet i'm bankrupt okay second squad second squad hi oh my god leave us alone [Music] another replay i'll send one back here comes another emp stay psyched situation looking like here i have one second back up one thing back into the forest paper team is here uh bloodhound is really hurt on blood needy cracks uh outside that close door home a hundred on the clown nope really i have 19 bullets left i've got light you go here you go okay i'll team one two cell slabs another another third party what's going on i have no heels no shield deals here i dropped them if they're full my farm is rich this is ridiculous this is getting out of hand oh do you crave something already [Music] they're good 44 but he's running back i have one shotgun shell oh hold that crater my baby oh my god i'm gonna stay right now that was ridiculous how are we alive we have no business we should not be alive right now no business being alive right now i think they saw this gold extended energy through the window and everyone wants it that's what it was yeah yeah someone pinged the backside through the window i can't craft a bag this feels so wrong but it feels so right it doesn't it's twice but it does it feels so wrong but it feels so right we're not very close that's a bag isn't it i can't craft a bag and a battery so i'm just not going to 45 seconds oh gonna have to bat level one armor uh just east in the next building they're on top of this i think yep purple i'm holding the bond i can't climb the stairs middle floor [Music] oh look at all the heels and everything no cells though oh there's some yeah goddamn controller loot and i couldn't get them what do you need i have no zelle zero zero zero zero i have four i'll give you two i'll keep them might be something good this way oh lulu do you know your music by the way yeah yeah i'm definitely talking to myself i thought when i saw the pink with nothing no cons next to me [Music] it was the thing like that those teams that were fighting at cage here might like just rotate in and use that cut yeah i was definitely just like explaining it to myself i always just assume that you you're muted talking to chat and you're pinging what's up right behind us yeah 20 damage could be a rat man that's [Music] i do have a chargey boy so sprinting straight in just here this guy's throwing that first guy's nearly cracked 14 running away there careful there are four teams here cracked one did you say uh including us yeah nice job i'm back there's a team there's a full team with these stairs just be careful okay i'm gonna throw a long uh i mean if there's that many teams here we kind of want to force them to fight like we want to we want to deal damage there were three others but one of them run off you got his own get in there all three they must have finished one of the teams the wraith team that was looking beginning i don't know they were on the ropes at the start they just ran off oh this team was running you said there was a lot of sniper in here right yeah yeah yeah i need to grab some delivery replicator got a replicator everybody found oh my god you were right there's tons there's like three different sniper spawns on there oh my gosh is that crater that's mine he's got white armor and a crabber yeah he's on data center all right i got the red i hear my creeper pure vanity that's first mode i had to give with a craver bro i'm stuck oh my god somebody's scared for me yes i'm in for 34 flesh what's he doing we've got 30 seconds i'm so tempted i'm not gonna lie i'm i'm so incredibly tempted have you ever done this have you ever patted across this no no you're making it sound very high i don't think this is doable it's a rope if we get most of the way and just use the rope actually yeah you know you could cracks up top 64 i'm down it's got white armor stuff you need the crater okay oh my god i'm dead i died i died no you've never been healthier they spotted me you are solo lulu i'm coming right now i hate uh i'm altering the roof i'm altering the road no no no no i'm falling closet there's a rev on my head i'm vain octane's climbing the roof he's cracked i got him i'll turn on the roof i got a bat i'm one shot off six cracks up top i can't get down there this is crave a guy crave a guy just there oh he's on the real volcano [Music] now i keep switching to this level one armor all right i've won that after this oh we're in a really good spot sniper ammo here we really are like i have extra shields three cells yeah i have one back twelve cells i'm one in four uh one bat eight cells you drop more they're in here actually awesome accelerant engaging you can body shots the octane's body could be really close i'm i mean i got a bat in seven cells now so i'm all right okay over there they're gonna excite that dude they're uh they're all in that oh they're back good we're inside that's 42 recharging there's six squads left maybe someone like hiding beyond dead do we think there's anybody in this building right below us i have no clue [Music] i'm gonna stay up here until i use my favorite shots okay look at bunker front door bunker front door lulu with the crater blue bin someone else is over there i see i can get an angle his teammates are underneath his teammates are here i think unless i got a cell phrase underneath this house yeah you should get some gas in this building right i have uh traps down low i'll put some up top on this um drop down okay hold on do we want to try it i don't know if we should contest it i'm just gonna i'm gonna hold an angle i'm just gonna hold an angle on them up here here with that was my fault i played that so bad i've got to go back soon [Music] like i don't know if we can hold the top on the roof oh there's three spots left yeah looks like they're shooting each other he's one in that corner lifeline on this door right here climb back up top near the side there up right on climb they're back made up for my mistake in that building bro they were both tucked in that

different legends have however apex legends data miner bias 12 seems to have found some ground emotes that may be coming to the game pretty soon in some of these files we can see different animations titled as per legend for example bangalore with ground emotes such as push-ups or rifle drill some for gibraltar are titled bring it and kick flip lifeline seems to have board and wave and some for loba go from golf to rare torn and even tree monkey we're not entirely sure what these will look like just yet but if they're in the game files you can assume they'll be coming pretty soon and we can only imagine downing an enemy just to pull a cheeky emo in front of them alongside these there are some more for revenant and watson and if you'd like to check them out visit bias 12 on twitter we will leave a link in the description below also these are only just a few emotes what emotes would you like to see and for which legends let us know in the comments section down below countdown let's

description for more info dude should we do some solo no fill i'm a little bit scared i'm a little bit scared because i want to try a rampart the new rampart new and improved rampart barrier shields they don't get nuked by grenades anymore funny story about that too is i i actually had a i actually had a i have a clip where like i just grenade a cluster of ramparts shields and it was just like so much so many damage numbers just showed up on the screen i'm glad they changed it i'm glad they changed it but that also makes me a little nervous doing solos in rampart doing solos in general is gonna be hard doing solo rampart i don't know i i don't know if if that buff is enough i'll have to find the patch notes but basically the grenades don't one shot her deployables anymore so the shield will actually protect you believe it or not all right i don't know how to what's the best course of action i think so i think playing a character with an escape is super important too the only way that i think i can take these fights because if i land hot i start third partying all these guys healing [Music] give me good enough for me i'm out of here so before the grenade would have just one shot the barricade actually blocked it i'm actually kind of happy i got like one kill for that oh dude this guy's just chasing giving my shields a recharge toss in the frag i gotta get out of here that's not a squad see ya get out the loot it's all yours babe i don't want it anyways oh they're fighting this is tough i'm out of loot because i can't i can't stay around to loot very long all right you know what i'll go volt volt uh i'll go vault 301 so that way i'm not using this one nano type that i'm actually kind of a little bit low on stuff hold on i actually get one there you go here we go that's how you play solos guys that's how you play solos oh my god this is crazy stressful sorry it's more it's a shame because i can't tell if it's one or a full squad i'm assuming it's gonna be one full squad so i'm gonna bounce now it sucks because i don't have any be nice if i was playing a recon character because then i can tell but i had to leave those bodies which i guess distracted that team long enough to be like oh yeah who's loot is that chasing me what i really need are bats bats are gonna make the the spitty the problem with the spitty is like this is something people only talk about but the aim down sights movement speed is very slow on lmg like this so i'll lose i'll lose a lot of fights if i tried eight yeah 1v1 well in this case it'd be 1v three people right so i kind of need the mobility which is why i'm keeping the vault the 301 has a little bit better movement speed and i have the anvil so i can kind of poke if i need to that's why i'm picking the 301 over this pity for now the other thing too is um i don't know how well i can use sheila here considering oh they just finished that all right i'm just gonna yellow it i'm a third party [Music] [Music] like i heard someone falling down on me deploying the kids come to me i'm dropping back a little bit yeah i think rampart i'm just gonna shut up talking here hold up yeah someone's here backing up bouncing springfield so giving my shoes giving my shoes i should just bounced i shouldn't i should have tried fighting them i should have just bounced are you choosing rambo because he thinks he's a good legend for 3v1 no by no means well about that i don't know i feel like an evasive character is better like a horizon pathfinder uh octane somebody can use to like escape really fast rampart you kind of have to commit when you're playing rampart you kind of have to commit and that's really tough to do in a 1v3 situation solos you know it all depends it honestly all depends on how good the other team is if they're cracked you just you need an escape character like no amount of amp damage and amount of cover and amount of shields is going to protect you from a good three good players escaping is a bit more guaranteed right it's you can it's more so more in your hands if you have an escape ability [Applause] wish me luck let's go boys this is why i land hot the third party there you go i think that's the strategy though it's land hot when you're solo and just try a third party because if you don't land hot you're kind of like out in the middle of nowhere and it's hard to get loot and it's easy to get picked off that's that's my that's my hypothesis that's that's my guess the trick the soloing i don't know maybe i'm just talking about so there should not i repeat there should not be anyone else on this area account of two teams where are these teams coming from i don't know do you guys see anyone i don't do they think i don't think anyone's here i feel like i feel like a scared fish that's well beyond the barrier reef actually right now i am in the reef but once i leave this collection of buildings we're going to open waters or sharks are [Music] abound giving my shields a recharge cover dipped okay i thought they were good i thought the other team was gonna fight them they're probably gonna be this uh this thing little canyon one minute of the ring's close right sometimes things just work out getting shot at tossing arcstar another couple squad wipes a couple of kills maybe we'll see you got ring flares opening near me i love the tension puncture hornet's nest invasive maneuvers someone come finish him at least it's close someone's here assassin max assassin build right now [Music] should i go back for the body or leave it inside and go back for it i'm so nervous to use my sheila because i think that's going to draw more attention to myself unwanted attention and i'm afraid to put down barriers too because that'll also give me a way this is tough because i want to use like i don't know like the ideal situation would be like the last two teams are fighting out in the open and i can get a shield on all of them right well the chances of that actually happening oh my god they're right there i don't know if you guys saw that here look right there right someone else is up here too bush i'm a bush i am a bush we are plant rings nearby and i got 30 seconds on the clock easy can i even go around i think i should be able to rings closed i'm good not what's healing here [Music] giving my shields a recharge i love the tension that's a whole squad down ring's pretty close got 45 so i'm not tripping just yet maybe up here cover i cannot believe that word of course i am i cannot believe that worked i cannot believe that word oh my god oh oh my god dude i actually won a soul game with rampart and i pulled off the sheila why did that bloodhound just stand there let me do it oh my lord ggs oh my god my heart is that is what this is

damage like that all right well they're probably healed from my gas but they probably don't expect no where are they but they were pushing oh there it goes bam and the dirt is gone oh can you actually get up from there oh come on why is my guess hurting another guy how oh nice job oh god i just want mobility you can get me up there what they're activating this gas no that means if they're gonna

get over it five damage a tick you guys know what that means you can out heal gas with a syringe which means caustic is a tickler i'm gonna have to play as a clown caustic from now on just tickles

peacekeeper oh my you ran through the gas you actually ran through the gas you fooled hey see i told you that confident never trust apex players oh you're getting hit by my other cast you guys didn't see that one chucked in a little corner like that time to do the mozambique to finish so caustic can still be useful like as we see right there if they push us and they push into the gas it may not hurt them as much anymore but they won't see anything anything oh and they'll be slowed the slope is the best thing it's so predictable to shoot a slowed guy i love those tight corners this cause stick oh boy and i am yet champion let's go gamers i just love being champion this time maybe i should throw it away in the hull again it's too far away time for jump pad huh did i just get punched mid-air by a horizon no less gas gotta horizons punched mid-air i'm sorry it takes me a while to get over some goddamn weird things where is he there he is no that's the bangalore at the buildings my favorite location hopefully they're quite low on hp seems like you are no don't close the door on me don't you dare you need gas boy you need god oh god no there have some more gas oh 12 damage in the

match huh well guys if you enjoyed that video i want to send your support to caustic remember to hit that notification bell and azil brad will see you guys laters", "4mHvpuYmaV4": "thank you to ea for sponsoring today's video hey what's up guys it's welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and i wanted to talk to you guys about the chaos theory update that happened yesterday because the update is huge and it's brought a lot to the game now first of all the new area caustic treatment this place is amazing it replaces water treatment on the south side of king's canyon and brings a breath of fresh air to this side of the map the fights in here are brutal largely because of the walkways with the toxin underneath and you can actually drain these toxins to reveal the legendary loot there so if you're brave enough to land here you could be walking away with all four pieces of legendary loot setting you up for the rest of the game only if you survive though next up we have bangalore's heirloom which i did a video on last night it is clean it is sleek the animations are amazing there is something about running around with an heirloom that makes you feel more powerful more in control and i'm not sure what it is i love that when you are crouched bangalore crosses our arms just looks so menacing the games change a lot now too because of the new ring fury escalation takeover which periodically brings isolated parts of the ring to what would usually be the safe zone cutting off escape routes forcing enemies into tight corridors you have to adapt on the fly to survive and that is where this new item comes in as well now you'll see in the game that i have for you today we have to use plenty of the new heat shield items to survive a late game of gunfight now you heal and revive faster in the heat shields but only if it's protecting you from the ring so you can't throw this down in a safe zone and benefit from a sub three second battery for example along with all these changes comes so many updates to the legends and weapons on apex legends and the one that we are focusing on today is pathfinder my old main my favorite legend he's been updated to take reduced damage thanks to the removal of his low-profile debuff he is back to his former glory and he is so fun to play once more now there are plenty of other changes to legends and weapons so make sure you're still to the channel to watch my videos on those coming soon i hope you enjoyed today's video showcasing the new item takeover and also the return of my old mate pathfinder thank you once more to ea for sponsoring today's video and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends landing right here oh good yes at you taken down my god someone else took me that's not good no it's not i'm gonna close you at least here is that okay i'm gonna help you clear this team inside is showing that might be them i don't know we'll see i need to decipher my g7 desperately oh there's a purple mag in that box and there's a two timer oh thank you oh mag but that was a heavy one give me a second recharging shield that's what you meant wait what did i say he said there's a purple mag there was a purple yeah it was a heavy one is that what you meant yeah oh okay yeah yeah well what's happening what's that because i said i had a g7 so i thought you oh you know sorry that was poor timing okay hey yay that's my favorite thing to do no oh no starting again i don't know ah that's pretty bad i can't lie that's pretty awful i think once one person does it they're like i'm doing it that's nice it's like you know it's like when somebody honks their horn everybody just starts talking it's like oh yeah you want to be annoyed this way let's go this way i'm so sorry i missed three massive shots octane's really weak though i i saw panicked it's fine said i was with you i wasn't really with you oh my god there's somebody in here ladies [Music] i don't know i think that pathfinder thought that it was a gimme bubble oh and he wasn't firing or something right he was just like adsing and just staring at me and he wasn't shooting i think he thought it was a gimme ball it does look like one it does 100 percent i turned and i was like wait this pathfinder is not shooting me when you live what a great guy oh he's very honorable you have to be looking at him doesn't shoot anyone in the map this guy that's a very very honorable man going from a no mag to a gold mag is one of life's greatest pleasures oh that's the dream oh you're dead okay do you want to hear some crap the race is like really weak i'll tell you after that no no the race is really weak behind that box it might just be that one she are facebook i don't see a teammate i mean she's not healing she's just zooming sorry to ask you for syringes again but you have this one uh yeah i do wait she's right here hold up uh yeah three so my controller keeps darting to the left a little bit like it's broken mm-hmm and i'm like i ads to her and she went behind the beam went to the left and it darted to the left and it like basically locked onto it look honestly yeah you're making excuses okay for when you post this video in the future and when people accuse you yeah yeah packing just preemptively making the excuses ah you'll see just jump to the left it's weird idiots like whoa my gun just annihilated this guy it wasn't me i swear to god where's my recoil it's like i forgot to cody for me that's funny i know that bomb is just pretending that i didn't know gotta hide the wall hacks

confusing uh well they're alone oh manly oh my god oh my god absolutely with the astronaut boxing gloves these games oh my god this glare is killing me this is awful it's terrible why yeah well that's what happens when you thirst every single kill every single kill even the ones that aren't yours that's what happens rich and you use a g7 man i can't say anything you should i don't even know if i want to post that the octane me using the massive against him was so embarrassing i can't", "Ad3aHyiKPN8": "there's a rat here we go it's kicking off now we are we're arm switches so [Applause] if you need to wait there's no way he just pushed that right i got you brother he did what a god better player yo guys welcome back to the channel today we are continuing our rank grind and i'm actually able to confirm some massive changes that they made to rank it took me a little bit because we didn't play ranked at the beginning of the split but now that we're playing ranked i'm actually able to confirm these changes so if you don't know how the matchmaker worked beforehand if you were playing ranked and you hit diamond four the lobbies never really change now of course sometimes the matchmaker would just make a mix match lobby and you would have some preds in your games but it wasn't actually like a true pred lobby the second day you hit diamond three there was a wall it was a huge huge skill gap when you hit diamond three because that's when you're actually put in pride lobbies so diamond four and diamond three it was either you were playing with the platinums in diamond four or you were playing with the preds and diamond three there was no real diamond lobby well what they did is they said they wanted to create a healthier top end in diamond and they wanted to improve the quality for ranked matches by filling your lobbies of players of that skill level now if this change went through that would basically mean that there is a separate lobby for diamond players which would be amazing and i haven't actually been able to confirm it until now today we are playing with item once again the two of us were doing some ranked and uh he is diamond three and we never saw a difference in our lobbies it was basically the same diamond lobbies that we were playing in which is fantastic for those of you out there that hit a wallet diamond for diamond three and you wanted to keep going to masters but you just felt like you couldn't because you were you were going up against three stack of pro teams give it another shot give it another shot i am 100 certain that you can do it i believe in you and i know that the matchmaker is one it's different it's different i know for a fact that it's different i can feel it in our games so if you haven't played ranked because you felt like you were you were stuck give it another shot and i believe that you can get to masters yourself i know you can do it so uh yeah we're playing some rank today the last couple uh videos were full games today's actually going to be highlights of platinum one so we're doing the entirety of platinum one in one video we're getting a diamond today i hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching and i'll see you tomorrow for the next video there's no way he doesn't have a pad soon him jumped on me oh you crawled around somewhere mate this is what we need a replay mode right you could do this nice job [Music] oh my god bro sorry man i'm a corsic i see a room i want to get in there i am i should have waited till you guys finish your back man that just kicks the door wide another here we go everyone's just getting rest today no idea what that would be it's got to be in the buildings dude this way really cracked close guy horizon here for 45 flush he's on her right [Music] [Music] attention well we're gonna have to fight him yep do you see an extra armor let me know um i got a charge rifle if you find a big scope here look at the map the next ring is far i'm gonna hand shield here taking fire what is uh really hurt give us white too throw an ark star don't want me in the back come back and come back the only the other two are up front for the rest again okay i'm pretty sure there's a solo caustic in the building and then both teams are in that corner anyways so this is a free this is a free win for us the ring's close 45 seconds the pressure is exhilarating triple t guys fried charging up my shields it's lifeline 47 thinking across the way maybe these guys are vulnerable over there i'm gonna keep holding this angle i'm not gonna stop at this shot at angle enemies are shooting at me hey that got 47 down the hill this guy here okay i'm just going to keep pressure on this other team we want to make those two teams fight each other that's all we want to do yeah yeah yeah shields this guy would be behind us though do the squads they're fighting each other it's only a solo it's a solo classic they killed in that building there's one one full team in the building and one full team to the right i like pushing limits to the next guy why do we push we just played right below us in the hill let's go over here no no no teammate no teammate no teammate no teammate oh my god i spotted it i'm falling we just want to stay down here because they're going to force each other to fight if we stay down here like 547. one's down walking up nice yeah [Music] let's see sometimes wait i was scared for our teammate dude he went to the building what that guy's a psychopath all right i'm gonna go take a little gander oh might be able to do uh might be able to do a nice little third here oh we gotta get you boys some cyber bullets i've got sniper ammo here i could use that to three distracted begrudgingly i'll be honest with you i'm not playing too aggressive here the sniper ramble on this balcony let's go over here very well i'm just gonna try to get an angle and see if i can third but i'm not pushing too hard here i got close right right building right building i'm in about mate yeah yeah close i pride the horizon i fried the horizon and i hit the lobo for a bit love is crack there everyone's out i'm pushing her no she's so awake now like eight times okay the guy in the window too look at the window close the window [Music] this is a nice little electron yeah you guys are doing god's work with your charge i don't have too many shots left they're sliding down the hill in the water look at the water look at the water okay is that them almost like near the guys i saw one i think it's that team yeah right here flush flush reloading nice no they're getting dirted let's go this way come to this building it did have chapstick before i took one eighth nice we can pack to the rock from here okay i'm getting an angle on this team did that not go down there no i don't know i just reminded myself yeah this is oh man what a third that was i love being caustic just walking through all the gas no problem we're so clean we're so clear we can't let that guy get too over over aggressive on that kill up there we're safe here wait we need to we need to just we need to hold this yes they're all going to converge on this front side we don't want to be there exactly oh don't die i'm going to leave a trap up here we can't take damage either like we have to be the team that that that thirds can you come with me can you come with me and clear this we have to clear our back real quick real quick no no i'm almost 100 sure i know what the teams are okay yeah we're good recharging over there there's a team on top of market there's a team on top of those rocks there's a team at that one salvage building yeah they have to move good in calms this is perfect one of them is only a duo at the most one of them to duo because he might knock one and it got thirsted i don't think it was that team yeah recharging my shields is that literally being a rock climber that's not in there they're this team is so dead on the right when they rotate in i'm scanned it's an octave team they compete they could pad in we just need to make we need to force those two teams to fight each other yeah so we can't play we need to be in the cave we can't be brushable if we play exactly if we play too far forward they're going to push us like teammates we can't just ignore it we can't help them we need them to fight each other let's hide the gas nice for we got this easy peasy bro it's more realistic for these two teams to fight each other i almost one clip the horizon 184 nice on the left or on the left no matter what even if you get the ace playing aggressive see this is what people don't understand you get flirted if you play aggressive the other team yeah the other team is full you need to keep making them fight even if we like you win that team trap we got this brother you have your all yeah yeah yeah and i have that back deployed knock on the right down on the right okay they're not getting are hurt i don't even want to reload my arthritis it's about him nice play that perfectly well played man well played good job inside a bit of patience you know well that's the thing if we committed to one fight on the left or the right it didn't matter then just the opposite team third party is the winner of that fight that's it yeah you are the apex champions good job dude well played say mate there we go y'all we're frying with those charge rifles huh bullies", "GuL90gKlkJI": "you're gonna win this you're gonna end this for 30 seconds okay you need to open the door um are you are you are you ready yeah i'm ready yeah

update on march 9th was pretty big but i just want to highlight two things bangalore finally got an heirloom check out these awesome in-game animations just in case you aren't a bangalore maine another huge change is water treatment the whole poi has been changed to a caustic town takeover sporting a really cool lab to fight in and even an opportunity to get 4 random gold items [Music] i don't see anybody scanning i got two [Music] i got them where [Music] [Applause] oh um oh my gosh wait whoa all right [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] hey yes shields recharging pick me up that heat

not available i am giving my shields one moment at least i don't have to wait for anyone [Music] is you", "f6mwJtUWXkM": "it has been three seasons since i've done an apex weapons tier list and a lot has changed for starters the prowler's in the care package now the devotion is now floor loot we got two weapons the volt and now the repeater and there were a bunch of weapon buffs and nerfs so because we hit our sub goal again on twitch here is another apex legends weapons tier list and of course i'm not including any of the care package weapons because you can consider them all s tier except maybe the prowler like i don't know why the prowler is in the care package [Music] and as usual these are my opinions these are not facts so if you disagree go ahead and write a comment but don't be mean about it so let's move on to d tier d tier is reserved for guns that are just not good and if you see them on drop you probably don't want to pick them up at all and we're starting dtir with the longbow snipers in general don't have the best time in apex and the longbow is by far the worst sniper it doesn't do anything the best at all ranges especially up close and being the worst ammo type in the game isn't helping while skull piercer is a strong hop up it's not enough to make this gun good simply put there are better snipers and way better ranged weaponry in order for it to be better i think that first of all sniper mo needs to be removed since it's an ammo type that is not very popular and its attachments aren't picked up by many people making the late game loot pool for snipers not great if it was a heavy gun again it would have a lot more ammo to work with and the chance of finding high tier heavy ammo attachments and ammo in the late game would be significantly higher but that goes for all snipers all snipers would be buffed if sniper ammo just disappeared and the last weapon in deets here is the mozambique while mozambique here is a funny phrase i won't be saying deebs anytime soon this gun is still one of the worst guns without hammer points it's god awful and a gun nobody wants to run with it it's slightly better but it's just completely outclassed by other shotguns i genuinely think that increasing its mag size to five or even six shots will change it for the better because even though they did increase it to four it still wasn't enough okay guys that's how i feel about mozambique someone get ready to clip this uh worst gun in the game right guys where's the longboard when you need it so we can throw that off too and that's it for deeds here you will find that most weapons from here on out are decent to very good apex legends has done a great job at balancing most of these weapons throughout the seasons seeds here is reserved for weapons that are okay but you're going to want to drop them for better guns immediately first up we have the l-star the l-star got some buffs making it a lot better than it used to be but it's just outclassed by every energy weapon by a long shot it's just so inaccurate and blocks so much of your vision with its big flares it's just not worth using if you find another energy weapon this gun could really use a barrel stabilizer like i've mentioned in the last tier list this would help both of its main issues until then it will stay at the bottom of c tier next we have the auto pistol the re45 wow a new hop up and nobody even cared the re-45 is just a placeholder gun until you find a better light gun if it packed more of a punch or its hop-up actually did something it could have a chance but i doubt it perhaps if they increased its magazine size or damage or both it could actually be a decent gun until then you're going to want to swap it as soon as you can next up is the charge rifle this gun while hitscan is just not the best sniper it has barely any ammo the longest reload time of any gun in the game and it doesn't even benefit from the new golden sniper magazine it's an incredible sniper from really far away but it lacks versatility in every other area while they could buff its ammo size or its damage it's probably fine how it is because we don't want this gun of all guns to be broken it's not useless it's just an okay gun up next we have the 30 30 repeater 30 30 repeater 30 30 repeat 30 30 repeat which i know is going to get a lot of hate since it's the new kid in town and while i might have said that it's busted in the last video i made when it first came out i now see the light it's all right it's just outclassed by every other assault rifle which does its job better especially since they brought back anvil receiver it's not great in close range and its reload time is bad one way they could buff it is to increase its fire rate slightly but then it might be a bit too good if that happened and at the top of seats here we have the p2020 the p2020 is similar to the mozambique in that without a hammer point hop up it's not great but with it it's incredible it's one of the best guns with it in the right hands it shreds through teams with ease what would make it even better is if it maybe had a little bit more shots in its magazine but i think it's in a great spot as is next up we have beats here beats here is full of weapons that are all good but they're just not great these weapons could be your favorite guns and guns you bring to the end but just know that there are other guns that just outclass these guns slightly first up we have the alternator the all-standard received a small but significant buff this season with an additional one damage per shot this makes it a beast that is decently accurate it's just slightly outclassed by its light gun older brothers but it's so close to being a top tier gun again you guys remember season two when it had disrupter yeah that's when it was top tier before oh it's so close i can taste it maybe one more damage next up we have the sentinel this sniper only requires two cells to charge now and it's so worth it it's one of the best snipers and almost feels like a baby crater but its weak fire rate and the fact that disrupters go away for some reason is what holds it back it would be aids here if it shot slightly faster and disrupters stay until you use all the ammo and not over time next up we have the biggest winner this season and it's the spitfire once considered one of the worst weapons it got two big buffs in its damage and the introduction of gold magazines this gun is so forgiving it really does feel unfair at times but it's slow fire rate is still holding it back from the top a slight fire rate buff could help but it might make it a bit too much but right now it's in a good spot and if you're gonna kill me with a spitfire you suck i'm just kidding spitfire fans you know i love you up next we have the best sniper in the sniper class and that's the triple take since precision choke is completely gone the triple take naturally is amazing on drop it is the only sniper that is both good in close and long range it honestly feels like a shotgun sometimes i genuinely believe that the only thing holding triple take from being a top tier weapon is the fact that it uses sniper ammo if it was an energy gun again you could definitely see this gun being a top tier weapon since it could carry a lot more ammo but until they do something about sniper ammo overall it's gonna stay in the middle of b tier next up we have the eva shotgun the eva is a fair shotgun it has a great fire rate and a high magazine it's just a great gun overall it's outclassed by one shotgun which we'll talk about later and it also got nerfed slightly because double tap is gone but a purple bolt does the job anyway i believe it's completely fine where it is next up we have the havok the havok has its turbocharger back but they did nerf it a couple times to make it a little bit inaccurate with the turbocharger it's amazing without it it's good the other downside is that it's not very accurate in long range battles so you're not going to be using it as a sniper anytime soon which is good it would be broken if you could but in close to mid range especially with the turbocharger this thing melts don't sleep on the havoc still great and at the top of beats here we have the hemlock last season before it's nerfed it was s tier i'm not even kidding a lot of pros hated the hemlock now it's still great don't get me wrong but it's just slightly outclassed by other assault rifles and i think it's in a better place like the eva shotgun i don't believe it really needs any more buffs or it might just be too much again but like i said it's in a good place now we have aids here all of these guns are great they're just not the best guns starting with the flat line i got two words for you anvil receiver with this hop up it has so much versatility it has great hip fire accuracy decent damage and a solid close to mid range game it's what the 30 30 repeater wishes it could be now i'm just imagining like the chad flat line versus the virgin 30 30 repeater if you haven't been using the flat line this season you got to give it a shot it's nuts next up we have the devotion the devotion in my opinion does not belong on the floor look i get it without a turbocharger it's okay it has a really long wind up and it's not the most accurate weapon they definitely nerfed it a couple times but my god with the turbocharger it's just unfair it just shouldn't be a weapon why is this allowed i really do hope that the developers understand that the devotion should just be a care package weapon and they could probably bring back the prowler as a regular weapon and just nerf the prowler if it's that good seriously nobody likes getting shredded by a devotion nobody next up we have the best sniper in this game and it's not even a sniper the g7 scout this is essentially the better 33 repeater it has better fire rate reload speed and it's even decent in close range the g7 remains on top as the best long range weapon double tap may be gone but most people never need it in the first place it's just that good there is however one gun that i think is just more versatile in every range and just does the g7 scout's job slightly better and that's the r301 the r301 is the epitome of a perfect weapon it's not broken but in the right hands it is incredible it has great damage insane accuracy in close range mid range and long range it has great hip fire accuracy the r31 is great in the hands of a noob and it's great in the hands of a pro this is the gun that every gun should strive to be like the r301 is just a gun that is phenomenal and it even gets better because they added anvil receiver to it making it even better in long range and now we're on s tier these are the best weapons and if you are great with these weapons you're kind of unstoppable in this game the first gun we have is the wingman the wingman is still an s tier weapon in the hands of an aim god it's insane every time you land a couple wingman shots it's gonna destroy shields in close mid or long range the wingman will always be on top it requires no ammo has one of the best hop ups the skull piercer and with the inclusion of gold magazines it just gets even better up next in s tier we have of course the r99 the r99 has not changed much since my last tier list and it still remains as one of the best guns it is still insanely accurate and in close to mid range it's a shredding machine and with a lot of the top tier guns being light ammo guns you'll always have enough ammo in the mid to late game the only reason it's not at the top is because it's slightly outclassed by the newest smg in this game the volt smg the vault came out recently and even got nerfed but even then it is still phenomenal it's an smg that is good in both close mid and long range it's not gonna snipe people from across the map but majority of fights happen in close to mid range anyway it does great damage and it's an energy weapon that doesn't require a turbocharger to be great this gun is the reason why the r99 is not on top anymore because why run the r99 when you can run the volt and last but not least we have the mastiff you may have heard me on stream called the game mastiff legends before because the mastiff has literally become a must pick gun i don't know exactly why the meta has shifted this way maybe it's because caustic is so good but a lot of games end up being very important close range encounters and there's one gun that is above all others in the close range and that's the mastiff the mastiff in my opinion isn't a broken weapon by any means but it is the only shotgun that fulfills the role you need in close range i do believe that if they had to nerf this weapon at all it would be by decreasing its ammo size by one or two because right now and maybe it's just my perspective but it feels like if i don't have a mastiff i'm gonna lose to an enemy with the mastiff it's just that good and that's it that's my tier list do you agree with me do you disagree with me let me know in the comments down below and if you want make your own tier list i am not a pro player and i'm not pretending to be one so if you are in masters rank or above and you genuinely disagree with me i would love to hear your input in the comments below thank you so much for watching and i'll catch you later", "ZOT1FA1f788": "hey everybody what's going on and welcome back to the channel today's video is sponsored by ea thank you to the team over there for supporting the channel um but we're about halfway through season eight now and things are getting interesting when i took the time to sit down and think of what apex was like back in season zero and one it was drastically different and season eight to mid season eight wraith is looking pretty different from the rest of the sea like even season seven she's just so much worse now it's kind of unbelievable i feel like she needs a little bit of buff work now a lot of people say she's a bullet magnet she's just not good anymore and so with all the negative things being said i figured we'd try to run her in some matches today now after the matches um you know i do got to say that i don't think she's the best at all but i don't think she's the worst but something triggered my inner tv and when people see a crazy moving wraith in front of him i feel like it as an intimidation factor so we absolutely pop off today we have some pretty insane games pretty insane kills and i think you guys are really gonna enjoy the video now last thing before we get started today i just want to thank you all so much for the support on the staycation shorts youtube channel it's my second channel that i've created if you guys want to subscribe to see

trash little luke but hey oh bangalore skin if you want to see more guys hit that notification now somebody will see you guys", "0RmuEhRQ-1s": "hey everyone i hope you're well we are going to delve into all of the legends in this video and critics talking about who i rank the highest in terms of the overall engagement rates this is kind of talking a little bit about ranked but mostly it's talking about unranked their engagement potential their overall skills their movement their hitbox their abilities we're going to start from the very bottom from c and work our way up to s now this video is sponsored by myself i've got some merch you might want to check it out there's a link in the description all right let's get into it i'm going to be pretty light with the editing here and just kind of have a bit of a conversational approach so we'll start with c we have rampart first now last time i put rampart in d-class and i think that she got a pretty good buff this season now the main buff is the fact that you can literally just put your walls down pretty much anywhere any angle you can jump up and wash the mid-air place your walls this is a really good buff and it's really just a bug fix it was broken in season seven and it was a big problem it's fixed now her balls also have 45 health but it doesn't really feel like that much honestly i think they could buff it more her turret now has more range on it in terms of how much you can rotate it a nice change and i am seeing myself doing pretty well of the turret especially late game driver farm damage to get my evo shield up or when the ring's coming in and we're playing ranked it's worked off worked out pretty well for me i would say that she still needs a lot of buffs the thing is is that most of her kit really relies around her tactical her ultimate is very situational there are many games where there's just no point me putting it down because it's just more effective for me to just shoot people and move and stay on the move than to put down my turret get on the turret aim down sights all of the animations involved just take too long she has a very situational alt a very situational passive although with the spitfire buff that's kind of nice you know that's pretty nice this season but still pretty situational so she's a very situational character and i do mean her myself but she definitely needs a lot of love still and i think that pretty much every other legend in the game is better than her next we have revenant now revenant is an interesting legend and he can be really good if you time your ultimate right and you're well coordinated with your team but besides that he's just really situational as well he has that one alt push which can be really really really good it really can revlite could with enough buffs be s tale without a doubt and he could dominate the meta and and maybe like season five i think he almost did dominate the meta for a bit but was kind of just shunned away to the side we don't really see him competitive that much anymore but um the main thing is his his own solo capabilities aren't that great i mean his tactical is okay you can silence people pretty useful not gonna lie but to me the passive is pretty useless he's very big he deserves fortified in my opinion and overall i just feel like his kit fails to provide enough utility to him and also enough utility to his team when you're not coordinating with your team like if you're in a free stack you're coordinating you're in discord or whatever then it's easier to do that with revenant but you know even then you need good timing and coordination with your actual squad mates um so revenant's really good if you have the coordination to do it so i think you need some more love on a personal level to be pushed up now next we have mirage and i would say the mirage footstep buff where his decoys here uh make footstep noises was actually a huge huge improvement it's actually really easy to get bamboozled now and i think that he is actually a pretty decent legend and if you made mirage you could do really really well with him not only does he go invisible when you heal or revive your teammates or respawn them but he also can use uses all completely few four people the footsteps on the decoys can completely fool people a good mirage player is scary and i do think that you could play mariah's solo him get really good with him and be a very difficult player to play against but he just lacks that utility in fights a lot of the time i mean he can throw his ultimate cause chaos which is you know it's okay but it doesn't really provide much utility in the fight it doesn't have any engagement abilities to engage with the team he's good at cleaning up after the fight right the invisibility thing's pretty good but um yeah i just it doesn't quite hit the ceiling in terms of or break through the ceiling in terms of him being a competitive legend it's a lot of fun you can create some great moments but he's still seated personally for me so that's it that's c-class all out of the way next we have b-class up first we have bangalore b for bangalore right i would rank bengal higher um i think that she is a really really good solid legend she's actually really great i think her ultimate has really great positioning power if you stun someone with her ultimate rockets they slow people for a long time their vision is blurred the smokes are really useful as well her passive is incredible in close range engagements or just disengaging too she's a really good kit and i think that's why she hasn't been buffed for such a long time because well she just has a well-rounded kit that's really good so why have i put her in b class well the thing is while she does have a really good kit pretty much every legend in a and s tier are just that much better in terms of either what they provide to themselves as like a selfish ability or what they provide to the team or in most cases what they do for both themselves and their team bangalore is really great honestly but she doesn't quite compete with other legends like horizon wraith gibraltar caustic lifeline for their overall team player utility and the way their abilities kind of really pivot a fight so that's why bangalore is b that's kind of the same reason why loba is b loba can have a really good power spike at the early game because you can put down your alt get the gear you need and you're good to go straight into battle and this alt will constantly provide you with ammo and items all through the game which is really really great um it's actually a really helpful ability but actually in fights and engagements lobo does nothing a tactical is completely broken you try and throw it around sometimes you don't even teleport as really unreliable as an ability i think that they need to really think about changing that in some way because it's buggy it's really really buggy her passive is pretty good as well so yeah she's great she's a crutch to lean on when you struggle to get loot but that's it she isn't anything else what does she provide to the team in a fight not really anything so that's kind of where it counts the most right and that's why she's not any higher now the final legend in b is fuse now i'm going to put a fuse in b class because i'm a little bit reserved to put him any higher at this point i've seen a lot of crazy things happen with views especially when paired with say a horizon or a caustic out or just throwing a bunch of grenades in buildings it can be pretty dangerous they're not gonna lie but the fact that this nadespan was happening like it could still happen you could still have nadespam happening he just does it a little bit more effectively for sure he can carry more grenades so it happens more often but i i just i don't know he's got this explosive kit that can do a lot of damage but sometimes it just falls short the ultimate's a little strange there seems to be a delay when you throw it down on the ground people can walk through the fire for the first couple seconds and only take five damage so once it does stun them it kind of like defeats the point of using it sometimes especially because when you throw it down you can hardly see through the flames um i think that fuse should have an ability where he can see enemies outlines through the flames because you throw it on the end circle for example and players who may have digi frets on the other side are going to win the fight because you can't see anything they can see you through the flames but you can't see them and it's a big big problem frieza's passive is a lot of fun his tactical is pretty good at times it does do a massive amount of damage but for a tactical it's pretty decent i'd say it's just it's too early to say it's really early i could potentially see if he's being a tier he's definitely not c tier but for now we're going to put him beats here because i'm pretty reserved i don't see him being more effective as a legend than bangalore see this is kind of the competition we're going up against the legend mata is pretty good right now so we're seeing a lot of well-balanced legends and powerful legends um all across the board so next we have eightier we're gonna start at the bottom of eightier and that is watson now watson's a strange one watson's pretty boring to play but you can't deny that she does wonders for the team with her abilities like game if you want to commit to that play style you have to commit to the playstyle of being ready to camp somewhere or set up somewhere and be ready um so it's pretty interesting you can kind of use her ultimate reactively as well in a lot of situations to stop nade spams which is obviously gonna kind of help deal with the huge amount of fused players at the moment for sure overall she's just a really good legend that's going to help you secure wins really effectively without a doubt her solo kit is also really good as well you can quickly reactively place down fences fences stop people pushing you it's really really powerful in my opinion and she has a really good animation set and a small hitbox is really hard to hit she has she's in the top five for 1v1 engagements right amongst wraith octane horizon uh i think the other legend is lifeline five of these legends all have movement-based abilities or small hitboxes watson doesn't have any movement-based abilities so she can you can tell that she does well in these 1v1 engagements because of her hitbox and animations and that is why to me she's a dark horse for perhaps one of the best movement legends in the game she has no movement based abilities but her overall animation set if you're good at strafing and and crouch strafing and just abusing the movement in this game watson is up there i would say watson is alongside both raven lifeline maybe higher a little bit i don't know that's why she's eightier to me she's a really strong legend she's just boring to play that kind of brings me to crypto as well because crypto has some good animations too his strafing animations are actually really good so if you master movement again the bass movement mechanics you'll do really well with crypto without even touching your abilities and that's the thing you may not really touch your abilities if you're playing pubs and unranked that often um because you kind of have to get into your drone and be active in accessing the drone which you know you give up your own control of your player i'd always love to see a buff for crypto where he can actually have his drone auto scan the area or something but crypto's ability kit itself is actually really strong the drone allows you to quickly see who's in the area you can scan the beacon from afar very easy you can respawn people really effectively from afar the emp is a great engagement tool i would actually say crypto is closer to watch a plus actually it's just once again kind of like revenant you need to be coordinated with your team to pull off a good oh because it does stun your teammates and it has a certain range to it so you can be really good with crypto but he has quite a high skill ceiling i think it takes a lot to be a good crypto player and a lot of good teamwork to pull it off in a team so that's why he's a and not any higher he's a very good legend very very good oh yeah he's not s t here yet next we have pathfinder and 80. ultimately pathfinder's mobility is still really good yes we have horizon now yes we have the octane jump pad now and that's why both of those legends in my opinion are act higher than pathfinder but pathfinder's grapple still allows you to get away very fast a lot of distance if you're good with a grapple personally i think it's just a really good ability and i think it's always going to be that way because of the freedom of movement that it offers the zipline can be good for disengaging and engaging at times as well and his passive is kind of a shame but the recompressive is also really good overall a really good legend hopefully low profile will be gone from him soon which is really really needed he always has the potential to be s t here honestly it's just hitbox problems mixed with the fact that other legends are kind of taking his sort of play style his his identity with the recon legends taking his passive is kind of a big problem he needs a rework for sure but still really good all around next we have bloodhound now bloodhound is a really powerful legend for providing utility to your team i'd say if you're playing ranked and you want to provide benefit to your team but you're not very good at communicating or you're worried that you're going to come across people who don't have mics or don't communicate or speak a different language bloodhound is the legend for you because bloodhound provides information to the team very visually constantly through their scans and their passive ability it's such a powerful ability all the way from the beginning to the end stages of the game bloodhound's ultimate is incredible for constant stat scans and pressuring the enemies it's a really powerful ability thanks to the movement you can quickly see enemies thanks to the outline of players as well it's a really strong ability i would say if i were to do a ranked tier list i'd put i'll put bloodhound in s i'd definitely put bloodhound in s bloodhound is really good without a doubt next we have a plus first up caustic caustic is just really annoying to fight against and if he's really annoying to fight against that means he's good the fact that players can move in corsic's gas now without any problems is a huge problem for when you're fighting against the corsic team that know how to play around the gas it's still annoying to be in the gas as a corset teammate so there's a bit of a problem but if you know how to play around it and you work together as a squad you are just gonna be so annoying caustic wins the majority of late games as well so he's always gonna do well if you can get to that point out in the open he's kind of caught out a bit but you know with some good core movement mechanics and good positioning it's not such a problem of course it's ultimate it's so frustrating to play against his gas traps have been nerfed a little bit so you can shoot them whilst they're deploying but overall he's still really strong in my opinion he's still such a bully when you just constantly put pressure on people with the gas i think he's a plus tier there are some areas where he kind of falls flat because he is big and he doesn't have mobility but i think the power that his abilities have are so strong that it it really does make him a plus and if it was just damage stealing right his abilities were only damage dealing or even only damage stealing and stuns slows then it wouldn't be so bad but the fact that it basically blinds you it's damage dealing and it slows you and ticks damage over time it's just too much it makes him really really strong in my opinion and next we have lifeline now lifeline's kit's a bit strange her ultimate isn't really that great her passive is incredible though her passive is incredible and everything relies around her passive you can literally win fights with her passive constantly you're going to be able to constantly get your team up play around the shield get your team up in situations that you should never be allowed to do and it's going to win your team fights it's going to win your team games it's going to keep you alive especially in rank this is more important but overall if you have a bad teammate you literally can use that to your advantage by just constantly tapping the shield and playing around it like you're playing around a gibby dome it's incredibly strong and i think that they're gonna shift some of that power away from her passive and put it into her other abilities in the future we may see a significant drop in her rating in my opinion so for now she's really strong because he's just annoying to play against you know you know how it is when you shoot down a team and then the lifeline just raises them all and you're like well there's my rp gone there's my there's my kills gone i'm not gonna get them anymore and that team's gonna be up and in my face any second so really really strong legend now eight plus is octane octane jumped from cta to a plus now how does he jump up so high well with his boosted jump pad of course the distance that you can get and the speed you can get when you slide over the jump pad is incredible now it's a really powerful disengage tool repositioning tool the octane needed from the beginning he was also always such a solo focused legend players would play aggressive with him but now you can use it to reposition very effectively very freely get out of situations and that's what he needed from the beginning the increased height on it when you just walk over it's really great as well pair that with the tactical which also starts to get your health healed faster now thanks to the improved passive back in like season six i think octane's a really good legend he's a really good repositioning legend without a doubt and i think that we're gonna see a lot more octanes in high level play i really do now we have estear first up is gibraltar well firstly he's a tank he's just a tank he's a massive tank and it's so hard to fight against him when you 1v1 him his 1v1s are going to be so great because well he has more health if you're a good gibby you are going to dominate people he's big but you have to use that cover around you to really put him to his full potential i've also noticed that there's a bit more long-range fighting going on and once again gibby basically gets free peaks because of his gun shield long range so really goes in his favor you can also reposition very well out in the open you throw your dome between where you are and the position you want to go you have free cover really really powerful kit it's kind of a free revive at times as well long range it is um it's not as good as lifeline 35 but still really good overall gibby just has too much to offer i haven't even talked about his ultimate yet gibraltar's ultimate is also really powerful especially late game the amount of pressure it provides which allows you to reposition or push up on a squad or just deal damage on players who are trying to heal or escape is really amazing just everything about gibraltar is really great he is big but you can learn to play around that of course you have the gun shield to kind of negate that a little bit now next we have wraith wraith is still s tier now she had a big nerf with her hitbox and it's definitely made a big impact but ultimately her abilities are still really great she has a free repositioning tool where she's invincible and you can move really fast whilst using it her ultimate is also a free invincible repositioning tool for your whole team yes it has reduced distance now much more reduced distance than in the past but the fact that you can move somewhere without being shot is incredible it's it's always going to be the way where we're going to see race on high level teams because it's her kit it's not just the fact that she's really small and can win 1v1 so well because she's so small of course that matters but it's her kit so now she's a still relatively small legend with an amazing set of abilities so it's no surprise finally we have horizon now horizon got another nerf but she still has really great movement-based abilities she can still abuse her graph lift like crazy whether she's strafing on the top or using it to drop on people's heads she can throw her out and completely just destroy a squad if you throw a good out and it's not hard to do that with horizon like it is hard to do it for caustic oh you're just gonna destroy squads you're gonna completely stop them from getting away and just turn a squad within seconds and with the third parties going on in king's canyon right now you need to be in and out as quick as possible and horizon zell offers that quick burst to just throw all your abilities in one spot as enemies are pulled into it really really strong legend so that's it that's my tip list for the season i may do another ranked tier list of course we have the weapons to let's do a bunch of other stuff so i hope you enjoyed this video let me know what you think and i see you all

legends everyone and i have discovered well it's a bit late and i've realized why everyone has gone bloodhound and ranked it's because every time you scan the assist of that scan counts as a kill and

came up the name in the middle of the game so what is it uh we ran a wingman p2020 two pistols and two weapons that don't really go very well with each other now uh individually they're both really good obviously the wingman is one of my favorite weapons to use and the p2020 with hammers again a really good weapon but together it makes uh you know it's really hard to use you definitely want to spray a weapon of some sort but uh anyways those are the two guns that i used and i absolutely popped off with item one of the craziest games i've played this season so far so uh yeah it was awesome i do hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching and i'll see you tomorrow for the next one [Music] i think that was a little guy that tried to punch me at the beginning feedback him die let

yo come to me if you come to me we can pad we can pad this way and kill this oh that's a team yeah no no no hold up hold that thought there's a there's another team on the far left there's a wraith a solo race over here and then there's a pathfinder team underneath us and then a team on our left right yeah 100 gold on one i can broke this on top of that yeah do that do that do that yeah this one come back easily [Music] she's really hurt you got a bad up no bueno noise there's another team here though i don't know where but nice job phoenix if you need it uh this guy had one thank you this guy had one phoenix kid ah these take forever there should be there was a gold armor guy somewhere he didn't die oh they're in the water oh i shouldn't have two subs i should have picked up that g7 oh good i'm grappling over okay bro this is a wild game this has been a lot of fun the john wick challenge that's what i'm calling this i'm running wingman at a p2020. uh in the left side of the water uh 75 crypto on gold [Music] here by the red weekend okay oh you rest we can push that right i don't know my ultimate just yet i'm on 83 was that here yeah yeah he res right on right here he shot at me too a little vault guy time reloading the chance one he's the one that got respawned that's nearly cracked this is like i don't know this game is so fun this is really fun i'm gonna slow heal real quick okay i'm gonna use my cell so i can save my bats and i'm gonna crack me uh i'm gonna cut the skull here sir while i'm here do it oh perfect energy this is the guy that's had it it's entire time um yeah i have two bats and i've got gold so i might drop you mod uh i have a couple bats i'm good okay charging up my shoes yeah i got two bats tremendous tremendous actually i might as well just keep that let's craft a hater all good one is enough one crafting plenty myself a rope you can use six crafts at the same time right back imagine the efficiency wait i heard a fly's gone crazy going to be the team with the cold armor that's the team with the gold armor 100 i can rope us from here maybe i don't think it will guess all the way over there no horizon horizon octane dog team might be by himself in that building we could push him oh i'd say yeah let's go i'll go to the right door okay he's got time one more minute oh he's on the left door cracked my lifeline [Music] charge i cracked the horizon i probably should yeah i should let me see if this is the one had many bats did uh did the lifeline have gold armor uh no i think he must bring this button that we killed earlier they had like the gold person because they're gold 10 seconds oh you know what it probably was then i never shot that bloodhound this whole time i've been looking for this gold armored guy the gold armored ninja where'd he go the gold armor bandit what's your name some of you eggs are looking like you need it i wonder if that if they just shot us like at a weird time for it to say another squad or if there was actually a squad yeah quite possibly i think he was just that team must the more needs the better absolutely oh there's only one team left oh okay it all comes down to this what's the best spot this mountain let's explore smg's i'm actually deeming this i'm calling this right now the john wick challenge wingman p2020 i mean yeah two of the smallest guns it's the john this is john

i might i'll just no skip them oh my i'm stuck behind the wall yeah oh where'd he go oh oh oh he's here no my kill mix he dodged me how did he do that look the scans are helping us so much thank god for bloodhound thank god bloodhound to hear that you've got to do scans over this way thank god we got a bloodhound we're going to win because we have a bloodhound like if we didn't have him i would i know what i would do i think he'd just give up like i'd collapse quit your job screw your resume oh yeah directly there oh thanks no you took the shot again oh god no oh jesus did you throw it all down too i did i'm hitting them heel boy heel i'm hitting the wall once i was excited why would you push that horizon no max good shot though stole the kill no you didn't max you saved us you deserve all the kills i'm coming in whoa eleven damage now that's a steal kill oh well done is there killing injuries three teams here three teams one two three good job max oh you killed him it was a good shot by you oh they're in here [Music] through get back here i'm coming make sure to stay in that building the building where they are yeah because we're getting shot from behind we're coming from behind max yeah i'm distracted oh okay no i'm not running get in the building get in the building ha you just shot glass or whatever that is special glass you just shot perfect you fool i would never shoot perplex perplexed glass oh you didn't close the door max that's so rude didn't even take off your shoes yeah shoes off in the house wait it's a turret do it do it cut him down get him down oh oh he's so low i shouldn't jump out like that heel heel and then scan scan and that rafe is mad all right next time i have to take this don't mix and take the kill it's all right take the kill there's a rape about him jump on us i reckon she'll jump they always do that cheeky now they're actually inside the building they try to do a massive flank only we can do a massive flank oh my god max what are you doing get him back yes look at this flanking oh don't worry they're inside i'll use my arms don't use the roll inside makes it doesn't work right nice max good good damage i don't know good dome don't max oh but it's gonna disappear i know it's not yes it is this damn lifeline good job max oh if you took that my god did i try oh no i have been craved and then shot skin why is he learning behind you find around you why was he looting oh jesus i missed the shot that's okay you can get another he could have been shooting instead he was looting yeah so we have a bloodhound he knows what's up no i missed the shot i missed why was he looting it's cause they had a blood down on their team they won that's true okay oh gee look at those kills that i stole don't worry i mean oh my god geez that lost teammate max that bloodhound we need a better bloodhound that's how you win god i hope we get a really good blood hand this time yeah me too you didn't tell them to get blood hand no they always go bloodhound just naturally they just know they just know like without a bloodhound your team's screwed you see that everything look he's already pick and blow down what are the chances what are the chances i can't believe it this is great we're gonna win now all right where would the predators go max well i do believe the predators enjoy right there looking at things that have crashed plus they're crashed inside they're broken inside predators they have nothing left to lose not confusing me a big word all the right here right here come on max come on i don't need armor i just need a kill i hate you horizons i missed everything die harassing oh god no you got the whole squad come on attack me boy oh baby it's a trap oh no if i could aim it actually would have worked come on there we go i only took six shots but i got him that's all right you should have seen my atrocious aim just then too and she was on for help that was the bloodhound during all that though gosh yeah i wonder if he got like three kills in that time surely yeah four damage one kill i'm i'm real proud of this actually i'm gonna frame it what damage one kill 371 one kill we're basically the same how does that make it same where do we go max where do we go we could go over there the sport hound's following you there is this crafting oh there's people there they're trying to attack your crafting how dare they we kill them and then we craft on their bodies i'm going to use their bones as material that is good skin blood out oh god they have a blood one again let me say blood down better blood hands all good teams have blood hands all good teams have bloodhounds die blood down oh man go bloodhounds go yeah you guys go very nice there's a creeper there for you too me okay for me oh i was gonna say that you want to give it to the bloodhound true we did lose because of an enemy bloodhound with the crater all right furious bloodhand oh it's a peacekeeper this is unfortunate well i mean as long as there's an heirloom right that works yeah you want a third party max you can use a roll for once you can get a kill i throw it ah i can't aim again are they down no why can't i aim oh my god this is dangerous i don't want to get sucked in why can't i aim oh i'm actually hitting them i'm traumatized from the previous i killed him oh my god that's so right brad i'm so happy you were right i was right ah got him then pushing him no the bloodhound scared blood you're about to get shot i'm gonna save him fight as good as you can blood flight bloody on fight oh oh peacekeeper i guess yeah man bloody hounds of aliens are pretty good don't finish her finish double finisher you do one too yes yes yeah this is what they get for trying to push you in shh never push a blood hand never push a bloodhound they can scan if they didn't know watch out oh jesus and there's another squad as well in general get to cover somewhere dire max i don't have it i used it to finish please they

lad just trying to take my kill max no i wanted to finish him when he fell down but he just died oh they oh i've been to the other team i think they died of the team oh no if they're right there oh we

let's go gamers oh it should have been me no no way you don't know how to finish a kill you don't know how to damage someone from far away they heal and then i get and then nothing happens you're just farming uh so we are dropping in late because it's a new 500 strategy you watch where they drop in yeah exactly okay so they're dropping on this side we'll go the other side give them false hope over this side you mean i didn't ping so yeah okay such a full time you know that well you didn't ping so i thought i'd clarify just in case i don't want to be wrong in the gang greet me always angry i'm not hi jimmy no no yeah they're here i'll take him what the nice i got one the call stick is down oh lord it's the horizon die you've got to raise me save him save him oh no let me die boys you down

already on a team man i don't like it you love this so much oh my god let's go that side then we we almost won last time there we just you know trunam failed us we'll just say that it could never be todd's fault never i'm a god at this game of apex oh they landed on me oh my god what the heck nice time knuckle cluster did something i'm very good at let's go get it killer quick punch hey that was it is there another squad no i'll fly in there no no no maybe we need to calm down and we won't die to other squads we're going to slow down go too fast oh now there's a lot of pressure now now we're part of the problem i'm not good at uh being a third i'm getting voice corrects yeah yeah i'm good at being well hello there oh you just you just won against the other guy you're dead wait someone from behind is shooting me what he's landed on top of you todd get him tight no no i got hit too much yep oh god they're pushing that's oh my god what a joke i'm dead oh my god they heard me doing grenades i almost got one of them all the grenades despite the good fight one left no he still stayed there i thought he pushed he's just standing behind her oh what a terrible grenade go for me he's definitely not going to push now he's healing i think there's another one i think that is another squad yup that's another squad that's another squad it's another squad guys that's another squad that's another score that's another squad did you know that's another squad yeah that's another squad please leave them away so i can grab todd i don't know if they're following me but iran and

okay no do it then screw it oh i i didn't think you'd have the balls actually that's another squad as well guys yeah ready todd you ready i'm ready i'm gonna punch you we're gonna get it todd's the third party i'm the third party yes you got an aerial todd inbound with mozambique yes true hello oh no loot box here where's lawson he's freaking out he's scared he's throwing grenades and such he is busy he shot from the top he's very at the top what he'll drop down in a second come on how much longer can you stay up oh he's uh wait what he's he stunned himself what the heck was happening there third parties are getting creative again he's very creative he's all going to his head the third part he's all gone through his head he's acting weird will you hear that i thought okay why is upset like the day we make the bit of like ptsd it actually is warranted yeah just going everywhere it's happening it's legit a nightmare todd just wants us to end i really want this to end but then when it's not happening it's too quiet yeah i'm even more on edge it's like i need the violence i don't want it but i need it oh we killed this guy because it's only level 467 very unfortunately wait it's already gonna be the final battle yeah round one hasn't even toddy quest is that just apex legends no a little ridiculous man i haven't even done anything i did a hundred damage that's it where do we go they're on the air to fight i think all right in front of us how did that know a single one of them twice okay they've really hurt oh hello oh that's todd oh very good everybody very efficient oh they gave us their all that's kind of applause if we if the last team pushes us right now that is officially the quickest match like ever this is the one time i would like to be third partied please wait he's friendly the gibraltar is you can't trust it's a tactic i think he might be attacking it might be a tactic all three of them aren't doing it if this whole lobby was this sweaty oh my you're right todd knew it man but i want to okay try to finish the other ones first okay not the gibraltar okay yeah the wraith didn't chew me as well really so don't stop slaughter of third do take off your arm you'll be the same off the armor off now it's fair time oh sorry okay all right i won't do a man again i'll the armor no armor just throw the armor you see throw armor it's just there we go okay now you've got the touch now you go oh my god and he picked up the other one what no no no no no the armor off the armor off the armor off man i'm just going to kill this guy brad kill the gibraltar we'll start with anyone else i win the first fight okay good job tom you go against all the armors and just chuck it up all right no stop you gotta have no armor how does this what is happening he's using a gun i got him kill them leave that guy leave that guy we'll leave him with one guy we'll leave it with one guy one guy we'll get the one guy oh you just you just killed me yeah i understand

in with the protect boys oh no boys oh thank god oh well done what the heck the hell man level 500 everybody's trying to get it essentially the only reason why i want to take a farmer usually i want to have armor versus armor but lately when i do the 1v1s it's so much more entertaining without armor yeah and and we could have done armor but there's a gibraltar the gibraltar would have one or two extra hits yeah man easy that is true i am level 500 now maybe it's time for me to mature and open up a pack time to open up a pack every time we lose we open up a party questions actually if i hit a shot i didn't get anything good guys oh god oh my god yes i hit the shot like i said she's low she's like push hard no don't you dare horizon away i will not stand for it he's flying yes oh man that

sometimes i take this big breath of the fresh air man all right if you live your life on speed run you won't appreciate the small things okay i appreciate you amen do that oh there all went off he's lying right right yeah rising queue i will trust true they're shooting though to the left do we initiate a third party or begin a fair battle we're making two parallel universes right now going oh my god what have we done split decisions my brain your choices impact the game i'm living both at once go for the left left that's all right that that that yeah just popping that old and wasting it created another parallel universe yeah they killed them all third party go actually wonders if they can't find it calm down i can't talk they're in there somewhere that's just a solo over that way honeyquest nice what the heck was that even very cool moment an apex how do you help me that much oh my lord oh it's okay little brad cheer up no i would not because i wanna hide true i'm good are you

thick thighs save lives since you don't use her abilities i guess i won't too i don't know what uses their carry you yeah probably let's be real yep she's even now worse than rampart yeah rampart is definitely more fun than watson and better it's just great that like you pick a mane you decide i'm gonna get this many kills with her and then she's the worst she's the worst hero yep least fun hero worse that's why you did it so no one else would play watson and then you'd uh you know easily exactly wow that was all part of your plans i am the champion let's go look at you guys if you're

nothing if you're a what's in maine though no i'm watching die yes i want to fence them so bad but i don't actually have abilities right now that's that's why doesn't have the abilities anymore go on forever they should just do that i think people will become mostly the same the amount of times people die because they're doing fences i literally died because i'm placing fences more than anything else and then you do that because of me saying defense is long oh bjorno you're in trouble it seems you better make it oh hold hold first bradley i'll hold don't you worry okay okay hold me it's good okay that spitfire is quite nice that's kind of insane ah no you win that no i don't i'm what's it what do you think i'm gonna do soon oh wait team rampard and the jesus guys i just started missing everything i hit the watson curse just blame watson it's not your fault you should actually just become a horizon man honestly i'm thinking about it you would actually win so much more biano i'd have

team there's no attack what happened it's okay you know if we had fences then they wouldn't have been able to push what's the point of me doing fences man i mean there wouldn't be another pushing no you know i could have put down fences but why would i what's the point bjorno we would have died anyways at that rate you reckon i don't know watson's pretty cute you're not if you die how do i even live i don't i don't i'm when i'm watching my teammates do i die i'll be on a wet oh yes oh in the hole near there near there let's go watson can't touch that what are you saying about watson's hole

another node oh nice there's a big bubble over the node oh i love the nose another note i'm playing watson so well right now better than bjorno it's more focused than dorno does much better than me oh my god go go go don't shoot yet oh there's ttvs watch out brian i hate them all oh you ran into it up here as well okay oh my you'd be right about that one bionic he dropped blue he did oh came back

nice you killed them all right ah that's useful question mark yeah question mark i'll revive her i like my revive animation oh and i got um gold backpack that's right oh that means watson's kind of useful when she has the right abilities i mean um items they're running they all are purple oh we got one we you're there for moral support you got this bjorno oh hell yeah my booty is that a watson voice actor she just joined the call it's me they ran wait where's your finisher though yeah i got the good finisher he's here somewhere i don't know he's sneaky how do we how do we get up there bjorno they're directly up there oh they're up there okay oh i don't know how did we get either oh how do we get off it oh oh how did we get up there be honest oh no i'm out of blitz okay my hulk was almost done yeah it did it literally like oh yeah i started switching my aim to the wrong one yeah blue one look at me if i got third party we'd lose we never lose not once but yeah it's not one this must be the most triggering thing place the fences i'm getting an airdrop first i don't know what you mean you buy yourself watson you're by yourself completely oh i'm all alone who will help me who would help this cute little defenseless girl i don't have any abilities and i'm gonna just jump on them bjorno you're no help me oh there's a crater oh they were trying to creep at me how dare they oh creeper man what's the need to crave you know i've heard this i'm a saucer too that spitfire is nice how did you get that i'm better just watch someone crave or no i mean she has it in the trailer right exactly she has to get it maybe i can sneak a second oh they're next to me oh run away oh that's the other hill whoa oh watson does have craver i am crave a girl where'd she go like give me ultimate scare oh why would this happen oh my god that's a prowler teammate's pushed up we got to save hydra oh it's acoustic as well i shot her in the booty well you altered himself i hate this hero yeah play with our food i almost got him i don't know where he is i'm just shooting earth but the team not the team another team i need all the nades i'm going back to get more names from up here wait beautiful shut up oh sad boys i'm not sure here if you want to scream i know i'm about to i'm wasting the bullets there she is oh i hit the rock but that would have hit her in the head i swear i'm ready be honest 60. i'm always ready 10 kills are you on 10 kills oh you're fine oh wait where's she going oh they're all quiet yeah and there's a enemy down there i think that's a solo maybe rafe little race she's feeling oh she's outside oh she's running right turn around oh beyond no that's a lot of damage it's a lot of damage triple digits i don't know where he is oh come back here i got him don't you worry just watch out for the enemy team the other team has soon oppo die it could be on right all right so here's the plan all right so i'm going to queue on them and we're going to hold them and throw all our grenades i have one you ready for this slow book just just do what horizon does keep healing first i'm going to sneak under them over here cue up and kill them it's going to be fantastic because i have you know abilities and i'm useful oh oh yeah but once if we get shot while queueing up and we die it's impossible oh really yeah yeah yeah never we never lost with a strap that's cool i don't really reach high enough oh he fell i got this one oh this is scary wait where's what's happening where's the people going i'm healing did you kill one no i don't know what the heck happened to me oh i got a backpack oh i'm burning him hold him hold my hand hold him he's dead oh oh i put him on the store all right jesus i brought my guy back please kill piano but oh i was about to say if you got hurt once i would have killed you i ran out of bullets in my spiritual she didn't even hit you once since she just annihilated me in lover i feel like i did something oh like you're like stealing uh any last words appreciate the carry boys no i appreciate you i appreciate you finally followed us i mean one cause of that oh hey biano i am your champion baby look you're working so it's me though so i'm still the champion no i'm the champion you just can't have every once in champion oh octane g i'm place i could feel like i have an ability with this you have an ability without an ability oh my god yeah i use your cue these jump pads and oh my god a master player i am going to eat them oh god you know without your abilities i don't know how the people would land here it's okay we kill them i'll get the armor we have a costume come on be on it oh you're saying one beyond chasing after me in a second elsta who would use that that sounds fun shut your mouth oh don't you dare be honest i did such a good spray down too shut your mouth oh i sprayed him through a tree i didn't even see him i feel bad i know you're a hacker we all know that too there's evidence the evidence is there get ready for that master player it'll come from the air base yep on that zip line actually we could cut him out let's do it take a hide on the wall they won't know what to do and shoot once he makes it across the zipline you're dead mr predator oh i'm dead maybe god don't finish this don't finish it don't finish this goddamn master plan look at you trying to do a third party without your team because you're so confident goddamn master players god i hate master players if i was playing for master player i'd just like end them and push them off a cliff or something now we just kill your teammate wait you only had one teammate oh that makes sense then former goddamn apex not giving you teammates sometimes remember don't use abilities what why would that there's no point what even is an ability come down oh i can hold them oh they get old you may be killed get wrecked goddamn horizon she's going to get revived good fiona get him i cracked him [Music] i hate you they were so low don't you dare get that last one i brought him down solo good so as if he got that his drone tanked the bullet and i didn't hit him you know i've never been so upset in my life i showed up cracked him did damage and the guy got revived got hurt oh my god that was amazing i loved every second of it like it was a good old by you but i had the guy of course you had a grenade of course you had a grenade oh i have so many grounds you know how you're literally better at horizon than any other watson sorry comment why do you do this like i'm actually serious like a youtube bit why do you do this i don't know give up your goddamn oh i want kills and horizon i mean my watson i'm number on one like gotta be number one no one can overtake me i'm gonna craft a battery in spite of you i've got red armor so what am i gonna use shield cells here's one fence oh no yep it's probably fenced he took cover oh that just must trigger them so much oh no oh i'll heal just in case another team comes they run yeah those fools wait i got a gold i got a digital threat that's right did you throw something i know right there we're really low one of them jesus christ from healing please cover me the revival get the results yes eyes heal before they come sweaties more coming always there's always more there's always another oh no you got no ability there's one here target here correct yep oh it's so weird when it pulls them yeah it's really annoying oh you pull that oh you had a battery for me so kind what a nice look very nice ow where was that oh is that yeah get okay there healed be more yes there will be more great job bjorno great job just a great job bjorno oh i got a gold helmet that'll help nice more nodes here's another note it's actually amazing this is legitimately what you do you you might put down a few olives but like this is what you do you never put that i use i use old scissors rarely you steal i use the old to heal like with cells because by the time you get three cells off it will give you your fourth cell wow what a little hidden effect that's that's some watson's only ability that's about it how about i get 10 kills again how many you have nine oh i have six oh you could catch up to me good luck i believe try your best i'll give you the kills oh no fiona you better clutch this somehow that's good that stopped the revival gg how did that stop okay you're letting that revive go off no don't you dare oh oh yes they died to the caustic gas are they all dead last one's self-reviving it's your kill as well punch him hey let's go that was cool i was like hey i'm just going to go ahead because i know bjorn is going to come and push him with me he just leans to the right you straight up to the right they all went to the left and you went i'm going to go right oh this is baby using you as bait if that was a master player we were dead did better than bjorn 25 more damage he's insane i went that way more if i survived i straight up was like why am i taking so much damage shouldn't the damage be like spread between a soul any last words uh core stick ggs wow fancy seeing you here how did you get here oh man

todd dies we open up a pack open up no that's too hardcore all right so max and i are the ones carrying and todd is the one purposely trying to lose oh i don't think he's saying i'm fine so there you go todd you're gonna have to use that light mag really well i would throw it off the clip no please don't touch that will make me open up a pack but they might follow it they might follow it off they might i think it's a good idea my precious okay they're coming they're coming close there's right there the sweaty reef get the one in the building go max go keep chasing her she's weak a little bit i keep chasing her oh she's cracked and then i stopped chasing her because i got scared very no keep chasing her where are they let me at them she's probably coming behind you no she's not showing

pack though wouldn't that be a little crazy scenario that should sell i'm dead i'm dying you're doomed here's a pack todd you did this yeah you caused this to happen oh it's a legendary though thank you todd you're the best what was it oh it's rampant wow todd wow wow legendary i want to open up another pack no not yet you're not yet oh okay we're going to ready wait man change what if we did oh every time we win we open up a pack shut up okay you shut your mouth okay we do it the normal way okay cause i hate it when things are different for the years this has worked for centuries centuries forefathers did this really every time they died they had to open a pack all right but they didn't have video games if we ruined tradition so if we win will they hate us no it's fine but we can't open a pack if we win you just gotta there's very few rules there's only a couple of rules there's one rules come on guys we gotta go open up a pack on them see every time we kill the enemy they open up a pack too well obviously i feel like you don't even need to say that i feel like that's obvious who's going in first who's the one that with no fear where are they yeah i don't know where they are i'm just running oh they were waiting it's resin tight it's wrapped i wasn't with you guys oh my god todd they're low they're low they're low are they it's very low oh that's a very good grenade jesus

i'm going to unlock the heirloom for and i mean if this was without question it will octane where we gotta unlock octane but there is one thing that we do in fact going to talk about and listen i've heard about being ratioed on twitter but i have never heard about being ratioed in the comments section on my own youtube video and that damn near happened in this video okay i was a little bit concerned it's the combat started it's it started to slow down and it was awfully close to the amount of likes that was on this video i damn near got ratioed on my own youtube video has that ever been a thing listen i'm gonna need more of you guys to like the video i can't get ratio i can't get ratio on my own video that's just that's unacceptable behavior but listen we're playing octane today we got the heirloom and i wanted to to get to drop a banger for you guys because we got the heirloom and what better than a 20 bomb with octane it's been a long time since i've hunted for a 20 bomb and this is just it's an up to moment so you know we got the heirloom we dropped to 20 we had some crazy moments one play in here you're going to really i don't want to spoil it you're going to like it i hope you guys enjoy thank you so much for watching and i'll see you tomorrow for the next video and don't let me get ratio okay like the video first fatality let the games begin i didn't even work [Music] i know he was keeping it low he's keeping us steady [Music] bro oh no i mean like they're in the building like right now oh they're getting pushed oh how many people are here a lot apparently i didn't even see those guys okay now that i've sufficiently busted with the p2020 sufficiently busted chicken is that what just came out of your mouth now that i have sufficiently busted with the p2020 it is time to move on to other undermining points disregard we're chilling i'm actually going to loot this guy dude i brought i got seven kills there i just i i hit my trigger as fast as i could i i get a little p20 there's only so much i can do with that thing i i made it work for what it was i made a word for me can you keep up president scroob which are we going was not paying attention at all through the i'm gonna go through the vault or the the thingy here oh the butt yeah i've never rotated through the butthole those are first oh that's embarrassing is that a team there no i uh i i preemptively jumped a little premature oh wait level three who shot me oh they're there they got 30 30s that's probably not nowhere near far enough but i'm 30 30. i'm going in oh he's going in he's gonna he's gonna ride the explosions i'm probably gonna stun you i'm gonna feel really bad about it rage has purple hit for 60. i'll kill the raid my hero there's a third party coming in right now i ain't even gonna give him the chance didn't get this chance stupid oh there there oh wait there's another third party yeah yeah pepto english shakes is this yours nope nope that's that guy okay i'm backing up because there's another two over there and i don't know what they got i know they stinky though that much i do know oh milo good brother yeah i'm good crack the guy there's a team up top on them too down another team i'm pushing up to make sure they don't get dropped oh he's behind me did you crack them uh almost you only have blue armor man's cracked man's crack one bullet let's go dude nicely done thank you we played that about as appropriately as we could i need some bullets now any bats shotgun bullets i'll drop you too thank you here any shotgun bullets yeah it doesn't exist today i mean there's like 50 jillion blocks here one what like the odds are in your favor there's gotta be shotgun bullets what i don't know that thing started making noise i was like are we getting pulled up on by a trident that i didn't hear until the very last moment the ghost tried it hey i guess i'm just going to go into zone now all righty shotgun ammo on the way maybe scammed here trident right i got hard stars if he comes this way i'm gonna try to stick him out try to stick it oh my god that was crazy oh my god no way i can't you hand deliver me shotgun ammo oh i would say i can't believe it but like come on come on they actually they actually got raffle stomped oh my god again i i'm just it's all boiling down to the to the heirloom come here it's what it is it's just giving me these superpowers you know what you know what i i believe it at this point like i wasn't convinced before but that right there yeah i'm convinced now bro it's the heirloom it's so sick oh my goodness that looks great i'm glad i'm glad i witness i'm glad i was a part of that that's like a that's like my favorite thing when they pull up crazy with with the the trident they never expect it because you stick them and it shuts the car off like and then they get hit by it like this is oh man they have to have like cat like reflexes get out of the car immediately otherwise you're about to catch a slow and no shields so good oh yeah we got more yep i can't tell if they're above or oh no the their bottom floor this tower we could check out here okay i'll be there in a bit and there's a team above looking for the third let's go over here um if we push that team in the grow tower we could fry them but we're gonna we could we will get through i mean we could okay okay just crack them crack them that's all i ask i'm playing safe but you don't take too much damage because that team is going to jump on our head make sure you're always full okay uh they're running away come here guy all right all right now this team should feel confident to push you would think if they don't i'd be very surprised they probably just wanted to snipe from up top here i'm just going to throw that i'm gonna throw this at him throw this at him yeah do that i'm gonna grab this massive just in case you want to solidify this one this is a good one i'm going to start walking up oh they're jumping i'm backing up i'm blowing up right now so give me a second i don't know if i'll i don't know if we push that what do you mean of course we do third party i mean go go like a media up here gold mags are so good bro he still has a teammate somewhere well his teammate's scared i'm gonna let him pull the bean i think all right i'm gonna let him go this is 20. this is going to be 20 100 oh maybe not all right i'm going dude they're gonna get a purple swap in there he's coming down look out jinx where's he landing i don't see him oh there he is oh he spawns with a beak i forgot [Music] what armor did

the sentinel or the crater i believe that's a term anyway honestly i felt like i was better with the one time scope on the sentinel compared to when i picked up the three times i might have to try a game of just using the one time scope and the sentinel and see how it goes but it's still a really fun game i hope you guys enjoy it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends place

hit that give his arm shield for like a total of 230 damage that's what i see before like the gun shield should up it should bleed through it's crazy nice good job dude good game that was fun apart from a few missed sentence shots but we're gonna talk about that", "UckgMUMFsks": "so respawn just announced the newest update coming to apex legends the chaos theory collection event alongside it with the caustic town takeover and tons i mean tons of balance changes quality of life changes just so many new things added and normally i wouldn't make a video like this going over patch notes and whatnot i this is actually the first time i've done it but uh this is the biggest set of patch notes that we have gotten in apex legends and some of my favorite changes to date so if this could be a good time to be playing apex if you're a fan of apex this is this is going to be good man tons of juicy content in here and so many good changes uh let's just get started right at the very top the caustic town takeover it looks like it's taking over water treatment well it is taking over water treatment which is a very good spot on the map for because how many of you guys go to water treatment let's be honest water treatment isn't a very popular place you don't see tons of people there all the time and uh it's gonna bring some life into water treatment and the area looks really cool too it looks like inside there's some juicy loot it looks like the the caustic gas kind of fills up the area and if you're staying there too long i think you're gonna be taking some damage but we're not gonna know for sure until it actually goes live that's just the first impression that's what it looks like to me next up the ring fury escalation takeover which uh by the way the escalation takeover is just their wording on a new game mode basically think of it as a new game mode okay so the ring fury escalation takeover is going to be the new playlist for apex it's going gonna be the same vr same rules nothing changes in in the sense of apex legends the battle royale what does change is the ring okay so you're gonna have the main ring that always closes in like in every vr you've got the storm that closes in on you and it pushes everybody to the center of the map the center of the ring wherever it closes in right well now they're adding little pockets of rings inside of that safe space okay so you're gonna have rings that pop up throughout the game and you're not gonna be able to go in those rings which is gonna be chaotic okay it's gonna add a bunch of chaos to the game it's gonna it's really throwing wrench in things really is what it's doing but uh by adding this it kind of leads into the next thing they added which is called the heat shields these are gonna be a new item added into the game that basically give you a shield that lets you stand in the storm without taking damage think of it as a gibraltar bubble but inside the storm and when you're inside of that bubble you're not going to take storm damage okay so here's what they say about the heat shields the heat shields cast a protective dome pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short amount of time enabling legends to loot revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the ring if you're inside of the dome healing items is sped up by 50 and the speed of revives is increased by 25 so that alone just that alone is going to change the way apex is played especially at a high level or even in ranked right like maybe not necessarily in a public lobby you're gonna find use for them in public lobbies for sure but in ranked and in a competitive setting that's gonna change the game entirely man that is such a it's a good change i love the idea of it but uh does it go in your inventory uh no it doesn't which leads us to the next change they added the survival slot okay so now when you open up your menu you're gonna notice that the heat shield doesn't actually go into your inventory but there's actually a new spot for it so the survival slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities like a mobile respawn beacon or a heat shield now there's no reason not to carry one of these around coordinate with your team and the possibility for more survivability tactics soar like the heat shield the survival slot itself will continue to be in the game even after the escalation takeover ends so this is a permanent change to apex this isn't part of the playlist this is new to the game and it's here to stay so we're gonna have the heat shield and we're gonna have the survival slot in your inventory from here on out the next major change as we scroll down the patch notes is the no fill option for matchmaking now this one is a little bit controversial but i think people don't understand how strong this is going to be just for the everyday player okay so i know people want solos and people are thinking that this is a way of adding solos into the game and maybe it kind of is it kind of is okay and trust me i would like to see it solos too i love playing solos when it was here but uh they've made it very clear that we're not gonna have solos in apex legends so this is kind of the next best thing for those of you out there that want to play solos but for those of you that don't want to play solos this is also a big change for you guys i'm going to give you an example how many times have you played apex legends and you've had a random person on your team a random third or maybe you're playing solo in general and just one of your teammates he launches solo that lands by themselves probably a sweaty ttv raythmate let's be honest let's be honest it's probably a wraith mate atlan solo dies and then just leaves now you're left frustrated because you could have gotten that banner and you could have raised that teammate and you would like to have a teammate with you at the end of the day apex legends is a team game right and and people can play however they want to play if you're a solo player that likes to drop by themselves and play their own game then the world to you but the majority of us out here we like to have our teammates with us and it doesn't matter if it's a good player a bad player it doesn't matter it's a team game and just having a body on the field has value in it right so for those of you out there that want to launch solo die and quit then this is perfect for you guys and this is even better for those of you out there that want to play as a team because you're not going to have those solo players on your team anymore you're going to have teammates that are willing to stick around and watch you get the banner and watch you get the revive and it's going to make games more interesting at the end because you're gonna be you're gonna be alive as a team right it's gonna have way more clutch moments and even if you're not using the no fill option you're gonna benefit from it now i wasn't gonna talk about this i wasn't gonna go over all the cosmetics and whatnot but bangalore got an heirloom all right bangalore's heirloom's up next and and we have to touch on it just because bangalore always gets the short end of the stick on cosmetics i know it's not a big balance change or anything like that but bangalore heirloom okay so all you bangalore fans out there you got a little love this time around which is kind of surprising because she's really gotten the short end of the stick up until this season okay now uh it's time to get into the meat and potatoes of the video the balance changes the legend changes the weapon changes the quality of life changes it this is the meat potatoes of the video okay first up the caustic nerf now for all you classic mains out there that are you're sweating don't don't worry about it caustic is not going to be in a bad place the purpose of the gas is is to hold an area think of it as like a watson fence right watson fences aren't meant to damage you they're not it's not it's it's the way to hold people out right and that's the way that i personally look at caustic the main difference between watson and caustic up until this point was that caustic could be used offensively and he still can don't get yourself he still can be used defensively but the gas that the damage that the gas caused was really really oppressive it was way too high and when you pair it with the slow effect the vision impairing effect everything just as a package caustic was very oppressive now here's what they say in the patch notes the nox gas grenade cooldown increased from two and a half minutes to three and a half minutes so that's his ultimate they increased how long it takes to get his ultimate which isn't a big change right because you can always just find alt accelerants it's that's whatever right all downs are minor detail this is the big one knocks gas damage at a flat rate of 5 hp per tick instead of ramping up from 6 hp to 12 hp this is good this is really really good because at the end of the day apex legends is a shooting game with abilities not a br based around abilities so the gas doing so much damage makes it feel like it's not a shooter game it's an ability game it feels like what overwatch turned into right now this is the dev note that they said about caustic caustic is effective at slowing down engagements the entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area effect slow and vision obstruction and direct health damage it's proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering that your teammates can play in the gas relatively unimpaired reducing the gas damage seems like a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end now this is also this last sentence right here is really important we will be monitoring the data and the gameplay closely if these changes hit caustics appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit him accordingly okay so basically in short caustic is going to remain a defensive legend he is going to be able to hold out buildings he's going to be able to take over buildings but the idea is that the gas is going to uh make think of it as like a concussion grenade okay the gas acts as a concussion grenade it's not a frag grenade the frag does damage concussion stuns and makes it easier for you to shoot them if somebody's in your gas if an enemy is in your gas they outline themselves like if they were scanned by bloodhound they're easy to see through the gas and you can kill them because they're slowed so if you're a caustic in your own gas you've got the the same mobility the same movement while your enemy is slowed your enemy is is they can't see as well and you could just beam them so you got to rely more on your gun than your gas great change i think this is perfect i've seen some people saying that kossik's going to be dead this time the other not a chance man not a chance caustic is still going to be a good legend is he going to be meta i don't know maybe not probably not in algs you're not going to see classics running around in pro play but for us regular people just our day-to-day apex legends we're hopping into an arena is classic going to be fine yes absolutely and it's going to be even better for those people that are playing against the caustic like i just want to ask you guys a question does it feel good dying to count to cost a gas if you died at classic gas do you feel like you were out played does it feel good to die to cause a gas not really so this is a good change i really like this and uh for you classic means out there don't sweat it because kossik's still gonna be a good legend all right next up pathfinder this is a change that i've been waiting for for months i expected this like six months ago i don't know why they kind of dilly donald around man but it's about damn time all right they removed low profile here's the deal pathfinder's always kind of been in a weird place for those of you that didn't play apex legends at the very beginning his hitbox was like swiss cheese it was all over the place it was hard to hit he had like holes in his hitbox so what they did is they increased the size of his hitbox they made his hitbox massive he's like the size i think he's bigger than caustic i'm pretty sure pathfinder's hitbox is bigger than classic it's comparable to gibraltar it's huge and then on top of that when they nerfed they nerfed him on top of that by giving him low profile so they gave him a massive hitbox and then they gave him low profile which means they take more damage well that was ridiculous and they finally got rid of it pathfinder remains rise up it's about it's about time man it's about time i'm stoked to see more pathfinders roaming around it's gonna be good now we got three smaller changes here to gibraltar horizon and revenant gibraltar they removed his 50 percent faster healing when he's in his bubble uh horizon they increased her ultimate cooldown which again i said this earlier ultimate cooldowns when you increase the ultimate cooldown it's not a big deal because once again one ultimate accelerant and it just completely negates that anyway so that's uh whatever and then revenant his silence now disables mirage's cloak while he's reviving and respawning and uh octane swift men which is when octane he gains health you know octane gains health over time so uh when you're silenced that's that's a no bueno that's not gonna happen anymore the next massive change is coming to my girl watson okay when was the last time you saw watson roaming around in pubs it you don't see them very often they're rare it's like a unicorn you see a watson roaming around it's like you saw a unicorn well they gave her a very very good buff so how octane he regens his health over time right watson will now regen shield over time at half of what octane regens is health so original octane octane used to regen at the same pace uh they doubled it just i think like last season they doubled it so watson regens her shield over time really good change and this is gonna be a really good change for competitive too if any of you guys watch pro player algs heals are always an issue right they're always running on fumes they try to get positioning and then they you know it's it's a different game they're playing over there so having a watson maybe become meta again is very interesting and i'm excited and we're going to see more watson's just playing the game as a whole simply because of this change great change absolutely love it now next up rampart with the introduction to fuse fuse is able to just absolutely destroy anything that rampart built anything it didn't matter it was an instant destroy uh even if you threw grenades like if you do frags that rampart stuff it would just destroy everything so now they gave it more health the shield the sheila the rampart equipment gets more health it's going to be much more difficult to destroy which is a fantastic change especially when you pair this buff with the buff that she just received at the start of the season rampart maze rejoiced because this is this is great changes and rampar's never been a very popular legend so uh hopefully we see some more ramparts roaming around now that's all we've got for the for the legend changes let's move on to the weapon changes starting with the gold weapons all gold ar and lmg optics are going to be a two times bruiser now instead of the optical sight so this is a good change because the majority of players prefer the two times optic now this is the caveat if you don't like the two times bruiser that is perfectly okay because the next change is they're allowing you to change the optic on these weapons for guns with fully locked attachments like the fully kitty gold weapons most crate weapons you can remove the optic and replace it with a different sight this does not apply to the craver which makes sense right i mean what are you gonna do put a put a h clog on the crater like get it together okay so any other weapon but the crater you can take the optic off and you can put whatever sight you want on it this is a great change that i've been waiting for for so long and i'm stoked that they finally implemented it now for uh the floor loot the mastiff finally got a nerf okay finally got a nerf they decreased the pellet damage down from 13 down to 11 and they increased the fire rate just a tiny little bit now listen here's the thing i saw people talking about this on twitter saying that this is more of a buff if anything just because of the fire rate change this couldn't be farther from the truth the the worst thing about the massive was getting two taps well with the damage decrease you can no longer get two tapped by a mastiff if you're dying to a mastiff it's going to take three shots and it's going to take three big shots okay so you're gonna it's gonna add a skill ceiling to it you have to be consistent to hit three shots in a row with the mastiff you've gotta be consistent and you've gotta hit all three right so now it adds a skill sealing to it so it's not gonna feel quite as bad dying to a massive in two shots not only that there's counter play to it too because by the time they shoot three shots with a mastiff you have time to to react to it and play accordingly so i love this change plus we're gonna see more eva eats around more eva eights and more mozambiques with hammers which is exciting i can't wait to see that that's gonna be great and the eva 8 is is in a really good spot too i've never seen anybody complain about the eva 8 and i wouldn't mind if that was meta for a little while i think i think it's going to be really good two more quick balance changes to weapons they increase the magazine size for the wingmen by one with every single magazine so it doesn't matter what magazine size you have on it purple blue gold doesn't matter they increase the make size by one and then they increase the hip fire spread by the hemlock so you can't just hit fire and beam people from stupid distances uh so two good changes i'm excited for the wingman change i'm a big fan of the wingman i'm biased it's one of my favorite guns to use so uh i don't mind that change at all i you either one of these i mean both of these are or whatever changes but good changes nonetheless next up some quality of life changes starting with kings canyon loop pools okay so i think everybody is in agreement when you're playing on king's canyon sometimes the loot can be a little in you know a little in so uh they upped the loot they changed some uh some rarities on stuff they changed some pois the loot should be better distributed throughout kings canyon which is really really good next the assist counter that we see in ranked matches you know right beside your kills you can see how many assists you have they are adding that counter into public matches so it's going to be ranked regular games doesn't matter you're going to see the assist counter which is nice because it's always good to see how well you're doing sometimes you have zero kills but you're assisting in all of them and it's just like a it's a feel-good thing right it's a feel-good thing and i think everybody can appreciate that they also added the assist and the knock counter at the end of the game so on the squad banner at the end of the match you're gonna see it there too again more statistics showing you like hey you're participating in the game it's just a feel-good thing it's a good change now the last one i want to talk about is the badge progression now this is one thing that i want to see them add more onto so any sort of progression in this game is is good right it kind of reminds me of how you can unlock camos and call of duty right so you get so many kills with a certain gun do do whatever right well now it's going to be more specific more detailed when you're trying to complete some challenges for your badges and uh it's just it's nice to see more statistics more challenges stuff like this is a step in the right direction and uh hopefully one day we're gonna have even more to uh to achieve i think this is the the first step to uh true success okay so that's all i've got for you guys today a different sort of video i don't usually do stuff like this i'm just a gameplay guy you know just a gameplay guy but i when i read these patch notes i got so excited i just i love this game that this is my favorite game of all time and when i read these patch notes i just i had to share my excitement with you guys because these these are by far the best patch notes that uh they've released to date by far my favorite uh let me know down below how you guys feel about these patch notes i think this is a step in the right direction for the game as a whole and i can't wait till next week to test these changes out it's gonna be uh it's gonna be really really good this is a good time to be playing apex man this is a really good time to be a fan of apex uh i'm pumped so anyways i hope you guys

red we can go down let's go this way oh hey round one oh so guys what do you think of a possible octane buff reddit user toad r put together an idea for something that could make octane's bounce pads a little more explosive the idea proposes that when you throw down a jump pad you can rig it to blow with a grenade team mates can use this as normal but if an enemy tries to use it the jump pad will blow up dealing damage and also causing the jump pad to be destroyed afterwards we aren't too sure what to think about this as we think octane is quite powerful at the moment especially with the jump pad distance being increased but nevertheless it's a pretty cool idea that we think is great for discussion we'll leave a link to the full post in the description below and let us know any of your thoughts in the comment section down below oh oh enemy down after his teammates left him twitch streamer the mad nomad had to clutch it up alone oh closer uh [Applause] right here this team for a

later", "-fmkoXmDuCM": "all right here we go what's up everybody and welcome back to the channel today we are playing some more apex legends now i uh i'm kind of really excited because i found it a little stat as of not too long ago and apex legends player base at least on steam is at an all-time high right now it hit a new peak player base of 228 000 players so it's kind of exciting we're gonna talk about more about that today i got a couple of uh little charts i took some screenshots off of because um i went to the steam apex legends charts website it's actually pretty cool like the things you could see on there yeah we'll kick into some bangalore today i've been having a lot of good like good fun with her ever since her heirloom came out i've kind of been binge playing her that's sort of my thing every time an heirloom comes out on my character i like binge playing for a week and then drop them um just because oh no way say swear we got a gold shield see this is that's how you know me apex guys are my this is this is our game okay we're gonna get the dub here oh wall bounce oh that was clean okay so essentially i plan on meaning bangalore for longer than this one week period i know i said it's my thing but she was actually the first character i ever made in apex i think i got up to like 750 kills with her and this is when the game first came out like i was terrible at the game but i stuck with her and then i i don't know why i dropped her her abilities are honestly so good [Applause] okay hold up we got a quick little cleanup right here hit her with the bang heirloom ah yeah yeah one more slice and dice nice i gotta keep the gold shield actually i can't drop that i don't think there's anybody else here we should be alone where are they at just through here i want to get another kill with my bangalore heirloom it's so satisfying to swing around it has like a a golden tracer effect to it i think he's right he should be right there and i messed up okay we're probably dead here but you know what probably dead here but you know what we're just gonna keep running oh get up here where you running at bro what are you running for bro good stuff another one he's super weak and the last one oh my wow mama mia papaji uh holy mama freaking me okay that was intense man i'm just trying to relax here play some games oh you keep the batteries bro i got chill cells we'll get the job done with this today yeah i want to show you guys some charts now uh these are screenshots i took of the apex legends player based on steam so back in november this is when apex first came out on steam and had 74 000 players in december it lost like around 10 000 players but now in the last 30 days we hit a new peak of 228 000 players playing apex at the same time now that's like that's impressive that's a quarter of a million people all playing on the same platform together that's no small feat um just to put things into perspective for you i'm pretty sure my friend jack fraggs he made a video on battlefield and battlefield apparently has had uh one of its higher player accounts in quite a while now at 20 000. so 228 000 that is that's outstanding now i'm not sure if the 228 000 that i just showed you guys is steam and origin together if you guys don't know what steam is i'm just going to clarify because i'm sure there's some people who don't um that's essentially like the playstation network and xbox live network of pc so i do know that steam and origin they kind of cross progression you can share cosmetics between the two so i'm going to assume that that's all of pc together let's just give them uh let's just give it the benefit the doubt and then this will make it even look more impressive now that number is in playstation network numbers or xbox numbers and apex also just came out on a nintendo switch which is probably another massive massive player base so all in all when you put all the numbers together i don't know how to track though i don't think you can track playstation network numbers unless they like release those themselves but um i'm going to say at least a bare minimum 500 000 people are probably playing apex at the same time every day across all platforms this is just wow that is wow so if you were ever questioning if apex legends was dying or if it was a dead game it is nowhere near that it's probably one of the most popular games being played out there right now at least in the competitive fps scene all right we got a little red ship they just flew away up there by the way let me know in the comments what you guys think of this whole ring flare event i'm gonna be honest i feel like you've been running and talking and not been able to fight for like majority of this match because i've been running around this massive other circle all the way from like containment all the way around to here it's just it's just a bit of a nuisance i i think they got to like shrink it back to level one because level one was actually pretty fun but the last that i think i have to show you guys today is this other screenshot i took on the stream tracker because i want to show you guys how many people are currently playing right now like as i speak and that's 141 450. i'm sure it's varied a little bit um you know obviously you guys are watching this the day after the time of this recording but it just goes to show you like there's a lot of people playing apex right now twitch viewership youtube viewership everything's really good for the game it's it's healthy it's strong it's got three legs oh my god hold up we got one guy right here that was insane oh teammates clutch up baby that octane melted my soul i don't know how he got me like that you got it easy money i'm gonna crawl inside you for the rest here oh sentinel man i think it might be dead here nice please don't push us i'm gonna be honest i'm going next door we get a clutch up here i refuse to lose this game it's not happening we ain't losing today okay we ain't losing i think they're getting third party they're fighting another team over there he's lit just smoke over there i'm not trying to get sniped out here i might get pushed here to be honest oh my god come on come on come on come on come on come on go up go up knock him off knock him off we're good let's go this way wowzers man what a play that was cool okay both my teammates have left me [Applause] a little bit of a solo warrior here still three teams fighting let me take some high ground on this rock i don't know if this is the move but you know i don't really got many moves so take what we get i'm going to go in for it and parkour to go got her pop herself she gonna sell fresh i feel like she do yep got him that it i think that's it man oh no there's another team here do you know the smoke way up baby holy smokes this has been an intense one i tell ya a real intense one there's multiples in here oh god oh papa soul we gotta go we gotta go yeah not a good look here at all we'll uh we'll dip out we'll try to get a bit more in you know it's always tough doing these solo commentary videos they're always so intense the enemies are absolutely out of this world aggressive you know what somebody's got to do okay because if i ain't going to do it who's going to do it be getting the job done out here right you should probably get off these out of bounds zones too because i'm probably going to get killed let me chuck that down there keep them away i don't know where this other team is i legit can't find them for the life of me it's it's kind of crazy oh shoot the other teams the other teams in here oh shoot oh this is bad this is bad go go go go go go go go i might be dead here i'm totally dead here oh wow we gotta we gotta body up on this guy here oh that's just tragic i got five kills 1500 games let's watch this one let's see how this one plays out who's gonna get the dub here i'm kind of more mad at the team that was hiding inside the caustic lab the whole time i i kind of want the horizon and the octane to win now they didn't win okay anyways hope you all enjoyed that let me know what you guys think of the player base numbers that i showed you all today down in the comment section did they surprise you were you kind of expecting them me personally i i they didn't like surprise me surprise me but they surprised me a little bit because i didn't think they were that high but hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if you did leave a like on it subscribe i'll catch you all in the next one peace out", "PZzRQeO3qKc": "they're holding the hot dog there's two teams who are right too hit up at 72. i got him on circle there's my flames as well she's beamed at one health yeah her friend's somewhat hard too nailed that whole squad should we put up llama swaps on them really gonna get vault from narnia oh there's a team over there too dragon's gone okay they're our containment they're probably walking through for that guy oh no they're walking right here we land on them if you like they're shooting the air they want to fight too i'll fight we shall give them let's give them it another soft landing 193 octane you wanted a fight didn't you i mean i am oh he's actually gonna kill me with that thing what how am i alive oh dude you have one health left they're both all back here i think we could all use ready to hit for 65. i'm pushing that then yeah that's cool we can if you want jump now jump now while she's portaling sorry gabriel palmer oh lobo just went on our roof [Music] she went inside [Music] this dude's gonna revive his teammate he got his banner i respect it what was the buff she went above really dude she's just pouring all over the place dude [Applause] a cracker i feel like i'm just wandering around like this terrible breed bro he's rising another game ends the same way what you guys didn't think we weren't doing an intro in today's video did you listen i don't even care for four minutes in i don't even know if this is classified as an intro anymore but welcome back to the channel before we get started with the game that i'm going to share with you guys today you and i got to have a little conversation okay controversial topic hot topic almost at all times which is kind of baffling to me because i feel like we should be past this already but uh you know something that we gotta talk about is aim assist okay we're gonna talk about aim assist now i wanted to start the video off with a bunch of those little highlights clips just to show you guys i've been practicing with my r99 my nine is it's never been as good as it is today and the reason it's that good is because i've been practicing if you watch my apex gameplay from the beginning you and i was not doing that you know i wasn't doing that and i've been working on it because it was something that i wanted to do i saw others one clipping people all the time and i'm like i want to laser somebody from across the map with this smg i want to master that recoil i want to understand it and i want to be better so i've been practicing and i've been working at it and you know when you hear people just say i got controllered or he has aim assist it kind of belittles all of the time and effort that you're putting into the into the craft right and i call it that it's to me it's a crap right this is a profession to me and you know it's even mind-blowing to me because there's even there's people that are better than me you know like i don't play apex legends for 10 hours a day there's professional controller players that play the game for like 10 hours a day that are even better than i am so i couldn't imagine how they would feel but you know i just wanted to i wanted to touch on this okay so aim assist helps there's no question about it you can't even deny it it helps does it do it all for you no if i just hold my right trigger on my controller i'm not just going to one clip everybody there's there's a technique to it right there you got to practice you got to put the time in anyways i've got a great game where we're running the r99 we're playing mirage too by the way he's got a buff so uh yeah and we had a we had a really crazy fight it was a really good game and i think you're going to enjoy it and i hope this this amos is little conversation that we're having in the middle of this video i hope you you guys understand it for all my pc guys out there you know we can't be belittling one another all right we're playing the same game we love the same game it's there's no hate all right you got your peripherals we got our peripherals us controller guys i i think we're still at a disadvantage even with aim assist for example moving while looting you know moving while looting i think is is one one pro that a mouse and keyboard player has that a controller player doesn't but anyways i've been rambling for a long time i hope you guys enjoyed the rest of the video thank you for watching i'll see you tomorrow for the next one uncommon dude i got i got great loot the best i could have ever asked for got one and i hit another one too i thought he was dead dude yes i'm champion huh i heard a team to my north coming over here for this pack probably oh they're chasing up the hill i got scammed oh they just teamed up the out of me i actually got hate i'll take splash by the way what oh they didn't res life never mind kind of rude the you want a wingman battle me headshot i'm coming up all right act like a cheetah i tried one of them [Music] ue bro i'm cooking my shields stick one through the bushes throwing our star are you fighting yeah okay are you looking for ttv reactions i've got one so i'm just gonna shoot oh two teams two teams two teams

video this probably is upscale to 1440p just to get the best quality you can out of youtube but this gameplay is i think it's at 720p on the nintendo switch from what i'm seeing because they they gotta lower it as much as possible so you can squeeze as many frames as you can otherwise uh you know it's gonna be an unplayable experience but i'm pretty sure we're playing at 720p at a high of 30 fps and then anywhere you know in in variance that so you could drop to 20 fps and high action fights maybe even maybe even i don't think you'll drop to 10 but definitely around 30 fps so we're gonna be trying to get my first win in apex legends on the nintendo switch today i'm a little nervous to see how this goes because i have heard rumors that you do get put into the same lobbies as xbox and playstation players and they're pretty good but we're gonna hop into a game try to get it done in the new ring fury takeover trios and uh this is gonna be a good one man if you all enjoy the video i'd appreciate if you hit the like button also if you guys want to subscribe to my new staycation shorts youtube channel that'll also be in the description but oh oh my god what just happened i think you just i think it just threw me back into the game with the reconnect feature oh my god this looks insane the graphics are so weird oh god there's a guy over there okay all right this is going to be interesting man um it kind of looks like we're playing at like i would say like 60 field of view and i think my one friend on the nintendo switch here is a microphone okay here we go okay so i've become accustomed and like used to playing at 1440p resolution at 144 frames per second on the pc so even when i go back to like playstation or xbox i get pretty like rattled at how it looks like it's kind of like what the heck is this but this is another level like i i think i'm hold on let's see if we can hit this guy oh my first kill nintendo switch sit down boy there's another one there i'm trying to hit him so hard hold up we'll drop on him get back here son look at him go 69 oh no look at this how is he shooting at i'm coming for you buddy no he's so fast got him all right this is interesting i think i'm gonna mute my teammate here it sounds like he's like eating chips while he's playing it literally sounds like he's knocking on a bag of chips i mean it wouldn't surprise me he's probably like on the toilet playing right now i would say like my initial thoughts and impressions on the fact that i'm playing on nintendo switches i'm surprised it's even running like i i don't know how they pull this off don't get me wrong i'm not gonna say it's fantastic don't any of you any of you in the comments they're asking me to play on here again because this is this is uh it's a one-time experience okay that's how you get out of me i wonder how many of these players are actually on nintendo switch oh his aim is out to lunch no he's coming for me okay i'm gonna bail back is he gonna come up here where is he oh he's close 37 on him charge it up 69 oh we got this guy in the bag here give me your son get over here boy let's go i'ma hit him with the finisher look at the resolution i put my control freak that i normally i put my control freak that i normally use on my controller on my nintendo switch controller oh my god it's a rat it's alright i finished her okay here we go where's this guy nice okay i still got it i still got it even on the nintendo switch yeah i put my uh my control freak that i normally use on my my pc controller onto my nintendo switch controller and it's a little bit big for it hold a to replace this is something else other than like the visuals i would say that it feels just like apex everywhere else like my controller set up the exact same way i got like uh this controller sent out to me from apex set us to apex and it's got like these two little back paddles on it so i can like run slide and jump and still have my movements with me it doesn't it doesn't feel too different at all actually feels pretty smooth now i haven't tried this game in handheld mode um that's probably a whole different experience but if anything i think it would probably be a little bit better because the since you are playing in 720p it's gonna look a whole lot better on a smaller screen because the pixels will be more condensed oh shoot we got people right here no i'm lighting them up i'm lighting them up got one this is the lady what is happening oh man i was gonna say um i'd like to hear what you guys think of apex on the switch for any of you who actually have it like what's your experience been like so far are you enjoying it you think it's fun um one thing i do got to say is that this is my thoughts and opinions on the game coming from pc now i remember when i used to play fortnite on the nintendo switch and i never knew any better it didn't faze me like i didn't think it was bad at all so if you haven't played anything other than nintendo switch apex this is honestly probably this is fantastic and you could play anywhere you could play this in class not that it condone it he says there's people up there he just pinged them out okay let's open this what we got two ten time sniper scopes shoot you get a g7 shooter where is he oh he's up there oh he's pretty hard to see you know what i said we get the push-up he's got a red shield i'm gonna go up here and pop a shield bad real quick this is great this is how apex should be super chill super casual oh shoot gotta go gotta go no i got knocked teammate you

come across something quite interesting within code for apex legend something we covered not too long ago we now see that there's a category called marksman for weapons and within this we can also see that there are attachments titled barrel grip and sight all of which are followed up by a marksman tag so could this mean we're getting new attachments that are specific to marksman weapons and if so which weapons do you think will become marksman rifles we're used to having sights and barrels but a grip could this change the way guns are used and if so how let us know all your thoughts in the

yeah i don't know they wouldn't it wouldn't be like that otherwise we could literally spawn dg threats so now something strange or do i have to use a bed uh my kid use a medkit i don't ever carry syringes when i'm locked in look how many rings are down do you reckon people are putting these down or like they just randomly spawn no they just randomly spawn and then how do we how do we use the equipment because one started it oh hold left on your d-pad yeah i can't wingman inspect anymore i can't do like jump pad wingman in specs bro what i think they would have changed button right yeah i hate shooting like north east actually no north directly north right [Laughter] actually no it doesn't expand that far though does it it only expands like a certain amount like on our mini map can you destroy them no you can't oh you're like if you're getting chased oh right in front of me just waiting no it's not like a gimbal it only protects you from storm i think i got one nice start again he dropped out of you that's the guy i got you oh you're fine that was the last of that squad should we collect heat shields oh cannot equip what i think if you just have one you can't carry more oh you're allowed two you're only allowed to did i hear a team i do team here there's a teammate oh my god he's right up top one with me jump down jump down pull down nah i got him oh nice i don't know what that was i don't know sounds like a zombie right or am i tripping it was a weird sound yeah i heard it too it's a weird sound that's why i was kind of like confused i'm like is it was that a guy is there a guy here it changed path on his grapple sound oh he added that good stuff all right why do i have a slot missing in my backpack dude you can pick it back up wait really no you can't no you can't no you can't no you can't 70 percent how's that so it doesn't hurt you no it just blocks the storm look it's like raining it's like it's raining oh that's right i thought it was the storm over here someone just put that down or is that you oh i'm in the storm i'm stupid wait what that's a heat ring yeah oh man this is this whole heat ring thing is like really throwing a wrench in there oh i get it now i was thinking you were putting the heat rings down but you're just putting the dome of protection yeah all right i'm stupid i also have zero health i need to advance that what just happened i why did it oh that's gotta be that's gotta be a bug what happened i just tried to pick up uh a heat shield thing and it said i had no room and i had to swap it out with oh oh my god i just got pre-fired bro you gonna have to shoot for me for a second i'm going inside and i'm phoenixing hold the high ground they were waiting for us was i'm so confused they're not even walking out be careful with her she might be sucks but then again she probably just heard me coming i was not prepared for her she was like she's not there i'm gonna check around i'm lagging i'm like skipping okay yeah i'm gonna try to repeat i think they're just waiting for us around the corner it's a ramp up so she might be set up let's investigate my wingman has nine bullets by the way bro my wingman has nine what side was the only tell me she just freaked out right side right side it was like you're standing still and pretty fired me the device detected really a ring player just came in at market by the way ring flares opening heroes i want to see if they ran around i might cut back through market and it's fighting that way all right let's go there dude these end games are going to be insane these heat ring things are going to be so sweet i'm going to go around just because that heat ring is expanding and cutting off most of the markers dude you could sit and storm for a like a long time you could yeah if you were wondering games are gonna be like that like think about it you could have three three teammates all of you have two heat rings each that's six heat rings and you just you just alternate them oh we might run into that right in front of me i'm gonna throw a nade and then i'm gonna choose pretty much cracked the one body somewhat low on you another team coming up behind us 180 on the guy behind him 180 on this guy i'm gonna get a better real quick it's a heat ring battle i don't think so rising dude like look at this you they had to drop heat like the the shield yeah heat shield this is so sick i love how the spitfire's got the 2x now as well what was it before the one to two i didn't even need to swap it out i could take it off if i wanted to but i ain't doing it that's just scary oh behind it's probably the horizon teammate okay they're boys too oh that's right you are insane bro this is the other guy's track just said this oh you're already in that i respect it yeah god um i'm like send it you're halfway there his name is thank you dude that octane god exploded yeah that first guy you must have exploited it i just shot at him and he fell over yeah you gotta call they're fighting there's a team high ground just awesome up in salvage should i like not even carry cells now that my character just heals its shield now you probably should still carry cells headshot him i want to see how long it takes to charge full red armor i'm going to let him break my armor janks just for science yeah this guy really needs to learn recoil control he didn't even heal i'm kind of confused all right you let that thing heal up it should take a long time though because it's old octane it's old octopus yeah oh it's the original option that's not the exercise i want to see you with the gen as well dude that's like pretty good maybe that's pretty it definitely stacks it definitely sucks we can just sit here and i can just do this all day long that's actually going to be so good for ranked or for even algs i wonder if once it's going to be meta you just like watching it's kind of ridiculous that's real heels are so important in that mode these guys stop being weird and just like contest this or die i'm going to kill him yeah get him out of here i was getting ready to be even brian dude i wanted to wingman inspect so bad i'm like i just can't i can't do the wingman inspect anymore is this one though wait wait wasn't that like a half player lobby turn yeah there was only 30 people or something 32 i think in that lobby we just played it anyways just wait this is interesting kills assists knocks that's good yeah kills assists knocks we're so even wait what is knox though like seven kills i mean that would be seven knocks like there's no way i only knocked two people maybe it's like knocks that you didn't eliminate oh maybe thirsting in somebody else's knock maybe", "53pyMD-IP7g": "[Music] hello everyone i'm kris and welcome to best epic sleeps

right show yourself to me bloody there we go oh there we go efficient oh another one as well if you want mate oh mate just got a heavy max all right mate i got an idea okay i kind of want you guys to

another try mate jump into some more enemies this time how about that this damage to kill ratio isn't fair i'm the grenade character no you're the aussie character mate i think i'm gonna be a rampart man i don't have to think about anything i just need to hold down and shoot oh you really want to commit to that no no i don't maybe another time maybe another class this is my new main character and i am your champion let's go where is it where is that gold heavy mag oh it's too powerful in your hands man i can't i can't let you know where it is i'm sorry you know what i know where it is it's in the hot zone it's in that hotty toddy are you sure it's in the hot zone oh you make a hot zone are you willing to commit we could do outside of the hot zone and an area where there's very likely to spawn yeah and then we go to the hot zone yeah look there's one there and there's one over there oh there's lots of gold mags in this area yeah because they spawn in these little things so i think it's always a good idea thank you for giving me all your secrets now oh my god it's a little stupid i don't know oh my god max is in trouble don't be in trouble max please don't be in trouble with the government again oh geez the government's up to mexican ow that's so standard for max i know actually government loves max oh go away i really wanted to kill him already fine fine i will call it todd what's the golden thing ah i'll take it but i don't like it oh there it is we've got it you you got it todd you're right this is where it all is i know man i know why are you always so right in life are you ever wrong isn't it strange that normally i am correct i i don't understand the why the world does indeed revolve around you i think so man yeah honestly when i'm not talking to you i just kind of sit there and do nothing yeah we're npcs in your life wow well there you go look you learned something new area and i don't know if you you're lying or not i'll never know really they're here i haven't come on stuff there's no way i think they're down i also think they're down but i like the cut of your jib brad is never wrong when it comes to where enemies are because i don't know if you know this max this is his job this is his job okay i think that oh this is high ground this is high ground oh there he is i was correct you made me doubt myself here i find his cracks that guy's correct too oh there's one what the wait where are they oh how they how they just doing that so much oh i don't have oh thanks where is he so reviving the guy i just got oh they're in the room they're in the room yeah we must have my gold thing oh are you okay oh no no what's the matter scared no it isn't why not why would there be more than one team oh that's correct yeah it's time to open it up baby i've never tried this before i opened up that oh yeah you haven't no what an animation on the video no oh isn't that cool why why is it not the heavy bag there we go maybe i could use the turret oh wait they're going to come behind us hold your ground men okay it is not smart to do that right now what do you mean the turrets buff yeah yeah i can look left and right doesn't mean i keep paying attention it is buffed you're pushing you guys use my thing around the right they can't see with their eyes if we're out of their vision that is true brad oh he was pre-shooting me because he's a cheater how dare you [Music] oh wait but max broken me set oh wow yeah just like if we must oh i can't fall back i almost got one of them it wasn't good it wasn't good at all pretty convenient wait they're pushing evil well that makes sense why they're pushing wait so that means there's two squads there we could hold this angle and we can win love doesn't always come on time 20 seconds a little bit less there you go this is beautiful this is our little bunker you're beautiful oh you're beautiful oh you're beautiful oh there's so many batteries i forgot to go oh he's pushing us you dead

you wanna answer the answer it's the last two squads and you that was the answer what well it's just you and me now mr zilbrady i didn't want this oh you can come again he'll get you eventually i think he got this well we might oh it might not it's as simple as that and it's as simple as they keep getting to cover every time i shoot them yeah imagine if you went down though you could get them well i didn't want to because then we get pushed by the other you're like would you like a loafer yeah over here there's a load of buff that uh we can grab his banner with it is that real one minute no someone said that to me and i believed them i would have been called wait wait wait they're moving they're moving okay i actually have a scope for my actually i actually got actually you should shoot him i actually got to strike no don't shoot oh my god no too late brad you said that way too late okay go don't shoot them all right we're bringing max back he is the important one we call upon you max since you are the god all right max we'll never make a mistake like that again i'm actually pretty peaceful right now i'm over here by the way bro you better start running the game wants you

right boys i finally got a good turret placement and i can't see anyone you can't see anything yeah oh it's apparently it's not that good then no it should be it should be it'd be good a little bit further right yeah just a little bit a little bit because we can't see over this little slight incline but if they push us no no no don't don't run in the next we've got to win can you aim it a little bit down so they can't see the laser brad you're doing great max they're not here i don't know what the heck he's doing what is he doing no idea i've got no i'll just keep doing walls along the way they're not here we're the wall characters oh they run that way we stay here stay here i think there's one yeah focus aren't they al get to cover toddy quest oh my god if you get down we all die i

another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the final unlock in season eight of apex legends the white reactive longbow skin called a blinding light i've been trying to get a decent gameplay with the longbow but the problem is at the moment public games are wild every gunfight takes place 10 feet in front of you and the games are done by nine minutes so i went into ranked and the fights there were far far better for this weapon there's a bit of distance to them people have far more discipline when it comes to rushing and i finally got to put this gun through its paces and i've got a ton of kills with it hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends vibes don't come oh there's a blue over here on me oh my gosh there oh no it's coming to the other side i don't want to be here okay i'm coming on come here give me one sec you're gonna have to move in my speech thank you i've got a wingman and a score piece there so does that mean i have to use it first um i think so that's the problem i just can't you just can't no i mean you can though may not do it well but it's okay no kill leader that's it i must confess is he okay uh yeah probably this flat one is so tempting all right here's the sniper tower okay give me a second that's the most stacked long way you've ever seen i just saw this trailer oh yeah oh they smoked tomorrow am i near them okay she keeps smoking everyone out but like i hit this guy from 96 and she smokes it but i guess she didn't know that okay we're good nice work everyone um i'm gonna look for more reliable secondary what are you using massive longbow so i feel like my second gun should be like an r9 here we go green now what do you think i have what did it even do um right here he had some stuff for your lambo he didn't like no he didn't you're just stacked out of your mouth fully stacked wasted my time okay oh well all right nice good start fantastic i've got two kills of my longboat it's already on fire landed a head shot from 96. i mean that's the dream right uh absolutely if there was people here that even better had to buy the um i saw a care package flying over here but i have no clue where it went it's not on the map anymore it might have been a lifeline oh yeah i had way there's oh wait there's a give the old hold on everyone i didn't know that was coming in oh all right sorry maybe you led it to me you led it to me with you soon the stones come in as well just be careful not with you guys at all it revolted mate team's here eyes are in the same hand 27 headshot okay not again come on that might be their teammate just trying to get battery i think so it's positive i'm gonna go back to the same team over here evo shield here level three wow i should take that what am i doing what do i need syringes i'll try and get up top so they don't hold this out oh can't i can't see the accident i'm dead you're fine no no no i have no syringes i think i'm okay i think you're okay you're okay okay that was a mess are you bad at kingroot i don't know so i left you alone because i was providing the teammate because there were boxes right there so i thought you know i guess it worked out he's up there i see him on the on the door that door is he down already i can help if you fall back if you need i'm fine that's right but they have to jump off in a second but i'm a corsicson fan scenic and if you ever had on the outside you can just climb up nice and one okay nice there's another team that i shine this way too okay yeah we gotta we gotta move it went like right through the hole i am scrapping what's this a contraption i can see in the distance there's something here oh my god that looks awful never mind riding over here oh do the team's pushing too careful not with you engaging there we go yeah i walked up uh hughes was resin while lifeline was standing in the corner oh nice yeah yeah team called nation where is this crater i'm going to add crab with my longer 65 cracked one shot dead that's not a head shot i'm missing i'm missing i'm missing i'm missing an actual mystery i see anyone on diving board which is very surprising kind of interesting right oh uh where i just killed that one yeah nice um wait are you telling me that i don't wait so i can't recharge you okay so i'll just waste my ultimate nice that's two out of two then okay big value racing stop doing i'm trying to snipe them i got two of them oh she definitely does she's popping off with it it's never good for your team if they don't have it oh i got one now so i'm showing i need a four to ten times that's what i need comment really um yeah i was kind of confused but i understand what you're trying to do now did you know that you can't like use it and recharging did you know that um yeah i think i knew that about caustic i think it takes for it has to like go away right yeah i mean it makes sense i'm glad otherwise you'd sit on charge towers and double imagine that virgin terrified one ultimate thrown through a fence and another ultimate i've thrown at a care package but no one was taking fire evaluation absolutely hold on mate careful with that one maybe it was like a you when you read it you're saying it about them kind of thing you know yeah i guess so um these guys are just big chill and hide yeah they have double smds so i'm not very useful as soon as you get shot at you just retreat there uneven hit a shot and he's just out there what's going on here it's like a game of whack-a-mole what's going on here oh my god there was no okay once positioned me i'm not wasted how does that mean don't know it's an actual mystery how does none of that hit yes i deserve that one us there's one squad left and they needed us so i don't know did they go that's the question they're in this way make the longbow that's the longbow game i'll be trying to get that's the game you're here you're kind of firemen that was fun who are they didn't have a single good ultimate it's not about caustic gg did i deserve 14 kills when you look at the damage counters no maybe not okay all right all right rich come on what is what is happening here what is really happening here i can't farm damage when i'm double head shine people they're just dead it's not my fault yes when you're here for 105 105 they're just dead there's no farming i can't first from that range either it's tough", "NdhVO_sbfcM": "welcome back to apex legends everyone today we're gonna be playing solo in the trio's

party where to go i wonder for that you know what i should probably go for a flat line let's do it big chunky gun there we go we're kind of set baby oh whoa they're right over there oh they're jumping

out of here they're after me i'm the one being hunted actually wait you're confident maybe i can like get you yes i'm a bit better brad oh my god this is tricious oh run run away all right there is three of them that is indeed a factor that is true i've never been so bad at aiming though okay i need to calm down a bit i'm a bit panicky i get really panicky if i don't have team members to take the hits for me i'm like oh god they're looking at me and i can't aim give me a gold magazine oh they're fighting this is perfect gold magazine oh yes indeed all right we can rock the flat line then all right they have to come to me i will be awaiting for them oh they finished up a squad or something let's check this out that's gibraltar eh come on i can't shoot you're buying a tree no it's a dome oh there's a platform of dead i can't let them revive that man yes all right we'll put this down and start healing ow how dare you i can hardly see oh my light heal fast hopefully he's pushing me no he's still in there too now he stuck me now i got him ah there's another team that's another team oh jeez okay oh no screw you gibraltar yes all right let's heal fully just in case they push us we're going to use these heat shields i can heal faster than them and i feel like i'm gibraltar up and running we got all the loot possible right now baby boom throw that one away boom throw that one away it's the looting phase baby oh god backpack hope for that other team isn't camping us are you lads waiting for a poor little solo uh yeah cause i'm gonna smash if you are oh and they're right there that is a terrible situation for me if i do this right now yes your enemies hear those shots oh is it doesn't that sound juicy don't you want to get in that action please leave this area please leave the area oh god there's a huge ring along the way oh my god we have to run through oh he's looting still what oh there he is good oh no okay hit your time yeah i got the heat shield you don't baby heal quick so it looks like i'm actually the only way i'm going to be able to do this is if i play with the heat shields guy's given up now ah kanye west is dead i've done it i've won the game they revived my kills i cannot let this happen i cannot let this happen one bit it's time to dominate these lads before i get up and out of here now where will they drop right here he got both of them

of here okay okay only 12 squares left i need them to fight or play the height on this place this is the artillery you can play a fight baby actually if there's six people could get a 20 bomb oh my god that's not gonna happen okay so that is gonna get covered by a ring so i think the plan is we just wait we're probably waiting in that building over there one team and the other team would be i don't know oh i look so good right now i am looking so good oh my god oh no the tracking at the end no god no you're gonna run through where are you huh can you finish off good let her revive actually someone's dead can i kill them do i finish off might have to finish him off real quick and then run he's going for the revive die yes okay one team left okay there they are how many lads we got please

there's a good boy oh you crazy lat out that's hammer point right there that is how my point no okay okay we're good everything is fine i think one little cheeky octane and oh they're going away after them i can catch off that octane you're right there no okay wait no don't do it octane all right now he'll be waiting i think i'll just go through the ring oh well jello meet again octane you know what i like the gold barrel stabilizer on the spitfire so let's just equip that i love that glitch here we go oh no oh wow there's some big hits oh no come on baby no the life one's gonna revive go for it lifeline go for it and i'll dominate them die away what will you do go on the zipline do it do it hello no think they ran you know what screw it let's use this gun jumping around using every other type of gun possible oh they ran away to respawn i see um coming did someone call the third party that is just a solo player i did and launching the grenade perfect arc start easy kill oh i gotta kill from it it's gonna kill this guy out out all right we gotta heal a little bit i'm going to kill you so badly always trying you guys stop the revival oh we did come on boy come on boy come on boy yeah oh my god it's gone spitfire jesus christ love my golden guns oh double golden oh let's go flatline as well that close range oh my god double gold oh it's even a mozam oh what do i do i thought i could use them all this is the most like i've got backpack but i don't have any teammates oh they're fighting no not without me and my ten shield batteries this goddamn ring flare i can't get on the action this is good though there's a bit of high ground here i can play a pathfinder and actually have a chance again all right it's a three man i need that high ground now all right this is our new home there they are oh that felt good did i push it it doesn't sound good to push not at all oh but it is maybe they're not together okay none of them uh characters that can fly up in the sky which is great great news especially if i get them right now and then finish them off okay no no okay come on come on drop it down drop it down no no no no no my chance my glory is so much ammo like that i'm gonna run out of ammo at this rate unless i can get the guy for once yes oh you're dead there's no chance for you look at the ring engulf you goodbye you didn't follow your team fuse mate goodbye nice that's what we want to see oh he's waiting down here oh my all right we can make this work oh he's high ground oh look at this ring beautiful unless the ring flare comes oh thank god it's over there he's over there oh look at that okay i don't want to get too confident so we're going to use this high ground to advantage he's still hiding that little corner oh he's trying to shoot me i'm reloaded oh it's a gg isn't it isn't it it's time for a punch hair real fudge i punched him into the ring to die i need that high ground baby but boy does it work so well whoa spitfire is kinda repeat nice almost 3k damage all right so it seems like the strategy is to get lucky enough to get that end ring to be high ground for pathfinder and it's just beautiful it's beauty full oh don't forget third parties early on that's nice get all the stuff so you have to kill everyone to get enough loot to have the final battle having those gold mags is a dream you get to heal and once you're healed you got you're reloaded and i am your champion i hate the delay now i got to get used to that thanks the new announcer just doing it randomly oh where to go oh that hole i want to go in my little house my beautiful little house just over there who's going to drop us oh right that's right it's just me i might have this kind of to myself i mean i'll have to kill them somehow oh my god they're landing like on me get away i need to kill you quick die not gonna leave too many enemies i don't have enough ammo all right so i've finished up quite a few teams in here can we third party perfectly can i catch them off guard no i cannot no i cannot indeed oh boy oh by the way i go ow they really want me oh they want me all right they want me so badly they're all together i need an ark star in this building this is it do a dive building right here all right i almost killed that gun uh no get the hit i know he's behind me die all right where's the third one huh oh it hurt okay she's low go for the revive do it i tell you she's going for it go for it do that revive yes oh let's go all right now we've finally got the magazines so we can uh actually do some better stuff in here god without the magazine i just feel like i'm useless they're in the zone oh they do know okay they got a sniper all right i guess i'll find another fight then i'm really not hearing any fights nearby god i'm far away from it all seems like it's only two of them actually it is a rafe and a horizon though sweaty little ones aren't they there's another guy oh my god there is oh my god it's a new team and they always have snipers there's nothing i can do they are running um i need your gold man come back here why are you running i know i'm coming i'm really not liking this though i just want a nice easy third party what two enemy squads left oh my god i was just on the wrong side of the map the whole time i've heard nothing so now there's a two man i know three or two men left so now i like i shouldn't kill this team so they shoot each other then i come in at the final okay we are terrified of each other they they're a two man and they're terrified of me why is that the team they had to fight where's the one that just keeps running away oh they can shut it interesting okay oh my god no they're running where are they going i need to make them go the other way hey don't hit me i've got this railing here oh he hit me ow sir we're getting cornered by everyone right now these guys are running away so i have to cut off this other team or something jesus christ great just what i want to see oh make my day and flank me make my day are they going up there nice i need them oh they just died oh that's just great well that's just great it's a three man and i have no advantage no advantage god damn it oh boy a ring flip just what i wanted wait come on okay come on there's a plan do it dude no no advantage what was that trash well guys if you enjoyed that video and that little soul adventure remember to hit that notification bell and our zil friend will see you guys laters", "sRzs49_Qfis": "everyone i hope you're well today i'm going to be talking about a very strong strategy you can use to damage farm and get high damage badges right now this isn't going to last very long now right now the heat shields are in the game they're absolutely everywhere you can get them off dead bodies and you compare them with the ring flares so whenever you're down and low you just jump into the ring flare and heal up now the kick is you pair it with the trident on olympus and then you either go solo versus trios or duos versus trios with a well-coordinated teammate and jump in the trident zoom around the map look for third parties engage at a distance uh not too aggressive get as much damage as you can and if things don't go your way just jump in the trident get into a ring flare heal up and then reposition or retake the fight i'm going to showcase two games today where i really use this to its full advantage it's something that you're not going to be able to do as much once the ring flare mode is gone so definitely give it a try definitely watch this video to see an action this is the same strategy i used to get a 6k damage game there's a card on screen now if you've missed that video but anyway let's jump into it let me show you this in action oh how do you manage that then eh cover judging my shields all right quick little four piece quick little four piece and i'll find the players oh okay you need to chill crafting happening in there just have a little peek you know where'd you go pushing me i don't really know what's going on to be honest right nice little drive-by shooting i'll fly by shooting there here we go it's more like it i just got down oh again get out of here oh it's never training but the worst thing you want to fight is a spitfire player i didn't actually do damage against you you know almost got him [Music] in my meds i'm gonna just let out okay someone's wait what he fell off the edge and i got the kill for that okay a little look at what's going on here oh there's a player there oh that's a lot of players all right we need to go just we're dead here but rock it on the other side of the heat flare and then just chill for a second the ring coming in okay um all right it's fine just zoom past him dude oh well let's see and take a different approach we need to pick up some heat shields i think they're fighting huh something we'll get involved in i don't have to warn me but can i hold this angle you know now we put the wall up all right it's a nice little third party situation for us right now dude i might just pull up on them oh oh oh yes we do oh my god yes tons of watson see tons of watson fences but i don't hear them inside they are i think we're dead now dude can i push me i think they will that just shows you how powerful this strat is i kind of set out we'll come back to them later gotta take a bit of damage on them oh okay i'm good we'll find another fight dude that guy's just running out in the open what's he doing dude i don't need to reload it do i what am i doing oh my god dude we're dead we're going to the diffuse thing oh no ah dude oh we did all right though okay they landed with us so i got papa what all right all right that's a bangalore maybe somewhere whoa buff dude rushing can there's actually more people here all right 1k damage already people actually here i didn't know that i just stopped here i have a shame wasting time you know down here i just want to clean up these guys there's one down here i think oh god all right i'm gonna come out since um yeah i'm gonna go like that but we are 1.5 k damage 27 players left i have a sentinel now um which is going to be quite good because of a long range scope though i think i hear people i do over here we're looking at here we're getting chased down here so oh we're about to get pushed dude oh no problem no problem we can go back we could go around the other side there's fights happening on the other side so i might do that [Music] let's get that countdown foreign oh do not have a heat shield oh my dead [Music] here oh finally a decent weapon dude what's what's left 3k damage there's the potential here is the potential for something great it's fine we just gotta leave that unfortunately they'll probably come for me um a little dangerous but can i just go for she's a it [Music] we're dead so yeah i think we did a pretty good job i hope you enjoyed this video let me know what you think and i see you all in the comments cheerio", "1q210X6rg_M": "welcome back to apex legends everyone today we're going to be opening a pack but more importantly okay it's not a legendary or anything we're going to predator

apex predator 1 000 damage this match guys how many won 913 oh that's door one crib one great one craving remember guys we can't win until we get a crater we cannot it's not it's not it's not physically impossible unless we get a credible all right we have to throw the match if we don't find a grip oh oh yes there we go they're aiming at me but i don't know where they are yeah i don't know where they are up on the roof oh where could they be i don't i need to get my my 87 damage oh dead are you okay i'm literally a god at this game hold on i you i'm sticking and i'm sticking to protect me i'm literally a god are you giving my shields yes oh why would you move backwards why i didn't know they were aiming at us guys there's no way of knowing that okay now you're kidding me just stay in that corner right there way of knowing that you're a predator you're supposed to play good they may not play great man better than you okay oh yeah how many times did i fight one hose once right once or twice right that's right what's the driest for it you're not going to believe it until you see it once yeah oh damn actually yeah i didn't expect it what do you mean i literally didn't register until you said it i always land my shots oh oh there's only two nice there's only two three two i told you if toddy gets the crater it's insane instant win thank you for carrying me todd you're welcome oh can you carry me again please carry me again oh come on turn him stealing my kills why are you talking about him you didn't even do that much better than me brad actually like well you're literally a predator so technically like i'm quite proud of myself that's true you should be proud of yourself actually now that i think about it i'm one match i'm one match away from gold baby todd look i'm gold wow i mean i'm not gold yet you have to carry me this one as well okay todd you did so well and i think i'm starting to learn from you yeah i think so man maybe this time you won't die as much no no it doesn't matter if you die or stuff the one thing that matters in this game is finding the crater we only won because of a craver we need the craber and then we win yeah brad was just farming me my revives yeah i was trying to get my revived tracker up oh i'm a champion and i am your champion zynga baby hell yeah this is a terrible day oh i almost fell off and died that would have been not good that's interesting what that's a tactic guys so write it down in your little notebooks okay thanks predator man anytime any time i hear dragon you know what that means todd dragging my balls across your face oh oh damn he got he got played bam i'm gonna run there by myself though wait someone's doing a logo crafting oh right down there all right we'll kill that man then yeah

right now recharging my shield a trigger shot it's a right shot hardcore i hate horizons die why they are the faint of everything in this world i haven't done any damage yet guys i'm learning from you

in drone detected what does that one mean wasn't built in a day it was two true another one down oh my god i'm going crazy todd the predator teachings are so good it's like aussie osborne's train

times you have to shoot him to send him back what the hell uh revenant buff they have a thousand hp now at zombies you know i'm off it i don't believe that that is bollocks man you probably shouldn't believe that that gibby is uh one idiot good no it's max here's the normal skin oh no it's the next cosplayer what is actually happening right now that's a decoy no that's just time you shut up maybe think it was a decoy i was playing with caustic that's not how the caustic character works is that number one oh there's another one for this show he wants to get finished by you know he wants to get

get the best armor yeah it's true that's why you have no armor low low oh flesh low there's a difference between flesh and low low man that is definitely low i should have a tiny bit for 70 something

get some armor and stuff we take their most out so we didn't double most them that was the easy part that's gonna get harder from now on yeah i didn't think about that i was like that sucked that guy's gonna get easier now no unless we third party come on third parties boys can we use um arc stars and stuff yeah grenades fists and mozams it's the weapon that's changed we cannot use any other weapon okay no other guns we should have done this on april april fools it is april fool's oh yeah we get to do this again in like yeah like two months oh a month and a half two months two no hours time work all right how many how many points someone got one one good you open up with the normal mozam and finish him with the other one oh you know when they don't have armor we're gonna stay together where are you i'm coming i'm coming come on we need a third party all right as long as the stream is with me yeah i'm not gonna do anything guys i'll be honest you're the cavalry he's got yeah he's looting did todd grab the um grenades that's you want chad characters perfect like that no no the golden are the golden 301. i swear they had another teammate this way no they only had two no yeah he had a um no there he is oh stop shooting okay push this guy push this guy push this guy okay we gotta run we gotta run through die you trying to heal todd all right in the building then pickle boys pickle oh they're pickling over pickles rick god damn it this guy's almost dead where are these guys uh nearly there's many guys totally quest hell yeah oh my god is that another that's

doing brave and shaved it might just be someone even shave he's gonna try and push him somewhere i hope so i want to get more kill no you're not gonna get straight killed get him go todd grapple in there i don't have that ability i hate all horizons kill her yeah well done nicely all thanks to you oh what the heck somebody's just why are they still in this car is that behind us that's all the way over there jesus christ they hate us they hate mozambs oh we could craft more hammer point that would make us win yeah double like to have double hammer point to be honest instead of switching todd why haven't you healed come on this way oh man so many things so little time okay they're right there right there oh yep yes before he healed oh my god the damage that was insane we're using snipers legit i'll fall back he's just running to the zone hi very fast no you're the first character todd all right so there's that solo guy and probably a three men oh three squats what the heck i didn't realize there's only three squads that's king's canyon for you i don't know where the solo is going to go there he is i want to get a kill oh let's get the solo guy real quick now you cease us come back here go tell grapple smack him up oh i'm missing grenade good goodness how did i get bad i'm sorry that's all good i was so far away we're we could craft a hammer point before we get in the next fight the last fight quick true it's gonna run out of hammer points oh no it's out of stock god stop does all these dogs let's get distant since mozamb is a sniper okay no wait todd give me the gold backpack oh man if i get down i can hold all my grenades all right oh all right so they're close quarters where no me so they're long range and we're close quarters we're hit close gordon called

good thing i took that gold backpack yeah cause he rested todd you pops i'm one off one off dude damn oh man so close so close maybe next time that just shows mozam is the most op gun that's why they want you to start off with the mozam and then throw it away and realize oh why'd i lose the match oh it's cause you threw away the mozam you're silly if all of us are using the most exact same guy boom they're dead exactly no other gun does that no other gun well no and i am yet champion let's go gamers all right where do we go where is the nice craft no way it's right here oh first i'm gonna

boys no do not be afraid where's the last one that's another one behind me up there oh there's another team up there it's another game that's the last guy over there as well from that team oh jesus christ there's a blood following me through my golly we're gonna leave hello bloodhounds we're gonna leave this way true white hound's getting shot by another team i know i know this way we have to let todd die he wasn't even good anyway so it was my time it seems time to shine you've always got to make sure you use the most and big strategy in order to kill all the enemies in the video today here's the battery for you oh thank you should we fall back i think there's ah we send it right here wait did he revive oh oh they're healing as well yep now that they're running away kinda they're running let's just let's get todd he's really crucial to the game okay it's okay it's important that todd did that now we're not going to go ham we're going to slow down a bit and think about what we've done i'm going in i'm a freaking hero oh my true wait ti todd remember there's a zip line right here okay the car zip line there okay i'll take the car no take the zip it goes to the car straight away i probably have the gold helmet well you can it's an option for you no they looted it when they killed you oh really they're on the left too they're behind you get for the behind get behind guys got him i'm gonna run call out todd damn right right in the corner good luck oh god helmet thanks todd you're welcome oh wait i started looting guns oh i don't think you understand it's

right left left nice todd that wasn't me i don't care when have i ever cared that it was you or not you got another one hat you have the other guy that's pushing yes moses well done good job todd we're all working together as a team and all are probably doing equally as well as each other exactly i have no doubt in my mind all right there's a team that's going to be pushing from where we were no pressure oh wait there's a guy driving in a car oh what a good strategy those guys are still fighting outside the zone though yeah i want to go to the outside guys yeah i just don't know exactly where they are i don't think the car guy is like a full team i think it's just a song yeah he's car guy we'll deal with car guys yeah cause car guy is cool yeah car guy is cool he just wants to do some drifts oh yeah i know what they're doing yep that's what they're doing a respawn hey that's double respawn right behind you right behind you oh my god oh my god where'd this come from i have no clue calm down hey there they are ow man they're dead good job you gotta kill yeah wait i didn't get a kill right what about the other guy there's no other guy the ones that respawned oh yeah i have no clue where he yeah there i don't think they're really playing characters yeah snipe him oh don't get down below watch too slow i can't hit shots with this don't worry drew i was like what yep that was a solo god that's a three man as well jesus christ these are all top there do it do it now oh my god we're gonna be afraid of our car guy right now come on oh that could do well no oh that way they went through it yes get him beat him that guy's leave moving slow because of it i need the lifeline she's cracked fall back everyone there's so too hard to hurt run oh no if they're camping us

sorry oh now i'm missing thanks to you i cannot hit the bullet it's all right i've done 35 damage if that helps it doesn't oh 135 it's okay oh i'm behind them oh my god i felt like todd just then i missed every shot i felt like you is this what it's like to be like because i landed every shot okay hey presents i felt like you taught for once this is this is why you didn't like the anvil because you just didn't hit any shots well i'm good with snipers okay but why would i use an anvil when i can have a sniper a crater yeah a crater thought there's a creeper here okay if we can well if we get the crater we've won do you know that every time you pick up the crater you win i'm literally never lost with the crater and then if i have two craters double win oh it's nothing let's go come on todd come on my life just like okay i'm coming all right we're gonna lose though i hope you know this oh god all the squads are dying without you todd you gotta carry so hard with that anvil receivers your
