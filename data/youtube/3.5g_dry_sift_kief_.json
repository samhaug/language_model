{"MWiy7snq6nc": "good morning YouTube and happy 7/10 it is oil day 710 oil day so I'm going to do a pressing video I haven't done one in a while because I've been in a funk and I haven't really been wanting to press this is what we are pressing today this is the last not gonna haven't put in the bag yet I wanted you guys to see it this is prime wellness prime wellness PT star dog flour number 36 or pressing in hateth I pick this up the other day the stuff that you just saw it just this looks fantastic it is coming in at twenty three point nine eight eight th CA th c 0.608 so you know I am kind of excited about it this is gonna be a fairly quick video because like I said I've already got the rig heated up that already got the bag pretty much packed up I just got to put that last big butt in there you guys saw and then I'll get to or I've got the handy dandy scraper tool I've got the you know everything I need ready to go so we'll get right into it I'm doing two hundred I'm changing my temp going a little lower this time it's all packed in there pretty good so yeah I'm gonna do a little shopping today I don't know what I'm gonna get I have some things I'd like to get I'm not gonna jinx myself or anything because you know if I go up and in with high expectations I end up disappointed and I don't want to do that so I'm just gonna get some stuff today whatever our little present happy little present of that prime wellness PT star dog I'm excited alright we're gonna release that lever drop her down and get our handy dandy paper in there just stick our little happy present in there my little seven ten presents make myself a little oil yeah start getting her in there I'm gonna put a little bit of pressure on I'm gonna let that sit a second warm up Wow well yeah I hopefully everybody has a safe holiday no drinking and driving no drinking at all hopefully I don't drink I gave that up but yeah lots of flour lots of oil today today should be dabbed a dab a day and I definitely be dabbing pretty much all day when I'm not at work once I get done it's gonna be a dab time so I'm pretty excited about it there like that heat soak in a little but I'm just having a good week my tooth hasn't been bothered me too much I am going in for surgery on Tuesday so on my mouth so I may or may not be doing reviews the next week we'll see how I feel I can't really do a whole lot of vaping or smoking or that I don't want to get a dry socket but we'll see I don't see how I feel what happens how the surgery goes all right I'm gonna get her up to full pressure here oh yeah she's already starting to run all right we are there look she's starting to go already I think this stuff's gonna auto butter almost mmm very light color already this might alter auto butters my sugar up I'm not sure but I'm new I'm learning what I like it's a little more pressure so we'll see how this comes out I don't know what to expect for the yield I haven't pressed a whole lot of prime flour but I wanted to press this PT star dog at almost 24 percent THC a so you know it is what it is we'll see I do kind of wish I had a bigger press but I'm looking into it it will happen this fall it's just not the cards right this minute and this one does fine for right now nothing wrong with it it's just I want more capacity I ought to be able to do a quarter or more time now you can kind of see that peeking out there in between the paper that's got some nice color movie a little all those are here kind of see it in there it's really light but a second longer I still see some movement there's still a little squeaking out in there hopefully I don't get a blowout really is annoying I don't get too many book give it another few seconds and then I'll take it off I'm not gonna do a second pressing on it I'm gonna save the puck for some edibles that's just the way I like to do it so 15 more seconds then we'll drop her down and see what we ended up with all right let's see what we got we did sugar up automatically she can kind of see the ring up there yeah big ol ring so this is gonna be sugar great up like a shatter so it's gonna make a bit of a mess my take it off probably is what it is and that's all that it is okay so hopefully we get a fairly good looking good so far I'm actually surprised it's not doing a hole exploding off the paper it's actually little goofier the only thought which it's not a bad thing it's actually good I didn't want it to explode everywhere it's harder to gather makes a bit of a mess pisses me off just because I get aggravated my things are difficult sometimes I have a little patience issue sometimes my anxiety okay so that's what we got I'll see how much it weighs here all right so I zeroed out the scale with the paper as weight so all the weight we have is going to be medicine good or bad it is what it is [Music] okay folks my truth we have a point six so a point about 4.5 9.6 9.6 once we get everything off and so I mean I'm not upset about that at all it's a little lower than I would have liked but I mean that is some really pretty stuff I'm going to enjoy smoking that today yeah oh yeah you know I'm gonna enjoy that so I mean you saw it is what it is it's not the greatest yield but that is gonna be some good quality medicine without a doubt I'm pretty happy with it it's not what I would have louder seems like to seem closer to a point eight or a gram out of it but you know so we're looking at so I mean a seventeen percent yield roughly I mean I would like to see closer to twenty three twenty four percent but hey I'll take what I can get that was a gift from above for me I mean that's not too shabby so thank you all for watching along as I play with my press and I will be doing more in the future but I appreciate it thank you for watching subscribing liking commenting the setup will be a little different next time so you can actually see more of me while I do it as well and thanks for just tuning in as always keep on huffin and be well happy 7:10 folks", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "kJQX7pESJ7I": "[Music] did you know you could do up to seven gram extraction in a nut smasher mini we're gonna do a seven gram extraction in the nuts master mini right now stick with me what we're going to do is we recommend to three and a half gram use in terms of bags for the nug smasher mini you can use a seven gram bag you can put up to seven grams of material in the mini using a seven gram bag remember it's increasing your surface area so you're going to have less pressure on the product which will give you a lower yield in some cases and a better quality result so you want to make sure that you can you can go ahead and lean down on the thing when you're using a seven gram because you are increasing the surface area it makes sense and i'll show you the difference between the two the seven and the three gram bag so you guys can see what the difference is in size that's a three and a half gram bag this is a seven gram bag so you can see the difference in size okay now just because we call it a three and a half gram bag you can put up to four or five sometimes even six grams in this bag depending on the density of the material and get a good extraction same pressure same consistency and should get the same yield because it's holding the same surface area so the key is the surface area hold with the bag now to get the surface area you got to make sure that you're tucking the bag and and packing it bottle tech style so we got lots of instruction on this lots of videos but basically the long short of it is that you turn the two corners inside out like that and then you put the material on top so which the result is you get a round round puck at the end that's a surface area that we've pre-measured to give you the right surface area to give you a good extraction like i said though this machine was made for this surface area so you can give it some extra pressure um you're not going to ruin the product when you're using a seven gram bag on a nug smasher mini okay so what we have here is we have two uh bags of material three and a half grams of piece so they're two eighths from a well-known grower we'll dump it out on the deal and load the bad guys smells good if you want to put the material in as even as possible you don't want to let any air leave any airy gaps you don't want to smash the [ __ ] out of it you don't want to ruin and smash the trikes into the actual plant material you just want to fill the void so you're going to get a nice round extraction you know the key is when it's extracting that you get a cylindrical down motion it doesn't lean to the side so it collapses on top of itself right like a slinky that makes sense so two three and a half gram bags here we'll shove in the seven so make seven grams keep it easy and simple any big stems like that you want to snap off you don't have to be overly picky with the stems but anything big that's hanging out at the base snap off [Music] okay now that we have the bag somewhat packed you can see how the bottom of the bag looks see how the corners are tucked in you got a round puck shape if one isn't tucked in quite enough you think you want to tuck it in a little bit more you can definitely take your time and do that i like to make sure that at least the tips are touching or they're overlapped that really makes sure that the surface area is exact every time once you do that you can just wrap the bat at the top of the bag up like a present tuck one side in the other side over itself this side right in now if there's a lot of excess bag you can definitely trim the bag off as well our bags are double backstitched all the way down the side they're made to be trimmed and not unraveled so you can definitely do that if you feel the need once you got it folded up on the top you lower the plates to the size of the actual bag that'll help you hold the parchment and everything in you can slide your parchment paper in let's talk a little bit about parchment paper i like to use i do not have a magnet i like to use um kirkland brand parchment paper it's uh it's you get it from costco you can order it online you get on amazon all over the place get it at costco um for 10 or 15 bucks um it'll you can go through 40 pounds or so so it's almost a lifetime supply two rolls so that's my recommendation don't use sheet paper the reason is the rosin soaks into the paper and you end up with a bunch of paper and rosin and it's just a mess so i've had rosin in this paper for years it's been solid hasn't dissolved into it it's great paper so all i know is what i know and it's good value too so but once you put the bag in there you can just start coming down evenly and like i said you want to make sure directly downward extraction on it and that the bag is tucking in just like a slinky you guys can see that make sure our release knob's completely tight and take your time with this you want to make sure that the heat is normalized through all the material and then go ahead and apply your pressure and then throughout the extraction we'll go ahead and once the material starts to come out and displace itself from the plates we'll go ahead and apply more pressure [Music] from the point that full pressure is applied you want to wait about 90 to 120 seconds so you can go to google play or the app store download nugsmasher.com's app we got a [ __ ] and timer on there we also got some uh calculator tools for the pro and the xp very handy tools you also have um your tert files that shows all kinds of different recipes and different strains that people are extracting all around the world so a lot of information there check that out go ahead download the nugsmasher app so i think we're about 30 seconds in we're about 40 through this extraction you can see it's starting to starting to run now the flower that i put in here i've had this flower 90 days i want to say 60 days 60 to 90 days so it's old flower i've kept it in the envelope with a bavita pack in it i'll show you what that looks like i like to use 75 percenters in arizona where i'm at because it's dry here so i use 75 humidity boveda they work great you can get them anywhere if you can't find 75 search for it it's it works if you can't get 75 72 is good in a pinch but if you're in a moist area don't use that much go to 69s or something and once you wait the full full time we'll go ahead and release pressure once you got that going and you can see it there's not a big run here this is all buttered up of course and that's how you want it i don't want to show you you want quality to come out of this thing and a collection plate works really good if you don't have a collection plate something else is really cold that retains it a piece of granite something like that work out okay for you so i'm gonna say you got about two grams of raw maybe 1.8 1.9 i'll show you guys this which everybody likes so what i'm doing is i'm cooling the plates down the collection plate's just sucking the heat out of them i'm just touching the plate with the collection plate so it works both ways gonna pull right off yeah so that helps you cool your plate down a lot quicker you know if you're trying to do something you can flip it on for a second to see where it's at so it cooled it down 25 degrees so far 20 degrees so it'll keep going it'll suck it out quick so how you can get a nice rosin coin is this needs to be you need to cool your plates off to about 100 degrees get your fresh piece of parchment everybody always asks right how they make the nice coins so separate your rosin onto a nice piece of parchment let your plates cool down like i said uh right at about 100 degrees no more than 110.

guy and good quality things can come from homemade interactions for sure so the first thing is talk to somebody both strength and structural engineering kind of thing I mean this is a lot of power this is a 20 ton jack hooked up to an air compressor and this air compressor does 225 psi and you need a boat my good solid 150 to run this thing full capacity so you hear yourself any kind of jacker with some kind of air of a pneumatic jack however they called it I'm a complete amateur and know nothing to do with hydraulics or air install all this kind of stuff so I got some help with some friends that knew what they were doing and the first thing was these expensive rods remember what they cost to make their one hundred two hundred dollars apiece they do 60 tons of force they'll take each so about these big monsters and these big huge the knots in washers and I'll show you close up in a minute here but more importantly here I've got the plate really close to the jack area and you know everything is really tight so the force is really close to the middle and all the pressure you know the frame works really really really tight I've got a plate on the bottom plate on the top and a plate in the middle on the one in the middle here just right it's not a pretty I mean I've just drilled holes here you could put nice you know I'm sure there's ways you can make it slide smoother or not doing it binding so if it brings you laughs and what makes me laugh and stuff but I know the the product that comes out of it's amazing and if you've got good good product anybody can squish that even with the hairs so anyways getting back to the price here there was some things that I had to change about it I had to beef up the ball and beef up up here more when I started pleading that kind of pressure started having things flexing a bit so I'll show you what I mean let's go up a closer look okay there's my little setup here got myself a little I mean a nice as cheesy as it looks it works a hundred percent I've got my little big stuff double stitched up bags some fantastic sticky there you'll G ready to go I'm gonna pre-press this into a nice little puck that's my little little bit of blocks got my parchment already one nice clean piece of parchment feel my light and stuff and then of course this bad boy here's the doubling up I added the sticker plate right here really hole on both sides and here's those big crazy nuts and then here's what my ugly looking press looks like my Jack just sits in the middle here's where he's done some bowing you can tell so i beefed it up with that other plate and now it's fine so basically I've used some special insulating material I found that works amazing at stopping the heat transfer from my heated plates to eventually through the metal work eventually to the jack you don't want to join in the cylinder and there's seals and stuff in there and the oil will it'll event it'll wreck the jack so I being conscious of that and try to this material works pretty good I know when I leave it on for a long time all this gets really hot and warm and of course my my homemade ugly looking Chinese pits inside just bolted inside the boxes and then wired out by a guy at all and just run to a plug so simple as on I dial it in to huge here coercion of here by the way I need to know these are monsters they're really thick and they go the whole length to the core of the plate and both sides so that's my little setup here's my compressor and that's my little homemade lab got myself a little room that setup check this big bad boy wrench that I had to go by to build this thing so you buy those massive massive nuts and bolts or whatever for these huge one-inch hardened ready rod you're gonna need this monster I mean you want it homey this is how you do it I could pull 27 percent you got this wait sticky weed is the nice little puck that's all it takes I mean it's months later there is science to disability and shattering a lot of the other stuff and definitely four rows of this technique for sure it's a little bit of science don't forget your full okay so you get in case you get bronze and rivers my favorite routes and rivers okay the Falls boom boom boom damn it quick for you guys boom bro there's no but can't bring her first go magnet it's pretty straightforward get yourself a bend you're super hot these plates already balls in my hand putting it through there I know this looks a little bit good over your paper it's nice and flat it's placed in the right spot I all right so I'll let it cook for a minute and that's about it I mean I'm sorry if you didn't get a good view of that it was amusing me placing it in their book ski so I got it in there you said in just have another look at the press here so I'm just like you know walking it pumping it up with the pressure of the thing little handle and then like unlocking it to but release the pressure let it down so just get used to using the thing there's a tool that goes on that that's a really cheesy it was I can hear the rosin cooking the beginning in my rosin bag videos we can hear it cooking - you either love that song see ya Larry's starting to pull out a little bit if it's pulling out and not getting the bag wet like if it's coming too fast you can always just back off the pressure a little bit you got to find that sweet spot or pressure I find just to get the you know the big yield we're gonna try it this is on a half ounce trying to get a nice little yolk going okay I think it's just about ready to hit there let's try it this thing's super loud annoying so you can find another way to get the pumping stuff going or the the jack then you know Bobby we'd be way better just let it ooze out and when it stops moving that's when you're gonna wanna you can see it who's you know over there and it caught my little trap otherwise I'd be dripping over the sides which I've lost some before it's gonna be careful with that and there she is so I hope this helps I hope that you can make your own press I hope that it all works Oh sometimes it's safer just to buy your own stuff and do it yourself sometimes it's safer but yeah the agency Safety's key got yourself on on hot plates whether it be from the company or ones that you buy come together grab yourself some amazing amazing stuff check out oh so rosin guy hit me up I love bras and I love pressing we let's get", "B5_REnwB-Jc": "hey guys Billy from oz investigated 231 Graham drive safe squish for you on the squishy and if that thing in focus would just click the packet in

getting a pretty consistent flow slowly keep going I'm on a five inch by three inch by one inch aim steel plant so 300 40 probably have a heat cartridge over here in the Senate Samus Aran support starfish presses are made in Ashford Oregon well it looks like it's really starting slow ups I'm gonna pool just package and maybe give it another squish by itself again but there you go 31 grams of dry sit on the Swisher thanks for watching", "5SW8QcENmfU": "[Music] hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I was just actually going to clean up a little sift that John be brought by I've got it right here it's a quite a low quality I'm not sure what it is but it had all this hair in it so before I got it onto my screens I figured I was just gonna do a real quick cleaning out of the hair so I thought you guys might be interested in it so I'm gonna set the camera up so you can see a little bit better you're not gonna see my ugly mug but you're gonna see what my hands are doing and how we're working the sit through the screen to fall down on the catch and then hopefully be left with the hairs on top so let's get to it okay so generally what I would do in this situation is I would kind of gently let it rain down you can see it already leaving quite a bit of dust this is a very large screen so it's not a small screen and we can use the brush a little bit to kind of brush it through it's gonna contaminate the brush quite a bit but that's okay I am using in a really large amount of sift here I wouldn't normally do this but I thought it would kind of make a neat little video where we just watch all of this sift it works through the screen and eventually be left with just the hairs which is what should be happening here of course I've gone and I could have showed this same trick with a very small amount but it's not a bubble man rolls is it not lately maybe not ever [Music] nice pile falling through low quality though and see it's smoking drop a little bit there on the side not overly worried about the quality because it's very dirty needs to be cleaned quite a bit [Music] right that's some dark sift [Music] phoner the way geez get all this other good sift out of the way - we don't want that sort of contamination now do we be careful while sifting low quality sift around your high quality sift would that be brutal you go to take a nice rep of your 99% barb dry sift and you've got this absolutely swag a--let's contaminated it to think that someone considers this a final product this is almost not worth being a first product like a starting front you know it's almost not worth the starting point [Music] [Music] just salt and pepper shaking it you started seeing the little pieces the Little Falls here in the bottom that are not quite breaking up but if like press themselves mildly so we're gonna be left with a lot of those in the end here you see we're getting down to the to the Nitty now almost done as we get down lower it's the brush will even push it through faster when it's a big screen like this you can use the brush up here I'm gonna try to use the brush on the smaller screen you're gonna come into problems it's where the rigidness of the card and the flatness comes in handy imagine when they're making the Moroccan hash how much of this resin and small particulate is flying around in the rooms that they're in my nose is so itchy right now and it's funny because people often ask me if it's if it gets itchy and I'm usually it doesn't when it's high quality it doesn't at all it's more likely when everything's broken down to these smaller low-quality bits of plant matter that let you feel that a little bit of itch in the nose [Music] all right so we've run Oh a good solid I'd say 100 200 grams through this little colander as we get down lower it'll it'll make it even more difficult and you'll start seeing contaminants that would otherwise be in the hash not that I'd call this house just yet let's call this a mild cleaning Adi Haring of the farmers grade six farmers grain farmers grade nothing wrong with farmers grade that's what you start with you know maybe there's something wrong if you're putting it in your pile as your favorite thing but if you're starting with farmers grade that's nothing wrong with that all right so this is starting to you can't really see but it's feeling different under the brush now and it might look different on the camera as well what we've got now is we've got a collection of capitate stocks and cystal of hairs and you know I didn't think I'd be left with this much I thought it would be more like a small pile but it does feel like the majority of what we have here on top is a contamination usually the heavier heads will have fallen down right now it's not to say you know because it's a big screen I could still get a lot of this to fall through but it's not necessarily something we want to do so I'll take it down a little bit more see if I can clean it up a little bit more and then yeah it's pretty wild how the consistency has changed completely and left me with this just weird paper like material definitely different from the rest of the hash show you there so as you can see we've just got a real terrible quality of [ __ ] that we just took out of that hash and look how much we took out of it that's a fair bit all right well now that everything in my office is covered in resin I'm going to pick this up this was what I worked through the screen and it's still you know a terrible quality by playing most people's standards but much cleaner than it was before we started the project not about it sign that some of the resins sticking listen rice don't probably get to screening this over the next little bit but for now that was just a little tip on how you can remove this unwanted stuff from your hash I really hope you guys can see the quality of that and how it's not even hash at all it's a weird like substance that is not happening anyway thanks for watching bubble man's world let me talk to you soon [Music]", "06maWSlZQcM": "hey everyone Eric with pure pressure here just going to help you select which bags you want to use when your press and rosin got a couple different bags down here we have everything that allows you to press from Keith to bubble on the 36 micron end of the spectrum 70 to 90 and then the 115 s better for flour to get started got some gloves and get these ready so I've got our quick flip tool here anytime you're pressing with a bag you always want to turn it inside out so you have this easy little tool you just slide it right on the end here put it through and then press it down I'm going to press out the corners and the reason that you want to turn it inside out is that you don't you don't want any blowouts so now I've got my bag inside out my corners are all pressed I'm ready to go so today we're going to be pressing some Cinderella 99 cross with the white this is a great strain we really think it's going to yield quite a bit put that in my tray you have just about a quarter of an ounce here that we're going to pack up so we get a lot of people talking to us and they're asking should I grind this up before I put it in the bag how do I do that we don't actually recommend that you do because then you're getting trichomes that are in your grinder or wherever you're processing it I'm going to take these Nuggets and I'm going to put them straight in the bag and then break them up so take these put it right in start breaking this up with my hands so again not grinding before I'm putting it in the bag I'm kind of breaking it up with my hands in here already so one thing when you're packing these bags is that you really want to make sure that you don't have any big stems in there so if you're pressing some material that happens to have big prominent stems you're going to want to pick those out what you can see now is I'm actually just working this down to the bottom of the bag and I'm trying to fill it out and make it as even as possible so any gaps or spaces that you have in your bag that's where your oil is going to get trapped so is what I'm trying to do is I'm just breaking this up with my fingers filling it out making sure it's nice and even you could definitely fit more than a quarter ounce in one of these six inch bags and with the nine inch bags you can get just under an ounce its evened out so here we've got our bag it's just about ready to go now one thing that I'm going to do here is I'm going to put down and I'm going to put some pressure on it because you want to pack this as tight as it's going to go ahead of time so that when you actually start pressing all the oil has the right path to come right out of the bag got a little extra space here at the end so is what I'm going to do take a pair of scissors and cut off so I have just about an inch at the top there we go cool so I've got a little bit here at the top a little bit of space and then when we're ready to press is what you're going to want to go ahead and do is flip this over before you slide it in so you have a nice little envelope so here we go here is our bag it is ready to press so this is ready to go as soon as we're ready to press we'll go on over you", "vXxb6EQtu_0": "good evening folks my name is a nas worth and you got me here in Rosen Hearts labs yes this is Bessie here the 20-ton press and she creates the most delicious concentrated THC substance on planet earth at least in my opinion and I've been smoking since I was 17 years old tonight we're going to make some rosin the mysterious rosin that you've heard about and may be seen in the dispensaries and hopefully it tasted because it is worth going out of your way to find some and taste some what can tell you that's what got me started on this about six months ago and I'm a research analyst every possible thing I could find out about rosin I read every forum post for months then I was lucky enough to get in contact with two of the top four rosin makers in the state and was able to talk with them and the end result was this press here which is the best way to go really is to create your own press and the techniques that I'm going to show you which has been developed after literally about a hundred and thirteen presses that I have done an experimentation before I started came up with the method so what we're gonna do here is we're going to do something that almost seems absurd we're going to take 40,000 pounds of pressure and we're going to apply it to two grams above now this is a pre press two grams of a wonderful strain called LSD one of my favorites and I actually bought specific vices for pressing depressing and didn't really like any of them and actually have ended up using a 15 pound tortilla press which is worked out ideally for me and because for me the ideal is 2 grams and as close to a circular formation as you can get and that's really easy to do you don't even really need to press if the butt is sticky you can push it together yourself two grams you're gonna put it on some nice clean silicon coated parchment paper if you start doing this please do your research on parchment paper you do not want to use Reynolds Wrap or most of the papers out there because they don't use silicon anymore they they use something that's actually made out of chrome called quite long used to be in the bread business know a whole lot about the materials that are used in baking and cooking etc which essentially what we're doing is cooking here this appears the controlling unit this is a digitally controlled unit that it sends information to the heaters these heaters extend across these three by five plates there's a heater for the top and a heater for a bottom plate and this top plate is mounted directly to this 40,000 pound press so we try to get this in the center of the sheet here even though this is showing 226 degrees that's not the actual temperature the actual temperature I measure with thermometers that I keep here right between the plates or just about 200 degrees so without further ado and at that point I start the timer because probably have about maybe a couple of hundred pounds of pressure actually here because a little resistance here is leveraged tremendously in a press like this so after about thirty seconds we're going to apply a lot more pressure than a full pressure this Jack I'm using is both manual and powered by hydraulics depending on the need and I only use hydraulics later in the procedure as you'll see so we've done 30 seconds in preheat now we do about two full strokes on this particular press but I'm doing I've measured this before we're raising the pressure up to about eight hundred pounds per square inch maybe six hundred eight hundred I've gotten different readings and we wait about 20 25 seconds okay folks we bring down the hammer I mean by hydraulic press cuz we're actually going to put full pressure and there you go so right now but it's not really that much because we've got a three by five plate so that's all divided up by that 15 square inches so what you really have is about twenty-four twenty-five hundred pounds per square inch and that's assuming that this puts out the full 20 tons which it may or may not but in any case I have found applying the hammer at the end of the procedure increases my output quite a bit all of this Dirk stuff see how big that boat is spread those buds have spread into and all of the Starks cut around the bud if you can see it is rosin and remember we only started out with two grams so the next step in the process is to put this stuff in the freezer which I'm going to do now and I want to thank you for watching happy smoking", "oHESHakS0uo": "[Music] all right what's up everybody welcome welcome welcome we're going to do a uh three and a half gram extraction on the nug smasher mini um i'm gonna walk you through a whole extraction we got a eight tier of wi-fi cake b so that's what we're uh we're extracting today now next master mini um there's uh we nutsmaster makes several different uh three and a half gram bags 120 or excuse me 90 micron uh 120 micron 160 micron and then we also make a 37 micron it's really good for bubble and whatnot so or uh so anyway really find one um today we're going to use a 90 micron uh for the flower um let's actually get it out and look at it so we got our scale zeroed here so we got right at three and a half grams we're gonna pack that in a uh like i said a 90 micron uh three and a half gram bag and we're going to do that bottle tech style so to do that we take the bags and we invert the bottom corners and the reason that we do that is so that the surface area that we're extracting uh meets the pressure that we're applying with the mini so you get a consistent result each and every time so like i said invert the bottom corners just like that just push them inside out so the bag looks like that and then after you do that you can start moving your flower in which this looks really nice try to keep the buds as big as i can when i'm packing a bag i don't want to um i don't want to smash the uh the trikes down into the plant material i want to go ahead and place it real nice and neat in there and kind of fill the voids i want to remove any big stems anything that might tear the bag obviously [Music] once i get an even base i'll just push down on the flaps a little bit not much but just to settle everything down the whole um goal here is so that i have a cylinder that stands up straight and that i can extract it smashing it down an accordion-like effect bigger stem than i like to see in there so if you want to make your own solventless dabs this is the very best way to do it easiest way if you're not a grower you just want to go get down and get some flour and get a machine and make your own stuff so you know it you know it's there and it's ready available this is it a lot of dust left on that [Music] okay so once we got our bag all packed bottle textile [Music] we have an excess we're going to go ahead and cut the excess off so we're not left with extra bag and one of the keys to the nug smasher bags is they're double backstitched so they're not going to unravel and you're going to have blowouts when you do cut them off like that so then once you cut it off you go ahead and fold it in like a little present just the four sides in on the top like that we'll stand it up right and then keep in mind your last flap that wants to be the one going in so it doesn't stick out it holds your shape so that's that's a key then you're gonna lower the plates so that they're about the height of the bag there go ahead and place your bag right in the center of the plates there magnet comes in handy nug smasher magnet they will come in real handy to hold your parchment together and then at that point you see how the bag's coming together with that accordion like effect you just want to make sure that it's coming down cylindrical right on top of itself if it's not stop readjust loosen it lower it readjust it and then move forward with your extraction now's the time so nutsmasher mini is if you just apply nice even pressure on it you're going to start getting a real nice extraction coming out of your flower so as as you do have rosin come out and materials displaced off the plate you will have to have to add more pressure because it's losing material and you want to do this and keep even pressure applied for about 90 seconds [Music] [Applause] [Music] temperature also can have a lot to do with it um be careful on the temp as you get higher higher in temp the material will get darker but too much pressure will make your material darker a lot quicker than higher temp so too much pressure is the number one cause of the bat extraction looks like that's coming out nice and butter you can see how thick it is there it's not really running so that'll tell me that i could raise the temp um three or four degrees on the next extraction of this strain i could see uh if i get a little better yield out of it but it's really coming out kind of like i like it butter [Music] all right after you get about 90 to 120 seconds on there you can lower the plate bring it on out and let's see what our results look like wow so you can see this is a complete butter extraction we'll have to weigh it out to see what the yield is here but you can see how the extraction came right around so it's uh it's really at the lowest temp that we could really do this extraction real close to maybe we could lower it another two or three degrees now if we would have raised it another four or five degrees you'd have got more run you got a little bit more yield out of this so probably two or three more percent so let's weigh this out and see what kind of yield we actually got here's our paper that we're going to put it on we'll zero that out we'll start collecting this up here wow a lot nicer yield than it looks [Music] see how thick that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] there you go guys nut smasher mini so if you want to make your own solventless um rosin solventless dabs this is the absolute perfect unit for you and the key is the surface area so if you buy a three and a half gram bags stick eight in it every time i mean in this case you got a gram back off an eighth so that's a good yield um but usually yields are anywhere on a real low side to 12 15 on a high side up to 30 or so so anyhow if you want to make your own uh fire dabs this is a way to do it and it's clean solventless and very stone thanks for joining [Music] so you", "-rgKchRQyEI": "[Music] so guys this is about a gram and a half of rosin that was extracted yesterday flower rosin it was extracted from seven grams i got about two back out we've dabbed about half you know half a gram so it's about a gram and a half of rosin you can see it's buttered there's a butter effect to it which just means a lot of the oxygen come out of it you can see it's a solid more butter effect we're going to turn that into uh thc a so basically what we're going to do slide it into a 37 micron uh smasher bag and we slip it in the bottom like that just fold it over like this so that has a double fold on it it's going to be facing out away from the crease of the parchment put the parchment in we're going to fold it directly around the bag leaving the escape at the front okay now we're going to put it in the press our target psi is going to be 300. [Music] our surface area is going to be the size of a three and a half gram bag i'll leave it real quick and our temperature is going to be 108 time set is 90 seconds stick that in there like that and again the open side out i'm gonna try to keep just over 300 on it for the 90 seconds and once we complete that we're going to go up in temperature and do it again [Music] okay now that that's happened we're gonna go up on the temperature not the time go by 10 or so and then we're going to come back to our pressure let it climb the temp [Music] start [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so at this point we'll just take this out of this all the sauce stick it in another looks like it's working pretty good clean that up a little bit [Music] [Music] [Music] just cleaning it up as we go hotter and hotter we're just getting all the sauce [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right let's continue to clean it up almost there i must take it sideways towards the end when it's all isolated like that and i'm gonna stick it in flat so it can run out from all sides so as i start the temp i do this [Music] start to turn white in there [Music] [Music] okay so let's let it cool for a sec and then we'll see what's inside okay i would normally go up to about 230 degrees to get it cleaner i'm just in lifetime like i said if you went to hotter temp you're not going to have this issue at all because sauce will be out of the bag completely i'll just be left with the powder but it also will diminish some of the return too we have this all open there's nothing in this part so we're going to go ahead and cut it off so it makes it easier to work with can you see all the thca chips in there what you're left with in the bag is this and the hotter it gets the more sauce you'll take out of it so the more brittle it'll be and dry but it's separate just peels off the bag real easy usually in big flakes if you let it sit for a little bit it's easier to take off what i usually do is pour it in a jar when i'm all when's all said and done and we'll we'll go ahead and do that to see what we got back but it looks like we got three quarters of a gram back or something maybe a little more and if you get stuck in the micron you can just rub that micro on itself [Music] [Music] hca you", "PVduzr1U1uU": "it's my chief and I'm working on this is from harvest all cute I got that using there's trim bins and now I'm gonna empty out and I just very lightly did it I thought of that first means literally I just ship it piece of weed all right no it's out of the first stop been suitably get a second bin I'll be doing this all day good that's why it's such a necessity to really you're a connoisseur cannabis you really like to make your joints super strong", "1zX3Phr33V8": "[Music] hi welcome to Bucks how to wear this week we're going to show you and we do every week how to do something so this week we get a letter that's right letters folks that's right letters you get letters folks this is people station or paranoid oh this week's letter comes to us from sister McGavin ease she writes puck I've been growing with the other sisters for years but we've always thrown away I feel so wasteful well waste not want not I always say I think I found your Savior ladies because my buddy Mike is gonna show you how to turn your lead into Keith's take it away Mike thanks buck and great question sister what you want to do with your trim is you want to take all your trim and you want to turn it into Keith and there's a lot of ways to make Keith and hash with them easiest way I found is with dry ice a bucket and these great bubble hash bags so of course we need our trim and I dried this trim out but you can use wet trim do to trim it red the day that day you could get it into these buckets and start making Keith so you don't have to dry it out but I have this it have this around so I have sixty eight grams dry two point four ounces dry of trip so the first thing you want to do is you want to put on your rubber gloves because you are handling dry ice and that stuff burns so make sure safety first it is always care about here bucks how to I met buck in Vietnam we were trimming the first thing I do is and I broke up all I did is I broke up some dry ice you want to create break up it's a small pieces created a surface area and I have two bags here I have a hundred and twenty micrometers and I have one and 60 mikanos we're gonna start with a smaller one so first I gonna do is gonna dump all of our dry ice into the bucket with the dry ice what happened scientifically is the dry ice is super cold what it does is freeze off the trichomes and it breaks them off and since you know the trichomes THC is not water-soluble you don't lose any in here we're gonna do is I'm gonna put the smaller bubble hash bag on that is our 120 and then I'm gonna use my 120 micrometer bubble hash bag we're gonna put it on first we're gonna now put on our bubble hash bag shakes and then I'm gonna put on a little clock a letter about 5 10 minutes you know it's your first time maybe want to go a little 10 minutes let it you know let all everything freeze up in there nice and cold leave in five minutes maybe now you want to smoke a doobie drink a beer remember don't get too messed up cause you still the fun stuff is still coming so I'm gonna go back to buck well there it is that simple all you need is leaf and dry ice and a bucket some bags you're there Mike let's show them the next step good one but while we were waiting for everything to get nice and cold I set out this little cardboard I got this at Target it was five bucks coz this woman Elaine all of our Keith down it's a nice material something that's kind of that's not gonna stick to you don't want your keep sticking so this is where I'm gonna put my 120 micrometer 's and this is where I'm gonna put my hundred sixty micrometer you want to separate them so Kay the finer the finer of the holes the better that keep the better the quality that keeps so people really want 120 160 maybe you cook with it whatever some people will just do it all together whatever your choice is but let's see our next step is it's been about five minutes what are we gonna do now is when it up flip everything into our bag and you want to hold right there because you don't want this falling off not yet so then I'm gonna take it all off and now everything is inside of our bubble hash bag and here's the fun remember those shake weights this is a better workout than shake weight here we go and who said all those years at fat camp was which one or the shake weight right who the [ __ ] needs a shake weight shape on you like you can't be here for coming so you could start see I'm gonna pull back a second right there the Keith has already started collecting there and that's just 30 seconds of shaking and you can do a ton of the ton of things of that you can smoke it you could cook with it you can make hash with it you take a step further make some oil with it that is why folks cannabis is the most versatile plant on the planet all right so I'm gonna put this take our bucket we're gonna dump this back into the bucket into the bucket hey let me get a good close over there and you can see like nicely all that and all that smoke is actually co2 like see like all that broken up nice and broken up there next thing we're gonna do is you want to collect this now you can smell you smell that camera guy he's already stoned smells like heaven [Applause] all right so we want to collect it we're gonna put it right into here separate it from and this is real time folks there's no camera tricks here you saw how I put it right into the bucket from the time I put it into the bucket [ __ ] shook it up got it onto the table this is ready to go look at how green that is look how nice and [ __ ] that is the trick is I leave it out 24 hours why I know there's not supposed to be any moisture left but always some moisture gets in so I leave it out somewhere in the dark you'll put it in a kitchen cabinet somewhere 24 hours let all the moisture get out of there but there you have some pure Keith so what do you think of that sister huh you did a lot of fun nights at the nunnery with this stuff but we're not done yet because I still gonna use the 160 micrometer bag and you're gonna see how much more of this good stuff we're gonna get but I'm sending it back to buck well the Lord provides sisters because we're not finished that was the first bag now we're gonna drop on the 160 we're going to see what we get out of that all right let's do it Mike thanks buddy so we're back and I promise we're gonna make more keep so we just finished our 120 micrometer 's I'm gonna use our second container and we'll fill it up with 160 micrometers you put the bag on I'm doing we did last time Lippitt into 160 micrometer bag set it off to the side and I'm gonna do exactly what we just did same thing three to five minutes Jake wait you see him he's like right by his face he loves it he loves it more that there's a bag slapping his hand some people cook with this people could smoke with it's fine you can make hash with it you can make the oil with it whatever you like so three or five minutes shake shake shake shake shake when you start to see more frost coming down than the green stuff you're close to being done you probably should look out as much of those crystals as you can and don't worry about the frost is again the great thing about using dry ice it goes from solid to gas there really is no liquid form now remember sister you got a whole nunnery to help you shake so you don't have to do this alone so then we're gonna collect all the keys and remember this is our second batch just to remind you I'm gonna grab the first batch we made before the break look at all that good stuff right there if you have more trim get more dry ice less trim less dry ice use gloves the stuff burns it could hurt you [ __ ] I got you a gift buddy hope you enjoy and sisters I hope this answered your question thanks for having me on but all right there you have it ladies in there your tune in next week to another bucks how to wear someone else will show you how to do something Oscar said [ __ ] it he's out of here that's it Mike showed us how to turn our leaf in the kief thanks Mike thanks Mike he didn't give you the other one all right to the moon Alice [Music]", "ILN3yhlezYg": "[Music] uh [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music]

sorry that i have been m.i.a for a little all right so during quarantine i ended up you know like everybody else wanting to grow all my own plants so i hopped off at the bend and i grew a bunch of weed plants i mean not actually a bunch i mean six which was decent enough for me i did all right and then one of my neighbors ended up giving me seriously almost a pound worth of trim and just like popcorn nugs that he didn't have the patience for so i was like oh my gosh like this would be great to have a rosin press with and going into this new pandemic epic oh [ __ ] [Music] um i just figured okay it's about time i start messing with the rosin press so i ended up ordering the rosin press and that day my neighbor a different neighbor an old lady told me she needed help identifying a plant came over and she had a massive marijuana plant she had to have given me three four pounds of weed i mean i have so much right now that i didn't even weigh it i just like got it all in about gallon bags and put it in my freezer so i also ordered ice water hash bags and ice water extraction machine so if you have not subscribed already please go ahead hit that [ __ ] subscribe button hit that

so excited right now all right guys stay tuned hit that like button subscribe and i'll see you soon", "YJyJ3VMEdLI": "what's up guys we're sending the smash lab right now we have to nug smasher minis here our old nugs measure mini and our newly refined next measure mini we're gonna go over the changes and improvements we made to the newly refined mini as well as walk you through a smash we have 3.5 grams of a GoSee dose flour here this looks like really good stuff we're gonna do that in a 160 micron bag 3.5 and see what kind of yield we get but first let's talk about the difference between these two units so we recently purchased a new fiber laser and bender machine which has allowed us to further refine the nug smasher product line today we're gonna focus on the notes master mini looking at the mini you're gonna see the new fit and finish we've been able to implement precise tabbing that allows us to rely less on bulky welds it also gives it a much cleaner look our new release valve has a safety feature that prevents the knob from opening too far and causing leaks one more thing we've done is move the on/off switch to the back of the machine and even made the power cord removable for easier travel so you guys been asking for a lot more informative videos lately you guys like when you have we walk you through the entire press how we do things a couple of our techniques so we'll go ahead and try to give you a little bit more information on this like I said the new on/off switch is now on the back to turn that on and doing this go see those flower we're gonna do around that out of two hundred five degrees mark that we traditionally do so it's already set while that's heating up when we take this uh flower dozy doats like I said and it's been sitting in a Boveda pack for about a week now if you don't use those you might want to try it out it mu stands up your flower and it ends up giving us about a percent to two yield higher than it would have if we had left it dry so we traditionally use these a lot pull that out we'll get this scale down our scales are the zero all right so we have about 3.6 the bud looks really good really frosty and we're gonna be using a 3 point 5 gram 160 micron bag the 160 micron bag is the micron size that we use for our freshest most Moines flowers so that's the one we're going to use okay so we'll take our 160 micron bag and we're gonna pack it a bottle textile like we usually do pressing flour first step we're gonna invert the bottom corners the 3 point 5 gram bag is the hardest to do this with it's just a little bit harder to mold around but you got your dad tool for that so get the quarters inverted okay so for those of you that haven't seen this packed ball textile or still aren't really sure how we go ahead and I include the link of the description and a link on the video for a full in depth how to on packing politics style for those of you that are pretty familiar my corners are inverted next thing we're gonna do is just go ahead and add your flour you [Music] all right so we have our bag packed next thing we're gonna do is just wait till this gets the 206 we're gonna add our parchment and go ahead and start pressing so our plates are not heated up we're gonna go ahead and turn the release valve lower the plates and insert our Kirkland brand parchment paper [Music] we have our handy-dandy Doug Smasher magnet right here go ahead and start gradually bringing the plates together so with the minute you're gonna want to get a whole standing arm pressure on it and we're probably going to do this for about 110 seconds once we apply for pressure [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right it's been about 110 seconds you can see we have some fresh dab sitting there amazing working color and consistency to pull that out and it looks great [Music] [Music] okay great looking press here's our bag you can see it has that a surface area that you were going with a mini the same that would happen with a 1 gram nug without a bag but yeah this is how you want it to look when you're done you can see why you might have less yield if the bag and look into form then it doesn't have the surface area it's because you didn't get everything out of it because of the way you pack the bag look well put that to the side and we'll use that for a later date to make some different oils and jell-o's and stuff like that you guys have been enjoying for now I'm gonna go ahead and collect this up [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so here's what we got nice easy collection really great ending product our scale zero Dow see I kind of yield we're working with okay so about nineteen percent yield decent yield a important thing though is that it's really high quality stuff we really like the way this looks the color the consistency we're gonna go ahead and try those dabs out see how they taste thanks for joining us hope you enjoyed this video let us know what you think and we'll see you

some rosin so what I have is I have some bud right here so that's that's actually blue dream and then right here I got this little piece of Rick Simpson oil beef hash that I made myself so those are gonna be what we press today this is a Revlon piece of crap $10 hair straightener the box said that the high setting was 400 so it's pretty much what I needed so that's that's what I'm using figured if it breaks 10 bucks who cares so fresh clean sheet of parchment paper I give it a fold right down the middle okay now throughout this talking I'm pretty sure my hair straightener is pretty good and hot probably about ready to use let me grab one more thing so it's also good to try to keep some coffee filters around if you're gonna do that so I just use the standard old mr. coffee coffee filters but we'll get to that in a minute so to start with I'm gonna take the bud and I'm just gonna set it in the full nice and comfortably most of that is gonna get pressed together all right clear and evident what I'm trying to press I'm just gonna put it in there give it a little squeeze not much to start with all right so it hasn't produced anything so we're not quite hot enough yet not a few seconds so we'll be ready to go all right let's see what happens now we're doing a full-on press so want to the partial press kind of just a test to make sure the hot enough but the full-on press you really want to kind of lay them - all right you hear it sizzle once you hear it sizzle back off now I'm gonna pull the pot out for a second it's kind of flat but what we have here those black spots those dab wax spots okay I don't know if I got them in camera or not because I'm on the wrong side but now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the same but I move it a little bit to a clean spot off some more fresh clean dead wax so that's gonna be what you want to do to press your rosin from pot so I'm going to get a fresh clean piece of parchment paper for the hash because it's a whole nother experience altogether now hash is made at a Keith so if you try to press it it's gonna fall apart pretty much what you expect okay so that's why we're using the coffee filter what we're gonna do is we're gonna press the wax through the filter alright so I'm gonna make sure that gets in the fold and then I'm gonna leave a little space again for the wax to have a place to go alright so just like a quarter of an inch between that fold between the hole for the coffee filter and the bolt for the parts of the paper press alright so the first one should flatten it out what you're gonna get some wax pretty quickly alright alright now when you're doing wax or when you're doing hash you get it a massive conversion to wax alright so you see what we got there that's a lot just from one press alright and this thing will just keep pressing and pressing so the coffee filter is keeping all of the contaminants out of the wax something to give it a good couple presses it's not even gonna be enough really I can still keep pressing this after this video is done but it will see you'll be able to see a good bit of what I'm getting out of this so there it's all wax I'm ready for the smoking so you just scrape it off with a blade and you're ready to go put it on something and you're good", "zYlGYKsDUls": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]",

part of the great Alaskan Northland this strain has been known as Matanuska Thunder F word but sagar martha decided to use the more prudent tundra as the alaskan word for grassland tundra makes this varieties name perfectly descriptive so there you go a very stable breeding and crossing strain and I'm telling you this strain is strong what's up smokey how you doing homie you I've ever come across her before what's unique about Matanuska tundra is even after 60 days of flower you'll often fly it you'll often find a large number of the Matanuska hares to still be the pistils will still be pure

you can't screw up a crop unless you over fertilize which I highly recommend you don't do that plant doesn't need much fertilizer in Afghani they don't need much less is more please guys remember less is more when you're growing please it's your health you'll have a hard time getting that fertilizer out of your plants for me try it whenever you're fertilizing it take app your crop take 1 take 2 take 3 and waton and fertilize at half the nutrients how do you do that you take one five-gallon pail with the set amount of nutrients that you water and you take a and you Newt make sure it's nutrient water in that five-gallon at your dosage you take up a five-gallon pail of fresh purified water and you mix that half-and-half back and forth so you have ten gallons at a half of your dose and it's that easy mix it through your plants your plants will thank me your buds will be bigger they'll be purple they'll be crystal ear they'll be that it won't be green they'll be yellow orange red

they produce some really nice shatters I've been taking a lot of pictures of their flowers lately we got some of their gorilla glue and they're premium Jack both our fog link or gist I got to be honest that there there's some prime examples of what those strains can be well I think the premium jack is actually just separate it's like their own cut of Jack Herer I don't think it's actually like a cross bred thing it's just Jack Herer so anyway this little sample I have is gelato it's a new strain by them coming in at a three point eight one percent total cannabinoids it's not bad it's pretty good all their shadows look really good very very stable with the exception of the the white buffalo OG which is like their quote-unquote elusive indica it's actually got really low cannabinoids when I got to look at it and see it but it is I for sure want to pick it up because it's more pull and snappy if you guys know me you know that's kind of what I'd prefer over a glass I feel like the glass just goes everywhere so this sample um it should be like 0.25 maybe it's a point three I don't my scales on the other side of the room I would weigh it out but I don't care I mean we just we just did that whole [ __ ] drowning a big video I don't you know I got nothing to prove I'm cool I'm cool off completely wasting well for me so let's just take this in one big fat dad yeah shall we look at that oh look how pretty that is it's so beautiful yeah so it smells like gelato it's not bad it's not bad I'm usually not a big fan of gelato except except for of course Juno Juno is kind of gelato related gelato how the [ __ ] you say correctly I don't know I don't yeah I don't I just don't know the specific details there it'll need that if my homie actor that says no family [ __ ] that Juno is fire I'm always a little a few inch long there do you notice some heat super nice pacing so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this big hit let me know if you take long with me yeah at the second I got this sample I'm like Lulu I know what I'm doing with this taking it one fat rich huh you know [ __ ] let's just see what's that I'm gonna have a good day determine to have a good day I'm doing front desk tonight and that is like my least favorite thing to do with the club thankfully I don't like hardly ever have to do it I just find it super boring I'd rather be helping patients talking about medicine and stuff like that I love doing that I can I can do that all day the most part I get to do it all day so my life is pretty sweet right now Cheers yeah not as good as the Juno refire though oh yeah I have to say pretty [ __ ] fire um so the rep also said they may be coming out with some strawberry banana would you be really [ __ ] cool to see from them I think they probably do a great job with that especially I'd love to see the flowers well man huh yeah but I'll be sure to check on Instagram dad demon vory for all those pictures again this is just a little informal video just a little short session down kind of let you guys know hey I'm still here I know huh I did that drowning with a pig and they're just gonna we're just kind of chilling for a second but um yeah I hope you guys enjoyed that video that was all for fun that was like I know it's super wasteful but sort of I all of the waste I really did not like that slab that was some super low grade trimmer I still got like another 5 grams left of that [ __ ] anyway I'm gonna go finish getting ready for work let's [ __ ] I know only two dads but like I said in session all day now that's a pretty

the flower without feeding it flower nutrients it was my color like my mistake some [ __ ] stupid reasons yes don't know why it's not important so they'd really weren't getting what they're supposed to get now judging from what I did do and what I see oh god I'm so anxious to grow it again and do it right you know saying and see what comes out yeah I did have a bunch of strains that were 5 tailings and I'm not I'm not sure yet what it quite what it could be you know I'm saying I did with that new a blacks in there and everywhere that everything that was under the a black spot stays ok but like super bright it's super super powerful but yeah these are definitely slick the duck foot brothers work in progress but I'm happy with what I'm seeing so far I'm really happy because anybody has got seeds of this [ __ ] man they're gonna be like holy [ __ ] so exercise it's exciting those gummies kick ass they do kick ass the baozi from last night but uh it's exciting to create something

look at my sub count and thinking I'm some master [ __ ] grower for people it's not it's not how I put work to get where at what I got I don't saying we got no one got that hound and bring him here a baggage oh yeah yeah Mike to take it to the bed and then do it it's [ __ ] up too because you know I'll I know of that like an actually dr. bet I think you totally do for me his [ __ ] sick [ __ ] used to send me pictures searching Bulldogs [ __ ] yeah oh no no no I didn't look it's all sitting on these racks right here it's been sitting here all day okay I started and another thing is they keep coming out with all these [ __ ] things don't be hurt call me I mean I can see small tubes yes love my mites do you like your readwrite light no are not generally it's dry already I tried to let it dry in the darkness I don't have a [ __ ] dry room right now I had tents and stuff like that but I'm not using that you know I will probably be setting up my [ __ ] [ __ ] out there though for those summers harvest to see me last week what meaning you definitely using promix HP and publicly and I'm mixing love and then I amend it with dry amendments being edgy could talk the small troops I have no idea to do so he's keeps nasally very plain John Buchan great score forgotten here I got one a couple boxes made and they were all filled so I put them on these racks and some of my closet yeah I got some boxes made I don't have anything set like permanently sent like this is where I Drive you know I'm saying I'm trying all different kinds of ways or manners to really differ I'm still learning up here I'm from Ohio i'm still learning up where you think well after one row you and know how to do it no new chip came up there Tommy your changes like right now it's June it's supposed to be one being it's [ __ ] it's the humidity is high and it's [ __ ] marks you know what I'm saying so [ __ ] Miami differentiation like Princeton this [ __ ] was dry the other day and now it's starting to get a little moist it's out there in the wetness yeah I'll do my organization sucks right now bro sucks balls sucks balls keep being my brother Tribeca crossing with the last parents across for the walk yeah I always try using through these cats as [ __ ] yeah it works great it's actually going to eat twisters and eggs mixed with bunnies oh yeah do you really like it's not like it's hot humid it's just most humans [ __ ] stupid man like you had a humanity I got a humidifier going to fire my walk in there were six and seven percent men that [ __ ] said on 30 I'm like how I'm like how what the [ __ ] right no and that's what I'm gonna try next game going indoor man for sure the h0 and a new rice and the cereal was perfect just science is there it's in the stringent right it takes the moisture out and makes it nice and rock-hard right but the sugar content to fine particles that's one thing you gotta try to avoid tripping knives and stuff like that it was minor stuff in there but easily shakes all out and stuff like that wasn't like it was powered all up in your like the bottom of a cereal bag gets all from me it wasn't like that but definitely agree that food product like that was probably not tested that's not probably what's the best thing so right definitely my next thing I'm also I've been trying to brainstorm and look up different things that could mimic that but is a natural thing like piece of plastic or like clay pellets you know something like that that would be the same thing I'm not sure yet though so I agree it's my afraid to throw the following okay yeah what great food yes I think meaning in the Wow rub with every plant you got yeah oh it's might work too but that's the thing right there same with the cereal so if your weeds were a wet right and say it it takes in that moisture think about soggy cereal rice and filling thing like the soggy O's mold sets in you know what I mean that's one thing that's I freaked the [ __ ] out about mold dude but I can't do it man if it gets in my nose or my mom's like you don't [ __ ] hit current in you know I might not do trevorrose take that your family's needs and confident all foods so guy can't kick the [ __ ] so I try to always look for eradicated and she like them any time you try to go with how it go without it I got a lot of whole bunch of fans for that room everything else I saw was 67 I was like no no [ __ ] we got done at 37 now but man I mean roll is going yet the new grows bro yeah I'm gonna go the whole canons fast with no smoking no smoking black mouse by the time I come back so it's a sir they as Friday said it's Sunday it's three days I want to come back on Monday should be smoke-free we think we should be good we got a vape pen we're gonna try and learn try that's rising in the micro screen that's exactly what I was thinking for like the rice even putting it in like those things that they squish with you know this thing's a [ __ ] Nathan dads and stuff with those little bags so they find a big-ass mother [ __ ] munch throw are you reading like lay it in it's one layer not layered up in one layer in that bag that's where the American interior can I put your other bag in there yeah it's kind of like what I do with the green crap but in bands that was the only thing I would totally do differently for doing it anything rice cereal oatmeal whatever you know Bruce are lots of thin roots I think now here's here's the thing if you look this up okay on the thinner roots it's actually those micro fine hairs that actually will take in your fine particulates and your your ready-made [ __ ] nutrients and stop those rags from your fevers and stuff so when the roots get real thick and longer those are good to me those are highways it's all the little fine hairs that are doing all the work you know the big fat ones are just highways so when you see it like that you'll see the big fat ones can that just telogen your root system is well established so that way at the bottom you got tons of those drug dealers now if you get rewritings or groupings or fungus gnats those three things destroy those little feelers those little fine fine little hairs that eat everything on the roots once they eat all that that's when you punch plants are seven problems you can have all those big highways you want to have bigger stuff water consolidate you they're sucking water they're not feeding anything you can imagine like like at the end of your roots you got all these little paintings going and then sucking up the long arms you know exchanger keepers plan she gotta be guys baby bro wait what's up what's up the chick folks what's up can't say your name but I don't use great white or anything like that got no fat ones you will oh yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure we all we all watch the videos you know we all Google stuff and figure out what our questions are to answer and stuff like that so I'm getting my knowledge from you know all the other stuff these you know but once you actually see once your roommates guess my biggest things out you get root rot you [ __ ] up you know saying your fungus Nestle's normal if you get Ruth F is that your worst [ __ ] ever now when you have brood aphids that really do damage and you pour your [ __ ] out and you see that there is nothing left except for those Springs and you realize why you playing struggling you're like oh yeah I've never used great white unlike that yes what that flavored cake um I use it mr. beans green trees got tons in my cries it ended already I use that cooking groove tons of my garage in there tons of [ __ ] and honestly the best thing I've ever used I would love to test this against like great white and Israeli much my ghost is 22 gemstones and frequencies hello acquaintance gemstones in that routing frequency dude I was I hadn't transplant like every couple days he was overthrown my pond so I was like holy [ __ ] - curious oil experience yeah no way you know yeah I just last mile with their client pepper [Music] [Music] [Applause] I've never if your soil is shitty if your soil is nasty right if you have real organic type soil like with living you know like banana pieces on there and fruit pieces on there chunks of stuff and it's rotting like decaying you can possibly have flies [ __ ] you don't land on there and then pump their little maggots in there and then they'll eat all that [ __ ] I've never experienced anything like that I don't let things rot like that you know even though he's inorganic in most organic pieces I would turn that into the soil you know I would never let it sit on top I don't like that okay yeah that's [ __ ] nasty Jason can actually burn my roots these are capsaicin time with leverage another's capsaicin of hot peppers I know it's not very I never had a problem with the time type of though I don't that [ __ ] in there be rocks and [ __ ] out there [ __ ] expecially using coop okay you track them flies croc site is a [ __ ] you got root problems root fungus root [ __ ] rot all that [ __ ] man [ __ ] flesh your [ __ ] out with the peroxide water you want to mix the price I have water though don't say anyone makes it it's nature's earth it's like razor blades trick to them um it is but if you've ever watched time-lapse videos on diatomaceous earth and how it actually kills bugs and how long it takes dude some of those bugs takes a long [ __ ] time I watch them try to kill eight it's good that [ __ ] dude it's a [ __ ] seven goddamn days I was like yo Maya knock your [ __ ] put one plant outside on the ground right and these ants that are in my backyard will go all over this [ __ ] plant and pick it clean 100% in like two days you know I'm saying yeah I really prefer my aunt's dude if you guys have ant hill in your backyard or anything like that try it put your [ __ ] plant I'm gonna [ __ ] anthill and let them [ __ ] hands go all over your plant and take that [ __ ] plant clean dude I had root if it's an spider mites last year I didn't spread [ __ ] all I kept doing was putting it in the same and then like I would have plants that were outside of my closed in garden and it was like all sands where all these [ __ ] ants are and then these other plants would be in my driveway where there's no ants right burn and they would start getting bugs so I pick him up and put him in to where all my other plants were and then in one day or two they'd be picked completely clean pit I had Goliath cuz by didn't believe me I'm like broke look at this plant covered right put it in a second cannolis claims I want the welcome like you [Music] yeah let ants the ants and ladybugs see the ladyboys Kate come later though you know naturally then the answer I'll white [ __ ] now the bugs ain't no I'm out yet really not not the ones that really affect us the King this plan it's not my anyway but y'all though hands go to work you know ladybugs Tom ISM the mosque on the moss come in there like around now and they start laying their [ __ ] eggs right and then you get those army tent ones and those [ __ ] Rock all kinds of stupid [ __ ] you know I'm saying so I try to make sure I'm out there picking at those and trying to find me some mom some toys and some some praying mantises I think I'll be able to keep playing man stays in my area I just fly away finally roll is going up yeah but those ants were the best the best thing I've ever seen for [ __ ] on a pigeon [ __ ] I mean those lady buggies we're cool it's the ladybugs you can actually watch them they'll go up and down the leaf up and around and build searched and searched and searched the whole plant and find something like chew it all up the ants are sweet though you just see them gon take them up in the air and carry them up [Music] [Music] whoa yeah we're gonna smoke this joint finally take it easy I got you some ganja Donna your mama I was called John Sonya me neither and we had a bug issue when I got mountain of ants outside if I were you yeah for sure see this year I'm gonna do pure crop one uh primarily for the mold and stuff only new some pretty uh you know ways a preventative but it's mainly for the [ __ ] molding but rot oh man zennith season last year was wicked dude wicked man everything was going so beautiful the whole [ __ ] summer everything was going like clockwork I had a couple issues but not like at the end nanus weather turned shitty and was like Oh [ __ ] no no I was out there every day springing that [ __ ] peroxide chopping down [ __ ] kindling that [ __ ] powdery mildew man [ __ ] sucks yeah Mike's actually uh like spider mites and [ __ ] actually increase the trichome production Oh fight you grossly a new growth is using cameras of pitch I rather deal with tata mildew outside though than the inside is outside no wild exploring a [ __ ] out everything you I'm saying inside I got a [ __ ] take my plane shower clean everything out of the shower spray it all down so he was like during the winter sake no chance for everything down take plane out they no [ __ ] Jolla down you know stairs yeah everything he gave me everything [ __ ] on it [Music] no yeah God you think she's going out summer earlier so we take up a bomb and so low and Goliath hits it you goes whoosh it takes me back to 1999 I was like what was that man that tastes like 1999 a monkey airplane scrub everything with each it's not going really okay see unstoppable I thought I had some unstoppable Rudi for this year though I was blessing with long all kind of [ __ ] a-two a-three cleaner the [ __ ] trying that pepper and it finally it was the second dose of cayenne pepper that [ __ ] renegade now those plants are gorgeous Timo's 1999 nine left out don't make me feel already twisted [ __ ] we laughed my ass off I was 21 back to nine dollars in which all this get here that's coming back her mom open now I got to get out and bring sunny days in here what and look shady out six [ __ ] 48 in except for 20 outside and the [ __ ] Sun was coming up 4:20 in the morning like huge I honestly don't remember the Sun coming up ever at for [ __ ] 20 in the morning dude I just maybe I'm just lost maybe I just hadn't been paying attention I do not remember the Sun being up at 4:20 and the [ __ ] morning ever it's crazy crazy dude I don't know what happened for Planet nine tonight since you know what a coincidence yeah Pierce has got a whole project going on over there it's no male in existence this is what I want to learn I do curious I'm learning the secrets KITT I'm learning these secrets for a purpose right got all kinds of [ __ ] in my cranium we're slowly discovering because we get stolen a lot and I do different [ __ ] bounce around and stuff but right so in ancient times okay there was only female have cannabis okay that's the seed that they brought it was only female and now if you listen to some of the we church stuff I talked about with life to Jesus and stuff and how they say it's just a whole metaphor for cannabis like Jesus is cannabis and the killing of the male's was then trying to eradicate the male see if you just think about it like that right so when Jesus came Jesus was the first true male cannabis seed since and he was the first true male for the canvas line okay so they tried to eradicate him because they didn't want anybody breeding the cannabis it was only for the for the high ups and now the the low class right the peasants the poor people had the male candidates Jesus at the male okay so now they would have the opportunity to bring it off okay so I'm seeing about a lot that like that lines right sure or not sure don't matter the whole point of it is at one point there was only female okay now whether it might have been a hermie male female you're right but there was it said it's written that there was only females and then through God it made males okay and it made it populate go go forth and spread across the land okay that's just in my head another metaphor for them spreading cannabis everywhere you know um so if it's possible okay I want to learn how the [ __ ] they did that how did they make it a male how did they get a male out of a female where there's no male see I'm saying that's something I want to work on you can make a male dominant method idea eventually producing real nails after thousands and millions of years yeah see that's what I'm talking about I want to learn how to do it though I want to see if it's possible it'd be hard though are you do know starting to eat yeah it was the aliens

water would do it to my plane feed it to it go ahead and get so [ __ ] let me see what nope would you okay feed so let me say Pepsi would do things here who gives a [ __ ] it's a plant he gives a [ __ ] try and see you don't know what will work or what it will do to it because you know 9 times 10 no one's [ __ ] try the chip before it no I'm saying they stick with what everyone else tells me to do and that's why people stay and then they hurt to be here frequency and grown with crystals and junk something to go about really cause all the way ancient text books on you that tell you what I'm talking about they might not come out of my mouth exactly 100% crash but I guarantee longer I study the better off did you know it [ __ ] like that is crazy heywhat everything to keep getting this probe tip and prep starting to piss me huh oh yeah I guess we can't afford it that's fine of course you didn't [ __ ] people dude I can't afford a net farm you exactly making plug in all different kinds of trades once with everything the other dilute excuse me I like to just have fun I love trolls me I love make him intoxicate I give him a wrench a [Music] baby gage oh yeah it's my dog cage my tillich age so I feel deep tore up that already summed up yeah laughs II can't talk crap and the funniest thing was right so everyone saw me last year I turned the [ __ ] out on my plants right you guys really moment seen anything for me that yet this year so I got all these new people talking all this [ __ ] oh god I love it I love it it's all these new people that just see what I got going on right now you know and it's like that's cool I didn't make twisted training series because I don't know what I'm doing I just cuz I know how to do that no I just did the totally different way this time they're gonna see on the outdoor yeah we're gonna see I'm after that's why I tell them all stay tuned I know trust me your budget look like that look at that stretch you bunch it look like that she's y'all tight I know this is what I [ __ ] trends why I train for the donkey days this was trained differently but wait till you see the outdoor a few runs like you know how my plants might not be as impressive is other people's are still right now but no you're judging from we had last year we should be fun pretty well yeah see anyone can grow that's the thing that's the thing a lot of new people need to start learning and understanding dude anybody can bad your plant anybody anyone can train the plant simple let's get the flowers let's get to the button let's see how you handle the button let's see how it performs for you let's see what you get harvest that's what makes or breaks are grower I can grow a [ __ ] plant the size of my house and beg and maintain that and flower there's not a hard part that's that's my toughest part right there it's flowers you bet make sure everything supported yeah makes you're not stubborn on breaking up right on man yeah there's no bugs in there oh for sure for sure sure but not like when people say like they're drug growers or something like that or this or that you know I like to see people what they doing but you know that's all no fruit I mean anybody grow any kind of crash we like to read like me I don't go for the mango I don't give a [ __ ] what de piel looks like like do you think that's gonna have bag appeal [ __ ] no but that medicines on there I know you can't see it I children before but the trichomes is red medicines they're people it's not in that plant material it's not nothing to have plant material but plant material you know the trichomes the crystalline part of that plant is where that medicine it's you know saying the more plant material you have the more medicine you can possibly potentially have on that plant but it's not really needed does not really need it I like to get the big fat buds and the that bag appeal right but if it's not there and it's a funny [ __ ] strange amen [ __ ] fun of my buzz all day while I came to this joint of the same [ __ ] you're making fun of and then a walk away that's good yeah I know it is what it is weeds weeds if I could if I could think it and draw it up and everybody would look like that oh I'd have the biggest part is perfect this [ __ ] anyone ever seen just like y'all would yeah ten buds 10g yeah see what happened what these strains though they're all popcorn buds there are all these popcorn type buds but they're all dude there's [ __ ] they're beautiful they're not quite too hard I can't say I can't say they have I'm not really really squeezing but I can't say there's soup like they're rather squeeze and I can't say they're super super tight but those calyxes dude those calyxes are fantastic pockets I keep thinking they're seeds in there see this one Fox tailed like crazy this is chocolate chip dough me try to seem like fun because I've been smoking them off when I find him I'm lucky we had less booze and smoke all next year this is my personal stash right here the other Fino is going to be for donation I'm here I must have cut a model come all up cheers beeps northern autos go on hell yeah quality over quantity I like I want to get quality and kwan-yuen saying like that chronic Skywalker is a nice producer from that small plane I get outside you know in said Bush we go Bush I got almost eight pounds you know it's run like seven pounds something like that off that plan there so that was a nice producer no big [ __ ] it gets big bugs but they didn't have long enough go outside it needed [ __ ] another like three weeks I'm not sure what the problem with that was it could have been life but like I said I wasn't feeling at the nukes properly damn it man seven oh yeah bro yeah yeah it was big and unfortunately so I did the harvest of that [ __ ] plant on so floats live he [ __ ] deleted it right I'm like broke and I wanted him to take me out and then give it to me so I put on my channel and [ __ ] that's before when I was stupid and would like listen to people and they'd be like hey man come on my love to do your harvest okay and he believed it right but it's funny my other harvest videos from that same garden are like houses and you know tens of thousands of views you know the fan so I really [ __ ] up on that but yeah I had tons but maybe I had to I trimmed for two days straight I kept passed out in the [ __ ] pile we do news everywhere through a Swede all over my [ __ ] house dude it was greatest thing ever man I only have three hours of sleep what you gotta do a light issue that's what I was thinking I got a 2000 watt egg Lex and everything I've put the egg the underneath the egg Lex so that's what I'm thinking I'm thinking that likes high power like [ __ ] you're supposed to put the 2000 watt a flex you're supposed to put it four feet above the canopy my [ __ ] was like that close because if Marla is coming over a living hell yeah it's our so what's up you wanna do a hangout I'll make sure my zippers up though come on scaring away just rude super heads [ __ ] for your Heights I got LEDs broke these are all t5 but these are beds T fives and teats I got LEDs and cobs over there don't see your cousin today yeah I didn't have if you met me though curious I didn't have any but rot at all on the chronic Skywalker I got a little bit was it unlike the other ones the one seem like the five gallon pots like those big-ass ones though I didn't get in you bought rock solid ice only the ones that were in the pots for somebody against we were talking much just got back with coffee you know yeah I love hang out always on this I know every time off my phone you're on a call back no sleep and [ __ ] you [Music] [Music] so this is what on this lesson that I want you guys to just think about agree or disagree it doesn't matter I don't even like know that's [ __ ] up that's stupid right and it's just something I learned last year last year I threw money and money and all kinds of money in my plans all kinds of nutrients right and still get what you get we're seizing [ __ ] up all your money is really wasted right so this way I want you guys think about think about having a better clean right think about having Tom Sawyer already bounce or like you spend all year long making your soil recommending it getting it right getting ready orgas leave it outside left my [ __ ] outside when you [ __ ] with organics when I dug that [ __ ] up this year there with worms and microbiology everything all the goodness friend Dugga Dugga [ __ ] we put it in the colorful so that's where I learned I learned not to spend so much money per plant right now if you guys use it for your personal medication or you have patients or donations that go out it's all about overhead okay now if you spend $3,000 or $1000 total pot dirt everything your whole setup right no not pops let's talk about dirt soil nutrients and genetics just those maybe co2 you know your replenishable [ __ ] that [ __ ] you go through every grow kind of stuff right so like your soil your genetics your nutrients your co2 maybe that's it that's probably about all I got right there for that and you were stuff like that right you might go stuff you go through right now if you limit not limit but try to lessen the amount of stuff you spend every year or every girl per plant and make your profit go up higher you know saying you'll learn a better way to grow that plant and not have to like to spend so much money because that's the biggest thing nude if you spend all kinds of money on your plant and it gets ripped you get raided it [ __ ] burns down it [ __ ] gets [ __ ] by a tornado it freezes if I can get snowed on I don't [ __ ] dog gets my ride I mean dude that's devastating devastating but if you just put your a little bit of money into your soil make it bomb and just let that [ __ ] ride you know I'm saying like for instance like nails and um males I don't feed at all don't feed them [ __ ] they get water period that's it no food ever plants that are not even sex don't get no food okay you know I'm saying I know I can get bigger plants I can get faster production I can get all that chick but if I'm building my solo for male and cleaning all my nutrients to a male that's a whole [ __ ] waste if I'm not beekeeping freed if they're total waste of [ __ ] money total waste so I'll put everything gets put reuses or soil it's not cold and it's not hot you know saying it's not cool it's not hot there's some nutrients in it it's not hot but it's enough to get it through clergy [ __ ] days I met you for instance so those plants that are down here I know you probably can't [ __ ] see yet seen before those plans that are just all down there I've never fed any of those plans not one [ __ ] time not one not one time they're reused super soiled reuse super coil that was not real mended you know I don't want to put my seed throw my clones and some hot-ass soil so I just chop down a planet I pull the [ __ ] the stalk out which is little roots around it or evolve the other roots in there and I take that pot and dump it into my other bin over here these are my big toast break all that soil lots of boom that's it that's all I do now I'm go grab another pot to fill that with soil and I put that plant in that much soil from these what products you broke I used from this HP and chromium's make feet neither those are mentally yeah my crashing device on the side yeah that's all as soon as my cries and buy a fungicide and it has the organic matter so maybe maybe my cries are keeping contact I don't know yeah those are using your neutrals yep that's what I do dan dan the into a man I use that mister these green trees do that makes perfect no-till living organic soils all you got to do is add worms dude it's perfect if you have the right environment then your tenant your grow room you use mr. B's green trees one time come back the next day the whole top of your pot will be furry with that beautiful lugging my cries up there the basilia whatever it is you know that [ __ ] bio culture stuff the stuff twisted see right sidebar bio biz all mix okay that's cool that sounds fine ginger bonus HP is good night goes yeah I like I use them promix HP and the promenades weed and I mix them together and I find that right there's business business hey yo what up mister got the boot yeah wicked big let me get some coffee [Music] the energetic for me what's that HP Jojo what a photo I need clothes doctors will try my weed so yes oh yeah yeah buy my from mix and our but there's all kinds of landscaping things around here like little kind of Pro shaft like gardening place seems like

structure and work on the budget by different techniques that's all you always got three areas of focus Bruce branches and buds right so there is focus areas and there are ways to increase plug structure sized under that you know make it look offering each it so we will be trying to work an inch of torture with this drink he says man even if it never turns out anything goodness always a

Johnson look you ain't gotta worry about paying a brand-new engine games you know yo I was lucky I time my [ __ ] I wish I could have flipped my [ __ ] say a month earlier than I did or say even two weeks earlier than I did so it would be a little bit more ready but dude it's my win against Goliath high when Goliath grower smokes a joint and says be honest [ __ ] like dude you just in your head you just know you did something [ __ ] good you did something right dude Kirill no grow some of the solid [ __ ] you like no no yeah I gave him [ __ ] like no no come in that's why I always tell you guys that likes Drive I've it's about this dream I don't give a [ __ ] who you are I don't care what you got I don't care I'll run fresh I don't care what equipment yeah I don't care who you are as a grower if you don't have a good enough strain there's nothing you're gonna do to it to make it good enough for somebody who is like paid a cannabis connoisseur right who loves for paddy I know I'm saying he won't settle for that [ __ ] painting fried fish she wants it thought you cared yeah you don't say so you there is ways of increasing THC account potency all that kind of [ __ ] all the different types of scripts in it and stuff like that you can increase these things slightly but without good genetics you know there's only so much interview to it to do anything at all so if you got crap to begin with like last year I had some crafting he's in like school straight up [ __ ] and the white widow fat bug was the first one that I really started growing that looks like good sales anything good except for my loved one me too long to come so I got lucky you know there's a good chip on going ahead all garbage I'm sermon garbage library started I had with skunks that brought with me but like everything else was just like fancy dry and collected you should know and I was like man hope he's all turned out good but then he was cleaned out Christ you know I'm saying now the weed they came from was good right but the we dick was grown but I mean it was mediocre weed but it wasn't nothing to be like is blunt weed you know what I'm saying if you guys know what I mean it was lovely you know like throwing a blunt and smoke it like none special but now like I look at this [ __ ] I'm like I like it I'm liking it sweepa sweepa broadly super huge carrots which is covered in hair it looks like the needs go a little on there but like I said I was lucky I was real lucky to even have ganja did you guys know I was out I was down to my little bit of blueberry so I was like man I'm lucky that these things pulled through enough that they did I just wait for him to turn I saw enough cloudy and I saw my first Amber's and I'm like poem calm down gotta have a right foot cup so it is what it is bring some green crack though do but if you got money Mook you know I'm saying yeah I'm sure there's gonna be [ __ ] for sale there so don't fret you guys at the dispensary if you wanted to grab something a little special I mean if you wanted to come and you cannot handle I would give [ __ ] up I'm just real lucky to even have something but what up doing door man how many outdoor plans you got you drilling right now I have 11 outside I have more than 11 outside but I have 11 in the ground right now but then I'll have we tell ya you're at Leith yeah I am living outside right now in the ground but I can have 36 total I might only do 24 you know I'm saying I think I'm gonna do 24 and your ground toga I think I'm gonna push it because I still got some stuff inside I do perpetual awesome lot you know saying I'll have shape going in and out in and out and out shooting around the states out all summer I'll shake my flower room I do I'm crazy but [ __ ] you got do crazy this unnecessary crazy [ __ ] all summer long so that way I have weed all the time I [ __ ] up a little bit producing a flower too late but a little bit of know who this shoot or non-native correct Kathy is really not panicking I really care about the THC you know it's got a good high CBD content like that blueberry it's low in THC people it's 12 to 14 percent THC I'll tell you right now the blueberry I'm telling inspires oh it's dang it like I have [ __ ] I need maintenance issues right I'm not really hurting no more a little bit but those look like you know so I look for something that gets me like to that point remember I don't know if you guys remember like laying around get like high high school and [ __ ] I like just like like all intent like paying attention but like Stalin and [ __ ] like I like to get like that that level of high and then but still be able to function [ __ ] less where that that Ribery put you in this list it's like perfect content level and it was like this is good and it tastes [ __ ] sit down you know it's not it's not it's an Endicott have you in a good state II percent and if it's 20% some people right but it's not that you could kill it's not it grows more like a sativa it looks like this so just hit focus when you don't think so it's not that oh [ __ ] you guys see anybody going going to the couple seat I don't go to dispensaries why dan [ __ ] it's so fun bro you'll have good we'd all found oh yeah for sure bro yeah you don't have to worry about debt don't buy this offense reread though I love going dispensary look for me dude y'all understand like I grew up in Ohio I've been all over the goddamn planet I'm in place where we was legal and I've been in places where weed is so illegal some places to lock up your family other places will chop off your hands other places I'll [ __ ] hang you it's crazy [ __ ] man so is this one of my favorite songs I gotta stop talking to say butt up Green crack help me with joint pain yeah yeah very smoke it's gold cat piss no I never had any cat piss at all so but I dude it's always been legal so like going being able to go ruin span 3 is like [ __ ] um being able to off it's like going to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory you know saying I like walk in there just like there's all these possibilities you know I'm saying and now they put a new regulation out to where they have to have clean meds by oh I think it was June 1st so they're that big old man sale for other [ __ ] and it was all mold mouldy type weed right all it should think area carcinogen some sort and then now everything has to be lab tested and approved and it carried the special seal saying it's 100% clean meds like there's no because you don't take don't get people's weed that they bring in the go silent dispensaries and they'll go sent it to the lab and they'll do it's a look at the swab bile culture and put it on a petri dish do like seven different [ __ ] fungus bacteria blooms or colonies will [ __ ] blew them up in a petri dish and you're smoking it now mind you this has been dried and cured cannabis and they're scraping across this petri dish and live living colonies are growing that means that [ __ ] is alive in that cannabis people that's what blood washing is for but you know goddamn well dispensary [ __ ] people that saw the dispensaries except for Harley they're not gonna [ __ ] bun wash because it's the profit at the time the other nuts it's agreed is what it is it's a green stuff being [ __ ] greedy it's not being so [ __ ] greedy people just [ __ ] do the right [ __ ] and do it you know just do it do it a few times to see what happens you know the we does not look to me does not look as presentable when you bud wash it it's more open and loose and airy it looks more like as if it was growing kind of almost a little our feet but it's way more clean it's [ __ ] a hundred percent smooth that's the more important part to me like I said bag a pill bagss meal appeal I don't you [ __ ] about that dude I look when I look at weed I'm not looking at really bud structure I like bud structure but I like say if I go to dispensary for us and buy a bag weed I'm going to look at trichomes that's what I'm looking for I'm looking how many where they had like I went to this friend so you go get $100 ounce right not what I didn't know when I was looking again I had no idea I was like hundred-dollar [ __ ] I'll [ __ ] in this [ __ ] and I went out there and he pull out three different types and I was like looking at him I'm off magnifying glass and I was like hey man where's the trichomes they're like put it all back like oh you want trichomes here let's go up here I'm like hold on so for $100 an ounce I'm getting a bud with no tried on dude I stoped it scoped it there's nothing I'm like how am I getting 100 dude I'm $700 on silent talking about it's not right now though what I'm Christopher Brandon soil life what a dude that's what I'm talking about we didn't misfit dispensary stock with misfit weed [ __ ] it misfit [ __ ] misfit on misfit grand misfit stocks i fault mall dude you're gonna find mall dispensary weed they don't bud wash it they got the quick dry.quick clear quick here system going on I'm telling you they might even dry their [ __ ] in [ __ ] cereal dude there's no [ __ ] way there huh there's no way they're cutting down their weed drying it and carrying it for [ __ ] two months before it goes in dispensary it's impossible there's no is it do you know what kind of operation you would have to have for you to be able to do that in an effective manner to make a profit and dispensary you would have to have stock piled up before you ever approached the dispensary because they'd start buying it all out and you'd have one your one league or grow going on you know saying you'd have to have [ __ ] three probably like 300 400 500 plants to be able to keep the poundage up on the cure you know same consume people smoke weed off you know saying so you got something there for a two-month here well by the time you take that one out you better have one that's like like a week or two right behind it you know I mean there needs to be [ __ ] right away I don't know how Spencer's go but you know they don't grow Spencer advised from growers yeah uh all the dispensaries I've ever went to they all grow every one of them that's when you go get the house special that's what they grow that's why when you grow go in in dispensaries they all smell like not like grow up like just kind of ganja they smell like growing ganja for sure yeah I'm actually every time I go to the Spencer ease go to this Brasserie and say can I meet the master grower I meet the master tour every time it's pretty cool oh yeah for sure like I said you know I just cut this [ __ ] down a few days ago it's gonna get a couple of day care and then we're gonna smoke the [ __ ] out of it this weekend also look [ __ ] up and I'll [ __ ] geek I don't selling cured yeah we'll see that's a [ __ ] that's a [ __ ] quality that I can't wait to have you know now I got to smoke your weed I got to smoke some cured weed that's summer because it cured [ __ ] all goddamn wetter rotation going so I don't have to go to Spencer eat yeah for sure that's whole point at least grow enough one time so you got pounds you know my work and this is better than most stuff I ever got from the dispensary mine's a 21-day minimum cure after driving yeah finds it finds the cure I'm curious until I'm done smoking it once that baggage are is done a you know it's all good that well I hope too Oh like when I do the summer girl for sure like when I'm doing this grow for sure out here but like these little grows like I'm only getting like I'm almost done trimming this plant that's all the weed I got from you no I'm saying these plants didn't feel too much outs or two three ounces I got like a quarter pound little I got a hundred and thirty six grams off of the Shogun total cuz it was [ __ ] Oh so [ __ ] but it's good they were milky trichomes we don't like to get them at milky but you know it's still good trying a little different I learned about plant degradation what that means what is actually happening in a plant so I wanted to try it a different way without plant degradation No so we're seeing what the different types of medicines are I cannot wait to try Harley's [ __ ] weed to soil I thought you're bringing somebody if not so good see I've gotten some dank ass wheat from dispensaries and now mind you my biggest goal to end dispensary of course was get some bud was to try all these different strains because like in Ohio I don't know what the [ __ ] she was I've no I've had soured II I'm not I've had green crack I know I've had gas cloud right that's like what they call it right um so growing as Spencer outs ever try a bunch of different kinds I've even brought the box out yeah all the little pages you try all these different flavors so I can kind of find like what's my favorite [ __ ] no in Ohio I smoke tons of [ __ ] purple weed so I've always liked that purple so that's why we found one got that purple kush I was thinking that was like the first thing I ever bought blue dream and purple kush the blue dream was good but then it started tasting like soap after a while so I was like not into that blue taste because the blue was tasting too soapy you know saying if you guys ever ate a bar of soap you know exactly what I'm talking about with that biggest flavor with it he's got the most amazing [ __ ] going on there I cannot wait to draw Harley stuff though for sure it cannot wait to try some Massachusetts weed uh hopefully second weaknesses bringing some weed ah [ __ ] he's flying dude second wind this is flying grafting graft a bunch of strains I'm one playing it and then flowered out is a graft I actually was in horticulture school for four years I had a two-year scholarship to mooster College with a two-year are announced are a four-year transfer for my we're masters not [ __ ] for horticulture and landscaping in Nam primarily landscape design landscape architecture that's what I was going to do so um yeah I know about all that he's graphed all the time I've never grabbed in cannabis although my cousin went shamanism master he's like a pro he grabbed did some cannabis once he drew a thirty [ __ ] foot tall plant he grew a treat yeah graphing could take a little bit of time to first master and then to actually take you know I mean well it's really cool about cannabis though now I've grafted trees right I've also cloned off of a graft I don't know if you guys know how to do that we're gonna be showing people how to do this though later on and uh so cannabis actually heals a lot faster than a normal plant does okay so when you craft a cannabis plant like it seriously like like immediately starts to mend and bond because that plant needs to feed itself so it's like it immediately starts making those connections that starts growing back together it's wild and you'll still see autographed come on though what up saw some great biscuit grafting fir trees cannabis is a tree ganja is a tree it's a tree of life here here's a quiz for you guys what makes a tree a tree that was one of our questions before me and Goliath tonight this cannabis a tree or is it a week just got me hungry [ __ ] yes ice cream bits and comes out with sucking his name it's a tree it's not a week it is a tree what makes a tree a tree anybody know that woody material all there's lots of things they have woody material though their vines stuff like that Bush is a bush is actually a small form of a tree growth rings and bark brother hardly grower I'm on the [ __ ] hit the nail on the [ __ ] head so when you guys harvest your cannabis at the end of the summer okay chop your chop your plant down however you harvest it right but I want you to go down like see that far off from your soil whatever don't break it make it all jagged right don't saw it make it all stupid try to get a nice clean chop across there or like like you do with the chainsaw on a tree tell me what you see tell me how many rings you see what's funny about cannabis compared to an actual tree trees girl rings by year okay you can measure the climate and environment of the area surrounding a tree by looking at its rings and measuring its ring it's a scientific fact right the [ __ ] cannabis does the same thing all [ __ ] people you'll notice um when you cut that [ __ ] you're gonna notice the areas where it grew really well where it was really not well and when you count back the months it goes by months not by years on a canvas plant so Goliath Groot is one plant for ten months we chopped it that [ __ ] had ten rings I was like wait holy [ __ ] that's crazy dude yeah we I didn't I I don't know if I knew that or didn't know that but we found it out for sure um recently more last year note saying tree rings or yearly Kenny goes by students and they go by the months every every month you grow and you can actually record it by looking at your tree stump where it fed well and where it didn't feed well in what month you can see the thickness of the range it you'll be like okay cool so if you can analyze that and know what the [ __ ] you're looking at and stuff like that and remember what you did you got those notes you can see what happened because what you should be doing your outdoors when you're recording notes you should be recording daily temperatures barometric pressure when weather humidity [ __ ] like this you know I'm saying and then so on and so forth bugs with bugs come see when birds come you never know because when in certain climates different birds mean different bugs are around you know I'm saying it's weird [ __ ] like that you know say but then you can go back in your notes and figure out okay this is exactly what happened and that's what we found out we found out when it was real [ __ ] rainy we saw this big growth spurt and [ __ ] like that and when it was drying like stupid and we're odd life wasn't either come over and feed it on its regular schedule we're seeing these little [ __ ] tight noted rings and it was weird and then we get bro fat it would stay fat for a couple times and then we get like sinner to keep smaller shrinking and shrinking AHA that's crazy I have 35 years oh yes but see you a cannabis plant can live year round it can you live year round it has to be well established though it has to have bark you know I'm saying it has to have bark to protect it from the winter for one it has to have a big deep root system on now if somebody grew a cannabis plant with a trunk the size of a freaking 8-inch coffee cans right imagine the bark that would be on a tree like that now imagine only harvesting some of the fruit right you leave some on there to rebadge you leave some of those little [ __ ] leaves all over the [ __ ] that a revenge okay so a well established plant like that as long as the roots didn't freeze and die I believe that [ __ ] can make it through winter huh come back in the spring and [ __ ] start your own you got I'm [ __ ] firm believer long [ __ ] gross pretty good how are ya what up baby bubbles rebuttals yeah for sure ya think when we're growing these when we grow our cannabis plants we normally are growing and harvesting like basically saplings you know I'm saying it's see a tree they're meant to be grown [ __ ] 30-foot [ __ ] tall you know I'm saying they're meant to be grown huge you know so when we're doing these little guys that barely start getting that flaky you know the skin stretches and you get that flake that's will turn into bark but it's the same if you go go plant a little tree outside go plant a little maple or something and watch it through its growth before it starts getting that bark right it's the same as that thing the canvass plan just it's it looks like a glow truth you don't I'm saying it's the same grow stages which is the cannabis plant happens way faster you know Sam yeah hope your dick doesn't have bark teeth waiting for you read Proust as much as the first grow cycle I think the revenge would produce more actually I actually think to revise reproduce more and in ammount yeah yep they're very smart yep and it just all depends on to how thick you're able to get those new branches you don't say and that's the it's bigger the roots bigger the fruits right but you also need that branch girth and strength to be able to hold that big ass [ __ ] but you know I mean I can't remember who this guy was I thought it was Goliath grower but it obviously isn't but there's a guy I used to watch all the time and when I found him he was on his fifth year rebadging the same plant is all he had he didn't have no seeds he had one seed and he grew this one plant and he only had one setup and he's been revising it for five years and keeps harvesting and harvesting and I mean it's a monster it's a [ __ ] huge huge monster it's crazy yep got pounded doors yeah five years that's yeah five years I can't remember who it is I try to find him all the time and I can't [ __ ] remember the hell it was yeah he was all over YouTube and stuff and he was doing the indoor and he kept talking about he's like here's my five year rebadge he's like I didn't have any genetics or anything so I just had this one seed and I kept rebadging it harvest it free budget and you just gotta leave something plant interior you know when you guys go down a lollipop everything you know how sometimes when you lollipop it and then you go to harvest there's still some of that green it looks like little leaves that are forming and growing again well if you harvest everything but leave say it's lower buds here there and then leave those green leaves and then keep watering that pot right don't chop it all the he'll keep watering the pot leave that toss them you need that [ __ ] stuff that's the [ __ ] tapper managing that being the taproot that's growing straight up okay so you need that they don't chop that all down and don't worry about none of that the plant will do what it needs to do so if you bring that back into your light cycle whatever you could let it go through all all winter maybe possibly but if it's a small plant you want to bring it back inside you know I'm saying and put it back under its eighteen six it'll revenge right back out and go I baked into your flower you know I'm saying yeah seven oh dear old mother yeah that's for sure I love to try to grow a plant that would be big enough for that oh my brute in the hybrid system are going nuts but I've got a couple of worms that when the water do I get absolutely absolutely you get them sonsabitches out of there they'll do that though guys your boy what a Harley it's me Tom Bombadil good morning beautiful [ __ ] would uh yeah grab the worms out yes what will happen is they will start rotting and stuff like that you don't want that that's nice that's cool mate I never want to get my bomb Tim it say ten yeah it's gonna be fun it's the gun Toby up on time for show will remain I just gotta say I hope you guys are ready for this gummies we're making these gummies last night glass not and I was like glass I'm like you know we're gonna give people whose gummies right there he slipping sliding and walking off crazy all over this [ __ ] [ __ ] ganja festival dude doing stupid [ __ ] he's like these are gonna be so high from so many different types of weed they're not gonna remember what got to high I'm like oh no bro they're gonna remember they're gonna know it's the gummies they're gonna remember how they got it was like leaning forward like something somebody was grabbing me like pull me it was [ __ ] that yeah I was like I kind of like that you know how like you like it whoa someone's like it was weird is weird you have to keep your plants short until today that's dope sent some gummies to the UK tell my international crimes I tell you how to make a muse it's so simple it's easier for you to make them than for me to send them to you and get in trouble after you do for sure how do you get gummies from customs I did send them I just put candy yeah I put candy because I sent it was a test run a long time ago but I sent Oh devil's garden devil's garden I sent him he's up he Canada I sent him some stuff and I put up there is beans and gummies and I put it in a damn near see-through almost it was white the package was white right and I just put him in a baggy pants he's a powers do and then I put a I put souvenir rare souvenir seeds and like flower seeds and Wow Wow rare soon near wildflower seeds this railroad and um candy candy and that scent and they got there I was like holy [ __ ] and they got their way faster than any other way I shipped to like Canada or anywhere yup yup yeah when I make brownies I try to go over over what I'm happy dude good morning good morning I'll be shipping a cetera see if shipping is not problem though the problem is if if they really get if they [ __ ] really do hold [ __ ] up and then get a warrant and open the [ __ ] right it's illegal from our state to send medicated guns so if we were in trouble it would be an international crime first of all so not federal you're looking at federal and international and then you're looking at state charges for being a legally sentir state and then if I send somewhere that's not legal yet then you're looking at state charges from their place so it's really it's [ __ ] [ __ ] up man what up John Malorie good morning good morning for new couple Street smoke yeah yeah see that something I would you like edibles like that like fruity pebbles treats different stuff like that like [ __ ] I'd even rather send a can of butter itself but this shit's heavy yeah it all depends sometimes people get lucky see I just don't know if the couple dollars is work we're just used to it I always used to is to dude I always used to see ya recipe and make some gummies yeah for sure see I just don't know man you guys you got to remember like licenses or a jail time and stuff like that more and more important on your [ __ ] jail time my license is more important to me than anything this is what we've been waiting for forever select with everybody have their own right to grow for me to make $100 or couple hundred hours and possibly like get in trouble is not worth it to me not you should polish name to the UK yeah it's not worth it to me bro I can tell you out of income is you not become yeah I learned that lesson recently is it's not worth it to me a couple couple hundred bucks or whatever hundred bucks couple of bucks trust me if it was legal to ship I would have been rich by now there's no dude I'm a madman I'll do anything but you know when there's [ __ ] too many people that know about it like I meant live you know I'm saying there's to them there's people you're Python and see that are watching that could be dark that's the thing you know me and be careful yeah beans can be sent no problem absolutely it's too easy beautiful nation no teats he'd be gypped yeah that's the only thing I worry about is like my license I don't want to lose the opportunity that we've been dreaming for and waiting for our entire [ __ ] life you know it has to grow cannabis in the face of the Popo [Laughter] that's I mean that's what I do it for isn't that what you do for it oh wait it's wait it's our personal medication that's right I grow it to have it in their face yeah that's not you oh he's a COO oh yeah whatever you guys do with them it's fine I grow just to piss off the cocoa me too me too ha ha oh you're cold in I know you bro you're good to go you're good to go trust me this other dude was trying to get me to send in pounds I was like he was like I'll pay top dollar our top dollar I was like the only person that's willing to pay top dollar is the Popo no I'm saying cuz everybody else I ever meet wants a deal the other man Noah trust me I wish it was legal once it becomes federal eagle it should well be able to be sent through the [ __ ] mail I mean we're not [ __ ] heavy cocaine [ __ ] crack we're not drug dealers dude we're trying to share cannabis with our [ __ ] friends that should not be a crime that should not be a [ __ ] crime you it's [ __ ] weak it's weed it's not [ __ ] you're not chipping you [ __ ] heroin you know what I mean I'm [ __ ] it'd be the same thing if I shipped you a [ __ ] pound of dry eyes alias or how about a pound of dry poppies you could extract that and get [ __ ] opium you know I mean there's a lot of different flowers that you could actually drive flowers that you could extract drugs from you know I mean I don't understand how those are legal to be shipped but you can't ship [ __ ] weed until [ __ ] get it dude you want to talk about psychotropic drugs let's go get some [ __ ] weather they ghosts ghosts [ __ ] lilies ghosts orchids or some [ __ ] that [ __ ] in the Amazon where they crush it up and they make that that should they snort and should they blow in people's faces and they go no [ __ ] it you know I'm saying I don't understand this [ __ ] yeah one day though when it's federally illegal it should be totally legal to be shipped I don't see a problem with it it should be legal now that's stupid you can't even [ __ ] ship head no saying because that's why I was trying to tell them like listen I'm I'm ship trying to ship hemp here it's high CBD it's good medication there's very little THC in there and then they gave me the regulations of how you have to ship hemp you have to have so many [ __ ] licenses it's not even worth it it's not worth it dude holy [ __ ] I'd rather send you the seed you can grow it yourself yeah it really does [ __ ] blow the laws and girls they have for weed is just so stupid like I dude I'd be willing to go to jail and fight for the chick for real for real because that's how dumb it is because you know me if they put me in jail for anything cannabis you know you better watch the news because my whole court case I'm going to Supreme Court all the way up I'm bringing out ancient [ __ ] texts ancient healing text the whole way the whole way I might eat cheese [ __ ] what candidates is I'm gonna teach them why it got put on a Schedule one drug because it's psychotropic yeah I'm saying it makes you trip right and I'm gonna teach them all the medical benefits and why they should be using cannabis and they're gonna let me out feel stupid that's where it'll be all over [ __ ] news and the whole world will change that's that's what's waiting to happen they're waiting

Twitty roots I'm like as a matter of fact I like to welcome you to we Church they be like excuse me what up crypto whatever Granick old boats I'm like in the beginning God created all that you see and

[ __ ] red hair so I've got all [ __ ] off that got blasted by the [ __ ] away and I wasn't being it the [ __ ] news like that was done guys so the buds are [ __ ] the bugs are [ __ ] the tur profiles there and the trichomes are milky so get you diesel behind but my all things you guys are tasted dude it's like I so hard explain this it's just like apples and fruit and like a little bit of like like salad or something like smelling it's [ __ ] amazing if I could say I don't even smell like lead it's most like going into the grocery store and walking through the produce section and she was the freakin everything yeah Oh fruit stings and some students yeah Anya's candid screen smell yeah yeah only a slight on more like a chive you know how a chives are real smell maybe like the garlic child it's amazing when I open my safe you guys never might see from last year I forgot all my weeds in there I thought opening things like because like here in my safe [Music] put your favorite sure profile of a diesel I love the purpose we don't and purple definitely has a distinct smell and flavor not like grape right not great purple purple distinct flavor and smell you can turn a planet purple I pull orders email give it comes from a plant called rabbit okay so I guess that's what you're profiling like just left it's just very very taste I'm an earthy see a lot of the weed is I'm loving this so the the chronic Skywalker is a pint earthy type flavor so the baboon is is the baboon is Gorilla Glue number four cross with San Fernando Valley okay so that's it's this real high account bro I can and if you guys know it can smells like it has this weird musky smell to me it smells moldy it smells like mold so all day I'm looking for [ __ ] mold all over my [ __ ] house since it's [ __ ] weed I kept scoping in scope it in there's no molds the [ __ ] smell of the weed it's that kemon but to my nose my nose don't work too well but to my nose it smells like like mold of some kind you know being buds now but um so you get this 10 profile with this tangerine dream if you don't tangi a tangerine case like or purple or you get this you get this chem flavor like earthy earthy piney like a spicy musky type of flavor with our fruit with like 3:1 citrus is the ship not that's what I'm trying to capture is I want to eat flavors well Sam I'm over the ledge I'm over that let me check yeah I'm over the lemon of mango I'm looking for some mangoes who peach you just gain out some drug [ __ ] present oh so I'm trying to capture this citrus profile dying so I got it in the chronic Skywalker times in Tulare which is so low right so there is no track Skywalker's nails that had been found yet the green projects gone all the polygons there's no males Holloman ever so instead of feminized in the strain right keep going to bring out those crummy treats I chose to cross this Thank You Larry into the chronic Skywalker break and then found the plant the female that looked exactly the most distinctive look as the chronic Skywalker but I found it in the mail so it is the cross and this [ __ ] went I was leave stripping it it's mellow got killed in orange I was like I was like there's this orange I had Goliath come over I was like Tom what's that smell like you you oh I smell lunges is it just like a pill norms ago that's a male dude I'm like I'm keeping it now I'm gonna cross it with the chronic Skywalker and the Nate Rex eats so it will be it won't be the original cross Skywalker it'll be Skywalker time solo so it's gonna be like the chronic solo stuff like that and um but uh it should I'm hoping I can capture that orange feed oh man oh god that's what you need though if you want to capture Dino's and stuff yeah I like to get from the males I take my chicken tail with a good feed Oh get grapefruits good pineapples good to me but it it leaves it like a like a sting on my tongue my god I don't know it's sometimes hard for me this place it just

to the stretcher it will stretch in flower a hundred and two hundred percent we can't pick um mine Strad school-aged that frequency and I did not control it I let it go I Adam under you know not too great a par so they're stretching too far whatever but the baboon the regular baboon and strong Bigfoot and the one I grew last summer if you guys go out Thursday at bamboo dude I have a [ __ ] in like foot and a half and I know that I might look like three feet but it's really not in my world over here it might look like you in the camera but it's not about two feet long 3 feet long a donkey like sign that [ __ ] thing dude big-ass [ __ ] buds man that the baboon is a nice [ __ ] playing field if you can find straight bamboo you seeds try to get them try to get them stressed like mad yeah keep you see my favorite fruit is how do you do oh god yeah dude oh yes you know it that is that's got to be my second favorite clothes that's part time for first age there's a little Sunday driver [ __ ] yes [Music] we all we have oh yeah yeah the frequency bro make sure your plants grow crazy so if you're not training them you see what happens dude did I grow a [ __ ] six foot tall plant two months hunger [ __ ] lights and just I was feeling that missing these creatures bags you know I mean but dude see groups so [ __ ] fancy table plate one I've seen this frequency tested that corn these deals were 20 foot tall corn oz LaVon use mr. candidate but Northern Lights iron lung fews net frequency I was getting three inches a day living organic soil on my flowered you was stretching to the left once the fire you they are stretchy read into this day hours like house measuring I was like holy [ __ ] I was doing alive like wow I couldn't believe it that's all my plans last bro got out of hand do they started off all beautiful and really started blasting frequency isn't look at 20 feet under some powder they just start going whoa it would be an overnight thing like three inches overnight like damn the frequency was on YouTube it was under sonic culture but they took it away they took me down for some reason I actually bought the CD of it bb-but about the last one times all talking back to me anymore but um oh yeah actually picture but you can look finding pirated yeah it's called sonic culture see it up here it's called sonic culture but sonic bloom is the actual creator of the frequencies and then other people have had a maboob that one you got with all those birds chirpin dude that one's [ __ ] nice Carmelo those are three of the plants that I grew up silent experiments were all of these two I have been low five gallon pots made great wall bigger role in chat but it's not right up Church right Church empty cave loved a he didn't toss up Church he makes fun of them you can't miss a kid [Music] pigmented and with some coffee drug dealer a church also uh house those seizures been going over intercom buzzer being able to do some good [ __ ] with some weed I know I haven't been up on that I know we talked about it before and stuff like that be doing good do that basic cell yeah on the Carmelo was more of like piney earthy young-sam they were real Knights [ __ ] frothy ads buzz and I got those from the same person I got the trench skywalker ground i don't even know the lineage of the carmelo at all but when i saw it it was like a camber not like a purple it was like this weird reddish almost like a brown the blood was like this weird amber color on top you know like a reddish-brown color was so weird I was like is that normal he's like that's the color the but I was like to get to go so it's really strange but if you guys follow the broken last summer you'll see it in there the car knowledge talk about it was a temperamental plant for me know the camera load you have or anybody else as I took the pure michigan which was the white little fast but times Ohio's gums that I created and then I took that male pollen and then crossed it with the Carmelo and then I also crossed it with the beef meat I was trying to make him an auto friend but there's too many photos in there to keep it a little bit that's why I'm saying Auto possible I was hoping to get that but yeah they came out bang oh yeah that was lightweight too so we started getting real [ __ ] stone I did I started getting real hot so I was like by the time I made that I wasn't even like fifth anymore I was just like this dude and when I was more mad about what he was [ __ ] uh just talking lives his streets [ __ ] he's like I live with my mom I've never seen a grown man be more of a child like real that's like that's like the child is good [ __ ] I can't raise yeah I don't think they're Auto either you know to do Roca saw tater delicious has a chair Skywalker John it's kind of like I'm [ __ ] Toby Skywalker talk about the con Skywalker see tater has the GD P cross so it's the same exact cross the Carmel and the GDP had that Pure Michigan in his right and he's thought at first his was gonna be an auto but it was just sexually mature his the [ __ ] monster finds a monster - it's outside I got an EVP I had to Carmela's going dude man if I was a cat though is going here or both [ __ ] males they were the biggest plans I had they were shy normos it might it might little bit different the donkey punch has nothing to do with the donkey know you know just like donkey kong has you know I realized though for all these lives I played the same [ __ ] over and over and over again and I view I really love these songs but what it is I'm trying to learn them so that I could sing them but also I realized something else that all these artists have you know why can't these things because you're not talking to them like kids and you start talking them like grown-ups and teaching gonna kick with your kids now they come out like if you die usually my one-on-one buddy right back you're out I just sit there his daughter was three years old we took them have full conversations of like how do you even know these words like not like a little kid I'm like dude I didn't know I was like oh we're gonna definitely see that much I'll send you a slack for sure we have little packets for you guys yes yes what up AJ groves chant y'all know where the help on command is just email why not like looking through look I'm like you gotta be shittin me man like yeah I can't wait to milk everybody that's something I can't wait to smoke to me from Arizona maybe maybe maybe like the face we're head to wean Koga how much money so let's go help send money I never did that yet I'm like y'all never did hey it's not yeah he don't need it so he's like you don't need it - like Saturday I think right oh you're cold and Dan is a British man he drinks he smoked he does not caught with our slang he will call you all dumb [ __ ] don't take offence that's how they [ __ ] talk and it's funny you just laugh don't egg them it's funny [ __ ] their sons people donated to me and helped me get to this spot you gave me for all this [ __ ] that's happen to stuff you know so shout out feel of me please still live I'm soaking with it but I've got a bunch of leave out one ice cream [ __ ] yeah right on my birthday maybe I gotta go do some stuff on the 10th keep that everyone peace out go shirt oh yeah thank you got it fun to lift it and I'm actually going to make t-shirts today for the cup [ __ ] so excited I'm gonna get all stone and make t-shirts all day let me get made to trim in this guide you'll please drop one of these before I go do I feel like a little kid on summer vacation about to go to Cedar Point for the first time you know saying I know if you guys ever been like you 2008 state flag you know Disneyworld you know I went to Disneyland when I was kid I live in Dana Point California so Disneyland but it's still exciting [Music] oh my golly don't really realize where am I going [Music] just like you guys ever watch Christmas movies when they go for like Christmas land and all the trees were covered with [ __ ] with [ __ ] snow it's all Zoning joints anyway I might only have like a little bit of butt out so we could look at her what not but most missions can you roll ducts or glaze I don't want to do that [ __ ] to a strike all right let me go over here in the corner and roll a doobie up man all right guys raise smoke like did we just smoke like [ __ ] five joints where were you I was over here wrong a joint in the lane dude pill gor gordo y are again some company today so I'm going to make t-shirts and slants for the [ __ ] canvas cut bro I'm going to making myself I partake dude I might put that on my shirt I partake [ __ ] it right this time - I liked it alright take good you know I might put it smells like God's vagina I partake I like that one clean in there i watch that video I keep seeing it though you get cleaned up you outside in your greenhouse less when I got to see with you are soaking down you young you're soaking down the railroad ties each other it's not all that info that's one of the big mistakes you people made for the greenhouse is just like you said they directly water their plants and soak everything down the next thing you know there's moisture in your greenhouse that can escape and your plants where stole most are open and they start drinking then they get over [ __ ] waters you know ten all my three security three I'm only making creatures I only bought three future so I'm going to make you pretty teachers I'm saying for this one but I'm gonna make Koga one we have to go back sure tell ya Goliath has some dope-ass shirts I'm gonna have a cool shirt this province like I don't have I don't have a logo or anything yet I'm saying I probably could have got one if I would have been like on top of it in this short period of time but you know I always believe that things happen exactly when they're supposed to happen so if they didn't happen yet then for some reason I have not been moved I'm not the noodle get to do it no saying that's what I was thinking when the universe pushes me into going in direction path", "shDLGiq9Chs": "[Music] hey what's up guys today we're going to smash 7 grams on our fully automatic nug smasher x we're going to show you how to get a little less psi on your material by increasing your surface area we weighed out 7 grams of white fire we normally recommend using nug smasher x bags but today we're gonna use nug smasher 14 gram 120 micron bags we're going to smash this bag with inverted corners bottle text style take the corners of your bag and turn them inside out [Music] grab your everything tool and use it to help push the corners in it is very vital that the corners overlap this is going to give you the cylindrical round bottle textile shape we are looking for since we are using higher quality flour we are going to increase our surface area and reduce our material psi to do that use a 14 gram bag even if you plan on smashing 7 grams this is going to give you 150 to 200 less psi on your actual material equating to a lighter result you might lose a small fraction of your yield but with higher quality flour it will give you a higher quality extract next we're going to cut off the excess bag one unique thing about our bags they are double backstitch which means you can cut and shorten them and not have to worry about them unraveling or blowing out during your smash [Music] next we're going to raise the plates of our fully automatic nug smasher x [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] here's a quick pro tip once you're all situated let the plates come down real slow so that the heat neutralizes with the material so by the time it reaches maximum pressure all the material is the exact same [Music] temperature [Music] now as you see some of the rosin start to come off the plates we're actually losing some material surface pressure because it's extracting off so we'll add a little more pressure to compensate for pressure loss [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and there it is seven grams of flour one button 22 percent yield from flour to rosin to smoke in three to five minutes it doesn't get any easier than this rosin made simple hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools and terp files be sure to check us out there at nugsmasher.com [Music]", "kJNTI4gcQdQ": "[Music] hey guys it's ryan we're here we're going to smash an ounce let's get started we're here in the knox master smash lab um with the nuxmaster pro the all improved nudge master pro we're gonna do a one ounce smash product here and we're gonna do it in 90 micron uh seven gram nug smasher bags four of them across the front so we're gonna load them bottle text style and we're gonna go right up to about 2 640 psi which will be about 720 material psi on your actual product we figured that out at nugsmaster.com under the tools tab up the top under charts and calcs you can hammer down on that and a real good calculator tool for the nut smasher pro but anyway that's where we're going to do so stay tuned check it out packing these in 90 microns 7 gram nut smasher bags they're double backstitched nutsmaster bags we're packing a bottle textile which means we inverted the bottom corners of the bag just like that which gives you a shape like that when you start to pack them now you don't have to put seven grams in this it's just a rule of thumb and a size a uh a surface area size for the bag which lets you know what what type of uh what type of psi to add to the bag so you know what material psi you like for the specific strain but the bag you can put anywhere from four to 12 grams in it sometimes or that's a little stretch maybe nine grams or so i probably had 10 or 11 in the pinch but you could put more in it than seven grams and a little less than it's been seven if you wish keep that in mind we're gonna do a smash with the pro today we're gonna do uh four of these seven gram bags like i said they're 90 micron seven gram nug smasher bags we're gonna do the extraction we're loading them bottle text style that gives us our specific surface area what we've done is we've gone to the calculator tool online at under the top tab it's a tools tab you can click on charts and calculators and under that charts and calculators tab there's a selection for the pro the pro or the xp the two units we have with gauges here and so if you know what kind of material psi you want to do on this if you've done it before or you've seen a video or something of that nature you can plug the material psi into that tab and then get the reverse gauge pressure from that material psi it's a calculator so we've done that on this we were put in 720 material psi and it gave us a 2600 approximate 2600 psi on the next master pro gauge on four seven gram bags [Music] also you can go to uh the app store the apple app store or google play there and you can get and download our app or nugsmeasher app and it also has that calculator on the app along with a bunch of other good features so go to the app store and check that out so pneumatic use of the nug smasher pro we can dial the pressure in pretty close to exact or to the extraction so you have an inlet valve that will go through here with you when we're done packing these valves but there's an error inlet valve so you can limit the amount of air that comes into the unit that will eliminate the actual psi that the unit will be able to achieve which is nice you know the number one cause of ruined rosin is too much pressure so like i said the nut smasher pro um you have two air exhaust valves on this side and then on this side you have an air inlet valve so and then a joystick to control the uh up uh up movement so what we want to do first off is we want to get the plates spread apart the exact size of the bag so we fold the top of the bag in like a little present there bottle textile [Music] okay we get it somewhat tight there so it'll hold parchment in for us [Music] once you get one in you can put your magnet up there [Music] [Music] okay so we're basically going to come up until we achieve 2600 psi on the uh the plates here you want to make sure the bags are coming up all straight and have an accordion effect as they collapse down on each other looks like they're all pretty good [Music] okay now once we reached our pressure which we just did we're gonna just uh hang out here for about 120 seconds see what happens as we do uh as material does displace a little off the plates we'll add a little bit more pressure but not much we don't close those lava valleys [Music] pro plates full of rocks [Music] that is a nice unit if you're doing this for a while yeah that's legit [Music] all right let's go ahead and release the pressure see what we got [Music] bring it out real steady get right into your collection plate here [Music] it's gonna be fun to see what we got working on here [Music] fat yielder that's all i can tell you [Music] know what it is but it's a monster [Music] foreign so let's see what we got perfect isolate material nice stuff nice too [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you", "f5dCHqZmIBU": "[Music] good morning I'm gonna show you how I trim my plants and prep it for cooking butter all right so I cut this branch off the first thing that I'm gonna do is cut off these bigger leaves here so again pull back and get it right at the base now that's up to you how anal you'd like to get how manicured you'd like to go how much time you want to spend because we're gonna save the small stuff for cooking butter you'd go in a little bit further [Music]", "JqsAIe9NEHg": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome to the nut smasher smash lab corona california we're over here today we're going to do 21 grams and two 7 gram 90 micron nug smasher bags these right here and what we're going to do is we're going to do a bottle tech style and the nut smasher touch 206 degrees fahrenheit temperature we're going to do it at 700 material psi and we're going to set our surface area surface area pressure like i said at 2 7 gram nug smasher 90 micron bags so what we have here is the home screen on the nuggets master touch and this is mostly the screen that i use i mean and i do 99.9 of all my personal extractions on this exact machine you know it's been a progression of temperature and surface area calculations and this is the ultimate machine to do that with so anyhow but the main home screen gives you a surface area target so whatever my particular surface area target on the flower that i'm smashing or the hat you know whatever i'm what the material that i'm actually extracting you can put in here and quick and easy and you see what it is and then you can set the surface area down here by bag size so typically what i do for myself is i extract flour so when i extract flour and this is a flower setting i put flour in the nuge masher bags this extraction we're doing today i'm going to use seven gram bags that i'm gonna put ten and a half grams in each bag so we're gonna do a 21 gram extraction on the nug smasher touch in two with two seven gram bags and i'm gonna kind of show you guys how that works so we'll stop those little little you know right up to the the brim and we'll do an extraction here with it so what i did is i'm going to set the surface area for seven gram two bags that's the actual surface area size that i'm i'm actually going to be extracting it doesn't matter that i'm putting more than seven grams in each bag or it doesn't matter that i'm putting less than seven grams in each bag for instance i could put five grams in a seven gram bag and get very very close within a percentage of a percent the same exact yield out of my out of my product so really doesn't matter you have that flexibility it's a guideline on the bags to kind of give you what surface area you could set and you need to apply what pressure you need to apply to your actual extraction and that's kind of how that works surface area is going to be set for the two seven gram bags like i said the target temp um is or the target pressure set for 700 material psi now i like to come over here and put my time in i like to do a little longer than 90 seconds typically with a flower extraction your extraction's clean you don't typically burn it unless your heat's too high like i said 99 of the time i use this screen but if you are doing something different like if you are doing some thca isolation if you're using uh some extra micro on screen to do something i mean make some diamonds or whatever you're you're doing in this you can easily go from our bottle text style surface area calculation on this screen to a flat surface area so you can measure what you're putting in and give it the specific surface area and you know for for instance um you know a target material psi i was doing hash would be 400 right so i'd bring it to there and then i could put in here i could go flat and then i could go i have a one inch by 1.5 inch shape square that's my surface area and i'm going to achieve that 400 material psi and then i can add my timer here so this screen this you know we call it a master extractor screen it has more customization features so you can really get in there and do all kinds of different extractions and know exactly where you're at every time so you know on the thca you got to start with such a small surface area of pressure and you got to do it for such a long time it's crucial if you're doing an isolation or something like that with the with the unit so pretty neat feature and then up here you got the lights that turn just turn the lights on and off and then you got here the question mark gives you a help screen that just pulls up our contact information now we do have a customer service team that's there to answer any questions concerns help anybody with anything they may need seven days a week they're there from 7 a.m to 10 p.m pacific standard time and that's a tool for anybody any of our customers that need some help it's a lifeline that's always there if you get stuck with something or have a question or concern or something like that products are all lifetime warranty so keep that in mind really take that to heart i want to make sure everybody's having a great experience all the time so anyway that's a help screen you can get right to us on that and then over here is a setup screen this gives you your wi-fi connection if you're connected if you're not it tells you what version you're on uh tells you what the ip of the actual machine is you can restore reset the wi-fi and update your your current version from this screen here so anyway that's just a quick tour on the touch for this particular extraction we're just going back to the home screen we're going to go to 700 material psi we got our surface area set here right for that psi we're going to do it at 206 degrees for 120 seconds it's really that simple now all we do is tighten the release knob load our bags here and apply pressure so stay tuned we're going to load these bottle tech style that'll get ensure us the proper surface area size on all these putting the material in the bag you want to kind of evenly layer it you don't want to beat it up too bad so basically what we got here is we got two 90 micron seven gram bags with ten and a half grams in them we're gonna do a 21 gram extraction here on the next master touch okay now that we're all ready we got our heat plates all heated up we just confirmed that our surface area is set and it is to two seven gram bags surface area size now keep in mind there's 10 and a half grams in each bag that doesn't matter as long as our surface area is set to this particular size so that's what we're after we're our target psi is 700 we're gonna do it for 120 seconds and see if we can have an extraction all right once you got yourself a piece of parchment now in terms of parchment paper don't go with the generic stuff your product will merge with it i like costco brand the one from costco it's the kirkland brand or whatever but um it works for you know works really well if you're in a pinch get a rentals and rentals from the store just don't get the generic a walmart brand i hadn't seen people have real bad luck with it so nevertheless that's my parchment end so get a piece of parchment that fits in we're going to get these bags measured here you want to have the plates apart just about the size of the bag the height of the bag that's getting pretty close release knob tight get your bags folded over like a little present get your nose smasher magnet on there okay once you get your bag situated in there you can come on down and apply pressure nice and slow and easy you want all the pressure to normalize all through the material at the point that it reaches your total target psi here you'll see down here on the actual pressure the zero point you'll start to build once the material gets flat as you're coming down you want to make sure you get an accordion effect and you're coming down nice and straight your goal at the end is to have a nice round puck that's that size that's what determines the surface area so okay so the timer is going to start from the point that we reach full pressure and from that point you just kind of want to maintain right or right at that point because as the rosin comes off the plates pressure will go down because material is displaced you can see the timer starting to kick down so we just watch the timer come down maintain our pressure watch the plates fill up with goodness it's about halfway into our extraction here the yield looks nice but remember we got 21 grams of flour in there too so it should look nice you know yeah i don't want to see it all running i want to see this butter like that because that's right on the cusp that's right where i want to see it that means i don't my temp's not too high and i like to make sure it's just right at my target psi or a little above and we'll go ahead and take it off once the timer's done see what we ended up with so i'll go and collect this up we'll get a total weight see what our yield was on this all right guys so five and three quarter grams almost so 27 nug smasher touch you got two 7 gram 90 micron bags with products old flour it's been in bags it's just dispensary flour been in bags for um at least three months two months let's say to be fair put it at 700 material psi in those two 90 micron 7 gram bags for 120 seconds and what come out is five and three-quarters grams of solvent-less beautiful rosin that's what you get with the nut smasher touch hey thanks everybody for watching uh i want to wish everybody a very happy holidays and merry christmas appreciate your continued support for the next master brand remember we have a customer service team set up to answer all your questions and make the process this easy for

right by the door I flung the door open and it landed upside down and well a lot pretty much all of it so it only got a 10% return now the returns not what I thought it was but that's kind of the trial and error of what's going to happen some are gonna be better product than others some are just going to produce better than others the flower was fantastic regardless the smell and taste is just super skunky and super deep um fantastic product I would recommend it to anyone I'm really anxious to go back and try the rest of it see what other ones they have I'm just gonna buy a grand this time a pressure diagram and see which one gets the best reveal for the best view again this was only 10% on the blue cheese from tilling station in McAlester Oklahoma thank you guys", "G1el1rVuUsU": "there we go so I'm live with some freakin live resident have you seen that picture man but holy shmow don't mind the little burn here that was my bed put a hot frickin tool on it but this is my blue nightmare clones some of it anyway but maybe an ounce of it I blasted just came out of the freakin out of the purger this morning okay oh good so good I want to do the blaster I'm not gonna do the blaster I'm not gonna do it yeah let me give you a nice close-up it's it's buttered overnight it was it was a lot clearer last night but it's definitely um kind of buttered up oh my god you wait until I can forge some sort of a smellivision or something like that that'll be freaking far out I think for the sake of flavor testing I'm gonna use the dry tank here to have a little puff so yeah I uh I harvested yesterday mm-hmm we got I don't know man but it looks like close to a pound to plants [ __ ] impressive I did I did make a small failure yesterday give me a second to eat this up I want to yell over the torch but I did make a bit of a bit of a failure trying to make some live rosin yesterday oh my god you almost smelled it yeah I actually got a little idea cooking for a way to make some form of an interactive smell thing it might be a little wide a ways out here but I got a little something kind of in the crust something working we'll see we'll see anyway I just heated that bad boy I'm just gonna let that calm down I'm actually gonna take a little bit off of that dab that was in the thumbnail cuz that was insane but I'm still gonna take a nice big dab here here we go guys see that puppy poop that's no joke you guys are gonna watch me sweat are you ready for this I don't even know if I'm ready for this okay I need I need I need two Pikachu this is a carb cap made by my boy Jessi Evans you can find him on instagram under Jessie who gotta get ready for this puppy okay here we go here we go nope trickery put my elbow down arm hurts melt it all in there Oh [Music] oh man the the turkey it Oh I mean if you know what live resin is you know what live resin isn't it doesn't get any alive er and fresher than this stuff this stuff is literally less than 24 hours old we're talking with we're probably talking about I mean only sat in the purger for about 12 hours on you're under full pressure but like it was it was nice and thin when I did it it's it's it's if you do it right you can purge all 99.999% of the tain out in the first like hour if you do it right anyway the rest of it was just more for my personal sanity and for more stability purposes but as you can see it it done butter it up anyway I took it off the heat and just let it hell hold in the pressure vessel overnight and it's buttered up nice so how y'all doing today what are you all smoking on you guys getting baked on this Saturday morning afternoon whatever the case may be wherever you are also what do you guys think of the new setup so check this out I got a live chat I even got a little this myname thing down here man and this is all from my phone I'm looking at it right now I'm doing a full 30 frames a second in 1080p so what do you guys think of this did i up my game for you or what did I fix this [ __ ] I think I did because this is all on my phone this is the back camera of my phone I can see myself so this is the worst possible view you they're gonna get I know my face it's a bad view but I'm saying as far as quality like resolution and jumping there we go anyway enough stroking my stats you go a little bit smoking some GG for nice I don't I have a hard time with the gorilla glues myself I find that the THC levels are so [ __ ] high that it just strips my lungs I tend to been leaning more towards middle and kind of lower th seas but with like high CBD like I'm really liking these one two ones lately I don't I don't have any more one two one all I got left of my one two one it's savage I'm gonna show you guys this is a sad day two buds you see them to that [ __ ] this happened last time every time I try to show my freaking buds they fall out of there there's two buds in there you see those poor little buggers that's it bubble gum nice I like bubble gum as a stray and I grew some bubble gum recently [ __ ] is it so sweet and tasty [Music] hmm I like I like a fairly high CBD like all the time just due to the fact that I got like I got a lot of nerve damage to be honest I got a lot of soreness and a lot of [ __ ] pains I normally grow a 1 to 1 strain and I've been a seed hunting and I got I got a couple of strains right now I'm really excited to try I got a CBD cheese feminized and a blackjack both basically a one to one happy guy I give to it today buddy sorry I didn't notice your name in there I guess but right on man looks glad you could join so here's what I've done to the poor uh come on focus on their camera are you gonna focus with me come on focus focus focus I don't know if it's wanting to focus oh okay speaking of CBD I got the CBD powder right here's the 99% isolate you have the same press I love this press love it I'm very impressed I like that press it's a good press man um bang for your buck there is some cheaper ones and stuff out there I've seen cheaper presses and I've seen more expensive presses but that one fit the bill it it looked the way I wanted it to it was the right size plate that I wanted that's versatile so I can do hash and a flower pressing it's big enough that you can do an actual good sized chunk on there and it was under a thousand bucks and it was you know that between was like a six hundred dollar press so I was like whatever I love it this phone D focuses me a little bit sometimes I don't know why I just watched it D focus me there hey welcome welcome to the freakin it's subscribed it's supposed to say it's supposed to say join to the sash not subscribed I don't know why it's saying subscribed I I think I gotta fix that one anyway welcome cool man this I'm impressed I'm freaking running all this [ __ ] from a phone man this is uh the stream labs app I'm kind of impressed anyway enough jibber-jabber and let's get this is what you've been waiting for right you guys want to see me do a big freaking dab blaster blast oh hey mr. Fogg how you doin good serve yeah this new phone setup is good and I really like this broadcasting software now that I figured out what the problem was it wasn't even my phone I mean it was probably partly my phone but the big problem the big problem I discovered it took me it took me three phones to figure this out it wasn't the phones again it was a little bit it was youtube's self-made broadcasting software limits you to a 720p live broadcast with like a fricken like 14 frames a second bullcrap and a low bitrate it was terrible terrible it looked like a freaking gameboy advanced screen or something anyway I got this puppy heated feeling good we got the resin here we go actually it was maybe a little bit I it was okay but I think I let it cool down too much I mean I'm not dying so that's actually pretty good news actually I'm gonna show you guys a little a little treat actually here I'm gonna show you guys what's going on with I got unplugged my phone here okay guys

for this kind of stuff on on the YouTube man there is a there is a need okay you guys get my ugly mug here for a second again here we go now this is this is the other one this is like the Mars hydro that new Mars hydro SP 250 isn't the SP 250 yeah I think so and this is the this is that OG Kush that I managed to bring back to life man III I did a little bit of a nutrient lock out halfway through this things like and I managed to actually it looks like I pulled it back from the brink of the brink of yuck and then all of this is my vegetable garden I took this out for that video that's what I was gonna say is I took this thing out of the video and they still demonetised me for my vegetables that's all I was talking about was the light and the vegetables and boom oh yeah check this out look at this the spinach is up - spinach is supposed to be a longer so we got the lettuce is up spinach is up and nothing from the chives or the onions yet there's still being slow so slow so so my nose

Eastern Province uh I can't find anything man it's [ __ ] hard it's been mm-hmm it's been it's been tough yeah Canadian crack baby oh I mean I got a [ __ ] coffee maker here and I still go for this [ __ ] once in a while I don't want to make it sometimes and there's they put something in there man it's so good it's like McDonald's french fries like all the other French fries in the world are good in their own rights but none of them have that [ __ ] addiction that McDonald's fries had I'm talking about that's crazy so if you guys are not already part of the I'm gonna call the session they can

until it's no longer red it's no longer red you can kind of hit it now soon as you get cool air going through this [ __ ] it's [ __ ] done anyway here we go oh yeah oh I love this thing man for real I

__ ] Billie's man those electric electric a honey badger or like honey Birds the little nectar collectors they've got these little electric ones I'm looking for my I got a vape pen somewhere maybe the yeah girlfriend might have it somewhere but the honey badger specifically is an electric it's a it's an email nectar collector it's a little tiny bastard - I'm like I'm interested and it looks neat it looks neat hey hey mmm-hmm okay maybe I will hit up a little bong action for some entertainment purposes due to the fact that like smoke go through the bong is more entertaining than then I don't I don't think I love this thing but I don't think it's very entertaining to watch people dab on it I don't know can i zoom I don't let me see if I can zoom here oh my goodness I can zoom in oh my god this new app is the [ __ ] love it look at this action oh yeah all right here we go you guys ready for this I'm gonna choose Pikachu and everything man I'm gonna pull Pikachu out for the bad one well I'm gonna use his ear oh my goodness okay let me show you a part of the design of the magic of the Pikachu curb cap okay see his ears see how the one ear is kind of crooked he's always kind of like that he's a crooked kind of guy but the one ear watch this [ __ ] Paul this stuff is such a weird consistency oh it's so nice but there we go look see come on focus there it's gonna focus on me again it likes me too much but you see what's going on right you dip down in with the ear and then you carb cap the Punk so let's do that how's all your days going for your freaking anyway that's new to the list dream what's going on with just smoking on I hope you're over nineteen you're not take a [ __ ] hike here a [ __ ] kid watching me shame on you your parents somebody should tell your [ __ ] parents what you guys with the crap you're watching on YouTube is and honestly hahaha this [ __ ] should be age restricted anyway so take that uncovering my ass I'm age restricting my live streams from now it's gonna slow down probably the amount of publicity I get so that's again right there why I need you guys to go down there and like the video because it's like the only way I'm gonna get any friggin traction on YouTube anymore because I'm doing things to hide myself a little bit but that's just the way she goes if I want to stay on this platform anyway let see was the Pikachu alright well pardon me I'm so disgusted a lot still it's okay there's enough of it it's good oh I wasted a little bit at the front there I usually like to have a bit of suction on it it was definitely too hot holy [ __ ] that was too hot they'd even put the camera at a focus holy crap Timmy save me save me Jimmy been watching your replay and loving it absolutely superb job on the DI hey thank you I I do what I can honestly I I just the whole reason I started doing this was literally just a document what I'm doing with my license to grow and all this kind of [ __ ] I'm like why not might as well just [ __ ] document it for my own sake and who knows if something happens at least I got it all on film or whatever right and next thing I know people [ __ ] love this [ __ ] I guess I'm a bit of an entertainer and I didn't [ __ ] know it really I mean maybe I knew it a little bit but I never really tried to do this [ __ ] before I had a gaming channel for a little bit that's the only reason I kind of understand YouTube but gaming channels are not sustainable unless you're like [ __ ] you got some super nish and you just got the [ __ ] love for it and you want to edit it to the [ __ ] cows come home gaming channels do what you love get in front of camera and do what you [ __ ] love if you want to be a YouTube youtuber but a little over that you got to film what you're good at and what you're [ __ ] passionate about and for me [ __ ] Weed Man I love we love it I've been smoking weed since I was like [ __ ] 12 years old I've smoked a joint with Tommy Chong I've [ __ ] grown weed as a little kid I started growing weed officially-licensed about a year and a half ago and off to the races now that's [ __ ] legal this [ __ ] is [ __ ] YouTube needs [ __ ] weirdos like me I think push the boundaries a little bit I'm not doing anything illegal I'm not doing anything wrong I'm a hundred percent within my [ __ ] legal rights medically and [ __ ] recreationally so YouTube's coming around though man they're not they're not D monetizing me as a platform they're limiting my monetization it's really limited don't get me wrong I make [ __ ] all on advertisement I mean 18 bucks a month mmm oh yeah it's trying to it's trying to trying to censor your swear words good sir I caught you it's okay a little swear words this is an adult channel a little swear words never hurt nobody as long as you're not being belligerent but it's it's coming around YouTube is starting to freaking see the light a little bit I have seen like cannabis based advertisements on YouTube I've seen advertisements for CBD oils I've seen advertisements for grow lights I've seen advertisements for stuff like that I was like what it's like this is like the next like mega come on if you see if you watch fricking weed channels you've seen that [ __ ] expertise it's uh it's neat it's like a neat indeed man spectrum Canada is looking for craft growers yeah everybody wants craft growers right now the reason everybody wants craft growers is because the couple of [ __ ] GPS or DPS or [ __ ] PPS or whatever the [ __ ] they're called the designated grower [ __ ] they're either overpriced or [ __ ] got a bad track record man III can't name one yeah LP there we go I can't name one of those [ __ ] that I know of in Canada that I trust I'm connected to one have I used it in one [ __ ] day oh no not one [ __ ] day have I used my licensed producer I've been my own producer since the day I got my license I was like [ __ ] this I am flipping the switch I'm retired I got nothing better to [ __ ] do I was focusing on the gaming channel and I'm like [ __ ] this I'm switching gears I'm going over here I did this just as a test and since it's taking off so well and people are responding so well I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be focusing my energy here from that one I am passionate about cannabis like I said I've been smoking this [ __ ] since I was like [ __ ] 12 years old I know a lot of neat tricks I've learned a lot of things in the years I know a lot of cool people out on the coast here I really don't want to move away from the coast because I got a lot of connections out here and I could do some cool interview shows I don't know I don't know this matter fine in a place so if any of you of my viewers know of any rental properties that wouldn't let a licensed fellow such as myself that has a good track record and good references on the west coast I want to stay out here somewhere anyway my coffee is almost done I'm gonna take one more [ __ ] dab polish off my coffee and I'm gonna go when I get back to house hunting for real I'm gonna keep looking where is it I'm gonna go with the dab blaster though because it is well damn it Pikachu get out of the way that is where's the big blob how does it how does a blob this big disappear like [ __ ] how did I lose that damn thing I yeah do I got an email to reach out to yes I do it's in my description that's where it is there's a there's a thing where it says contact for business options in the about on my channel I did actually add one so there's one there also you can always hit me up on Instagram Instagram you can chat with me again in real time Instagram quite regularly yeah that's always a great way to get a hold of me if you want to just chat chat well yes my autos are six we told and the chat goes come on um now six weeks old from seed or six weeks into flower you must mean six weeks from seed because six weeks from flower to be normal so if it's an auto flower yeah autumn flowers are [ __ ] weird those are mutant [ __ ] that are just you're gonna grow like a son of a [ __ ] no matter what you do let you [ __ ] them up and they don't want to grow yeah autumn flowers are just weird man you do you do one little thing wrong damn I'm just gonna go into flower or hermaphrodite on yeah otto's are fun and fast if you do them right but they're finicky and they do weird [ __ ] man even when you do them right they do weird [ __ ] oh they're fun no don't get me wrong I'm not dissing on the lotto flowers I started on Otto flowers I'm gonna [ __ ] probably keep running on the flowers as fast as all hell the turnaround is [ __ ] phenomenal I'm just gonna make sure you get good good good genetics good solid old lineage old seeds look for a company look for a seed company it's been around for a long time and by they're all this seed stock whatever they've had since day one if they've been growing white widow from day one that's the seeds that's the Otto flowers you want cuz that's gonna be their strongest [ __ ] genetic that's some advice right there at least for like basic Otto flower strong just plug and play genetics no email in the about it's just my Instagram what hold on let me take a look there my friend I'm sure I added one I really am sure oh if not I can maybe do it in real time right now yeah man says four business inquiries okay hold on a second here let me yeah let me just

know we came here because the factory in california is built out we can't produce and fulfill the worldwide demand for the product you know they need you know they need the available inventory i know the dealers definitely do and that's what the customers are telling them that's what our customers are saying so you know they need inventory and i can't tell you how hard we're working to give them that inventory you know to have a customer purchase a unit be able to ship it out that day you know that's what we're doing with minis finally you know so you know the next steps og's on that which is coming here real quick you know so you know giving the customer the available inventory of the machines and accessories when they need and want it is is you know what we're doing so we're ramping our production up day and night we're making all the improvements uh all the capital investments to do that for our customers so you know and i know for our customers when they think of nugsmaster like i was saying earlier they think of the machine that that is able to take cannabis to the level that they need and require you know to give them the help that they want or the fix they want or whatever the hell it is that they want gives it to them you know we know that but for us in a company uh you gotta understand it's quite the opposite we're uh we're working day and night to achieve uh uh the impossible if you will so we're in a company that has a worldwide demand for our product which everybody thinks is a great problem to have but a lot of responsibility so to meet that customer demand and need everything everybody wants and they constantly try to increase the quality of the product constantly re-engineering and the time and effort and money spit in the engineering of the product and making everything better so it doesn't break and and there's a reason we put a lifetime warranty on the product you know there's a reason that it's made right here in america in the usa so we're trying to bring the very best value to our customer every day so that we can give the world the pleasure of making solventless rosin", "xkqXJdUFe6Y": "hey folks rod here from caribou organics so it's

a bunch of different sizes so we got some bags that are 14 grams in size bags are seven grams in size and there should be some three and a half gram sized bags see if we got anything else all right looks like we got the handle for the pump and then it looks like we got a whole bunch of stickers we'll uh give those to the kids to take to school i'm sure that would go over really well eh no we're not giving the stickers to the kids over well that seems to be about all that's in there now so i bet you you would really really like to see us do like a couple of test squeezes now right and i you

don't believe this is gonna be all smoke make cartridges out of some of this rosin I dab it occasionally because even if you put that [ __ ] in the fridge or freezer it'll just like bounce back to

buddy yeah buddy oh yeah you guys take care have a great day shop is up all the time aloha", "ft3NyTkYWoo": "Cavan dank here and we're in the smash lab today wanted to show you this beautiful extraction from two grams of Keef this is the result and the best way to explain this is hash shatter beautiful stuff smells good smokes good and it was made on the Nook smash 4 touch at 975 pounds psi pressure 195 degrees for 2 minutes that is some beautiful stuff and once again captain dink in the Spanish lab till next time", "srW13xJetJE": "hey Aloha I'm getting ready to make some rosin from my bubble hash using some of these materials and mostly my Dooley tech 3000 press machine three hundred dollars or so was on Amazon thousand pounds of pressure great a little clean well worth it I'm gonna load three of the bubble hash pieces into the micron bag I want to leave maybe a half inch or so cushion around the sides of it then she I'll push it together so that it stays together in a nice group and it's level so that all presses approximately even leave it through the heat press but then I want to cut off part of the bag so that when I fold it over I have about all three quarters of an inch or so on the other side as well to make it even but secure enough so that the bag doesn't blow out I've cut the bag and now I'm gonna fold it over and I'm gonna use for glues some of the dads the older dads on the tip of a toothpick as the glue as I fold the bag over to keep it together and it just reuses it as it heats up it melts with everything else I'd like to do a double fold I'll do a little short fold-over first then I'll apply the dabs as the glue and fold it over again to make sure I have a good seal on this end so again nothing blows out the side all right we got that sealed up nice now I'll get my parchment paper and get ready to place this in between the heat pads once they're warmed up and ready to go all right starting it up it's pre-programmed already I'm gonna go like about 185 183 is my temperature and about 95 seconds or so for my time again this is a thousand pounds press but when I first press it I'll be going very slowly to make sure none of the material gets pressed out too hard too fast before it's actually melted just wanted to know gotta fold this parchment paper in half make sure the shiny side is on the inside and then I'll place my rosin bag inside and ready to place in between the heat press once it's completely warmed up alright and we are ready to close then fold I once it starts at the time again this I have not engaged it fully I'm just partially pressing down pressing a little bit harder I like to push it down and slowly as you see the timer counting down right now two minutes or so so I start a little bit more maybe like two ten and then finally once it's ready hit lock as I push it all the way down and then we'll just wait for the timer to ring and collect our goodies I like to use the ice pack or cold pack under the screen that they provided or the silicone mat that they provide and the tools that they provide and it helps cool the rosin down as it comes out of the press at such a high temperature easier to scrape it off the parchment paper alright that piercing sound tells it let's be ready gonna lift up and see the rosin he didn't drained out of the bag gonna carefully remove it remember these plates are extremely hot so be careful as I take it out and place it onto the cold mat spit that off then one is ready I'll slowly carefully peel this bag off I'll put it in another parchment paper and hook it back up and let it run a second time while I scraped the first one well you ready to scrape I'll put the next one through again same one out of time see if when you just get a little bit more out of it I'll use the silicone container so other scape the rosin out put stores nicely inside there then comes out nicely this point it's beautiful beside that scrape it up all right first time through nice little amount now what will happen is as I seal this and let it sit for another 1224 hours that will melt down and become a really nice orderly looking mixture like this this is from the last batch this is now of the same bag second time through the press and we got a nice amount of additional rosin to be able to harvest put it into our container from those three pieces of bubble hash from our trim and there's a harvest of rosin starting to slowly melt a little bit as it gets to room temperature just drops all the way down to the bottom in a container but there'd be a lot of nice Dappy at side of that", "Y9-Ms4_BKLQ": "[Music] what up youtubers it's your boy hashem pope and you're watching hash TV we're back we're live [Music] and we're chewin edibles what up zigzag oh how you doing

crossbred with strains they're often strains with popcorn buds so you're gonna drill these like 7-foot tall plants with these two-foot branches and you're gonna get just these popcorn buds I've seen it I've seen I've seen people's buds at for weeks and they're like this a four week bud on a Hindu Kush should be like this the size of a ping-pong ball closing in on five weeks you know maybe not not obviously not quite that big a hairs but yeah I know I can't wait we're definitely gonna talk genetics more because you got to make sure you're breeding [Music] quality males into beautiful females a male that is sparsely I can show I'll show you old video I've got of males I've got old blueberry males and they're sort of look like this and they they're in clusters but what you're looking for is large clusters of these yellow bananas you want them to have good clustering and what that's gonna give your female is you're gonna incorporate tighter tighter noting if you have these pot if you have these clusters of balls on your feet on your males now I've taken I have seen males with really spindly small spread out males wicked potency wicked wicked crystal contents passed on tiny freaking

halides and then hang on it's still here I just got to move this stool though I was sitting on yeah check this out I got 600 watt LEDs", "DQbZVzlx4gQ": "hey guys it's rebecca rips with another youtube video and as you can see in the title i'm smoking weed i always smoke weed but i'm gonna pack up my bowl i'm gonna use that crystally keith that we save in the bottom of our grinder for one day and that's today so basically i'm going to pack up my bowl i got this k herring bowl it's really nice it hits good i have a hybrid right here of banana puddingtain banana punitine and so yeah so i'm gonna put some bud in my bowl and then like i said before i'm going to use the keef at the bottom of my grinder if you have a grinder with the screen you'll notice that keep underneath and i save it for my bowls i save it when i feel like i want to get more of like a high so i untwist this and look at that let me get like a better yeah there we go i have a pill bottle filled with oh [ __ ] man i didn't realize how high this was filled with um with keith i just i love saving my key so i'm gonna i'm gonna come the grinder usually has this guy in there kind of reminds you of like a pick a lot of people will use like a guitar pick in their grinder if they end up losing this guy and it's just supposed to help you know constantly make sure the key doesn't stick together so i'm going to put you damn yeah look at that look at that pile of keef can you see that looks so good i'm like it looks so good okay so i'm gonna try actually i need to dump some of it because i need to sprinkle it evenly otherwise it'll just burn in that one part what's up guys i'm excited to to smoke i'm always excited to smoke with you guys all right so there we go so i have the keef all on the top and i have to um when i spark it i i have to do it very very lightly because the keith will start catching and it will keep going and going i put a lot of keef in here so we're going to have a good high all right let's do this yup that's the key right there some people find it difficult to smoke their teeth because it does you know make you cough if you do choke a little bit um but you get higher so why not holy [ __ ] oh i sound like a horse i'm like i knew this wasn't going to be easy i put a lot of keith in there i really did i put a lot of keith in there and you see how like you'll you'll see you see the flame on there because the keef catches so quickly i always get nervous that i'm gonna light like my nose hairs on fire or something i'm like whoa whoa if you see me in the past on a moon rocks video because that's what happened when you try to do moon rocks it catches it's kind of scary you know what i mean like a flame that big i'm like holy [ __ ] and the moon rocks if you haven't seen that it's just like little nuggets they're dipped in on the wax and they're dipped in the keefe um i just i don't really like them too much like they're known to not [ __ ] you up in a way like get you high because a lot of times like you're just you're coughing your ass off and you don't really feel like you get that much of a high because people are comparing it to like the dabs they do and of course that's just you know pure wax um so i kind of actually like that better you know like doing some dabs instead of like a moon rock i gotta take baby hits with the keith man this [ __ ] like oh it does it burns your throat i like doing it out of the bong [Music] oh i'm red actually i went on the tanning salon and the only thing i went to the tank slime i didn't go to the tannic salon i went to the gym and they had a tanning like a tanning booth and i was like sure i'll do it and my freaking eyelids oh my gosh this is this is an eyeshadow my eyelids are literally burnt they're red and then my neck like legit i am a redneck because i have a redneck it looks worse like in the light like this lighting is not that great but you can kind of see that i am red i was like how is the only thing that gets red is my eyelids and my neck oh it's been a while since um i put some keep on top of my bowl i like it because it does it gets you it gets you high gives you a nice high um you get high i'm like you can't some people say it's pointless like i'm the type of person that's like don't knock it if you don't try it like the gas mask i know i've mentioned this a lot like i'm still know if i want to get it or not guys like if i have like a couple people like say like hey i want to see you use the gas mask then like maybe i'll try it you know it's got to be more than one person though it's just oh my gosh i just i don't know i don't i don't know if i want to be trapped in i don't know yeah i like my bowls though i like my glass i can look so cute blowing it out like and then it hits me and i'm like my chest this is a lot harder than i thought to smoke i'm like wondering i'm like i feel really high i was like this may be an indica not a hybrid because i'm kind of a little bit tired not a little bit tired but i could take a nap i won't take a nap though i just have shitty naps not shitty naps but like when i wake up i feel like [ __ ] like my body's thinking to itself like you should have slept longer than that but it's a nap like i try and trick my body but my body just doesn't like it it's like no go back to sleep and i'm like no so it's like fine you're gonna feel like [ __ ] for the rest of the day and i'm like damn you know should never took the nap a lot of people who do take naps i hear they have um you know trouble sleeping at night and i already have trouble sleeping at night so i don't want to throw that in the mix i used to take a nap and i know when someone gets used to taking a nap every day [ __ ] you feel like you need that nap like you need it like you can't even get through the day unless you have that nap and i hate that because you you try to revolve your plans and [ __ ] around your nap like when you eat around your nap you're like nah sorry like i can't come over right is oh so anyway duchess duchess hi what are you doing that's duchess i don't even really talk about her too much i mean you see her in the videos right say you see me um she's about a puggle i almost called you a buggle a puggle so she's a a pug and a beagle um i had another one of these dogs before and i ended up giving it to my mom and my mom still has it um well i got pregnant with my daughter and got a dog at the same time and i was like oh hell no my mom is like i'll take the dog and she did and she took it and now it's like you know the dog's nine years old and she loves the dog but then you know my kids grew up and i was like you know i want a dog and i was like i'll get the same one i like smaller dogs you know i love big dogs don't get me wrong pit bulls like rottweiler i love but like me trying to walk it no and um i just i don't need a dog walking me i'm tiny i got back issues that [ __ ] gonna hurt me so we got her and we've had her for like three years um i mean she's good and the only thing is what is it she's not fixed and i don't know if that's why she's like really hyper you know she'll always be trying to help my kid who um is autistic you know she can't speak or say anything and i don't know she's humping her and i'll see her like i just get down but adriana she she um after being four years old like she's six now but after being four she learned to walk she learned how to be more mobile so i'm pretty sure now that she'll try and attack duchess like if she does that you know what i mean because at certain times she'll try and punch the dog and kick the dog i'm letting duchess know i'm like see she does remember that you hump her okay dutches so don't do that to adriana right she just hid out she just like laid down by herself she's probably like you know what i'ma just chill here and stay away from the smoke she hates the smoke a lot of dogs do because of not why they would hate it they don't know they'd hate wee but the smoke like it's gonna bother their nose like it bothers my nose it bothers my throat but why my cat likes it i don't know i guess it's the way their noses are holy [ __ ] man this [ __ ] [ __ ] my lung stuff it sounds like i got [ __ ] broken what's going on you heard me before i started i wasn't coughing that's why like sometimes like i tell people i'm like yo like i just like i smoked okay i don't think i got you know covered or anything like it's hard like i don't know like smoking weed makes me cough a lot and that's all i smoke you know i don't smoke cigarettes or anything in between but i feel like i got baby lungs so i don't know if that's why it happens i got baby lungs got baby everything baby boobs baby lungs my ears are tiny i mean my ears aren't that tiny they kind of look big in this i swear they're not that big my ears are actually really tiny inside here it's hard for me to wear like you know some headphones because they won't stay in my ear it's like too tiny like i have the the airpods pro pros and those stay stay in my ear and my left ear but my right ear it falls out like right away this one eventually falls out like i got to keep pushing it in but i'm like what is wrong with my ears that nothing will go in them not that i want things in my ears except headphones but so what's up with you guys like i hope everyone's like hasn't killed each other like meaning like within your household just because you know you're just stuck with each other like a lot more i mean don't get me wrong like we're all getting out a little bit more but we're still together i'm like we're still together everyone's like imperfections not imperfections and i wouldn't say like flaws i mean you know like everyone just has you know their [ __ ] their ways and you know that starts coming out a little bit more huh people start vocalizing a little bit more how they feel i mean i have i've been like [ __ ] you better pick them close up put them in the [ __ ] laundry basket i'm not talking my kids i'm talking to my boyfriend i'm like what come on man like dude like clean up he's a hard worker my boyfriend's a hard worker but i'm just like i feel like you would be the messiest most disgusting person if i didn't live with you like granted like you'll see some [ __ ] like okay like look at my window my mirror i keep bringing that up because i saw that but it's really not dirty like it's just i didn't i didn't use the right [ __ ] to like clean it so there's there's streaks but at the time like i didn't care i was just like i'm dusting i'm dusting i need to i need to dust i like to dust a lot because i feel like dust makes me sick so anyway i feel like i'm a pretty clean person i got to keep things clean i can't have anything on the ground because my kid will eat it like it's just that's how i am but i look at him and i'm like yo when you take your socks off he's literally like boop boop like down where he's like sitting on the couch and [ __ ] and i'm just like yeah and that's where i'll find them they're all like and they're all like they're inside out you know what i mean i'm not sticking my hands in there i eventually like kind of stopped watching his cl now i'll still wash his clothes here and there but like sometimes he will because i'm just i'm just kind of over it's just like me if you can't even place your like [ __ ] if you can't even place your [ __ ] like i don't even want to clean but no i'm i'm cool like as far as like i clean a lot of [ __ ] i do [ __ ] around the house for people like i feel like i feel like i'm a good girlfriend i'm just you know like i got a ring on my finger like but i just like i don't know like i don't i don't think i ever want to get married i just i've said that before like i just i don't know like that seems like a lot of anxiety to me like a lot of money people like having to wear certain clothes i gotta find a dress like this is all [ __ ] that i'm like i get it like a big party but it sounds not even fun to me i just feel like i would be you know i'd be worked up like not only that day but every other day before then like that's why you know i see people they get stressed to me i handle my stress a lot differently like it just i mentally try not to let it get to me and therefore it physically gets to my body and you know i'll feel like you know all this suffocating feeling in my chest like i don't know so it's just i i can't see myself like any time i think about a wedding also i think about the stuff i could buy with that money i'm like oh my god seven thousand dollars towards i don't know something i don't even know how much it costs i don't even know i don't even want to know how much [ __ ] calls because if i start finding out i'm probably not gonna plan my wedding but seven grand i was going to say like that's my boob job like that sounds like so like you know conceited or just like full of myself but really the wedding's for me anyway right so wouldn't you rather like see me happy all the time with my nice tatas than you know having one day of being happy i'm like comparing a wedding day to like having like my boobs every day but everyone knows like i'm small so why not like i'm a tiny guy i'm not gonna be the i'm not gonna be real big and busty and huge that's not what i want but this bra is really helping me out right now so i'm just saying i just want something just a little something there that's like hey i am here i'm not hiding i'm not hiding that's how i feel my boobs are hiding oh what the [ __ ] am i talking about i'm high talking about dumb [ __ ] got my nails done girls if you want to see them if you're still on here watching i'm kind of mad because i was like what do you use for the marble and she's like oh we use like a black and it turns out grylls like this just did not turn out gray it still looks black so therefore it doesn't match like that good the glitter was supposed to be a little bit different my nails are usually longer too but i don't know this will do i'm like i'm feeling i got ugly ass hands okay so that's why i get my fingernails done my fingernails always look fat cause i got like wide nail beds but i don't know i like my nails i'm feeling them i'm like i'm feeling them a little bit they're cute past couple videos i haven't had my nails on they just look like i don't even want to watch the videos to see what my nails look like because if my [ __ ] in high definition and i'm watching the video i see my like cuticles and how nasty i'll be like oh at least you guys see like i usually have nails on all right that was just like a couple off days why do i keep trying to use that letter it's dead yeah it's like almost dad i almost want to just like throw them out everyone's like you can't throw layers and i'm like what the [ __ ] are you supposed to do with them then like my batteries you can't throw out batteries i'm like what i get it but it's like you mean tell me all these people dispose of these things like properly i just i can't see it i'm like i can't see it like you put a plastic bag in the recyclables don't lie like you're really not supposed to do that and around here they were getting pissed they weren't taking their trash and they were putting a sign up like putting a sign on your trash like you new plastic bags and recyclables really what the [ __ ] i got a headache and weed doesn't help me it doesn't like it will kind of like come back a little bit but it doesn't ever go away some people say like weed helps them like i don't know it doesn't for me i look ugly as [ __ ] today i mean i look ugly every day but i mean like today i'm like i'm feeling real ugly but i didn't like i didn't really want to put on too much makeup and all this [ __ ] because i don't know i had a day off you know with one of my kids i'm like quite a day off i had a day off one went to school so i was like hey let's go out and um you know do [ __ ] i got i got some halloween decorations but everywhere is like out of halloween decorations i was like yo like serious i feel like i'm i feel like i'm early it's not like i'm late excuse me curtain was that the noise the whole time i was wondering what that noise was my curtain my curtain it's still wanting to move there you go there you go i don't even know if they're gonna have halloween but i'm just like you know what i feel like being festive and a lot of people are like you know what i'm probably feeling festive too so that's why i'm doing i'm just like you know what let's do it early like i don't care what better thing to have to do than decorate i feel like it's better to decorate early you know why because you're over it like the next day you're so over it that it could be that night of the event and you're taking [ __ ] down you know it could be like christmas it could be like you know halloween if you see people put [ __ ] up early a lot of times they're one of the people who are like the first people who put you know put [ __ ] down they're like yo like i'm over it i'm over it you're right i did put it up too early i've had it up for like two months versus you know like some people they're like a couple days before christmas you know decorating and [ __ ] putting their tree up you know some people are like december first or like they'll do it for thanksgiving because you know people come over thanksgiving and they want their [ __ ] to look nice and festive and thanksgiving they i don't know some people like it's supposed to be like you know you can use some of your halloween [ __ ] you know that fall stuff but people will like sometimes like jump right to like christmas like as far as like like decorations you know for thanksgiving i'm like yeah what i'm not gonna lie it does creep on you like pretty fast like right after thanksgiving like you're all sudden you're like holy [ __ ] man i only have like a week or two week before christmas you know what i mean like oh man holidays i feel like holidays are gonna be [ __ ] nuts this year and this is this is what i was always telling everyone i was like [ __ ] is gonna sell out quick for everything and it's gonna do it early you know for each holiday i said it for summer i was like watch you're not gonna be able to get any summer ship it happened you couldn't find like little pools people were looking for just little pools because they just wanted to cool down i have a pool you know i'm gonna get inflatable one i'd never do it but i'm home why not you know and people have money if not more money you know there are people who have less money you know what you mean like as far as going through this this [ __ ] so you know people are shopping so a lot of people that are [ __ ] shopping and you wouldn't imagine because you know these people say they're scared to go out to the [ __ ] grocery store and you know what like not that i'm saying anything because i'm i'm going to the christmas tree shop but i'm just saying like hey like you freaking talk all the [ __ ] but you're the one buying all decorations for your house but that wouldn't be a necessity i don't know it's just it's crazy i'm not judging but i am judging so i'm just gonna stop it's this man and it's the keith keith i love the cave the price tag is still going on it looks nasty i gotta clean my [ __ ] like do you see this tray is dirty as [ __ ] i got rid of my other tray i gave it to my phone i'm like here i don't use it you can use it and now i'm like well this is why because it's just annoying to kind of clean your [ __ ] i do like the trees um you can use 420 to cleaner to clean them off that like that does the trick like i went a while without cleaning my [ __ ] bowls right and this [ __ ] came out crystal clear my other pieces came out crystal clear with um you know the 420 solution and i just i don't know i love that like i don't know what you guys use um drop in the comments below i'm always open to like looking you know new [ __ ] out to clean your glass but oh my god that plane is like really low um but like i don't know it's just crazy they cleaned it in like 30 seconds i was like yeah [Music] 420 cleaner is not good as far as like when your ove is down to last it's not going to work it's like missing the saw it's missing some of the other ingredients it's not as fresh as like when you open a new bottle i notice when you open a new bottle you're like yo is [ __ ] clean versus like you know the end of the solution you're like this shit's not cleaning and then i have the um the raw pipe cleaners i'm not gonna lie like i'm gonna have my boyfriend on here one time and be like i just want to say thank you for helping me clean my glass because he does like i'll clean my glass and sometimes like if i'm getting annoyed and i can't get something out i'll be like yeah like can you clean my glass or like this last couple times like i did i did ask him to clean my class he lives in my class a lot he used to like roll my bloods for me you know occasionally like no i rolled my own blood sometimes even for us but sometimes like i didn't feel like it and he would do it you know even though he wasn't smoking but he doesn't nope he doesn't smoke and he doesn't want my pumps anymore we don't want to just jeopardize anything with his job so he doesn't do anything he doesn't do anything man i give it to him not like it's hard not to do anything but like you know for him i felt like he was someone that could benefit smoking off a weed he probably could get his card but he'd rather have his gun permit whatever i like having my card i'm like i like having my garden are we right now i'm just not worried about it i think this is it guys let me see if there's just like another hit in here it's a good bowl [ __ ] i kind of talked in the [ __ ] oh my god i kind of blew out the ash a little bit whatever i mean i don't you know i'm talking doing youtube while trying to smoke laughing i'm blowing this [ __ ] out yeah so i think i should try it like if you have it you know and you don't have a grinder that has this like get one of them all right you got this compartment the shredder compartment and then the weed goes into here i got more weed in here and then there's a screen and there's a lot of compartments but i mean you get used to it it's just it comes natural and then you have your compartment like i said for the for the key right here and it should come with like a little piece like i said that um kind of helps break up the keep so it doesn't stick into a pile but like this gets really like sticky and [ __ ] like that like looks so my grinder looks a mess right now like you need to you do need to empty it and i didn't so now my shit's stuck no i'll clean it out and everything like i said um 420 cleaner is good to just use on you know your trays because you get ash on there and just like residue and you know that [ __ ] stinks it stinks and it's sticky she's sticky so that it really helps so anyway guys that's it for the end of my video i hope you enjoyed and i really hope that you get to enjoy the rest of your day

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "CHjNQ0jQyk4": "[Music] [Music] always nice to get some trimming completed as US growers well known this is Dave with formal Jetix and format extractions which is the channel currently uploading on at the moment what we have here is loud seeds 7/8 hour of course file the frosty Asti trim so once we've trimmed we know what pretty soon it's time for hatch making now we got to put this trim in the freezer now I used to put my trim in bags like this sometimes I sold you for temporary storage but what we're gonna do I like a nice hard plastic container through freezing cannabis in makes a big difference freezes stuff harder for some reason and then it will get frozen in this bag although this is some nice thick leaf so it actually freezes pretty good even in the bag but let's go ahead and pop the top here alright dump this bag in the tote here I buy these totes because they're very the same volume as the two and a half gallon nine and a half liter Rubbermaid totes but they're much cheaper they're cereal tote so let's uh here we go well just go ahead and put the rest of this trim in here [Music] get all that good loveliness there of trim every little trichome counts we love to extract trichomes here at full melt extractions so we got a nice little tote but it's not done yet the pilot trim right here [Music] okay and feel the kief underneath this pallet or even this is a totally wet trim you still get some key falling off on the table and such I can feel like if I scoped right now there I'd see crystals galore alright so we ate about half full which I'm actually make a decent run in probably couple few grams it's the product all that go ahead pull it back on her slide her into the freezer and we gotta find a room for her that can be tough [Music] sorry for the expert camerawork here but there we go slide it in next to so full of buds here [Music] stuff close that bass app maybe you know you want to alright freezer shut okay yeah that's beautiful nugget let's go stick this over and then little train deal here sorry my camera work sucks dude camera work and work work at the same time alright now we finished our trimming and you know probably by tomorrow or thereabouts will be dabbing some wonderful products from this but I'd like to dab something right now so what do we have here take a look we have there looks like a couple nice little balls of scissor - so if I wanted a brush straight away I'm gonna take this scissor - this 25 micron screen I just cut a piece out of a pressing screen remove it rubble bags 25 microns [Music] yeah so let me try and demonstrate this [Music] so we're just gonna drop the hash here into this then we're gonna basically kind of twist it like a little piece of candy or whatever here now I know I've seen people doing folding it into like a postage stamp type thing that works great for certain people before when I tried it that way just didn't really work out too good for me so I just do it this way but I know that I'm gonna be using more of a folding technique once I actually do get a rise in the press which I plan to do soon but for right now we've already heated up the straightening iron so let's see if we can find a place where we can get a good view of a squishing process here [Music] [Music] here we go [Music] there we go okay so we'll take this lovely parchment paper and it'll tear ourselves off a little piece there's such gonna fold that in half and I'm gonna fold it again to the center both times so I'll just take it fold the top down to the center and then flip it over again fold the top down to the center okay so now we have three little creases and we have our little piece of candy so this has our seven eight sour scissor hatch inside it doesn't seem like much but we will get some nice damage out of this I promise you now let's go ahead give it a squish as you can see this thing is well yeah beat to [ __ ] it's had a very large boy's weight on top of it many times but I have to give it credit that's not quick so first I'm gonna try and put that like pretty much it but I put my house right in the middle as ideally as possible all right so it's in the middle there so now I'm just gonna give it a press right now the it's not super hot so I can actually press it for about four or five seconds so I'm just going to press it down to get the heat going and then I'm gonna really frickin press for about eight all right then I'm gonna sort of still leave pressure on just start to pull this out of there now we can see what our first squeeze looks like so now we've just been trimming in just minutes after we're done trimming look at that that [ __ ] gorgeous dab", "_9GRtUCa_II": "[Music]", "7G0UwpLWF8g": "welcome back everybody another beautiful day here with the dr. calico structure is in the house welcome back to my channel you guys so today I wanted to do an unboxing video of this we've got our hash bags came in the mail today we order them from melon farms everyone that's where we got them from so I wanted to just do a quick review on what I think about the quality and what they're really about and see what they're gonna do for us cuz I of course you guys you know I enjoy my hash and my flour those are my two main things that I enjoy out of growing every single season that I look forward towards my my trimmings and my all the good stuff we have left over from our cannabis that we invest since I am an outdoor drawer there's much appreciation and dedication put into this process but we'll see you let's get down to business you guys and go through it all right Wow you guys the material seems really really really good I would definitely have to say that this material really really thick sturdy these ain't gonna rip easily I guarantee that so I'm saying these bags right here I have to raid them 10 out of 10 the guys even our screens down here really really thick it's not low quality material and for the price of these bags right here I would definitely definitely have to say that they're well worth it these are by mellon farms you guys that's where the what company makes this these bags and definitely I'm gonna have to say these bags right here totally worth it these are five gallon bags here and it looks like they're gonna really do the job excellent I've been meaning to get me some good bags haven't had a hash bags in years you guys but wow this this material right here you guys good quality material for sure it's gonna get the job done let's see what else comes in this packet here see okay we got instruction today's okay the original bubble bag system that's what they're calling this our four shoe eight layers of industrial grade filtration which will allow you to extract the essential oils from almost any plant Wow let's see let's go down to instructions they don't seem too complicated this is for my viewers this purposes because obviously I've been making hash for a couple of years now but let's give you the rundown line the bucket where your bubble back starting with the 25 micron bag and ending with the 220 my Chrome bag step1 you guys step to fill the bucket with enough cold water to cover the the bottom of the bubble bags about halfway full okay number three as you're dry or frozen plant trimmings alright step four add enough ice to almost fill your bucket to the top step five stir your mix for fifteen to twenty minutes adding ice if necessary to keep the water cold at a 50/50 mix of ice and water is ideal step 6 pull out your bubble bags one by one draining them into the bucket step 7 as you pull each bubble bag turn the inside out after it has finished draining to collect your herbal extract damn we're really gonna extract like this huh Hey okay step eight you guys gently press the excess moisture out of the herbal extract using your pressing screen and a dish towel and they have a low link here where you can go to their website and probably see some physical videos I am gonna be doing a physical video of this once we get along to that process right now we are in the vegetable state of these outdoor plants here and I definitely have to say there's nothing like growing your own your own cannabis and your own plants your own food for for your home and your own medicine so that that's what my channel is all about you guys me growing me showing you tips I'm gonna be taking you along my the process that I go through I'm not a professional but I do have a couple years on me that I have achieved some of my goals throughout a compliment accomplishments and failures but there's nothing like keep on growing you guys and that's what my channel is all about making organic manner materials that you can use for your plants herb recites for the mosquitos and for a whole bunch of type of different varieties that I'ma be incorporating into this channel you guys there's just my basic group procedures that I go through and I'm gonna show you guys a little bit here of what I do here at the dr. Cali Kush gardens remember top shelf fire organics organic fire that's what the links and put it in the description for you guys to see this is just a little plant here that we left out of the net and the mosquitoes did get to it besides mosquitoes I know mosquitoes don't really affect it but we have a whole bunch of other bugs coming along here and through the process trying to eat it up and it just causes bacteria so this one I left it out here as an example of one of my harbors sites that I create here and dr. Cali Kush garden to show our buddy but we're gonna show you a little bit healthier products over here okay you guys some of the pride and Joy's here of the dr. Cali Kush gardens I'm gonna be demonstrating on how you could accomplish if you're simply growing growing at home trying to create your own crops okay guys well thank you for watching I want to remind you guys to remember to Like and subscribe and we're gonna be posting here on a daily I want to say daily basis but I would say at least weekly guys gonna be demonstrating and showing you guys how you guys could grow your own food at your home garden or your own medicine that's how that's how I want to do things here and show you guys well thank you everybody for watching and stay tuned for the best remember like and subscribe and thanks for watching here with the dr. Cali Kush gardens thank you y'all have a good one", "KpsN539Hd8M": "hi guys welcome we're doing the green half grams of this stuff on the nugs masher XP here's three and a half grams that we're doing we're gonna pack it in the three and a half gram next Smasher under 60 micron bag yes and see that we're gonna pack it Bobby textile and reason we pack it bottle textile is for the surface area of the extraction so by packing it up right so it presses like a coin one that's already pressed we get a consistent surface area meaning this round area that the puck smashes it's the same every time we put it in there rectangular way we have to really know what we're doing in terms of size and whatnot because we can change via strain the difference between this and this from a more denser strain can be 30 40 % surface area difference and what that means is different consistency in your return so that's why we prepare a bottle textile like that now to do that we just invert the corners on the bag you can see that I like to use the end of a little dab tool kinda helps me put them in there invert him turn him inside out so that's what the the bag ends up looking like no we're going to do is we're going to put the material in the bag when we start to put material in the bag and we'll pack in a bottle textile we just put a little of the material and somewhat evenly and then once we get enough in about like that we'll go and just take the bag hold it upright and just apply pressure and just a little pressure just push down by doing this it forms the bottom of the bag and makes it makes it round so you'll get this this effect and then once that's done we can put the rest of the product in at that point we're just trying to dump it in I'm not trying to smash the hell out of the product at this point I'm not trying to mix the Detroits with the plant material that's what I'm I want to separate in the actual extraction here so I'm not gonna do that but rather I'm gonna try to pack the bag evenly so there's not any air voids in it sometimes difficult to do but once I get all three and a half grams in the bag any big stems like that one I'm gonna pull especially as the material gets drier you want to pull the stems out say well tear the bags and when a bag gets tour basically what happens is the surface area changes so the consistency of the pressure on your extraction changes and that's what we like to to keep it to a specific bottle tech pack so once we get three and a half grams in the bag it looks like that and it doesn't matter if you're loading a three and a half gram bag a seven grin or fourteen but all kind of loads the same now once we get the product in there when I take our scissors and cut the excess of the bag off if you all can see that I'm gonna leave about a half inch above the material that's all I'm gonna leave and once we do that we fold it up like a present well each of all four sides in so it's folded up just like a present and then that will press up right just like this so once we get our bag off fold it and ready to go take parchment and I like to use Kirkland parchment works really good even if you packaged in this pad rosin and in this for over a year and it's it package is fine holds fine doesn't soak into the paper so Kirkland parchment we get a Costco it's a seasonal item so stock up on it then we lower the plates to be right about the height of the bag what this will do is will allow us to hold the parchment and everything in on this traction makes it much easier the process now the next fee is nice because it has a gauge on it and we know exactly what we're gonna go to here's a little green indicator yellow orange and red indicator on the gauge that gives you the safe zone in terms of if you pack the bag bottle textile like we did in that surface area it gives you the safe zone to go and pressurize and push your material so at this point we just start applying pressure try to put the load right in the middle of the plates once we have the release handle tight here just slowly apply pressure and you'll want to see the bag coming together it has more of an accordion effect when it comes together looks like accordion looks like an accordion that you're playing kind of folds in it doesn't bold it bulge out against the bag which is very important and on this extraction we're gonna go right about a thousand psi a little less than a thousand right here real low pressure and like I said once again we're coming together to get to that pressure stage very slow and the reason is we want the temperature for all the material to be normalized we wanted to be the 207 208 degrees Fahrenheit by the time we reach our 900-page and that would be my dog barking in the middle of the video so once we have once we come right down to the thousand psi which is right here we have full pressure and you can see the extraction coming so it's starting to juice here starting to make nice Rossum QB it's always good to have a little partner a little partner coupie gives me him keeps me company see beautiful color coming out there take this close up it's coming out there really good-looking material this process lasts about a minute minute and a half at the most we should have so go ahead and take pressure off it's been real close to a minute Matt in half we'll see what the results are once again this was just an 8 1 8 you can see the the bag here and then the results now at this point we'll just go ahead and scrape it right off the parchment and it's really nice looking material see that's the puck and then there's the rosin so stay tuned here I'm going to stick it on my collection plate see this is a seven gram bag here and this is a three and a half grand bag so you can see the difference in the surface area seven grand I'm three and a half gram alright so she's a regular collection tool to collect a little dab tool it's smooth on one side rounded on one side he has this flat edge on the other seems to collect a real nice for me when she stick it on a collection plate get it kind of cool right after the extraction it typically comes off real easy we get a little on the tool and then rub it across and it just really sticks yourself and there it is looks like maybe a little under a gram or somewhere right around the ground we got out of this eight way it though and give it to you but you know what it is you see it close up on the product it's really nice smells amazing wish you guys could smell alright stick that there for a sec away this so yeah pretty nice extraction 1.0 2 grams 1.0 - from 3.5 and i plucked a big stem out of it it's got to be real close to 30% or so that's how we do it 1.1 grams back and thank you for watching [Music]", "1K9KyzT8rxg": "all right good morning Sunday morning gonna do seven gram extraction let's see 7 gram bag here on the next semester XP this morning stay tuned for all the details so we got the X beyond 210 degrees I think I'm gonna turn it up to 215 for the actual strain that I'm pressing here so to do that I just push the over arrow and go up the up arrow five degrees hits s so the temperature set and rising on the X P I have six point nine six grams of the Safra ste good stuff here I have a seven gram bag prepared all right so we're all ready for our hour smash master to come out we got our email ready for after so we can dab it and try it you got a parchment paper we use good parchment use Kirkland brand parchment paper we have our product right now we got our smash master out here we're gonna load the bag and proceed to do the extraction she's gonna start by making a base in the bag loading a bottle textile so you can see the corners have been inverted as I've shown you guys on thousands of other videos that's key to bottle textile BT can she she put maybe two three grams in and made a flat base to get the bottom started kind of compressed the corners that were inverted on the bag she didn't put a lot of pressure she'd want to break all the trikes up pretty easy to do this is a quick process takes a minute or two she's got the the bag all loaded now she can lift it up and kind of show us the bottom see it's gonna be a nice round extraction textbook how to load a bag seven grams and one of our seven grand bags she is gonna cut the excess off yep so now she's gonna cut the bag the excess off she still wants to leave about an inch or so to be able to fold it over but more bag the less the yield she pulled the top in after it's cut like a little present so she has a nice little barrel for her extraction seven grands frosty flower ready to go into the nug Smasher XP guys I want to show you the piece she cut off of our bag why Lux masher bags are key they're handmade in the USA my little old ladies but they're back stitched and they don't separate as you can see all the pressure I got on here normal bag bag how it's been cut it just doesn't separate and it's double back stitched and I will add they're they're made in the USA by little old ladies and one big old dude don't offend anybody he actually does the best job for so so at this point we're ready to do the extraction she's gonna figure where she's gonna go pressure wise the yellow is our seven gram bag so she's gonna go write it to what he did 1500 psi or somewhere right now that we're ready she's gonna release the plates the height of the actual bag this'll help her hold the parchment and what in when she put she slides a parchment in and now she's gonna slide her bag in gonna really sit down a little bit more so it fits we use actually vinyl magnets we have some coming in for our customers but to hold the top of the parchment you don't have to do this works good for video if you're taking video but there's a seven gram bag put in there remember you can do two 14 gram bags with this now that our bag is in there bottle textile we have our parchment in there everything's neat we're at temp 215 we know that we're gonna go up to about 1500 1600 psi on our extraction so we want to come on when you bring the plates together you want to see an accordion effect with your bag it should accordion in on the product it shouldn't press out with pressure so eliminate blowouts but it also lets you know that you've prepared the back real slow as you can see she's going you can see it closed up on the product it's still a big gap no pressure yet on the gauge all we're doing is heat transferring at this point starting to get to her first little bit of pressure on the gauge here right at a thousand twelve hundred psi you can see the product just start to see some rosin extract so now we've achieved or destination pressure if you will look what's happening of the plates extractions happening beautiful beautiful looking product and here's a key if you have real dark product it's probably like I said if you're having dark product it's probably because you're over pressurizing our presses have a tremendous amount of capability in terms of pressure and heat so just be careful with over pressurizing there the pressures maintained if you start to lose pressure as the materials displaced you wouldn't have a little remember the full extraction will last about in a minute a half to two minutes you see the entire plates are full of rosin here which is seven grams she's getting ready to pull it out it's a good and squeeze the parchment together yeah now she's gonna release the plates down slow and should pull it out real carefully so that the puck doesn't slide into the product goes right onto the collection plate as you could see and then the beautiful extraction thick and beautiful nook Smasher XP stay tuned for the yield results we're gonna collect all this up so we got the rosin out she's just gonna deep Huck it at this point she'll just grab the puck from the top and lift straight off so it doesn't slide into the rosin you can see how clean this is there's no blowouts almost dry so she went to put this on a cold plate and she's gonna start collecting you can see how thick this is seven grams once again just a quarter guys that we've extracted on the nug Smasher XP browsing collects to itself so you can see her rolling it okay guys we're gonna go ahead and give a bit of weight here so we can get an actual yield for extraction we're about one point eight six one point eight five grams you can see the papers tore off there and there it is super thick nice office seven grand now to put it in or dar Robert Rainer piece rocking glass"}
